As your heart hammered, you saw that you were bound to what appeared to be a massive red cylindrical building. What was even more shocking was the figure that towered even higher before you. You looked up to see the withdrawing arm of Gina Carano passed over you like a floating roadway. As her tan, muscular body tensed up again, you couldn\u2019t even begin to prepare yourself for what came next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even scream as Gina\u2019s fist slammed directly into your body, bending it under the force like a piece of rubber. Your bones creaked under the force of the blow, even though most of it was directed around you thanks to good fortune putting you between Gina\u2019s fingers, the pain was still tremendous. The fist drew back as quickly as it had shot out, spanning no longer than a fraction of a second, but spanning for hours as far as you were concerned. As you struggled to get your breath back, you saw as Gina began to turn\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the warm tingle of urine running down your leg as Gina\u2019s massive elbow sunk into the sandbag next to you. Her elbow quickly withdrew as she spun around the other way\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as her heel brushed lightly against you, having sunk deeply into the bag as well. Looking over, you gulped as you saw her rough sole crushing the bag underneath it, having barely missed crushing you as well by the smallest margin. As her leg returned, you felt the bag begin to spin ever so slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!....CRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreaming, you looked down at your right arm, crushed into a disfigured mess beneath Gina\u2019s other heel as she performed another roundhouse kick. The pain continued to sear as Gina twisted her heel, pulling her leg back. As the hot tears began running down your cheek, you looked up at the giant warrior, wondering what you had done to deserve a fate like this. As the pain continued to torment you, your eyes involuntarily shut in pain. As they opened, you saw the quickly approaching sole of Gina\u2019s foot launching at you\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!.... SNAP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou moaned as her sole began to press down on you, having already broken your ribs and leaving you with very little sensation in your lower extremities. The sweat that covered her slick sole was soaking into your clothing, the salt from it stinging your wounds. You were in hell underneath her warm, sweaty soles, and as her foot withdrew, and you came along with it, you wondered if this would be the end of it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gina\u2019s foot landed in the mat on top of you, you began to struggle feebly under it, out of nothing more than pure reflex.  When her foot began grinding and spinning on top of you, you began to pass out. Meanwhile, Gina above you\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shivered knowing another bomb was about to drop as you ducked down into the wet grass as deeply as possible. A gust of wind blew overhead as Morgan\u2019s foot zipped above your shrunken body by mere millimeters, kicking a soccer ball the size of a Disney World attraction at an equally massive Hope Solo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ball was reflected off of Hope\u2019s hands and came bouncing back towards you, the sense of impending doom that followed it dawned on you. No amount of running or ducking you could manage would save you as the ball grew closer and closer, encompassing your entire felid of vision\u2026 BAM! You were flung backwards as the ball landed on you, sticking you to its surface as the wet dew grabbed you like watery chains. The ball rolled to Alex Morgan\u2019s feet as she reeled back her foot to deliver one last powerful shot to the ball (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.dailyrepublic.com/files/2012/09/17B4soccer36bw-826x1024.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dailyrepublic.com/files/2012/...</a>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in shock as the ball bounced off of Hope\u2019s hands, knocking you off and to the ground right at her feet. Groaning, you tried to get up, but failed to notice Hope shifting as the ball rolled back towards Morgan. You were totally unaware that her cleat clad foot was coming down on your poor body. Feeling in slow motion as her cleat pressed down on you, it was like a bad horror film. Your face and finally your whole body was pressed into the middy ground, sinking in like it was quicksand. The moist ground was all that kept you from being killed under Hope\u2019s foot, but as she lifted her foot up once more, you almost wish that you were already gone! You were brought up along with a lump of mud as you became stuck to Hope\u2019s cleat. As the two players began walking towards the locker room, you\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you get your senses back, you discover how badly your sense of smell has been under attack in here! You start coughing and wheezing as the constricting smell of Hope\u2019s well worn cleats chokes you. You staggered as your lungs burned, pushing you to find fresh air! But a new problem was now hanging over your head\u2026 literally! You turned and ran as Hope\u2019s massive, sock-clad foot slowly drew towards the cleat!<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n  Your legs and lungs burned as you tried to outrun the goalie\u2019s massive toes. You turned around just in time to see her big toe gently touch down on the damaged fabric lining the heel of her cleat. Suddenly, your foot hit a fold in the insole\u2019s fabric and you were sent spiraling to the floor. You groaned as your mouth got a full taste of Solo\u2019s sweat, the residual from her last game still clinging onto the fabric of her insole. A dark shadow fell over you as you turned around to see Hope\u2019s sole hover over you ominously. Closing your eyes, you braced for impact as\u2026.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n\u201cThere we go!\u201d Hope said as she slid her right foot all the way into her cleat. She tied her laces tightly as she flexed her toes inside the cleat to make sure it was a good fit. Annoyed, she felt some sort of pebble under the ball of her foot. She didn\u2019t want to take the cleat off after just getting it on, so she instead stood on her tip-toes and tapped her foot trying to get the stubborn rock to fall. As she slammed her foot a third time, she felt the annoyance dislodge and fall pleasantly between her toes. \u201cAh! Much better!\u201d she cooed as she wrapped her sock-clad toes around the small lump against her sock.<br>\r\n               <br>\r\nYou struggled against the grip of Hope\u2019s toes, but the soccer-star\u2019s foot was too strong for you. As Hope began moving, you noticed she had a bad habit of grinding her toes together, or maybe she was just intrigued with you. Either way, with every step the gorgeous athlete took, her toes rubbed against you roughly, almost dislocating your arm on several steps! The smell in her cleat wasn\u2019t getting any better either as Hope stepped out of the air conditioned lockers into the heat of their first game. The thermometer read a high 82 for the day, and Hope\u2019s toes were ready to work up a sweat just for you.<br>\r\n             <br>\r\n   You needed to find a way out of this mess. Looking around, you saw a small hole in Hope\u2019s sock just above the nail of her big toe. You decided you could either try to make the hole bigger and crawl through\u2026 or you could try your luck giving Hope\u2019s toe a quick nip. It was risky either way. As Hope\u2019s toes constricted around you one last time you made your choice\u2026 you were going to\u2026..<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were frozen to your spot like someone had nailed you to the floor.  Looking up, you were transfixed as you watched Hope slowly strip her socks off. You could hear the sweat cling to the fabric as a sound similar to tape being peeled off resounded in your ears. One of these huge black socks fell onto the sandal you were sitting on. As it ran across the toe section, a wave of Hope\u2019s aroma washed over you. After a long game, the smell wasn\u2019t roses to say the least. Chocking, you tried desperately to move, but as Hope\u2019s foot hovered over you, you knew it was too late.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHope sighed as she slowly slid her feet into her sandals. She stretched as she wiggled her hot toes feverishly. Her body was sore all over, and her feet were killing her! As soon as she got home she decided she was going to take a nice long bath and try to relax for once. They had lost the game, and Hope was kicking herself (figuratively) for letting those two shots in. She knew she was better than that! Frustrated, she ground her foot into her flip flop and stormed out of the locker room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou wondered what would become of you as you found your body pressed against Hope\u2019s arch. Looking around, you were dismayed to see strings and lint form her socks that were the same size as you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHOPE! HELP ME! I\u2019M A FAN OF YOURS!\u201d you shout from Hope\u2019s arch. No answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed; you really hadn\u2019t expected anything else. But you were thankful for two things. One, you managed to get stuck on the very edge of Hope\u2019s arch, so she wasn\u2019t stepping on you. And most importantly of all, number 2, that sock had taken most of the sweat off of Hope\u2019s feet. Tired, you decided to rest while Hope drove home, no use getting flustered just yet\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou woke up to the familiar back and forth swinging of Hope\u2019s long strides. Looking around, you saw you were in her house, but you weren\u2019t sure just where yet. Before you could get your bearings though, you were already in danger as you saw Hope\u2026.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>What a game!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was always so refreshing to return to the field after a big game to see the empty stadium, the tattered grass, and scoreboard still displaying your teams winning score.  It was a habit you had made since you started playing soccer as a kid, your own personal victory lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this time had started like all the others.  It had been a night game, and the cool night air gave your skin a refreshing chill.  Still in your cleats and soccer uniform, you held your gym bag in one hand, while the other hand swung idly by your side as you walked.  You reached the opposing team's goal, and turned around to face the field, smiling a little.  After a few seconds of basking in your own glory, you hear something above you, and you look up, just as the lights of the field turn on again.  Caught off guard, the bright light blinds you and you stumble back a few steps, before tripping over your own feet.  Things begin to get dark rather quickly, and you lose consciousness before you even hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, smelling the grass and noting the silence of the empty field.  Whatever had just happened had come on like a 16-wheeler.  You sit up, and your head throbs painfully, but you manage to peel your eyes open to take a gander at the scene around you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrass.  Not just regular grass, tree and building sized blades of grass that tower over your head like you were in deep forest.  Something is very obviously not right...were you...tiny?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsolutely minuscule is more like it.  An ant may appear to be the size of a horse to you.  Your first thought of encountering one had given you another chill, this one not so refreshing.  No time to stand around, standing around is what got you here, action was required!  After a quick look around, you see that your bag was shrunken as well, and you still had your clothes and cleats on.  Inside the bag you had a full change of clothes, a bottle of water, a sports drink, some trail mix, and a few other items.  Grabbing your bag, you lift your leg to take the first step of what you expected to be a hellish, long journey out of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, apparently you arent the only one who enjoys the solitude of the empty soccer field after a game.  Though you couldn't feel the ground tremble as you might have expected to, the sound of cleats shuffling through the grass is unmistakable, even at the size.  Someone was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Hope Solo has re-entered the field, possibly to relive the misstep that caused her to slide just inches shy of knocking your game-winning goal away from the goal.  Naturally, with you standing next to the goal, it won't be long before Hope's cleat missteps again, this time with a much, much greater penalty to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately begin to run in the opposite direction of Hope's towering form, also still in her soccer uniform, and still sweating just a bit.  It doesn't take long for the goddess of a soccer player to catch you, and your world is cast in the shadow of her cleat.  As she lifts the foot to place it on the ground, and you, chunks of dirt and soil tumble haphazardly through the air.  Screaming, you dive to the ground to avoid a bus-sized chunk of mud still lodged under the brunette bombshell's shoe.  It explodes into pieces as it hits the ground, covering you in it's dusty, grimy debris, and you swore you'd just lived through a cherry bomb explosion.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though you survived a single projectile launched from your rival's immense shoe, the owner of the shoe was not quite done with you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour attempt to escape her powerful, towering cleat treads is mostly successful.  Hope's shoe-clad foot crashes into the ground scaled inches from your ankle, as you lay their cowering in her wake.  From this perspective, you can see clear up to her shorts.  Above that, though, you might as well be looking past the clouds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so tiny provides you a temporary blissful ignorance though, as you don't notice the beading of sweat on Hope's forehead.  You do notice, however, the leather of Hope's cleat shifting and adjusting toe the wiggling toes that lay inside it.  Upon closer inspection, you realize that these idle toe-wigglings are not for the sake of wiggling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, Hope has gotten frustrated with her inability to decipher what she did wrong.  She lifts her right hand to drag gently across her forehead, while her left hand brings a water bottle up to her lips.  Simultaneously, she begins tapping that right foot, the one that you are residing beside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose beads of sweat that had begun to trickle down the woman's forehead were caught up on her hand, and she quickly dismissed them by shaking her hand down towards the ground where you lay.  The first drop lands several yards away, but it doesn't take more than than drop to catch your attention.  The next drop you could practically hear coming, and you look up for a split second, just to watch the liquid bomb of salty sweaty crash directly into you, covering you in it's sinewy stickiness.  The single drop of sweat from the goddess above you dwarfed most of your body.  It was time to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as you did, yet another peril lingers...that foot had begun to tap, the first of which coming immediately after the sweat drop bomb.  The displaced air from that single tap was more than enough to blow your clothes around.  Getting any closer to Hope's powerful feet could be fatal.  But similarly, the height of the treads, easily tall enough for you to walk under and stare up at the sole of the shoe itself, could provide you some protection from any more falling threats, should Hope be sweating more profusely than you expected, or wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you have an option, run far from Hope's tapping foot to avoid being crushed, or use that same foot to take refuge under until the threat of being drowned into Hope's sweat drops has passed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Torn between death by drowning and death by crush, you make the first decision you can think of...head for the relative safety of Hope's gigantic cleat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treads themselves towered over you as if you were walking into a parking  garage, the sole of her shoe raised far above your head like the ceiling of some tall building.  As you make the last few steps of your mad dash to safety, you hear several loud, wet crashes behind you.  Peeking over your shoulder, you catch a glimpse of Hope's sweat drops as they splash onto the dirt you stand on, right where you had been seconds ago.  Each drop was easily the size of a small vehicle, had you been hit with one of those, you would have been knocked unconscious, if not worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfident in your decision to hide under Hope's cleat, you take a deep breath and consider the situation.  Hope hasn't moved much yet, and youre not sure why, but you take this moment of curious serenity for all it's worth.  Approaching one of the huge treads that are currently supporting the weight of the woman above you, you place your hand against the surface.  It's black, made of a very hard rubber.  It's also got a pretty good bit of wear and tear on it.  From this tiny perspective you can see all the scratches and dings in it's surface as if they were screaming at you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a deep rumbling, and for a moment you think that Hope is about to move.  Looking way up, the sole of her cleat between the treads seems to be moving around some, as it was being pushed up and down.  You must be directly under Hope's toes, and she must be wiggling them inside of her shoe.  This is yet another moment where your tiny size is painfully brought to the forefront of your mind, reminding you of how dire your situation really is.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she stopped wiggling her toes, and you decide to do more exploring.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along the length of her sole further, you stare up at the magnificent sky of shoe sole like a child admiring the stars.  Similarly, you even try making out your own constellations from the more intricate tread marks that reside on the sole itself, separate from the spike treads that dig into the Earth around you.   It's not long before you realize you are passing along the arch of her foot now, and can even see her other shoe, miles away, to your right.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever Hope was doing, it sure was taking a while.  You'd been walking for nearly ten minute it felt like, and were still dead center of the arch of the shoe.  But just as you are thinking this, that deep, thick rumbling from Hope's foot moving around inside her shoe returns.  However, this time, it doesn't stop.  It gets stronger, and louder, until youre sure something strange is about to happen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe treads seem to suddenly dig deeper into the ground, and before you know it, huge, thick ropes as thick as redwood trees swing down from the heavens and crash into the ground on either side of the shoe.  They are white, slightly dingy, and woven very tightly.  It doesn't take you long to realize that they are her shoe strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud thud directs your attention towards the heel of her shoe, where the other shoe has position it's toe against the surface of the shoe. Seconds later, you hear Hope's foot pulling out of the shoe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her socked-foot down not appear.  You look around in every direction, seeing no sign of the giant soccer player's foot.  As you begin to reevaluate all of this, you see a shadow forming just outside of the safety under her shoe.  Youre not sure what it is, until the displaced wind, and it's accompanying scent gives it away.  Hope's now bare foot crashing into the grass next to it's adjacent shoe.  She must have immediately taken her sock off before putting her foot down.  But...where is her sock?  Your answer comes in the form of more rustling above you, she must have shoved it inside the shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHope returns to a one legged stance as she prepares to remove the other shoe and sock, preferring to walk back to the locker room barefoot, with the grass tickling her feet.  Her warm, musky, powerful foot now rests  inches away from you, it's toes wiggling violently as they attempt to balance the impossibly huge woman.  It's hard to imagine that this was the foot you were wandering around under only minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you don't have long, Hope will probably be leaving soon...will you head for her foot, in order to make contact, or climb her shoe string and climb aboard her shoe, and ride it out of the soccer field?</span></div></div>",

With each step the massive goalie took, your dangling bridge shook violently, swaying side to side so quickly that you were surprised you had yet to be thrown off. While the swinging made your stomach do back-flips, you knew that you couldn\u2019t afford to stay still on her laces, you needed to make a move while there was still time! Looking up, you saw her fingers tucking inside the heel section of her cleats, you would need to get there at least in order to even have a chance of being discovered by her, you began climbing as your body shivered from the rush of adrenaline going through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each pull of your arms, you inched your way up the impossibly long stretch of shoe-lace hanging below Hope\u2019s cleat. As you made it to the height of the sole of her cleat, you gulped, seeing clumps of mud and grass easily the size of hills hanging so helplessly from her cleat\u2019s spikes. The severity of your size difference stared you in the face as you swung into one of these mud mounds, coating you in a layer of thick wet earth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, now I need a bath when this is all done!\u201d you griped as you began to see the tongue of her cleat in sight above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you surmounted the top of Hope\u2019s cleat, you began swaying just out of reach of the tongue of the cleat. With every step, it came just inches away from your position on her lace, but only for an instant! When it swung closer to you again, you leapt\u2026.landing right on the tongue of her cleat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d you shouted as you grabbed onto the tongue of Hope\u2019s cleat, trying not to fall into the void of her shoe that you now hovered over. Looking down into the massive pit, you felt your stomach nervously pinch. Her sock, shoved in haphazardly, was still the size of a large building to you; the cleat dwarfed it by far. Hit by a gust of wind by the inside of her cleat, your body was almost knocked clean off her cleat. Unfortunately, something worse happened\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as Hope put her cleats down, making you fall inside! As you fell onto the floor of her cleat, you looked up to see that you were in the bottom of her sock. Hope towered over you as she\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You felt the heat rise in the sock as the bag was sealed up, leaving you darkness as Hope went off to shower before heading home.

The world around you was still spinning and turning at sickening speeds when you finally were able to open up your eyes. Shutting them tight, you held your body against the ground, trying to get your bearings straight again. The smell of wood and sweat was encrusted into the ground under you; it smelt like you were pitifully sprawled out on the floor of a gymnasium.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere the fuck am I?\u201d you wonder breathlessly to yourself as you hear a sudden flurry of commotion around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, Jordyn, you\u2019re the first on the bar for warm ups today, get started. I want to see the whole routine so we know it\u2019s perfect for competition,\u201d you heard a voice shout from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChrist, doesn\u2019t anyone notice a person passed out on the floor?\u201d you wonder humorously to yourself. Pulling your body up a bit, you take a deep breath and shout, \u201cCan somebody lend me a hand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJordyn, on the bar, now!\u201d you heard the voice from before boom loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked awake by an awe-inspiring crash behind you. As you were flipped onto your back, you opened up your eyes to see a massive young woman towering above you, Jordyn by your guess. Frantically, you began trying to back away from her, the massive woman who towered over you hadn\u2019t even taken notice of your presence yet. You were too petrified to scream as she lifted her foot and began moving, bringing it down right on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like pissing yourself as you miraculously landed between the giant woman\u2019s toes. Staggering to your feet, you tried to make a break for it, but were too slow as her massive toes pinched you between them and began moving again. It felt like you were on the world\u2019s most terrifying rollercoaster as you were released from the grip and slammed into the wooden bar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were tossed into the air once more as Jordyn\u2019s heel slammed down not even an inch behind your body. Your blood turned to ice as you saw her heel drawfed your body, and that if you had been just the slightest bit closer, you would have been under it! Getting to your legs shakily, you tried to run away, but as Jordyn moved around on the bar again, you were struck in the back by her heel. You were sent tumbling through the air as you landed on the mat on the other end of the bar. Groggily you tried getting up as you heard the faint \u201cTHOOMP\u201d sound of Jordyn finishing her routine. As you got to your feet, you felt like something was wrong. Looking up, you saw that the sky was replaced by Jordyn\u2019s foot as she leapt of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHOOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnast looked down at her foot as she landed, unsure of what she had just felt. As she walked off the bar, she told her coach that she would be in the locker room for a moment. Sitting down on the bench, Jordyn looked at her foot and was surprised to see\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The last thing you remember is being at the Olympics. You were offered a chance to meet your favorite beach volleyball players and get their autographs. One of the event organizers mentioned there would be a little bit of a catch to this but you assured them that you would do anything to meet your favorite female athletes. You were told to walk through a dark hallway and somehow you wound up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn your pocket you find a piece of paper\u2026it reads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:comic sans ms, cursive\">Congratulation as a Women\u2019s Beach Volleyball fan you\u2019ve been chosen to play the game Secret Crush! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are the rules\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been shrunken down and placed in the middle of the beach volleyball field.

A team of women who were the 3 time Olympic champions and 4 time world champions competitors. Looking up at these two gigantic women is like looking up at a pair of sky scrapers. Each girl towers over you casting a huge shadow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving you any time to recover from your awe the whistle blows again and the women scramble to their positions with Misty May guarding the front left side of the net and Kerri Walsh taking the server position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerri serves the ball and suddenly (everything goes crazy ). Female feet begin stomping everywhere as the women scramble to make sure the ball doesn\u2019t land on their side of the net. You find yourself darting to the left and right just barely managing to avoid getting stepped on as the women intercept the ball passing to one another, bumping and spiking the ball over the net. It\u2019s a terrifying experience. Every second a set of toes would crash down in front of you or you would leap out of the way to just in time to avoid getting squished under one of the giant girls heels. Sometimes the sole of a foot comes down right next to you as one of the women landed from a jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf the two volley ball players Kerri Walsh\u2019s feet are the most intimidating. You read somewhere that the 6\u20193\u201d blond wore size 11 \u00bd -12 shoes. Even at your normal size you would consider them abnormally large but at your current height they make you want to wet your pants. That\u2019s not to say that Misty May Treanor\u2019s feet are unimpressive. Estimating them to be size 9 you find yourself shivering at the thought of being stepped on by them as well. It\u2019s really amazing how fast both women can move. They are able to protect any area of the field almost instantaneously. Added onto that the large size of their feet  allow them  to  cover more area in a single step then you can run. If they stepped in the right place you wouldn\u2019t be able to escape their feet no matter how fast you moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust by luck, you manage to avoid getting trampled by the two girls in the first round of volleys and after a few minutes the whistle blows again. Jennings and Treanor have managed to score the first point. The game stops momentarily as the girls reset their positions for the next serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting heavily you gaze around exhausted from dodging the first wave of feet. There are giant footprints all over the wet sand of the field where the girls have stepped. You stare at one of the enormous impressions of Kerri Walsh feet shuddering terribly relieved that that the sand wasn't you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon\u2026the game continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the next part of the game play out?</span></div></div>",

You manage to avoid getting stepped on for a couple of times before your luck runs out. You are catching your breath from  a particularly close call where you narrowly avoided Misty\u2019s heels almost squashing you as she landed from a jump when you suddenly see Kerry Walsh\u2019s foot come towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Swoosh!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof\u201d You wheeze as her toes connect with your stomach sending you flying into the air. You land on your back several paces from your original location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cUgn,\u201d You groan as you lay there for a couple of seconds. You rub your forehead as you attempt to get your bearings. The blurriness of your vision clears just in time for you to see the giant shadow looming over you.  As you glance you see the sole of a female foot coming towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat\u2019s not good, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whap!!!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything seems to go in slow motion. You manage to stand just as the sole descends upon you. It\u2019s soft but firm. The ball of the foot smacks into your face once again knocking you onto your back with a powerful amount of force. The arch of the foot positions itself over you and you feel your body press into it. It doesn't hurt as much as you expect. The  sand cushions  most of the impact so most of what you feel is the pressure of foot pressing against you. You feel the pressure build as you\u2019re force to endure the athlete\u2019s full weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose foot is it that is standing on you?</span></div></div>",

Straining, you tried to break free from the bonds on you, but they were much stronger than you imagined. It was like you had been laminated to the floor! As you started shouting for help, the ground below you began to tremble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the tremors become more violent, a towering figure casts a shadow on you. You wet yourself as you realize you are in the presence of a colossal Kara Goucher smirks down at you.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, it looks like the little cheater is finally awake,\u201d she said glaring down at you. As her brown hair swept about her head, you thought she looked like a mountain with storm clouds around the peak. \u201cYou really think I didn\u2019t notice you pay off the ref so you could get that early lead with no penalty? I was one race away from setting a new record, and now, thanks to you, three years of work are ruined!\u201d She boomed as her foot slammed down next to you.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stuttered to respond, \u201cKara!

I\u2019ll show you how a real athlete practices for races, you little shit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as her foot descended onto you! As her massive toes passed by over your head, you could smell the fresh scent of soap. She must have just come out of the shower\u2026 which could only mean she was on her way to a workout! As the ball of her foot rested on you, you could feel the weight of her body ready to snap you in half! You struggled under her sole, only bringing a small giggle from your rival\u2019s lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see, I guess we should start by\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kara smiled as she twisted and grinded her foot against your body. The feeling of your little form squirming under the ball of her foot sent shivers up her spine; this was a feeling she could get used to. For you, it was absolutely terrible underneath her foot! The pressure had your body feeling like it could pop at any moment. Kara\u2019s foot wasn\u2019t exactly minty fresh either. Sweat had begun soaking into your clothes from the moment her foot first made contact with you. Now, you were soaked to the bone by her sweat, hoping that this monstrous foot would be lifted off of you soon. As her foot began twisting back and forth, you cried out in pain, writhing beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm, keep up that delicious massage bug, I just might let you off my flip flops if you do,\u201d Kara said, unaware that the pleasant sensation coming from the sole of her foot wasn\u2019t intentional. Kara\u2019s words were lost on you as the constant grinding of her foot began pulling your body in directions it was not meant to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed, bloody murder, as one twist tore your left arm from its socket. Wriggling like a snake, you beat and pounded against the ball of Kara\u2019s foot. Determined to dig through her flesh if need be. Of course, to Kara, your desperate struggles were nothing but soothing. Her tired sole practically was in ecstasy as your wild movements alleviated her stress. As you thought Kara was about to crush your body at any moment, a miracle took place. Her foot lifted off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like someone has finally taken a liking to being in their proper place,\u201d Kara teased as she flexed her toes over your head. She gripped your head between her toes as she lifted you up off the flip flop. \u201cKiss my foot, bug, or I\u2019ll squeeze,\u201d she threatened. You took no time at all as you kissed her foot, getting the taste of it in your mouth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKara! Please let me go!\u201d You shouted up at her between kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say, buggy,\u201d Kara said as her toes released their hold on you. You screamed as you fell onto the tongue of Kara\u2019s sneaker. The smell from months of use was tangling with your nose, impairing it dangerously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet used to this, buggy, because your next job is going to be\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you hung loosely by the arm before her eyes, Kara couldn\u2019t help but let out a small giggle. \u201cYou look so helpless like that bug, it\u2019s a good look for you,\u201d she said as she poked your tiny body curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKara! Please let me go! I promise I won\u2019t tell anyone about this! You won\u2019t ever see me again!\u201d you pleaded as your arm began to grow numb in Kara\u2019s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow why would I want to let my new toy go?\u201d Kara asked as she began to lower you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d you asked, terrified as you headed towards her feet once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m making sure you\u2019re all ready for our jog home, silly bug\u201d Kara said, smiling widely. You were at a loss for words as you fell onto the tongue of Kara\u2019s sneakers. As you fell to the mesh fabric on the tongue of her sneaker, you quickly lost your footing, your legs falling into the various holes dotting the area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKara! This is nuts! You need to let me go!\u201d you shouted as you desperately struggled to get off of her sneaker. But to your horror, Kara could no longer hear your small voice, or she no longer cared. Her powerful hands gripped laces the size of bridge cables, twisting them above you. You watched as the large chords began pressing down into the fabric, it was like watching a steamroller in slow motion. It was impossible to move in time as the chords slammed down into you, pressing you powerfully into her sneaker. You screamed as the pressure bent your arm even further out of place! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk bug, it\u2019s time to go home, don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s only a thirty minute jog!\u201d she said as she finished tying her laces and standing up. Tapping her feet a few times to get the sneakers in place, Kara began her long jog home\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was hell on her sneaker for that time! The heat of the day beat down on you mercilessly, as drops of sweat from Kara rained down onto you! On several occasions, you found yourself chocking up a lungful of her sticky sweat, as it threatened to drown you with each droplet.  With each step, you were flung up until your safety bar of shoelace caught you in the stomach, knocking the wind out of you. You were then thrown down mercilessly into the shoe\u2019s fabric as her foot landed. You watched as her leg took the shock of every step, the wave of force going up her toned legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Kara finally made it to her front door. As the star athlete got back to her home, she kicked off her shoes (and you) letting you fly across the room. Your tiny body falls out of her laces, lying nearly dead on the floor. The ground begins rumbling, as Kara approaches. As she kicks over her shoe with her sock-clad foot, the runner plants her sweaty sole on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk bug, now the real fun can start. I\u2019m all sweaty after that run, so why don\u2019t we\u2026..?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you struggled to breathe regularly again, you almost couldn\u2019t believe what you had heard. A shower? With Kara? Maybe you were finally getting a reward for living through that hell! Maybe Kara was going to be nice to you from now on! You tentatively reached your arm up as Kara reached down to pluck you up off the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, now look at who\u2019s willing to listen to orders,\u201d Kara teased as she picked you up. \u201cMaybe I should always let you know that if you do well you get to shower with me, I might get a lot more work out of you that way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stayed obediently in Kara\u2019s grasp as she walked towards the bathroom. As she entered, and placed you down on the counter, you watched, mesmerized, as she slowly undressed. You watched as her slender fingers plucked off her socks, peeling them from her legs. You saw as her pants and panties fluttered to the ground, shortly followed by her shirt and bra. Standing in front of the nude figure of Kara, you felt like you were the luckiest person on Earth for the first time since this hell started. Kara laid her hand flat out in front of you as she said, \u201chop on little one, it is time for the fun to start!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping on, you fell as she began to move her hand, falling onto her fingers. As Kara entered the shower, you were placed down on the side next to a loofa the size of a large bolder. You drank in every inch of her body as the water began cascading down her naked form. Reaching for her loofa, Kara accidently grabbed hold of you as well! As you were lifted high into the air, you grabbed hold tight of the spongy object, praying you wouldn\u2019t fall off. You watched as a fresh bar of soap was fast approaching her body! Without the slightest care in the world, Kara began rubbing the bar of soap all over herself, form her chest to her toes, lathering herself all over. Your show was cut short as Kara held the loofa (and you) under the water. Your time to watch was over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you were surprised to find yourself once again at Kara\u2019s feet as she began to scrub them with your assistance. You struggled as her hands slowly worked you and the loofa from the top of her ankle, down to the tips of her toes. Turning her foot over, you got a full taste of her sweaty soles as she rubbed you headfirst against them. Soon, you found your head bobbing up between her toes as Kara meticulously scrubbed every inch of her foot. As she dragged the loofa down her sole to her heel, you could feel yourself getting more and more aroused as her skin brushed against you, but as she began twisting and grinding you against her heel, the feeling faded fast. You knew you couldn\u2019t take much more of this and began beating on Kara\u2019s heel, praying she took notice of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re an eager one aren\u2019t you? Jumping on before I even said to!\u201d Kara said as she stopped scrubbing her foot and brought the loofa to eye level. She giggled at you as you clung tightly to the fabric. \u201cYou look so cute when you\u2019re helpless like that, so you\u2019re going to have to stay like that a little longer buggy. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ll like this next part, but I sure will!\u201d she said as she lifted her arm into the air\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFOOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were slammed immediately into Kara\u2019s armpit. \u201cEnjoy buggy, this always stinks after I run,\u201d Kara giggled as she began rubbing you into her soft flesh. The smell wasn\u2019t an exaggeration, your nose burned uncontrollably as her sweaty skin rubbed up against you. You tried pushing away from her skin, only to slip on the wet flesh and end up buried face-first in it. The taste got in your mouth as you had to open it to breath! You began spitting, trying to rid yourself of the taste as Kara switched arms, burying you even deeper in her other pit. She rubbed you in small circles, making sure you almost buffed her armpit clean! As you thought she was going to crush you against it, she pulled away, bringing you again to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright buggy, now for your real reward!\u201d she shouted as she lowered the loofa to her toned, tight, perfect ass. \u201cMake sure to lick it as I scrub, I want my butt spotless!\u201d she said as she pressed you into her soft cheeks. You wasted no time, as you quickly took to the task she gave you, licking in small spurts as she rubbed every inch of her rear. She was kind enough to rub only the outer cheeks, saving between them for a time when you wouldn\u2019t be along for the ride. As you skirted across the edge of her cheeks, you couldn\u2019t help but think that you could stay this way forever. You could even bare her feet if you got to cuddle with her ass every night! But your bliss was ended as Kara pulled you away from her glorious gluteus to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you a mischievous grin, Kara told you that she had one more task for you when the shower was done. \u201cOk buggy, when we get out, I need you to\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked up at the soaking wet figure of Kara as she finished washing the rest of the soap and shampoo off of her body. Looking down at you, the Olympic athlete couldn\u2019t help but giggle at your little form in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHelp me clean my ears, come on little one, don\u2019t tell me I need to clean yours first so you can obey my orders better,\u201d Kara joked as she turned off the water to the shower. You watched as Kara placed you down on the sink counter and wrapped a towel around her body. Looking down at you, she smiled and reached out her hand, pinching you gently between her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat exactly do I need to do?\u201d you asked, growing fearful of Kara once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust hold on tight little one, I\u2019ll take care of the rest,\u201d Kara said as she lifted you to her ear. \u201cOh, and if you begin shouting in my ear, I will squish you on the spot bug. Just so we are clear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that, you found yourself plunging face first into Kara\u2019s ear. Your upper body was pounded against the top of her ear, as she dragged your face across the ridges, swirling you around until you finally approached the outside of her ear canal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo well little one,\u201d she said as she plunged you into the darkness. It was a grueling experience as Kara\u2019s fingers began plunging you deep into her ear canal. Within seconds of penetration, you were already coated in her ear wax. Then, you felt pain ripple through your abdomen as she began to spin you around inside. You clenched your teeth, wanting to scream, but afraid to do so. You could feel your arms becoming heavy with the natural wax as Kara began plunging you in and out of her ear for a final sweep. Your legs felt like they would pop out of their sockets as she quickly pulled you out of one ear and switched hands to dip you into another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKara! Please stop! I can\u2019t take this!\u201d you shouted as she brought you to her other ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCalm down you baby, you\u2019re already half way done. Just shut up and hold on,\u201d she said as she shoved you into her ear and began the process once again.  When you were finally pulled out of Kara\u2019s second ear, you were coated in her ear wax, like a yellowish snowman. As she placed you into the sink and turned the water on so you could wash up, you saw her busily brushing her teeth. After dodging a few of her spits, Kara pulled you out and began looking around the counter for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKara? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d you asked, slightly afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNO fucking dental floss,\u201d she said, slamming her hand down on either side of you frustrated. Heaving an exasperated sigh, Kara looked down at you wearily. As you shuffled uneasily under her gaze, you saw a smile suddenly spread across her face. You grew even more afraid. Her fingers were quickly around you again as Kara lifted you above her head. Tilting her face up at you, she gave a sexy moan as she licked her lips. As her maw opened wide, you could feel yourself being lowered down towards it. You began struggling intensely as Kara gently brought you into her mouth, closing her lips behind you. As you ran to the edge of her mouth, her teeth clacked down and her tongue knocked you over, pinning you to the roof of her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKara! Please don\u2019t eat me! I swear I don\u2019t taste good!\u201d you shouted. You were released as Kara\u2019s tongue fell to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not going to eat you little one, you\u2019re going to be my new dental floss is all,\u201d Kara said as she opened her lips to let in light. \u201cLook and clean between all of my teeth, anything you find toss in my throat, I\u2019ll take care of it in the end,\u201d she said as she opened her mouth wide for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs you looked into Kara\u2019s mouth, you watched as the florescent lights made her saliva shimmer. You wasted no time getting to work as you ran over to her teeth and began checking between them with your tiny arms. The steps were the same for every obnoxiously large tooth. First you would approach it and examine behind and in front of it for any food let over. Next, you dug your arm between her teeth and reached around for anything that had failed to make it to her stomach on the first attempt. When you got your hands on something, you carefully pulled it out and tossed it down her awaiting throat. After a half hour of checking, you shouted to Kara that you were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGreat job little one, now time to get rid of the junk,\u201d she said as she closed her mouth, with you still inside! You ran to the front of her mouth, only to get knocked down by her tongue as she proceeded to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now was your chance to get help! You readied yourself, standing in the middle of the floor so that you had the best chance of being seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhythmic pounding of footsteps echoed through the empty room. You stood in awe as the impressive figure of Kara Goucher turned the corner, towering well above the Manhattan skyscrapers you grew up around. You looked up her long legs to see her face eagerly engaged in chewing on a protein bar. As her jaws worked the chewy bar into a swallow able size, you began shouting at her feet for her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sneaker clad feet soared over your head, obviously you had been missed. As she took a seat on the bench, she began taking off her shoes, the bar still in her mouth. Or at least until she bit down too much. You didn\u2019t know what hit you as the sticky protein bar landed on you, grabbing hold of you with a mixture of Kara\u2019s saliva, the bar\u2019s sugars, and whatever else was holding it together. You quickly found yourself brought into the air, and before Kara\u2019s wide open mouth as she put the bar back in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell face first into Kara\u2019s slippery tongue as her teeth sliced through the heavy bars thick body. As you were clumsily tossed to her teeth by Kara\u2019s tongue, you shook in fear. As her teeth slowly broke the bar to pieces, her serpentine tongue began to investigate your body, licking it up and down thoroughly. You began to cry as a long, \u201cMmmmmm\u201d echoed through Kara\u2019s mouth. She had grown attached to your flavor. As her stomach rumbled, you cringed, wondering when you would be sent below. As Kara\u2019s tongue took another long lick of your body, you trembled, hitting back at it. Her tongue jumped away, shocked. Time froze as Kara\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your friends plan to sneak into the locker room was stupid from the start, you knew that, but now it just seemed plain idiotic. It was partly your fault though; you never did ask him how much of the formula you should drink. From your new perspective, it was clear you had drunken too much! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continued to stare at the new, larger world around you in confusion, a new sensation began to permeate your body. It was a rhythmic vibrating, like an earthquake with a sense of beat. As the vibrations became more powerful with each passing second, you realized that there was a loud crashing sound to accompany it. Suddenly, it hit you as to what the mysterious sensation was\u2026it was the feeling of a person walking towards you! As the towering form of Lolo Jones soon eclipses the harsh lights on you, you realize just how dumb this plan really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBANG!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp explosion of sound echoed behind you as Lolo\u2019s discarded sneakers slammed onto the bench. Looking up, you saw her long legs bend as she planted her tired feet onto the bench. You watched as her toes pushed resentfully against her tight socks, waiting for the chance to breathe! The intense smell of her feet was enough to make you feel queasy, and their intimidating size didn\u2019t help calm you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you backed away from her feet, you failed to notice that Lolo was about to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You watched as shirts, shorts, and other objects clattered onto the bench, knocking you dreadfully off balance. As you crashed onto your ass, you watched a very angry Lolo looked down at the mess she made in disgust. Wordlessly, she grabbed her duffel bag and slammed it down behind you on the floor. You looked down into the cavernous canvas carrier, wondering when the Olympian would calm down enough for you get in touch with her. You watched as Lolo angrily tossed in used shirts and shorts into the bag, making little headway in the pile she had so quickly accumulated. As you took another glance into the slowly filling bag, Lolo let out a grunt of anger as she slammed her arm down onto the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuck organization!\u201d you heard her rant under her breath as she swept her arm across the bench\u2026.right at you!  It was like trying to outrun and oncoming bullet-train, you thought as Lolo\u2019s clothing slammed into you. You struggled to keep awake as you fell into the darkness of her bag, under an avalanche of clothing.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\tZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou groaned as the light from above was closed out with a quick flick of Lolo\u2019s arm. You fried moving, but found your lower body was pinned under something hard. Looking around, you saw that you were dangerously trapped under the sole of Lolo\u2019s sneaker! Struggling, you tried to pull yourself free, but the weight of the shoe was too much for you to move out from under. As the bag suddenly began to move around you, another large object crashed down in front of you in the darkness. The pungent odor that hit you next told you all you needed to know about the mystery object. Lolo\u2019s sneakers had tag-teamed on you. While one pinned you, you now found yourself staring into the cavernous opening of the second, bathing you in the smell of Lolo\u2019s feet! With each swing, you felt yourself drifting further and further into the darkness of sleep. The smell form Lolo\u2019s sneaker sealed your fate as you passed out in her bag\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tZIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou were woken as powerful rays of light shown down on you. Without warning, gravity turned on you, or rather around you, as you began tumbling around in the bag! You felt like you were free-falling as\u2026 well you began to fall. You soon found yourself watching as massive articles of clothing fell into the hungry maw of Lolo\u2019s washing machine! You ran on falling fabric bridges, leaping as separate shirts and shorts fell into the watery pit below. As you leapt onto one of her sports bras, you saw the edge of the washing machine before you! Sprinting on the cup, you jumped off, grabbing hold of the edge of the washing machine. You tried desperately to pull yourself up as Lolo adjusted the dials on the machine for her latest load of laundry. As the giant woman reached to close the lid, you\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Your opponent was Lita, and for your debut, you never thought you would end up being cannon fodder for such an accomplished woman wrestler. You had always watched her matches because you looked up to her, and the thought of being held down by her on your debut was becoming too much for you to handle. Opening your locker, you looked down to see a small pill container with a note attached to it. Picking up the case, you looked at the note and read aloud, \u201cTake two in case of nervousness.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled in relief, figuring it was a gift from your coach to help you get ready for today. Downing the pills in one gulp, you sat on the bench relieved as you felt an odd sensation pass over your body as you felt the pills travel down your throat. You closed your eyes as the sensation grew more intense by the second. It suddenly felt like your body had been dipped in cold water, knocking all the nerves out of you in a flash. Energized and excited, you opened your eyes\u2026.and realized you had a much bigger problem to worry about as your nerves came back tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bench which had just moments ago comfortably fit your rear now stretched out on all sides of you like a suspension bridge. As you stood up and tried to figure out what to do, you heard the door to the locker room open and close as someone entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!....BOOM!....BOOM!...BOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer footsteps shook your bench as they drew closer and closer. You prayed to God above that she would just pass, but you were having no such luck. She was a scarlet tower as she entered your isle. Lita stood over you like a Greek Goddess as she took a seat before her locker, which was right next to yours. As he shapely ass hit the bench, the vibration knocked you on your rear, right before her bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking up, you saw as Lita began stripping out of her street clothes and change into her gear. As her clothing fell all around you, it became apparent that you were left with only two options at this point. Either you could try and get her attention by hitting her ass before you, or try and take cover in the clothes behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMatch is almost on Lita! Get Ready!\u201d You heard her coach shout from the entrance. Lite grumbled as she continued getting changed. Time was running out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess began slipping on the last of her gear you made your choice. Risky as it was, you\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
