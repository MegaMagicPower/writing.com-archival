She was heavy for her age. Her arms and legs were kind of plump and she had a cute puffy face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother was at the other end of the room sewing. Nikki turned of the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom i'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother (Linda) looked up and heave a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki you're alway's hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was still sitting on the couch and looked at her mother with an innocent face. She knew her mother was right. She was always hungry. She alway's kept on eating until all the food was gone. But she never really had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked worried at her. She did't want to feed her daughter more since she already was fatter then an average kid her age but she did't want Nikki to cry and she looked so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda stood up and walked to the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what it is with her. That girl is alway's hungry. Now what do i have for her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned with a big bag of chips.

You're spending way to much time in front of the T.V. It would be good for you if you go outside once in a while.\"   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm feeling fine inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know something. when your father is done we can go for a walk in the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Woopty doo.\" Nikki said totally not excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what Nikki it's nice weather so i guess we can also take a picnic there. How is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word picnic cheered her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then.\" Nikki said knowing that they would go anyway if she liked it or not.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Great.

Are you almost ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Picnic. That sounds great. Well i'm done so let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked downstairs. It was really warm and nice weather so she did't need to were a jacket. Good thing also because she was recently gotten too fat too fasten the zipper of her old jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's mother came out of the kitchen with a big basket full of food since she knew that Nikki would have an even bigger appetite after a walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Nikki's father (Bram) said. \"Let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went out. Nikki looked around. It was really nice weather. Maybe it was't so bad to go outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to the big forest.\" Bram said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea.\" Linda agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose.\"  Robin said. still not really excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nikki. what's wrong? we go on a picnic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki you can't be hungry! You just eat a whole bag of chips!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you can't be hungry then.\" Her father said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did't answer but rubbed her big tummy and was thinking: \"I'm always hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they go in the forest Nikki got a little sidetracked. Then she saw something she liked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blackberries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast she walked over to them and plucked them and put them in her mouth so fast she almost did't have time to chew them. She plucked more careful for the thorn's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nikki your enjoying yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hands were purple  because of all the berries. Her parents walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat to much or els you wont have room for the picnic.\" Linda said. Not that it made any sense. Nikki was always hungry. With or without some blackberries in her tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen most or the blackberries where vanished in her tummy she and her parent's walked further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you want to have a picnic?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the grass field in the center of the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki heave a deep sigh. That would mean she would have to walk even further. But the grass field was a nice place. And there were standing some picnic tables and there were a lot places for children to play. The place was very familiar and there was a good chance they would't be the only ones there. A lot of people came there. Especially on such a nice day like today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It wood was making noises but hold. Nikki did't really notice. She just wanted food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram took some sandwiches out of the basket. Nikki fast grabbed one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki they are not only for you. Your mother and i also want some of the food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she started to eat the sandwiches and left two for her parents. After that she grabbed some drumsticks one in each hand and ripped the meat of them like if she had't eaten in days. In about 2 minutes she devoured 4 of the 6 drumsticks and most of the chicken wings disappeared the same way. After that Nikki fast grabbed some wraps (sort pancakes filled with salad and salmon or mackerel) and stuffed them in her face so fast she almost had't time to chew them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do i still go to the trouble to make them. She does't even taste them.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki found three cups of yogurt she ripped one open and gulped the yogurt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

You did't think a moment at us. You hunger is becoming a real problem.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dad. But i'm just always hungry.\" And she rubbed her potbelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what. Tomorrow we go to the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked scared. Like any kid she did't like doctors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nikki. It's only a check up. I wanted to see if everything is all right with you. Don't you worry okay. Maybe he know's why you're hungry all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here an apple.

Hello.\" one of the girls said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're fat!\" And she pushed her finger in Nikki's soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys also walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're finished. Who is that? She is fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ... i am.... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that you're not fat but just big boned.

And she walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she could see that there was a house. There were some bushes before it and a few trees and if you did't there was a house you would't notice it. Or when you were standing before it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wanted to go in that old house. It's standing here for ages. Or at least that's what my mom says. She told me the owner is dead for some time. But he locked the door of this old house so... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found a small opening. Maybe it was used for a dog door or something like that. However he nailed it. But he didn't did a very good job at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we tried to break it open and we did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i also come?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't know.\" One of the girls said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let her play with us if she wants. By the way if we did't let you play with us when we first met you here you would't be standing her with us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you can come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst the two boys walked to the house then the two girls and then Nikki. Suddenly one of the girls walked back and said to the little girl: \"Little bit you stay here and is someone is coming for us tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl walked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your sister understand you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. She is able to understand things she even can't speak out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her name is little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Little bit is just a nickname. She understand that i mean her. I got it from that cartoon about pixies. You know little bits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys already crawled in the house and also one of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here i come.\" The other girl said and also crawled in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was  very hard for Nikki. The opening was kind of small for her. She was pushing and wriggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy started to pull her inside.     </span></div></div>",

They are all thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The're also all FAKE! I watched a show on T.V. Most of those photo's are made with the computer! You know make that waist thinner or pump up those breasts.

I don't think it's disgusting.\" Nikki said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.

We could just bring that in to you!\" Nikki smiled and made a valient attemp to nod eagerly, which only succeeded iin jiggling her neck and face fat. \"Yes!\" She said, \"that's a really good idea!\" The kids nodded and went out into the past room, where indeed there was about a dozen full course meal's worth of food. However much it was thpugh, it wouldn't be enough to satisfy Nikki, just to hopefully tide her over until theyvfound something else to give her. If someone were to ask them why they were bothering to keep feeding Nikki, they really wouldn't have a reason. It was just something they were doing for the sake of doing something. As they went back and forth, bringing Nikki more and more food, they noticed it was getting harder and harder for Nikki to feed herself. Her arms were slowly becoming caked in a thick layer of fat, making it ever harder for her to even lift them. If she kept going on like this (like she most certainly would) she would get so lazy that the other kids would have to climb her hill of fat and feed her directly themselves. While her arms gained more and more, so did the rest of her. Her triple chin spread out into a quadtuple, quintuple, then even a seistuple chin. Her cheeks were bloating out like balloons, making it less and less easy for the corpulant girl to open her eyes fully. Without a doubt, however, the most affected parts of her were her legs, rump, and belly; with the bellyin the definite lead. Her thighs were filling out to be almost the literal thickness of tree trunks, though they weren't easy to spot due to her ever expanding bottom having covered her legs from the back. Her belly was mountainous,And the other children were starting to have to make a somewhat arduous trek around it to bring more to her eagerly awaiting maw. After some time, the food stopped coming to her. \"Hey! What happened?\" She asked through her flabby face. \"Uh... that's all the food.\" Said Alex. \"You ate all of it.\" Said a somewhat impressed Chris. \"Aww but I'm still so hungry!\" Said the massive girl. She sat down on the floor, making an enormous BAM that shook the entire house and sent rippling waves of jiggly fat all up Nikki's belly legs and rump. Under her tremendous weight, the old floorboarfs creeeaaaAked. Everyone froze and looked down, as...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

All of the other kids grabbed multiple handfuls of food to feed Nikki, restarting the process that they had above. Nikki ate happily, her weight continuing to grow as normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pile shrunk, Nikki's weight grew rapidly. Nobody seemed to care that they would probably be trapped down there for quite a while without any way of getting back up, all were too busy making Nikki even fatter than she was.<br>\r\n\"Mmm...

She was so large, her belly nearly the size of a full-grown adult. She was nearly naked, but her tattered shirt managed to cover up her new fatty breasts. Her butt was the size of half a bus, each cheek being as soft and round as a beanbag chair. Her face was very chubby as well, her big cheeks making her eyes squint.<br>\r\n\"Mmgghh...

Some kids at school that did't liked her called her the walking garbage bin.

Linda some times found it hard to have a daughter like Nikki but she must admit that it was handy that she never had leftovers. whatever it was Nikki would keep eating dinner till the last crumb of food was gone.<br>\r\nNikki opened the refrigerator. They had a big refrigerator filled with food thanks too Nikki's eating. Nikki's belly rumbled and her hands started to grab every kind if food she could get. Some boiled potatoes Linda saved for tomorrow too bake. Some cans of weenies. When Nikki was four her father learned her too use the can opener. Sometimes he regret it. Of course she ate the weenies with a lot of mayonnaise and ketchup.<br>\r\nShe also took out a head of lettuce and stuffed half of it in her mouth and took with her other hand a bottle of her mothers self made dressing and poured that in with it. and devoured the lettuce that way. Some juice and tomatoes also went down her belly. All kinds of sauces. She just put the jars or bottles upside down and poured it all in her mouth. Then she grabbed cheese, ham, chicken and all other stuff for on bread. She also grabbed some meat Linda wanted to use for the next days and even ate the broccoli. The only thing she left were the eggs.<br>\r\nShe waddled over too the cupboard and took all chips, cookies, muffins, cupcakes, candy and stuffed all of it in her greedy mouth.<br>\r\nSuddenly she heard her pajamas rip. She lifted her shoulders and kept eating.<br>\r\n When she swallowed the last crumb from the cupboard she waddled over too the freezer.<br>\r\nWhen she opened the freezer her eyes sparkled when she saw two gallons of ice cream. She start eating it with her hands. Some of the ice cream fell on her naked body since her pajamas was now in shreds on the ground. She ate the two gallons of ice cream and licked her hands clean. She the even ate the sugar out of the jar and took the fruit from the bowl and eat all of it. <br>\r\nShe had eaten any crumb of food in the house and her belly was really bloated now and sticking out forward and even bigger then before. Nikki felt better then she felt in a long time. Not full. She never felt full before but less hungry then normal.<br>\r\nShe felt too tired to walk back to her room and fell asleep just on the ground. sleeping with the floor covered with empty bags boxes cans jars and other stuff.     <br>\r\nWhile she slept you could hear her big belly being busy digest all the food.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you want me to be such a toothpick?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i rather have you like a anorexia patient than being a ball of lard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i rather be a ball of lard then a toothpick! I not nearly fat enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're way too fat Nikki! I'm your mother and i decide what's best for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's my body. I can do with it what i want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you ruin it. Trust me Nikki once in the future you will thank me for this when you are slender and... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I hate you! You don't want me to live my own life but too live like you want too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because  i know what's best for you. When you older you can decide what you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at her mother with anger in her eyes and hunger in her belly. She did't want a diet and she would't try to lose weight. She would get fatter if her mother would put her on a diet. She did't knew how but she just wanted too eat get fatter and maybe finally would feel full for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gonna do it. I just keep eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that!\" Linda said. Now get your fat butt in the car. We need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda hoped that telling Nikki she had a fat butt would want her to lose weight but Nikki was't planning to lose any weight. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

If their parents watch about what they eat they can grow into it, but Niki is well very heavy for her age and even when she grows up. How much does she eat normally?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... a lot. That's the problem. She is eating non-stop. She is always hungry. You know normal kids stop with eating when their full but she stays hungry so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. Well lets see. Did you ever heard about the prader-willy syndrome (does really exist)?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well people who have that never feel full. There always hungry. Maybe there is a small chance she has that. It's kind of rare. That would explain her hunger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i cant keep her under control. She keeps eating even when i tell her not too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I guess that's why she is overweight. combine endless hunger with endless eating. But i'm not sure if she has it. You should need to go to a hospital to be sure about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked to her mother. Her clothes were tight on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy i'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see? She has that the whole time while she eat every last scrap of food in the kitchen last night.

She had seen it on cartoons and one time when she was playing with the girls next door she saw their mother who was also on a diet and when she saw what she eat she shivered. She looked scared at her mother.<br>\r\nThe doctor handed her a small book with what she was allowed to eat when she was on a diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But think about it. Maybe you need to change her food a bit. That could help. Or make sure she eat's less. You could still let her check for prader-willy syndrome.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Thank you doctor.

There, she sees her mother making pancakes. Although to Nikki, the stack wasn't big enough; about 6 pieces in the stack. Well, Nikki just ate them by the cake, but unbeknownst to her, the pancakes were making her body deflate.<br>\r\n As she finished the pancakes, she tried to rub her belly, but noticed that it wasn't as close as she thought. She looked down to see that her large belly turned into a small bump on her body. She screamed in fear, as she looked at herself in terror, as most of her fat had been dissolved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, what happened,\" she asked in concern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother turned to her with an evil grin, replying, \"You're too fat, Nikki. The doctor came over earlier and injected a serum into your system. So, whenever you eat something, you'll lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki couldn't believe it. She can't believe it. She went to the cupboard, grabbed the box of cookies, and started to eat them. She lost more weight because of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No matter how much you lose, you're still too fat,\" her mother said, chuckling evilly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe searched all around the house to eat something, while her mother chanted \"You're still too fat\", but to no avail did she gain any weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPound by pound, inch by inch was dissolving as every time she was eating. After a moment, she was reduced to less than skin and bones. She literally looked like a stick figure. She was too weak to try and reach for a lone potato chip. She almost had it, until a chubby hand grabbed it before she did. She looked up to see that it was her mother, over 500 pounds, taking the chip and eating it to mock her. She walked over to the fridge to grab a large chocolate cake, big enough to feed a family of 6. She placed it on the kitchen table and began to eat it, while Nikki watched her, teary-eyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I never thought you would be so skinny that you can't eat what's right in front of you anymore,\" said Linda, as she gobbles down 1/4 of the cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram walks in with 4 bags of food from McDonald's, weighing over 400 pounds. He placed them on the dining room table and shoved each and every burger down his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were hoping to get you to lose some weight, because you always ate out of house and home while we were STARVING,\" he exclaimed as he drank a large chocolate milkshake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so sad to see herself as a useless beanpole, while her brother and mother were growing fatter as they ate her most favorite fatty foods. They grew bigger and bigger as they ate, getting fatter with each bite. After eating all the food, Linda was over 1000 pounds, hitting her head against the ceiling, while Bram was over 850 pounds, as he could almost reach for the ceiling. Linda's stomach growled like a lion, as she was salivating in hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a bit hungry,\" she said, as she looked at the small form that is Nikki, then grinned evilly, \"But I think one small fry will fill me up until dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she towered over Nikki, grabbing her with a pinch, and raised her against her giant mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki gasped in terror as she woke up from the nightmare. She looked down to see her belly was slightly lower, due to that she digested her meal earlier, which made her gain weight in every other part of the body. She got out of bed, proclaiming, \"I don't care what she says. I'm not losing this weight. Even if I weigh 10 kajillion pounds, I'll eat whatever I want, whenever I want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she crept downstairs and...</span></div></div>",

She slowly started to realize she would have a brother or sister.<br>\r\nShe picked a spoon and climbed on a chair next to her mother too also eat some ice until the pizza's were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then i'm the big sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Nikki. I hope you be nice to you sibling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be nice to my little sister. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can also be a brother Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or two. Maybe a boy and a girl.\" Nikki added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh i don't think so Nikki but who knows. Now you're gonna be the bigger sister.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Nikki started too think how she was gonna be the bigger sister. Mary-kate the girl next door was an older sister and she said it was sometimes hard but sometimes also very funny.<br>\r\nLinda put one of the pizza's in front of Nikki. Fast she started too eat it but her thoughts were still with the baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nikki are you ready for the checkup tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did Nikki remember about the dream and she started to shiver almost crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki what is it? Did something happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... i don't... want too... go too... c... checkup. Please mommy please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda did't know what too do. She knew that Nikki did't want too go but she really seemed to be scared half too death now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nikki you don't have too be scared. He's not gonna do anything too you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He... he's not gonna make me skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No honey. He would say some things when you too heavy but he himself won't do anything about it. He could tell us what we can do. So tell us which things we can't eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lifted her shoulders. She did't really understood it but it did't seemed like it would be in the dream and started too eat the second pizza. After she had eaten the second pizza her mother took her by the hand and said come on let's go back too bed.<br>\r\nNikki was still hungry but she was always hungry so she ignored it. The thought of a little sister or brother made her think less off her hunger. She crawled fast in bed and fell in a deep dreamless sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nikki grabbed a comic and started to look at the pictures(she can't read yet). <br>\r\nSuddenly someone pulled at her leg. She looked and saw a small girl. While she looked at the face she suddenly recognized the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little bit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked through the room and saw Tanja.

My mother thinks i'm too heavy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja looked at her new friends love handles.

I met her yesterday at the grass field. Can i come over after the check up? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda stood up and shook hands with Tanja's mother. Both mothers started to talk and finally Linda said:\"Well you can come over after the check up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Both girls said and hugged each other what was kind of hard for Tanja thanks to Nikki's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened and Nikki and her mother were called in. The doctor did some tests looked in her ears and her eyes and finally he wanted to weigh her. Nikki slowly stepped on the scale. The doctor looked surprised at the number and returned to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss you have a lovely little girl. You said you were worried about her weight. Is that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm afraid i must tell you that you're right about her weight. She is much too heavy for her age. Does she get enough exercise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she does't do any exercise, But what i'm worried about is that she is hungry all the time. She seems to never be full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm well i once met a little girl from china. She was adopted and was also used to eat non stop since that was what she did in china. Is it possible that she was also forced to eat much when she was little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not as far if i know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i don't know what it is. Here i have a diet and some activity groups. If she keeps to the diet and do some activity i'm sure she'll lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did't really understand what they said but it did't sound to good. She got scared.<br>\r\nLinda took her by the hand and walked back to the waiting room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll wait here until you're ready with your check up.\" Linda said too Tanja's mom while she and her two daughter's were called to the doctor's office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked scared at the diet book her mom was reading.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Besides she had seen every episode of her favorite cartoons about ten times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. I will do something else then sitting around all day.

But i want to hear something tomorrow before you go too bed or i pick some activity for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal!\" Nikki said and jumped on bed what caused the bed to make a loud squeaking noise. \"But mom can i have some food now. I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always hungry but i guess all right then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the two walked downstairs Nikki was busy thinking of some activity that was't tiring. For someone like her that was hard too do. She put her soft behind on a chair and started to think.<br>\r\nHer mother took a pizza out the freezer and put it in the microwave.

She would't follow the diet. Quietly she walked out her room and walked downstairs. She could hear her parents talk in their bed room. She fast walked to the kitchen and opened the cupboard and started to eat every kind of food she could get. Chips, cookies, cupcakes. It all vanished in her greedy mouth. She saw no reason in stopping and was eating until the last crumb of food was in her belly. After that she opened the refrigerator and took out all the food and pushed it in her mouth . Weenies almost drowned in some mayonnaise and ketchup. A piece of roast and some salad. Of course together with a lot of dressing. And also a bowl of baked potatoes. She also drank the last liter of Cola and belched loudly. Then she opened the freezer and took out one gallon of ice cream and started to eat it with her hands. When she was halfway through the gallon with her hands all sticky and messy her mother walked in. <br>\r\nWhen she saw the empty boxes wrappers and jars she knew exactly what happened.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

So anyway what do you want to die?\" asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Nikki could answer her belly growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we usually eat dinner at 6:00 pm. Until then do you want to play guess who with me?\" asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played guess who for a dozen minutes with Nikki winning the most rounds. Every now and then her belly would let out a growl. Tanja was curious about how someone could live with being hungry all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nikki you're always hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it annoying to never be full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes, but on the bright side I get to eat as much delicious food as I can\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja giggled at that last statement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a good thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the door opened and Robbie came in and noticed Nikki there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey aren't you the fat girl we met at the park yesterday?\" asked Robbie casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robbie! Don't just call people fat like that!\" said Tanja worried that Robbie hurt Nikki's feelings.\" Now say you're sorry\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright  I'm sorry\" said Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay guys I know i'm fat and i like it and if other people don't like it it's their problem not mine\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja was relived that her new friend wasn't offended and actually admired her for how proud she was for being fat. After that Nikki played guess who with Robbie and won the most rounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Tanja and Robbie's mother called them down for dinner. They were having spaghetti and meatballs and Nikki had two plates of it. Even though she wasn't even close to full from those servings she didn't want to be rude so she didn't ask for more. When Julie (the mom) asked Nikki if she wanted a piece of pie she said yes and ate it and it was the most delicious pie she had ever tasted and wanted more but again she didn't want to be rude so she just had that one piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner Nikki, Tanja and Robbie went back to Tanja's room and Nikki saw a small t.v and next to it a Wii. They played Kirby's Return to Dream Land with Nikki playing as Kirby, Tanja as Waddle Dee and Robbie as Meta Knight. They played until it was bedtime but Nikki forgot to bring her pajamas. She asked Tanja if she could borrow her pajamas but obviously they didn't fit so they asked Julie if she could borrow hers. She said yes and while they did fit it was still a little tight. The kids then brushed their teeth and Robbie went to the guess bedroom since Nikki would be sleeping in Tanja's room. Don (Tanja's dad) then came in the room to tell them good night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad\" said Tanja in a almost panicking tone. Don then came back and closed the door but left a crack. Nikki looked at Tanja with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared of the dark\" said Tanja embarrassingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I ask my dad to leave a crack in the door too\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they both went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked around to see that the bed Nikki was sleeping in was empty and the door was open. She thought nothing of it since she just assumed that Nikki went to the bathroom or something. But then she heard another noise only this time it came from downstairs. Wanting to know what was making that sound she got out of bed and walked to the stairs when the guest bedroom door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanja? Were you woken up by the noise too?\" asked Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm going downstairs to see what it is. You coming?\" asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since I'm awake now I might as well\" said Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made their way downstairs and heard that the noise was coming from the kitchen. They went to the kitchen and saw Nikki eating food from the fridge, she was making the noise all along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew for a second there I thought it was a burglar or worse, good thing it was just you Nikki\" said Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Nikki didn't respond to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nikki are you alright?\" asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Nikki didn't respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja and Robbie then approach Nikki to look at her eye to eye. But when they saw her face her eyes were closed. They then realized that Nikki was sleepwalking or sleepeating in her case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed Nikki was eating everything that was edible, from the leftover spaghetti, too the rest of the pie, too even the ketchup and mustard. Tanja and Robbie tried to wake her up but no matter what they did she wouldn't wake up. After she was done eating food from the fridge she fell down on her back apparently satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja and Robbie looked at the mess Nikki made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man mom is going to freak out when she sees this mess\" said Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tanja we can fix this\" said Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple we'll just clean this mess and mom and dad won't be the wiser\" said Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took some paper towels and immediately started to clean everything and even wiped some stains from Nikki's face. But now came the hard part moving Nikki back to bed. They both took an arm each and began pulling and only managed to move her a few inches before getting tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man she's way too heavy for both of us. How are we going to be able to bring her upstairs?\" asked Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Tanja got an idea. She went to the kitchen and got a cookie out of the jar and hung it in front of Nikki's face and just as she was hoping for Nikki tried to take the cookie but Tanja pulled it away. Robbie then understood her plan to bring Nikki into her room bye luring her with the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plan worked and Nikki was back in Tanja's room on her bed where she locked the door so that she wouldn't be sleepeating anymore tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that incident Tanja went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then Nikki started to wake up so Tanja stopped rubbing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Tanja\" said Nikki groggily as she was getting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Nikki.

The boy before her was also pretty cute in her eyes too. He had short cut brown hair, green eyes, and sported a dark blue short sleeve shirt and blue jeans. She also couldn\u2019t help note he was also a bit on the chubby side as well, not nearly as big as her of course, but she could see this boy was no stranger to food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeding himself was the last thing on Den\u2019s mind though. He wanted to see how much this tubby toddler could pack away. He kept his grin and said \u201cCool. How much can you eat?\u201d He asked a little excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned slightly, happy to see SOMEONE wasn\u2019t being mean about her \u201cability\u201d. \u201cA lot, I\u2019ve never been full.\u201d She said a bit proudly as she gave her tummy a slight pat. Little Bit didn\u2019t wake up from this but stretched slightly and repositioned herself on the large tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDen grinned even more seeing she wasn\u2019t mad about him asking about her appetite. \u201cCool! I wanna see how much you can eat.\u201d He said very excitedly. Nikki giggled a bit at this. As usual, she was hungry and was more than willing to show him just how much she could put away. \u201cOkay. But you gotta find me something nice and tasty for me to eat.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDen grinned like a boy who had just gotten a new present. He quickly ran out of the room, with Robbie in tow, also wanting to see just how much Nikki could eat to. After a few moments, they both returned with</span></div></div>",

Nikki grinned widely as she knew this would't be enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you eat all this?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can.\" Robbie answered. I saw her eating candy yesterday... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat it too Robbie.\" Tanja said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja raised her arm and let it down hitting the tennis ball on the screen to the other end of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out? What. Come in that was't out. It was miles in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what sis. I also eat some of the candy but not as much if her. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I was looking around while you were stuffing your face. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert lifted his shoulders and opened a bag of wine gums. Little bit was still sleeping. She looked kind of sweet on Nikki's belly. <br>\r\nTanja put off the Wii. Also a bit interesting at Nikki's appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oke Nikki open wide!\" Denvert said and took the bag of wine gums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did as was told and Denvert let poured a handful of the wine gums in her mouth. Nikki chewed a few times powerful before swallowing it all. <br>\r\nDenvert got even more excited. Seeing how fast this girl was eating and he continued giving her wine gums. It did't take long for Nikki to finish the complete bag of wine gums.<br>\r\nRobbie stood up with a bag of licorice. Just like Denvert he poured by handfuls licorice in her mouth. Nikki had the time of her life.<br>\r\nTanja looked interesting at Nikki. She had a strange smile on her face. She did't knew why but she liked this. She liked this very much.<br>\r\nRobbie and Denvert continued to feed her all kinds of candy. Haribo kinds of candy, mixed candy and more licorice. finally all bags were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that all. I'm not full. Not even close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait we get some more.\" Denvert said while he and Robbie ran downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is't it a bit strange to never feel full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm used too it. I always felt hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think they can get enough food to get you full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really but they can try right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later the two boys came back with three bags of chips, two bags of cookies and five bars of chocolate. Tanja shivered a bit from joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already put two pizza's in the oven.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure that's smart Denvert. I mean suppose she get's full then what do we do wit the pizza's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we can eat them. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on lets keep feeding her.\" Tanja said with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie took one look at his sister. He did't understood why his sister looked so happy suddenly. But it did't really matter. He was curious or this girl would be happy after eating this all and two pizza's. <br>\r\nDenvert already opened the first bag of chips and poured them in her mouth. Halfway the first bag Nikki said: \"Wait a sec. hold it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're full?\" Tanja asked a bit disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. But all those chips made me thirsty. Could you also give me something to drink while eating?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I'll be right back!\" Robbie said while he ran downstairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Denvert poured some more chips in Nikki's hungry mouth. When Robbie returned he had one bottle of Cola, one bottle of Sprite and one Cassis. Robbie unscrewed the first bottle and walked too Nikki.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Open wide!\" He said and put the bottle upside down in her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about one third of the bottle was gone Robbie pulled the bottle out and Denvert continued feeding her. Soon the first bag of chips were empty. <br>\r\nRobbie ripped open the first box of cookies and pushed them by three in a time in her mouth. <br>\r\nTanja walked over to the boys and took the bottles to give Nikki something to drink every now and then.<br>\r\n Soon the cookies and Chips were all gone in the huge gut of the girl. After that the chocolate disappeared just as fast. Tanja finished it by giving Nikki a few last sips of Sprite. Nikki burped loudly.<br>\r\nThe others giggled. Denvert looked at his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well those Pizza's are almost done. Come on Robbie. Let's go take them. Or do you have enough?\" He asked and looked at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet boys. Oh and also take something too drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys returned later with two Pizza's and another bottle of Cola. Nikki happy opened her mouth while the boys shoved pizza in it. After each slice Tanja poured some Cola in Nikki's mouth. Nikki was very happy. Being fed by her new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already finished one whole pizza!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't keep me waiting. I'm still a hungry girl that needs to be fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we do. Here we go.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert put on slice over another and let Nikki eat it fast this way. <br>\r\nSlowly he smiled seeing how this five year old girl eat more then an average adult. After the last slice was done and Tanja poured the last of the bottle inside Nikki belched long and loud. The others laughed.<br>\r\nLittle bit was still sleeping with her thumb in her mouth. Curled up like a little kitten. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly grabbed two more, sandwiching them together and letting her eat it down that way. Very soon the second big pizza was resting inside the overly wide little girl\u2019s belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki let out a massive burp and placed a food stained hand on her big belly. Her shirt had long ago been pushed up by the large pale dome. It looked like Nikki had swallowed a big creamy white beach ball. The stuffed little one couldn\u2019t help but grin in bliss. She had never eaten down so much in one sitting before. Her mother or someone else had always been there to stop her. However, her almost unbelievable gluttony seemed fantastic to her. Not only did everything taste great, but the feeling she got from having such a tight and round tummy was amazing. To top it off, her appetite and bulging tummy seemed to make her very popular and even bring her a cute little boy who, as far as she could tell, liked her piggy eating. She had to have more, and said so to the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*URRRRP* More! More! I\u2019m still hungry!\u201d She shouted blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone\u2019s jaws dropped. None of them had ever seen anyone THIS hungry before. Even though in shock, they were still more than happy to see how much more they could feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie looked around for the next item to feed the hungry little bottomless pit before realizing that she had eaten everything. \u201cYou already ate everything we brought you.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna wait so long for my food.\u201d Nikka said as her tummy let out a low growl, she wasn\u2019t lying about her hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDen thought for a moment as he said. \u201cMaybe we should take you to the kitchen and feed you more there so you won\u2019t have to wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki replied\u2026</span></div></div>",

We forget we have a hungry girl here we need to feed!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Well we get some food and something to drink.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys ran downstairs again. Tanja went sitting on the ground with her legs crossed under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never have seen anyone ever eaten so much. Well except in cartoons maybe. But my parents normally eat one pizza for dinner. You eat two entire pizza's and some chips cookies and candy. Do you maybe have a second stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that possible?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My uncle lives on a farm and he told me that a cow has four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i believe i have one. But for some reason it never get's full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little bit likes your big belly. I guess it feels kind of soft.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pinched Nikki's belly gentle. The next moment Robbie and Denvert walked back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what we have left are some jars of jelly, one jar of peanut butter and a few sticks of just butter and three jars of pasta sauce and some Spa orange. Of course we have still some pasta in the pantry but we first need to boil that before you can eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please feed me?\" Nikki asked with her sweetest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert already unscrewed the first jar of jelly and poured it in Nikki's mouth. Niki made a sound of pleasure when the sticky sweet stuff was poured in her mouth. Fast she started to swallow it. After a few times swallow the jar was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's my time!\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed a stick of butter in Nikki's mouth. Nikki liked Butter. She found it having a special taste. Of course her parents did't let her eat butter normally. But now she got the chance she took it. <br>\r\nTanja already unscrewed the other jars of jelly. After Nikki swallowed the first stick of butter Tanja started to pour another jar of jelly in the mouth of the fat girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thirsty! \" Nikki yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja unscrewed the bottle and poured some of the spa in nikki's mouth and continued pouring jar after jar in the mouth of her new friend. Giving her a few sips of spa after every jar.<br>\r\nFor the peanut butter Denvert used a spoon since you could't really pour it. But Nikki licked every spoon full  of the stuff clean.<br>\r\nAfter that Robbie pushed in the other two sticks of butter one by one. Tanja made sure she poured some spa in Nikki's mouth after every few bites of butter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Now for the pasta sauce! Or are you full Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja could't believe Nikki still was't full but she felt a strange feeling hearing Nikki still was't full. She liked the strange feeling.<br>\r\nSuddenly her shirt ripped right through the middle. Nikki felt kind of relieved not feeling the pressure of her shirt anymore. In the past time her shirt had rode up making it look more like a bra then a shirt.<br>\r\nTanja took the first jar of pasta sauce and poured it in Nikki's waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Robbie you do know that if she is still hungry after this... well we have't much food left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she's still hungry after this i give up. She has eaten more then a whole family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i hoped too get her full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't have everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja emptied the last jar of sauce and after that poured in the last of the spa. Nikki opened her mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRP! Oops! Excuse me. That was great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally full?\" Tanja asked patting Nikki's bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest... no. But i must admit i feel more close to full then normal. That feels great. Thanks you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i guess we're done now. That was about the last food we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play on the Wii?\" Robbie asked. \"I think you like Ben 10.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After i've done on area you can. All right? Do you also want one time Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks.

However she was finding it very difficult to keep her attention on the two as her big belly kept making her mind wonder back it. The feeling the large dome gave her was indescribable. She LOVED having her tummy this large. She watched as the white \u201cballoon\u201d of little girl belly moved up and down as she took in every breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tummy was extremely sensitive in this state but in a good way. She could almost feel every molecule of air wafting past her big, near beach ball sized, belly. She could feel the strands of her shirt that ripped open, exposing her belly but still keeping her chest covered, as she took each breath. And most of all, she could feel the weight of little bit as she snoozed on the soft and warm tummy. The weight of the little one was a bit much but she gave Nikki much more pleasure than anything else. She closed her eyes, the boys were just finishing off the level of their game. She didn\u2019t see how this could get any better\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the answer to her thought happened. Denvert had just finished and let Tanja take over for him. He was more than happy to as he himself was having a hard time focusing on the game. One of his greatest fantasies had just come true. As far back as he could remember he had fantasized about watching girls and women getting fatter and eating excessive amounts of food. So it was no wonder why the boy slowly walked over to where Nikki was laying and sat down by her big belly. He looked the stuffed little girl\u2019s belly over and grinned. He could only hold back for a second or two before he consciously placed his hand on her soft tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened her eyes to see what had just touched her and blushed. She looked up to see Denvert with his hand on her tummy. The boy quickly pulled his hand back<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Nikki, I\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I like it when people play with my tummy, especially when it\u2019s big. Just be careful okay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki said happily. Den nodded and slowly began to rub and explore the fat little girl\u2019s belly, being sure not to hurt Nikki or wake Little Bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned and closed her eyes again. She was loving the feeling of this little boy\u2019s hands on her stuffed gut. Granted she would have loved anyone\u2019s hands on her tummy right now, but there was something about Denvert. She liked everyone there, but she really liked him, starting to really form a bit of a crush on the boy. Her thoughts were interrupted though as his hands stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and looked up at him, wondering why he stopped. She was even more puzzled by the fact that he was blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Denvert?\u201d She asked concerned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s your tummy\u2026\u201d He said meekly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki raised an eyebrow \u201cMy tummy?\u201d He paused for a moment, blushing harder, before continuing <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes you look....\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d Nikki said not seeing where he was going with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-it makes you look\u2026very pretty.\u201d He finally said very quietly as he blushed more red than he had ever blushed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned as her own cheeks turned red as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks. I think you look very hansom too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said quietly, but also very excitedly. She was so happy to hear he liked her and how round she was getting. Denvent just blushed and went back to rubbing her belly again. However he couldn\u2019t help but slowly stop and wrap his arms around the large dome of Nikki\u2019s tummy, giving her a big hug. \u201cPretty girl\u201d he said as he nuzzled her fat against his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie asked as he and Tanja looked back from their game. Denvert looked up with a big smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m rubbing Nikki\u2019s tummy. It\u2019s so soft and warm\u2026you gotta come feel this.\u201d He said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth came over and slowly began to feel Nikki\u2019s belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s right.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja said as she began to lightly rub and poke Nikki\u2019s tummy. Soon all three of them were rubbing, poking, and lightly pinching Nikki\u2019s stuffed tummy. Nikki was in heaven with all the attention her sensitive tummy was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever all four of them froze as the door opened to revile\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her shocked expression however quickly turned to a grin. She had never told anyone, but she LOVED fat/to fatten children.

I guess we also have some canned food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we also have something in the freezer.\" Tanja added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're not supposed to use the cooker so we can't make any of the pasta or potatoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i'm not able to open a can.\" Tanja said. \"That stuff in the freezer of course also need to be cooked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not able to use a cooker... but i am, and i can open a can without any trouble. So i guess who is in for a feeder game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Nikki is the one who's being fed i'm in!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Said Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm still hungry so go ahead feed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry i will make some food as fast if i can.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Robbie and i will help you.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will?\" Robbie asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes we will!\" Tanja said and pulled her brother out of the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked at Nikki. Nikki looked at him with a bit of mean smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you think my belly is pretty? Is that really what you think? Because my parents don't like it i eat that much and am a bit fat. They think about putting me on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Are they crazy? Your fat is great! I like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert suddenly realized he maybe had said something he better could't had said. His face looked as red as a tomato.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? So really like that i'm fat and eat so much?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i do. I think your fat belly makes you very attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you can help making it bigger if the food is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can finally feel full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We can try right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle bit made soft noises in her sleep. Niki's stomach started to rumble a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe your still hungry after all you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like i said i never get full. I wish i could eat all day long. From when i wake up until i went too bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you would be soon a very fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like that and i think you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and you know what... I think Tina too. Did you see how she tried to get us too feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the first  adult that likes my weight.\" She giggled. \"This is gonna get fun.\"   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Nikki's mouth kept going open and open. Tanja could't understand how that girl could eat so much. It seemed like there was no bottom in her stomach. Robbie just shoved the food in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Feeling full Nikki?\" Tanja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. Not yet. I have still room.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was really bloated and her elastic pants were cutting in her soft flesh.

See. What do you want Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pull... them... off.\"  Nikki said between bites of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was busy stuffing her with some pasta small tomato pieces out of a can and meatballs also out of a can. Nikki did't cared what it was as long if it was food it was fine.<br>\r\nJust opening her mouth and get food pushed in. <br>\r\nTina put also on the song i'm fat from Weird All Yankovich and: Wanna be fat from the go go girls. Nikki liked both songs since it was a bit like she was.  She closed her eyes while food was pushed in her mouth. <br>\r\nSuddenly it stopped and Nikki opened disappointed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not full yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Tanja could't believe her ears but liked it for some reason.

Even if you do find such a person the game stops pretty fast since the person is stuffed very fast. So most people don't play it because that way it's no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except when Nikki plays.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee Nikki eating made him so happy he already forget the disturbed moment.

But Tina's parents were rich. Money was something she could get always. Her older sister was 17 and used about $1000 in a month or more. It would be no problem to get some money from her parents and fill the cupboard's again. Besides. Their mother said she would be back late.<br>\r\nShe walked down one time too counted the empty cans and bags so she knew what she nedded to buy and after that called the delivery guy while she walked back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ordering more food?\" Denvert asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sorry.

You just take a well deserved nap.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki fast fell asleep and dreamed of food. Her stuffed belly slowly started to digest her food adding more and more fat to her body. Nikki's mother surely would get a shock when she found out her daughter was bigger then before. Way, way bigger. Very big.<br>\r\nHer arms were now covered with rolls of fat. Her butt looked like two beach balls and her legs were so fat they had rolls of their own and rubbed to each other while walking. Her belly was huge and hung to over her knees even while standing. It changed into two nice big rolls. Her cheeks were puffy pink and round. Her neck was almost melted to her chest were also some of the fat gathered.<br>\r\nNikki slept with a big grin on her face with little bit still on her belly.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Put her on a diet at five years old is unhealthy for her age. Especially since she is a growing girl. She needs enough food. Besides i heard when those kids if they don't get enough food go out at night to get some and don't get enough sleep and have trouble during the day to stay awake and she needs enough food to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's unhealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On a later age it is. But i'm sure at this age she'll grow into it. Probably she will sport later and lose the weight then. But for now she likes to be fat let her have her fun until she wants to lose weight. You can always put her on a diet later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's mother looked surprised at the teenager that told her slowly it was't so bad if Nikki was fat. She had chosen her words carefully in a good way so it sounded logically and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe i did get a little too far with the diet and do i just let her eat less fatty food. That could help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good start. Well Nikki is upstairs and well we feed her until she was full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki.

Only it looked like her daughter with an exsice balloon the same color as her skin attached to her belly. Nikki grinned happily as she rubbed her BIG little kid tummy as much as she could reach with both her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Mommy. Look, they made me BIG!\u201d she said with happiness and pride in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Linda couldn\u2019t even speek as she looked over the little one. She could only mouth part words as the shock of what happened hit her. Soon though, her shock wore off into full blown anger. She quickly turned around to look over at the teen babysitter and littlerly growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DID YOU DO TO MY DAUGHTER!!!\u201d She shouted at the poor feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina gulped at the very cross woman who looked ready to start beating on the poor girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-well we fed her until she was full, but she never really got full\u2026\u201d Tina stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother just grunted angerly as she now knew whose fault it REALY was. She looked over at her daughter with those angry eyes. Nikki actually shuttered at the look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it Nikki. You\u2019re going on a diet, RIGHT NOW!\u201d Her mother said as went over to get her daughter up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the poor woman was barely able to lift the fat ball of kid out of the bed, blanket and all. She could feel through the blanket her daughter had no pants on and knew she wasn\u2019t going to be able to get them back on this fat little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll return *grunt* the blanket *grunt* later.\u201d She said as she struggled down the stairs and took Nikki home.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

YOU KNOW YOU WERE ON A DIET!\" Linda shouted at her daughter while they drove home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got a bit scared, She and her mother never really had been on one line as it was about how much she ate or how fat she was but her mother seemed more angry then ever before. She tried to curl up to a little ball but her new tummy made that impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on you're on a very strict diet. I thought first too make the diet a bit easier for you... I even thought about it to even cancel it after that teenage girl talked too me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up. So Tina did tried to help her. She hoped anything would work out fine for her and her new friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" ... but seeing what you did. It disgusts me! That girl was on responsible! So now you're on a diet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like a diet.\" She managed too say knowing that her mother would be furious hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T LIKE. DO YOU WANT TOO BE A FAT AND LAZY GIRL THAT WILL BE IMMOBILE ONE DAY?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Why not? I sounds like fu...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki! You're on a diet and that's final. I'm your mother and i decides what's best for you! You need too lose weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now if  i don't want too. What if i want too be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not gonna be fat. I keep you on that diet to start. I'm also put you on an activity group and take you to the gym once or twice a week. If you lost some of the weight we will go to gym once a week and the other day you can take another activity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki started too cry. This was too hard for her. She first heard that food the biggest joy in her life would be taken away from her and she needed to do things she hated most. She was't very active. If she need to be honest she was kind of lazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked at the blanket. Thinking about the kids. She could't really blame them. They were just kids doing a game. But that teenage girl was too blame and Nikki since she knew she would never get full and that she was on a diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know maybe that girl Tanja or Robbie know a nice activity group.\" Hoping that be together with friends would let Nikki wanted to sport. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\nNikki looked surprised at her mother. She thought she never would be allowed to see them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can still visit them?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on i rather have they come too our house. I don't want ever that they feed you again! Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a game. That teenage girl learned us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again her and how did you call that game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The feeder game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother paused for sec. She heard the word feeder before. Then she remembered she once saw a site about men who fattened up their wife's. They were called feeders. She accidentally found this site trying to find a site that would tell her why her daughter had such a big appetite. Did't found any. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that' girl's a feeder.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom i like being fat and i don't want to lose weight. It's not fair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What helping you. make sure you not become fat and unhappy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point! I'm happy! Putting me on a diet or on an activity group makes me unhappy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was doubting for a moment hearing this but fast ignored it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going on a diet and on a activity group and two times a week to the gym with me. That's final! Later you will thank me for this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that.\" Nikki mumbled so soft her mother did't heard it.  </span></div></div>",

You know why don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i know.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sometimes saw it on T.V and liked it too see other fat people who just like her wanted to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. There must be something you like. Foot ball, base ball, basket ball?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then i need to run so much. Besides basket ball. I can't even reach half size the basket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the point too do exercise. Too run. You know what i will even agree with ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would i wanna do that? I hate ballet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i thought maybe you like it now. But what kind of exercise do you want too do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I never thought of that since i hated and kind of exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine i give you time until tomorrow too think of anything or else i will do it for you. You know i need to take that blanket back anyway tomorrow i will ask what kind of exercise Robbie and Tanja do. Does that sounds like fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any way more fun than doing sport with no one i know!\" She said snappish. \"What's for dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did't thought you still got dinner while you ate enough for a whole classroom! Too bed without dinner for you. You can't possibly be hungry. So tomorrow we start with you diet two times too the gym in a week and one time in   a week an activity group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked too her room and crawled in bed and started too cry softly. Tonight she would eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Bram and Linda were eating dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey i don't know. Are't you a little rough with Nikki. Suddenly exercise three times a week with even less food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she does lose enough weight to get a normal weight i might say she doesn't have to diet any more and she can have normal portions and foods for a kid her age.\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"But honey i'm not sure about all those things at once. Just a diet and some exercise fine. But a strict diet and exercise three times a week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was't planning to do that. But when i saw her when i picked her up. How much she gained in one afternoon. Come on. That's not normal. That's enough reason too put her on a strict diet and let her exercise three times a week!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right.

It didn\u2019t matter though; she liked this view better than the view of her room anyway. She slowly rubbed her big belly with her hands under the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. She liked this feeling so much. Why couldn\u2019t everyone just leave her alone about her eating and gaining? Why did being fat have to be such a big deal to everybody? She shivered at the thought of the diet and even made a desgusted face as she thought how bad she\u2019d look skinny. Of course in her mind skinny ment ribs sticking through her loose clothes and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill she knew she had to stop the diet from happening. She thought about sneeking snacks from her house at night so her mom wouldn\u2019t know about it. It seemed like a good plan to her. However, the more and more she thought about it, the more she knew she wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with it for very long before she was found out. It was now clear to her: she knew she couldn\u2019t get food at her house<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo if she couldn\u2019t get food from her house, she had to get her food from somewhere else. She knew where that somewhere else would be too: her new friends. Nikki was sure they\u2019d help her keep her gut extra round and well fed. Soon a plan started to form in her head to get her mom to bring her back over to Robbie\u2019s &amp; Tanja\u2019s place and hopefully see Tina and, even more important to Nikki, Denvert. She grinned knowing how happy they\u2019d be to fill her hungry belly up again.</span></div></div>",

She walked downstairs bare feet still in her pyama's and opened the kitchen door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Nikki!\" Linda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a big garbage bag and Nikki saw she threw a box of cookies in it. Her eyes opened wide when she saw all the good food her mother threw in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I throw away all the bad food so you can't cheat with your diet. Besides it can't hurt if i would lose some pounds too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped on her flat belly. Nikki looked sad at it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy. When you're taking that blanket back... can i come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine you can come but don't eat a thing. If you eat even the smallest piece of food i take you three days in a week too the gym! Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Get dressed then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got to her room and looked for her biggest outfit. But even her biggest clothes could't totally cover her belly after the huge binge yesterday. Only some elastic pants fitted her barely and her belly was hanging over the waist band and her shirt rode up giving a good view how big her belly was.<br>\r\nWhen she was downstairs Her mother sighed seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom do we really need to throw the good food all away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda thought for a second and said: \"We can give it too Tanja, Robbie and little bit if they want. It's of course a waist to throw it all away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Linda got in the car and drove off. They did't talked on the way over. Nikki did't want to talk since she was kind of angry at her mom for putting her on a diet and want to let her exercise and Linda was still angry at Nikki because of her weight and that she eat yesterday while she was on a diet.<br>\r\nThey arrived and Linda rang the bell. Their mother opened the door and looked a bit shocked at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you were angry yesterday. I'm so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we come in?\" Linda asked friendly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. The kids are upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked upstairs while the mother of Tanja, Robbie and Little Bit made some coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry for what happened. I did't knew that they would feed her. They never did that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they're just kids. But that teenager girl was just irresponsible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suddenly got an urgent call and really needed to go and Tina babysit them often and she has never done anything like this too another kid so i don't know why she suddenly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However i'm not happy about what happened but... i don't want to break up friendship and she doesn't have that much friends so i hoped that they could stay friends but i don't want that they feed her any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I talked too them and too Tina. They won't do it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Oh besides since i started that diet i have some food that i dn't want too have in my house anymore. But maybe you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki in the meantime knocked on the door upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" She heard Tanja's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked in. Five faces looked at her and started too smile. Robbie, Tanja, Denvert, Tina and Little Bit who smiled seeing her favorite bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I thought we would never see you again.\" Tanja said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can stay friends but my mom don't want you too ever feed me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that was just so much fun.\" Tina said disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you feed me without my mom finds out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja, Robbie and Devert shook their head. Little Bit had no idea where they were talking about but Tina smiled a bit mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could give you some food. If you come down stairs around 00:00 clock and opens the front door i can give you food. I have enough money too buy all the food you want. Don't worry!\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNikki smiled happy.</span></div></div>",

Even if it was just a few feet, to Den it seemed like lightyears. She just looked so good with all that extra blubber on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina just giggled at their response.

I mean it\u2019s not going to be easy and you\u2019re probably going to have to fib to your parents. I love making you bigger but I don\u2019t want to push you to do something you might really regreat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said with true senerity. Tina did like fatting up this kid but she wanted her gaining to be a happy, fun activity. She didn\u2019t want to see this nice girl get hurt or make her do something this \u201cbig\u201d if she only sort of wanted to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought about it. The truth was the girl had been thinking about it all day and all last night. She knew clearly what she wanted to do. She looked up at Tina with eyes equally senser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI like being fat. I like eating and I wanna being fed.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grinned as they heard this.

But she put some shoes on and it was't that cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all got together in the hall. Tina had a big bag and opened it. It was filled with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't stuff you so much if last time since your parents would notice that for sure. But we can feed you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just feed me. I'm almost starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find that hard to believe!\" Tanja said while she ripped open the box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one she pushed the cookies in the mouth of the young feedee. Denvert looked jealous but he saw that Tanja also had a smile on her face. He wanted to feed Nikki but there was no reason why he would't let Tanja feed her if she liked it too. <br>\r\nWhen the cookies were gone Nikki looked very happy. <br>\r\nDenvert saw his chance and ripped open the first bag of chips and started to stuff the little girls face. Nikki worked pretty well with him and opened her mouth wide every time. The bag was empty to fast for Denvert.<br>\r\nTina already noticed how much this boy liked Nikki. She had a gift too know what kids wanted. She decided to let Denvert feed Nikki some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would you like to eat now my plump princess?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled with this new nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really thirsty right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina expected that and pulled out a bottle of coke and Denvert unscrewed to cap of it and turned the bottle upside down in Nikki's mouth. The cola was poured so fast in Nikki's throat she almost choke but fast she swallowed it and Denvert stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine! Feed me more! More! More!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina reached in the bag and handed Tanja and denvert a cake. Both broke of lumps and pushed it in the mouth of the young girl. Nikki loved it and so did the two kids. The upper part of Nikki's pj's was started to rode up but no one cared.<br>\r\nTina the took out a pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina you're the best.\" Nikki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" She said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert careful shove the pie in Nikki's mouth. He almost lost his fingers so fast was Nikki chewing.<br>\r\nThen Tina reached deep in her bag and pulled out...<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She couldn\u2019t wait to be fed by all three of them at once. She could tell the other\u2019s were just as happy to feed her as she watched them hurriedly unwrap the candies that needed to be unwrapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina grinned slyly as she was about to put her latest \u201cgame\u201d into motion. She slowly walked over to Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow open your mouth REALLY wide\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said showing her how big she wanted Nikki to do it with her own mouth.

She smiled proudly and nodded as she pushed out her tummy a bit. The others soon came over to get a good feel. Denvert seemed to do the most though, followed by Tina, Then Tanja. They really wanting to get a good feel of how fat she was. Nikki really enjoyed all the attention her fat tummy was getting. Especially from Denvert, loving her young crush\u2019s touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Tina pulled back and grabbed the bag infornt of her and opened it so it was large enough for everyone to get their hands inside it. The others quickly came over, not wanting to miss any of the game, and Nikki quickly opened her mouth expectantly.

I would already have thrown up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still hungry. Do you have more?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry Nikki but this is all the food i had for you. Today that is.

You should know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. Why am i supposed to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're a girl. My big sister and her friends are always focused about their weight and notice if the gain the smallest amount of weight. So i guess girls know if someone gained.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that your sister and friend wanted to look like toothpicks doen't want too say any girl want. Right Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet. I don't want to look like a toothpick. I want to be the fattest girl that ever lived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it will take some time until we're there.\" Tina said. It's better you three go back too bed. Oh and try to go too bed earlier. If i continue doing this you three will get so exhausted you can't keep your eyes open.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.

Not that is was bad to be big or anything, it was just getting hard to do things, simple things and that was becoming less fun to try to deal with as a young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly the cheers died down as a bag of chips was open from the back of the group, unseen from the triumphant, and much smaller Nikki.  Nikki knew exactly what kind of chips it was from the opening of that bad, due to her little fat girl senses, and it sparked something in her something she thought she left back in the gym with all that belly fat she used to support.  She felt her mouth salivate a bit hoping that she could devour that bag and maybe two or three more, then if she is lucky two big whooper meals and a quart sized super deluxe sundae milkshake from Spoons, the local ice creamery.  she soon shook her self out of her small trance while she was trying so hard to keep to her diet and become a much more normal sized girl.  That is when little plump Kimberly stepped up to Nikki shoving her slowly forming sausage fingers into the bag and shoving big handfuls of 'Papa Browns all natural kettle cooked potato chips' into her yearning maw.  Kimberly, or Kim by her friend's accounts, was not much shorter then Nikki ad their ages were close enough, Kim being only a half year younger then her now much smaller friend; but though a few weeks ago Kim was skinny by comparison, she was now the little cute fatty of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, I don't mind that you wanted to be smaller, and you do look great,\" she took another hand full and downed it before continuing  \"With you being small, does that mean I'm the group fat girl?\" she asked sincerely with a small greasy smile showing off her cute little braces as she took her hand and pushed up her round frame glasses swaying her hips gently causing her dress to swish back and forth a bit.  Nikki looked at little Kim with gently happy and accepting eyes as she put her hand on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as much as I wish that was how groups work,\" she paused to attempt to frame her next words properly \"We don't have set 'rolls' so there is not just one person that can be fat.\" Nikki's smile got bigger with the finishing of her statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but; you were the biggest, now you are not,\" She placed her currently free hand on the large spherical shape that sat round and tight under her soft dress \"so does that mean I'm the new fat on?\" she finished her question with a huge smile and a soft few circular rubs of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...What will Nikki answer?...</span></div></div>",

She could tell the little one was being completely serious about what she was saying. As a mother she just knew when her daughter was in true distress and this was one of those times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought about it hard. She knew how much her daught loved her food. At first she actually thought it was cute to see her piggily eating away. However, as more and more time went on, she began to get concerned as Nikki kept getting rounder and rounder. She had thought her being so fat was probably making her feel miserable and felt that the un-ending hunger her little one felt was probably unbearably painfull for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowerver, she could clearly see that wasn\u2019t the case. She thought back to how happy Nikki looked when she was stuffing her face. She then remembered how contened and pleased she had looked as she would rub her tummy or explore her own fat. She hadn\u2019t thought too much of it at the time, but now could see it was Nikki loving her growing young body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, she knew being this large wasn\u2019t very good for her. I mean, being fat no matter what is always bad, right? At least that\u2019s what she had heard from the TV and magazines. Still, she thought that Nikki being this upset musn\u2019t be good for her either. It was then she remembered the doctor\u2019s appointment that started all of this. The doctor had told her Nikki was healthy, even if she was a big little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked back at her daughter and sighed a bit. She was beginning to snap<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Nikki. We won\u2019t go to the gym today\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was planning on finishing her sentence, however was cut off from the cheer her pudgy daughter let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026However, I want to get a second opinion about your health. I\u2019m going to make an appointment to see another doctor.\u201d Linda finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch less cheering came from her daughter this time. Nikki wasn\u2019t so fond of this idea, especially after what happened the last time. Still, she didn\u2019t have to go to the gym. She looked back at her mom and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda grinned, happy to see her daughter not crying anymore. She was beginning to think she made the right decision. She then picked up the phone and dialed the number of another pediatrion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello, Dr\u2026Feedar. I\u2019d like to make an appointment for my daughter. When do you think you fit us in?\u201d She asked as Nikki watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the fat little girl heard her mother repeat the doctor\u2019s words, which were...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I wanted to know what she thinks about your health. You're too heavy for your age but... well you don't seem to be unhealthy. Maybe a bit lazy, and fast out of breath but not really unhealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... i'm not on a diet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I first wanna know what this doctor says.

I call the diet off but that does't wanna say i let eat you everything you want. More like just before the picnic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki  thought about it. It was't that bad. She could eat a lot of good food. Not as much if she would like but i was better then a diet. way better. But then another though planted himself in the head of the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B... but what... if he thinks i'm unhealthy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's really the case then i think we still need need to do some activity and dieting. But i guess i could make the diet a bit easier for you and maybe we don't have too exercise three times a week. But if you're really unhealthy... you must understand Nikki you could die or be in a lot of pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled her shirt as far down if she could. She was a bit scared. But maybe this would be all right. She decided to stay calm until the doctor told her if she was healthy or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh besides Nikki... it's not a he but a she. The doctor is a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki put on big eyes. She'd never been to a female doctor. For some reason she felt a lot calmer when she heard this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little later they arrived. The clothes Nikki wore were way too tight on her thanks to her huge binge the day before yesterday and last nights feeding but they hold. <br>\r\nThe doctor happily invited them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You called just at the right time. Another patient just called she could't come. So i had a free spot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked curious at the doctor. She had blond hair and had fire red lipstick. She seemed very nice and was a bit chubby. Most people Nikki met put on a strange look when they saw her. But this woman seemed even pleased seeing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you see doctor she's hungry all the time and if i would let her she would eat non stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she seems healthy but i'm no doctor. Could you give her a checkup?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course miss.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Nikki and measured her and weighed her and seemed pleased with the result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say miss she seems perfectly fine. She's a bit heavy but i would't worry about it. It's those damn T.V shows an magazines and all models in it that are skinny. Believe me Nikki. No real person can look like that without having anorexia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's healthy? I don't have to worry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. But if you think something's wrong you can always ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked outside Nikki looked at her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can i please have some fries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess you deserved that after yesterday.

But if a doctor says anything health related, it must be true\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So - just so we're on the same page - you're not going to force me to exercise or go on a diet\", Nikki asked, just to be 100% sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The worst I'll do is probably limit how much you eat\", said Linda, \"And maybe what you eat, but I won't go far with that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you\", Nikki sighed. She patted her belly. Her belly gurgled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hungry Nikki?\", Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki almost missed it. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to eat?\", Linda asked, \"I'll get you anything no matter what. It's the least I can do after putting you through such anguish and worry. Tell me what you want and I'll get it for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was so shocked she was still trying to get over the fact that her mom was actually OFFERING to get her food. Especially after before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's face showed complete happiness as she thought of what to eat.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki was stuffing her face in complete bliss, complete happiness, and for good reason. She is eating her favorite kind of food, and her mother is ok with it for once. She was in her own little world now. The only thing she seemed to know were hunger, a desire to get fatter than she already was, and the fact that food was in front of her. Fairly fatty food, and quite a lot of it for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was right about worrying about Nikki's shirt. And when she finished her fries and about half of the croquettes, it looked like it was strangling her body. When Nikki finished her croquettes and just barely started on her hot-dogs, she caused mild embarrassment to her mother. She ate a hot-dog, and the sound of about 3 sheets of construction paper being violently ripped if half sounded. A few other customers in the resturant looked around for what could have caused the noise. All of their eyes stopped on the fat butterball of a five year old, Nikki. Nikki looked back at everyone, then looked at herself. She looked at her belly in shock. It was uncovered, visible for all to see. Nikki smiled, proud that she had ripped a shirt, for the first time ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked completely embarrassed. She picked up all the trash and threw it in a trash can, came back to the table, and picked up the rest of Nikki's food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on\", said Linda, \"You can eat on the way home\". She walked fast outside of the resturant and into her car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got out of her seat, trying to not stop eating for anything. She followed her mother outside to the car, her fat belly making small jiggles in between steps, and big jiggles on steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat down in the car and closed the door. She lowered the chair so she can lay flat on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here\", Linda said, setting the food she took on Nikki's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks mom\", Nikki said, patting her belly. A hot dog fell off her belly, but it was still in its wrapper, luckily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really didn't see that coming\", said Linda, pulling out of the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I\", said Nikki, mouth of hotdog. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chew and swallow before you talk\", said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki finished chewing and swallowed. \"I didn't see it coming neither. I'm still suprised I did that, ripping out of a shirt\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the first time ever\", said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Nikki exclaimed, \"I feel so proud of myself\". She shoved a croquette in her mouth and chewed and swallowed it seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we need to get you new clothes too\", said Linda, \"I don't think those pan-\". She was cut off by the button on Nikki's pants popping off and hitting the ceiling. It fell back down after a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled wide. On top of ripping a shirt, she popped a button too. It felt good that her belly was basically free now. She ate the last croquette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly\", said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where are we going?\", Nikki asked, unwrapping a hotdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home\", said Linda, \"I know you probably like your belly being uncovered, but I'm not walking into a store with you looking this way, especially after what just happened\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\", said Nikki, after swallowing the hotdog. She picked up the one that fell and unwrapped it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I think we're gonna have some trouble\", said Linda, \"I'm fine with a shirt riding up a bit, it's pants I'm worried about. All of your pants are the same size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying?\", Nikki asked. She ate some of the hotdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm saying that we might not have any pants at home that fit you anymore\", said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived home. Nikki finished her last hotdog and licked her fingers. She rubbed her belly in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, let's get you some clothes that barely fit so we can get clothes that do fit\", said Linda.</span></div></div>",

Linda had looked pretty sure about that diet and now she called it of. He was surprised why. He and Linda mostly agreed on anything but Linda wore the pants around the house. Bram had no problem with that since Linda was't acting bossy or something and Linda did listen too him if he had something too say. Even if it was against something she wanted.<br>\r\nHe slowly tapped her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... calling the diet off. But why may i ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she said i did't loved her like she was and i only loved her skinny and i was shocked cause it maybe was a bit true. She likes it to be fat and don't want to lose weight or be thin. Besides it's gonna be hard to force her if she don't want too. But i took her to another doctor today and she said Nikki was perfectly healthy. If she really is healthy and don't want to lose weight or be thin we just have to... accept it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she can eat again what she want. Like before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. I might take a bit more care about how much or what she eats but i don't think putting her on a diet will help. But her clothes ripped so we need to buy new ones for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked into Nikki's room. On her bed was a big pile of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes i don't fit anymore.\" Nikki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe only wore underwear and socks and tried on all her old clothes. most shirts did't even came near her belly button and until now she did't found one pants that would button. She did however find a shirt that covered most of Nikki's belly but she still did't find any pants that would fit Nikki and she could't take Nikki with her in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where can i find clothes?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe by M.K.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\" Her mother asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.K. You know. Mary-Kate. The girl next door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Mary-Kate is a toothpick girl compared too you sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked up. It could work. Use one oh her or Bram's old ones. She would maybe even fit her. Of course after turning the pipes a few times. Even if the were a bit wide they could still use a belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nikki go downstairs i'll look for some pants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked down and suddenly remembered she need to call Tanja that they could stop the midnight feeding. She dialed their number. Someone picked up but she did't hear anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Hello this is Nikki. Who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a sucking noise like someone sucking on a pacifier and then she knew who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi little bit. I wanna talk too Tanja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later Tanja took over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(yawn) This is Tanja.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tanja with Nikki.\" Good news. I'm not on a diet any more and i don't have too do sports.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Does that mean we can stop feeding you at midnight? (yawn) I really liked it but i'm now very tired.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I guess so. But now we can do this games during the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Oh sorry. Gotta hang up. My aunt, uncle and cousins pay me a visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Can you tell Tina and Denvert? I don't have their number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Bye now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hung up. <br>\r\nA few minutes later Linda walked in. She had some elastic pants she wore before she was pregnant from Nikki. She turned the pipes a few times so they would suit Nikki and they did. The elastic pants stretched nice around her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.

He knew Linda could go over board with things like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026besides, it might not be such a bad thing if she feeds Nikki a bit.\u201d The man said as he took a bite of the extremely good pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!? How can you  say that? Even if she isn\u2019t on a diet, she\u2019s still pretty heavy.\u201d Linda replied very confused as to her husband\u2019s suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it\u2019s our bills. Here take a look\u2026\u201d He said as he handed her the numbers he worked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda took a moment before her eyes widened a bit. The rising cost of food, plus the rising tummy of Nikki were causing the family to spend quite a bit on food. Even if the little one was put on a diet, it still would have been pretty high.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d She said starting to consider the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo drive the point home, Linda reached over to get another small piece of pie for herself. Only, she found an empty tray. She looked over at her husband to see his plate still held part of his first piece. The mother frowned as she looked over to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat there with a happy grin on her face. That wasn\u2019t the only thing that was on her face though. She was also able to see a nice beard of pie covering her face and hands and even a bit on her larger kid belly where Nikki had rubbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed a bit. She knew she couldn\u2019t stop her kid from eating so much, maybe she should just let Tina feed her\u2026with a few ground rules of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Behind him she saw a small blond figure and a tall blond woman.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just around... and i thought we could pay a visit... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's no problem of course.\" His mother said. \"He told me they had much fun yesterday. I don't know what they did exactly but he really liked her so i thought we could meet you. If it's not a problem of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. The pie is just gone but i think we still have some cookies. Would you like some coffee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert you can play with Nikki, and watch out for Nicole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Denvert a small chubby girl with blond hair looked up. She must be about three or four years old. She waved and smiled friendly. Denvert rolled with his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna come too my room?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure why not. Come with me Nicole.\" He grabbed his sister tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you hurt her this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be. But the last time i did't hold her she ran away and we looked for about five hours and finally found her in the washing machine. Besides your house is pretty big. How many places can she hide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she girlfriend?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of your business!\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My room.\" Nikki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids walked in. Nicole still looked curious at Nikki. Suddenly she stuck out her tiny hand and pushed in Nikki's deep belly. Almost her entire hand got lost in Nikki's fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fat.\" Nicole said excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole! You can't just say that too anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert i don't mind! I'm fat and i like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But if she thinks it's fine with you she thinks it's fine with every one and some people don't like that. Besides i heard you mother took you of the diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I can again eat most things. I gonna become even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gonna become fun. I will help you.Tina will help also and i think Tanja too. Except not feeding you so late anymore!

He was so happy when his mom agreed to bring him over. He really wanted to see his young girlfriend again. However, he was so sad that his little sis was tagging along. He loved her and was usually pretty nice to her, but was still a bit mad that his \u201cdate\u201d was spoiled by chubby toddler being here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole raisedher hands, showing off her flabby pot belly to Nikki as she yelled out \u201cYaaay!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned at her, happy to have yet another feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, but not just yet or my mommy will find out.\u201d She told them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert nodded in understanding as he looked around the room. He was happy to see from the toys and posters and such that he and Nikki liked a lot of the same stuff he did. He looked over and found a few dolls (something he wasn\u2019t into) and handed them to Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere Nicole, go play with these.\u201d He said to her, wanting Nikki all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little one nodded and started to happily play with the dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDen grinned, happy to see his sister was now so occupied. He looked over at Nikki who was stairing at the boy with a happy look on her face. She blushed a bit as she was \u201ccaught\u201d which only made her look cuter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled and went over to the bed and sat down next her. He could feel her belly against his own chubby tummy and grinned at how good it felt. He slowly moved his hand over to the large exposed tummy and began to rub it. This caused Nikki to let out a happy little \u201cMur\u201d of delight. She loved how his hands felt on her big stuffed tummy and Denvert felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Nikki leaned over a bit, which caused her big belly to spill even more onto Denverts plump boy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat feels so good, Denvert.\u201d She said happily at his touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot bigger since yesterday.\u201d He replied blushing, but still happy to be feeling her flabby middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled and replied \u201cYep, I\u2019ve eatan a lotta food\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned over, seeing how happy Dnvert looked as she said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026I just ate a WHOLE pie before you cam over.\u201d She said a bit teasingly as she slapped her tummy proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert almost froze as he heard those words. He was so in love with this little one was really enjoying hearing how big of pig the little fat girl was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly began to rub her belly again but was stopped as his lips received a quick kiss. He blushed a bit more as Nikki let out a giggle at how cute he looked. He wasn\u2019t about to let her kindness be circumvented and leaned over to kiss her back, holding it a bit longer this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then though they were interrupted as\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Do you gonna get babies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert and Nikki were a bit surprised by this question. Both of them just started the relation. They only kissed each other and cuddled up together and he rubbing her belly but both of them were't sure how this relation would continue. They both knew it would take a lot of years before they would get children, if there would be children at all, but thinking about this they knew that this relation could continue until they were all grown up and Nikki and Denvert both wondered how fat Nikki would be then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we do that it's gonna be over a loooong time.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long? Two months?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More about when we're at the age of mommy and daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole tried to count at her fingers and mumbled: \"That's long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert wanted to strangle his little sister.

From now on everything would be fine. She could hang out with her boyfriend Denvert and also with Tanja and Robbie and Tina would be her new babysitter.

She did't want to push her mother over the edge now most things were going so well. <br>\r\nShe patted her round belly and rubbed it but it did't felt so good as when Denvert did it. She tried to bend for over enough to lick her belly but found out that was impossible.

Sure it wasn\u2019t as good as when Denvert played with her tummy, but it still felt nice to have some attention going to the ever hungry dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed a bit as she thought about her boyfriend. She couldn\u2019t wait to see him again. She was so happy he stopped by and was even more thrilled at how good it felt when he played with her tummy. She had to get together with him again and soon. Hopefully with a feeding this time as well as some more \u201cbelly play\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was also someone else in her thoughts too. She was a bit taken with Nicole as well. She had to admit, she thought she looked extra cute being so large at such a young age. Sure she wasn\u2019t as big as Nikki, but she was a pretty chunky. She wondered just how much that little plumper could eat\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were cut short as her mom called her to dinner. Nikki didn\u2019t need to be told twice and got up as fast as she could, which wasn\u2019t very fast with such a big belly. It sloshed forward and jiggled a bit as it bumped against her knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned as she waddled fairly fast into the kitchen, her massive belly sloshing about as she moved. She grinned as she seen the nice fattening meal of burgers and fries set out for the family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly took her seat and instantly began to dig in. She grabbed massive fistfuls of fries and shoveled them into her face. It didn\u2019t take her all that long to demolish the large helping of the greasy fries her mom had given her. With out missing a beat, she began to gobble down the burger in massive bitefulls. She only paused to let out a \u201cMmmm\u201d from the taste and a cute little burp, before licking her fingers clean from the ketchup and mayonies that had dripped on to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore please mommy.\u201d She said cutely, burping the word \u201cMore\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s mom didn\u2019t look so pleased at this sight. She was hoping that the plateful would have been enough for her, but wasn\u2019t so surprised when it wasn\u2019t. She sighed and filled up her plate again, this time giving her two burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mom was doing that, Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMommy, can I go over to see Denvert and Nicole tomorrow?\u201d She asked very sweatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused her mom her mother\u2019s mood to pick up a bit. She was happy that her tubby pre-school daughter wanted to spend time with the \u201csporty\u201d chubby boy. Of course, if she had known just what the boy wanted to do with her daughter she might have had second thoughts about sending her to see him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure we can Nikki.\u201d She said as she set the heaping plate infront of Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we have to make sure it\u2019s alright with Denverts mom, Okay?\u201d She said expecting her daughter\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Nikki was too hungry to care about her mother\u2019s words.

Nikki had a big breakfast and she hoped that Nikki would't eat too much at Denvert's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you like Denvert. I heard he does't have many friends around here yet. Except from Robbie, Tanja and you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Nikki asked wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They just moved two weeks ago. Denvert is new and... well  it takes some time to make new friends when you're the new kid. I'm so glad you have a new friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped for a big house. Her mother whistled. There was a yard around the house as big if a football field and behind that a small forest and she even saw a swimming pool in a corner of the yard with a fence around it. There were't many house around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's nice. When it's warmer weather you might swim here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki waved around on her legs. She did like swimming. Swimming in the water made her body less heavier. They walked too the front door and she rang the bell. Denvert's mother opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come inside. Do you want some tea or coffee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure why not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert is in that room.\" She said and pointed to a door. \"Careful he his dad and a friend of his dad are training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the door. Behind it was a training room. The floor was soft. She guessed for when someone fell. Am long man with short hair the same color like Denvert walked over to her. He, Denvert and the other man wore some kind of wide white robs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert train some with him.\" `he pointed to the other man. \"You must be Nikki. I heard much about you. Hmm he was right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well... just that you were a bit... eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat right. Say it i don't mind. I love the fact i'm fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Denvert kicked the friend of his father too the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert!\" His father said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice kick. Some time and you're even better then i am. Now better go. You girlfriend is here. Never keep a girl waiting.\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not. Let's go to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked upstairs she saw a door opened a bit and a small figure looked at her and after that fast closed the door. The next moment Denvert pulled her into his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister Nicole.\" He said while he nodded to the the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked around. The room was pretty big for a toddler. He had a bunk beds and a big desk with chair and a computer. A lot of toys were in the room. She also saw a radio, CD player and tape player in one. The most music seemed to be from Disney movies but she also saw a CD from Weird All Yankovich. There were posters from Disney and cartoon figures on the wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice room you have.\" She said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  He pulled some pants and a sweater. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned around so he could get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean. Good i guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she i also pretty chunky. I wonder how much she can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you right. A bit more then a normal kid her age. Not even near how much you can eat but yeah she has an healthy appetite.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was happy to not only hear that Nicole loved to eat, but also that she was the biggest eater between the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she sneakily turned around to see if it was okay for her too look at Denvert again. She was close, but off. The boy had his pants on, but his shirt was still off. The little girl could clealy see from his plump boy belly that Nicole wasn\u2019t the only one who food enjoyed her. Sure he was the skinniest out of the 3, but was not the smallest child. His belly stuck out a good 2-3 inches over his pants and looked pretty soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Denvert noticed Nikki stairing at him. He blushed and quickly covered his plump tummy with his arms. However, he slowly moved them away. For some reason that was beyond him, he actually didn\u2019t mind Nikki looking at him like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki too blushed at him. However, she didn\u2019t look away. She didn\u2019t know why, but she couldn\u2019t take her eyes off her young boyfriend\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I thought you had your shirt on\u2026\u201d She said extremely embaressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to bring Den back a bit. He kept up his blushing though as he replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I-I don\u2019t mind\u2026\u201d He said as he quickly put on his sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cS-so what do you wanna do?\u201d He asked, already knowing what her answer was, but trying to relieve both their embaresment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned and was about to reply, however her big belly spoke up for her. The large dome let out a massive grumble for food. She grinned a bit and gave the big little girl belly a soothing rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have something to eat?\u201d She asked happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned even more, now a bit more slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026.and could you\u2026feed me and\u2026maybe\u2026rub my tummy?\u201d she asked a bit lower than before, making sure no one else could hear them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert grinned at this. He was always happy to accomidate her in these areas. He nodded back at Nikki with a grin of a child that was about to do his favorite thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure. Now what would you like to eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You should be happy you have me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would't call it happy!\" He said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone is a bit grumpy.\" She said on a teasing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids went into the kitchen. No one was there.

Here and now shut up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked further in and pulled out two big bags of chips. A big piece of chocolate and three rolls of cookies. He then walked to the refrigerator and opened it and pulled out a pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two gonna eat all that?\" Nicole asked wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No this is only for her alone.\" Denvert answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she eat all that? On her own?\" Nicole asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and much more. I've seen her do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i watch? Come on. I wanna see if she can eat that all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Nikki. Wanted too know her opinion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now that she can watch if she helps to feed me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... that's not a bad idea. So you can watch but you have to help me feed her. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But i'm not sure she can eat all that.\" Nicole said while she carried the three rolls of cookies up too Denverts room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pulled of her shoes and went sitting on bed and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right keep it coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert ripped open the first bag of chips and pushed a hand full of chips in her mouth. Nikki chewed a few times and swallowed it all. Nicole ripped open her bag and also pushed a hand full in Nikki's mouth. <br>\r\nFor one time Denvert liked it to work with his sister like this.<br>\r\nThe two bags of chips were gone pretty fast. Nicole looked at Nikki like she was a goddess. She fast grabbed the roll of cookies and started to plop them in her mouth one by one. Denver fast grabbed another roll of cookies and he and Nicole fed Nikki cookies. First Nicole, then Denvert an then Nicole again.  <br>\r\nAfter that Nicole picked up the piece of chocolate. Denvert hit it a few times on the edge of the bed too break it in pieces. Nicole moved her piece over too Nikki and Nikki's power full jaws bit off a piece. Denvert noticed this and also pushed the chocolate in her mouth until Nikki closed her jaws.<br>\r\nWhen the last piece of chocolate went past her lips Nicole took the pie. As soon as Nikki opened her mouth Nicole let the first piece of pie slide in. After that Denvert let a piece slide in. Soon the entire pie was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I can't believe how fast you could eat all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Denvert asked   </span></div></div>",

Her fat tummy was almost two inches more round from the few minutes of eating she had done. She was also pleased that she had not one, but two feeders helping to make her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over happily at Denvert and her newest recrute, Nicole. However, it wasn\u2019t Denvert she noticed this time, it was little Nicole. The little pre-school plumper was looking over Nikki\u2019s body in the same way Tanja had when she was feeding Nikki. Not only that, but Nikki could see the want to be fed just like Nikki in the little toddler\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned as she moved forward a bit, her big belly sloshing around as she did, and made sure her fatty tummy was only a few inches away from little Nicole\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like how big my tummy is Nicole?\u201d She asked her sweatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little chubby child\u2019s \u201ctrance of joy\u201d expression didn\u2019t change. She just nodded her head at her in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki couldn\u2019t help but giggle at how the little chunker was acting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like it if me and Den fed you, like you did with me?\u201d She asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Nicole\u2019s expression did change. It went to absolute joy at the idea Nikki put forth. She grinned from ear to ear as she replied,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, you mean it!?!\u201d She almost shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked back at both Nikki and Devnert expectantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki seemed pretty pleased with the idea. She still wanted to be the fattest kid around, but also wanted to see Nicole get bigger, especially if she wanted to this badly. However, she could tell that her brother was less than thrilled with the idea. She could see in his face he did like the idea of her growing bigger, but knew he was still very mad about her \u201cruining\u201d their feeding session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki loved Denvert, but truth be told, she wasn\u2019t thrilled with how he treated his little sister. She hoped that maybe including Nicole in their feedings (well some of their feedings. She still wanted some of their time to be alone with her boyfriend), it might help him ease his anger with his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned back as she said\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But first you feed me right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert lifted his shoulders. He did't really want to feed his sister. He liked Nikki and also liked it to feed her and he also liked her fat and her big belly. He liked it if Nikki would be even fatter but that did't mend he also wanted his sister fatter. <br>\r\nBut at the other hand Nicole promised she would leave them alone. She still had no and then her nap and after the feeding she would probably be tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. Let's get some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three toddlers waddled back to the kitchen. Denvert opened the cupboard and looked in. He threw out two bars of chocolate. Later he also threw out a bag of dorrito's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh those are my favorite taste.\" Nicole said hugging the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked further while Nicole walked over to the freezer and opened it an took out a box of ice cream. Denvert found another box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you eat all that?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's belly rumbled and she said: \"Maybe. I'm kind of hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was up all morning watching cartoons and missed breakfast.\" Denvert mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? I like cartoons. You also watch some of those cartoons!\" Nicole yelled while the three took all the food upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we feed you in your room Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's room was really a little girls room. The walls were light pink. She had a small desk next to a red sofa filled with stuffed animals on the other wall a big collection of barbie dolls and stuff like kitchen set, car and other stuff. To another wall was a big bookcase only half filled with books for toddles and babies. Just like Denvert she also had a small tape and CD player in one. She had some posters from kids series like strawberry shortcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Now go lying on your bed and open...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait one sec i need to get something from your room. Back in a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran out as fast in her chubby legs could carry her and returned a few seconds later wit a CD from Weird All Yankovich. She put it in her CD player and turned it on and went on her bed and opened her mouth. <br>\r\nNikki first heard some gong noises then the music started while she unwrapped the chocolate bars. Then the text started. Nikki started to feed Nicole the chocolate and listened to the music and understand why Nicole liked the music so much.<br>\r\nNikki slowly sang a bit with the music. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it. Just eat it! Eat it! Just eat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole liked this very much it was clearly to see while she fast worked down the chocolate bars. <br>\r\nNikki then opened the bag of doritto's and pushed them with hand full in the tiny mouth of Nicole. Denvert decided too help. He liked the song and must admit i was perfect with what they were doing and also filled Nicole's mouth with the food. Nicole proofed she was a fast eater. The dorrito's were gone in record time. She felt a bit full but did't said it. While her brother and Nikki pushed cookies in her mouth one by one. Nicole just chewed and swallowed.<br>\r\nWhen the cookies were gone Nicole remembered that there was still a box of ice cream. She heard Denvert going downstairs and Nikki looking again for the song. Denvert returned with some spoons and the both started to scoop the ice cream in her mouth. Nicole felt full but kept eating. She knew they would probably stop if she said she was full but she wanted to finish it. She wanted to become a fat girl. Just like Nikki. She admired Nikki and wanted to become just like her finally she swallowed the last spoon full of ice cream and felt like she would pop. The next moment she fell asleep to digest her food.  <br>\r\nNikki turned of the CD player and walked with Denvert to his room.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Well i did't know she could eat that much!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"She's a real gainer. Tina should see her once. I don't know why you don't like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she's fine for some time.

She nodded her head at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, I\u2019m always hungry.\u201d She replied playfully as she gave her belly a slap for his benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert just staired at the big dome as it shook back and forth. He was almost drooling at the sight of so much pretty little toddler blubber. He almost moved over to start playing with her already bloated kid tummy. The only thing that was able to keep him from doing so was making her big belly even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took Nikki by the hand, something she enjoyed, and led the little one down the stairs to the kitchen. After checking to make sure the cost was clear, he began to load up with the last of the house\u2019s snack foods. Handing her a bag of popcorn, a few more king sized chocolate bars, and an entire pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki herself was drooling as she was led back up to Denvert\u2019s room by the egar boy. She waddled as quickly as she could up to the bed and laid back down like Nicole had earlier. She simply opened her mouth and waited for the first of the candy stash to be fed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few seconds, she tasted a sweet choclate bar enter her mouth. She almost sucked it down whole as she piggily took in the coco treat in in a few seconds flat. She let out a nice big burp and simply said \u201cMore\u201d to her pre-school feeder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t disappointed either as Denvert began to feed her the second tasty bar of chocolate. This one went down slightly slower as Nikki wanted to taste it a bit more. Of course her feeding didn\u2019t stop there as the instant she swallowed down the choclate bar, she ws greated with even better tasting apple pie. She gobbled that down in only a minute or so, her face being covered in sticky apple goodness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Nikki\u2019s belly was massive. Both \u201csmall snacks\u201d had caused her big toddler tummy to push out a good 2 feet from her pudgy body. However, both Denvert and Nikki wanted it bigger. He ripped open the pre-popped bag of pop corn and began to poor it into the chunky young poker\u2019s mouth. Nikki just happily \u201cdrank\u201d it down, feeling her belly slowly pushing out forward with every second she greedily ate down the massive feast of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo soon, the flow ended. Nikki grinned ear to ear from her stuffing and let out a nice big loud belch, happy to have her hungry kid tummy so fat and full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an amazing feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nikki?\" He slowly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i lay on your belly?\" He asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can.\" She said happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert got up and crawled on the big ball of blubber that was Nikki's tummy. He slowly sank a bit in her fat and he loved the feeling and so did Nikki. It felt so soft and warm. Nikki slowly closed her eyes and so did Denvert and both fell asleep<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two doing?\" Nicole asked waking the two up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole. You promised to leave us alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Two hours ago! Besides mom send me over here too call you two. It's lunchtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two hours. Did we sleep that long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the best two hours sleep of my entire life. Denvert thought to himself but he did't said it loud. Afraid what the two girls might think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch sounds good.\" Nikki said. \"I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really always hungry. Did you really never felt full?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds terrible.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine i'm used too it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how it's like to be when you would be a princess and people will feed you until you're full.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Denvert can join me at the table then. Together with Robbie, Tanja, little bit and Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Tina finds it more fun to feed you then be fed herself. Me too. I'm not sure about Tanja. She's not a real big eater but i think she likes it too until she's full. Maybe she wants to be a bit fatter. I think Robbie also loves it more to feed you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I they do, they may do that as long if they like. That's what the princess demands.\" Nikki said and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids walked in the kitchen.<br>\r\nThe mother of Denvert and Nicole was sitting at the table. Next to her was a very fat old woman.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Grandma!\" Nicole yelled and ran at the fat woman and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello grandma. This is my girlfriend Nikki.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really and what a beautiful girls she is i can see that!\" Their grandmother said. \"Come closer please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked interested at Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice young girl you are. It seems like you have a good appetite. I appreciate girls who don't care about their weight.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does care about her weight.\" Nicole said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she wants to gain weight instead of losing it.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A great. I wish there were more girls like you.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki blushed.</span></div></div>",

She knew most adults she ran into weren\u2019t very accepting of her gaining weight, especially if they knew she was trying to get a bigger belly on purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that wasn\u2019t the only thing she was blushing about. This was the first time Denvert had called her his girlfriend in front of anyone else. She was more than happy to hear this, but didn\u2019t know how everyone would react to it. Fortiently, it seemed they were taking it okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandmother grinned at the three kids. She was happy to see her grandson was interested in a girl who wasn\u2019t a stick thin anorex like most of the models she had seen. She wasn\u2019t a gainer, or a \u201cfeeder\u201d for that matter. She just held the belief, like many from her generation, that kids needed to eat as much as they could to grow up big and strong. She knew just the way to do it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the three and \u201chmmmmmed\u201d at them for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow would you kids like to go out for a very special lunch with your grandma?\u201d she asked them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three looked excited. Like most kids their age, they loved going out to eat. Of course the one more excited out of anyone was Nikki. She couldn\u2019t wait to fill her fat little girl gut up with even more food, despite all she had eaten just a few short hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe older woman giggled a bit at their responses. Seeing their looks of joy was always fun for her. She loved spoiling her grandkids aand oftened gave them everything they wanted when she was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, well go out to eat\u2026\u201d she said looking over at Denvert and Nichole\u2019s mom to make sure she wasn\u2019t overstepping her bounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother gave her a look that it was okay as she looked through the pantry, puzzeled as to where all the food had gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children cried out a \u201cyay!\u201d and ran over to get their shoes and jackets on, all three plump tummies jiggling as they did so. Their grandmother giggled again at this as she followed after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are we going to eat grandma?\u201d Nichole ask as she put on her shoes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a new big buffet that just opened with lots of food for growing kids.\u201d She said patting Nikki\u2019s head as she led them out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your Denvert's girlfriend. Fine to hear he finally has one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like her too!\" Nicole said happy. \"You won't believe how much she can eat grandma! She can eat eh... a whole lot of food and she's always hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You're always hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki rubbed her fat belly and said: \"Yep. I'm always hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When i was young i also had a great appetite. Not endless but still pretty big. So i eat a lot everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also do. But the hunger never disappears.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What that's new place called grandma?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The big belly buffet.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my belly will be even bigger then.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine too!\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked wondered at her. From just fat girl this morning she changed in a real gainer that wanted nothing more then too get fatter. Nikki liked the little girl. She was a bit worried if Nicole would maybe eat herself to the point of throwing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped for a nice house with in big letters said: 'The Big Belly Buffet' with a drawing of a boy and a girl with big bellies. <br>\r\nNicole grinned widely while she looked around. There were't many people. Probably since it was a new place.<br>\r\nThey took a table next too a window. <br>\r\nA nice looking man walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a menu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please.\" Grandma said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gave each of them a menu card. The three kids looked wondered at it. Denvert and Nicole could only read a few words and Nicole could't read more then her own name.<br>\r\nGrandma smiled at them.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I will tell you what they have. Oh Nicole this is something for you. Shrimps on a skewer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked happy. Since her mother once ordered a shrimp cocktail for her she was addicted to shrimps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Denvert they have also spare ribs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you like Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh junk food. I like meat more then fish and i love greasy things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A here are small pieces of meat with greasy gravy and fries, And ill take the steak with fries.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma ordered for them of  course all were an all you can eat buffet. <br>\r\nNicole showed she loved shrimps. She stuffed them with three on a time in her mouth. She ate just as much as an adult before the little girl was stuffed. <br>\r\nDenvert cleaned rib after rib but he was full even before his little sister. <br>\r\nBut Nikki kept cleaning plate after plate and she was still hungry.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Granted, it wasn\u2019t like a normal buffet where you were able to choose what you wanted from the rows at the middle of the restaurant and server yourself, they were still able to eat a great deal of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir grandma had the least, only having 2 \u00bd servings of a seniors meal they offered. To her, this was a pretty big meal as she wasn\u2019t the biggest eater anymore. Still she was happy with the quality of the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert came in \u201csecond\u201d as he was able to clear away a good 4 \u00be plates of the ribs. He was pretty hungry and loved the taste of the ribs he was serverd. He sat back and patted his slightly larger tummy. He wasn\u2019t a gainer like Nikki, but he was still a fat and hungry little boy, especially after the work out he did today. He wasn\u2019t a very active or athletic kid by nature and hated it when his dad forced him to move about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was able to eat a bit more than her brother. She was a true shrimp addict and gobbled up plate after plate of the tasty food. She was almost eating them down at the same rate her new found inspertion was. However, she just wasn\u2019t able to come close to matching Nikki and had to stop after just starting her 6th. She sighed as she sat back and happily rubbed over her slightly gurgling tummy. She was more than proud to have eaten so much and gained such a stuffed looking little tummy, her dress clinging to her fattened frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as piggy as both kids were, they were no match for the little ever gluttonous Nikki. She gobbled down plate after plate after plate of greasy gravy covered food. She didn\u2019t even slow down as the shocked waitress brought her a 7th helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon more and more staff were called in to her help feed the fat little girl who didn\u2019t want to stop eating. Both the men and woman of the restaurant were bringing her heaping platefuls of food and an incredible rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki just gleefully ate them down as fast as she could. Her tummy at this point was almost beach ball in size and was even resting a good 3-4 inches on the table top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone in the restaurant was starring at her in amazement. Their grandmother most of all, completleny taken with just how much she was eating. Both Nicole and Denvert were happily watching this girl grow larger and larger with every bite she took. They were greatly enjoying this show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, they were soon aproched by someone who wasn\u2019t so thrilled by it. The manager of the store angerly walked over to Nikki, who was just downing her 30th plateful of food. He did his best to keep his anger in check but it seeped through his voice as he addressed the table of hungry patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time you left!\u201d He said sternly, not thrilled this little fat girl had eaten him nearly out of business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandmother nodded and Nichole and Denvert got up quickly, still coverd in souse from their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm so stuffed.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Can't you even out eat your little sister?\" Nicole asked teasing. \"Even i have eaten more then you!\" She said with a smile and proudly rubbed her round belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert stopped one moment. his sisters belly looked a bit bigger then before. Denvert lifted his shoulders. seeing what his sister had eaten she probably gained a few pounds. He must admit that he liked his sister fatter. Not like in as a girlfriend, Nikki was his girlfriend. But he just thought his sister looked good fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad that i could't eat more. I still don't feel full.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they had to feed you until your full then you would have eaten them out of business!\" Nicole said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're still hungry?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i feel less hungry then normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We told you grandma she's always hungry.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Now let's take you home before your mom get's worried.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got in the car and grandma took a look at the backseat and liked to see three stuffed toddlers sitting there on a row with bloated bellies.<br>\r\nNicole patted happily her belly. She realized she changed in the past hours. She never really cared about her weight. here was no reason. She was a bit heavy for her age but being heavy at her age is't all too bad and her parents thought she would probably grow in it. But now she wanted to gain. To become really fat. Just like Nikki. She wondered how her friends would react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nikki since when is it that you are always hungry?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think... always. I'm not sure but i can't remember ever being... full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. I wonder why that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you anyway.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too!\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tried to hug each other what was a bit hard since the were on a backseat an thanks too Nikki's big belly. Nicole leaned against Nikki's belly closed her eyes and slowly she fell asleep using Nikki's fat like a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah little sisters are the sweetest when they sleep.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without a doubt.\" Nikki said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a Nicole's belly that slowly moved as she breathed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the got home a car was parked in front of their house. Nicole woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey it looks like you have some visitors.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Nikki have too go already?\" Nicole whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the car from my parents.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tree fast walked out curious who was visiting. they ran through the front door too the kitchen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...</span></div></div>",

However, she was more than thrilled as the 3 children ran into the house. She loved how stuffed all of them looked. She was also more than happy to see the little sister she was told about was not only as plump as her little brother, but was even fatter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Devnert and Nikki ran over to her and hugged the teen, happy to see their favorite babysitter had come over. Nichole was a bit more uneasy, as was her grandmother, neither having seen this girl before.<br>\r\nTina grinned happily as she hugged both tubby toddlers back, secretly feeling up both fatty tummies as she did so.

So they gave Tina a call to come over and babysit the children, after hearing all the good reviews from the naborhood parents, and Tina had rushed over straight from her baker\u2019s job to do it. Tina then handed a note Judy had left to prove what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir grandmother nodded and said her goodbyes to the kids, giving Tina the same set of instructions about emergency numbers and such that the parents had before. Soon it was just the teenage feeder and the fat kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina bent over to the shy little girl before her. She grinned warmly and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess this cute chubby girl is Nichole.\u201d She said happily to the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNichole blushed at her words, especially chubby, and nodded. Her shyness was already beginning to break down though around such a nice lady, especially since Nikki and Denvert were so happy to see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe just came from a buffet.\u201d Denvert said proudly to Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina grinned back and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see that. I hope you\u2019re not too full, because I got a nice big snack for you all.\u201d She said more to Denvert and Nichole, knowing Nikki was going to be hungry enough for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki drooled at this news and rubbed her tummy in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope I\u2019m still hungry.\u201d She said happily, knowing no one else would object to her enjoyment of being so fat and such a piggy eater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one though, Nichole also was starting to get a bit hungier as well.

Besides i need something too do until you three came home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was no longer shy for Tina and climbed on a chair. It was kind of adorable. She was so small that her knees did't even reached the edge. <br>\r\nTina looked at the round belly of the young girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you ask if the food was fatty?\" Tina asked. \"No kid i babysat has ever asked me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to become fatter! Way fatter!\" Nicole shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was so happy hearing this. She loved to fatten up kids. She never fattened up kids before since she never met a kid that wanted to be fat before and she did't want to feed anyone against his will but Nikki and Nicole now were different. Those two wanted to get fat. Why should't she help two little girls?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those things almost done? I'm getting kind of hungry.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost. Have a little more patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patient. Nicole has no patient. You not even can let her sit five seconds for a picture!\" Denver said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grabbed a small nut from table she threw at her brother and hit him on his head. Angry he ran too his sister to hit her. Luckily Tina jumped between the two kids and kept them separated. <br>\r\nNikki just watched at the two kids and teenager and lifted her shoulders and waited until the pizza's were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole say you're sorry and Denvert don't hit your sister!\" Tina ordered the kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry i threw a nut at you Denvert.\" Nicole said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded like if she really felt sorry and Denvert anger got less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Apologize accepted.\" Denvert said and walked back too Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're in love i think!\" Nicole whispered too Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? What's wrong with that i think it's really sweet. It's just calf love but still. Who knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calf love?\" Nicole repeated not understanding what Tina mend with calf love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means when two young kids are in love.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNicole looked at the her brother and Nikki. Denvert called Nikki his girlfriend. She hoped Nikki stayed his girlfriend since she really liked Nikki. She even adored her and she wanted to become just like her. Very fat. With rubbing thighs, a huge belly with fat upper arms and some fat on her chest and bowl round pink cheeks. She wanted it all.</span></div></div>",

Tina grinned as she looked over at the two cute little plumpers before her. She could see the excitement only feedees get when their about to be fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it\u2019s time for our big snack.\u201d She said to the kids in an equally excited, but also warm and caring tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three kids grinned and Nicole licked her lips happily as they heard this. All of them were starting to get a bit hungry again, although the two that really wanted to eat were Nichole and Nikki. Both were almost drooling in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina grinned so happily at this and got a great idea. She tapped Denvert on the shoulder and almost whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come help me bring the food over for our hungry girls.\u201d She asked sweetly, but with a tone that said she had something special planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert nodded and quickly followed the teen feeder over to the oven. She slowly begn to remove the pizzas and the heapingly large pie that was for dessert. The sight and smell of them even made the still rather full Denvert\u2019s young tummy growl for the food. Tina grinned at the boy, happy to see he was a bit hungry too. She loved all fat hungry kids, not just girls, but knew that Denvert wasn\u2019t quite the feedee type, even if he was a larger child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon both feeders carefully brought their food out to the hungry chunky girls. All of it was set on the table before them. Both little plumpers were latterly drooling as the smell of it hit them. They both could tell this was going to be some good tasting food. Tina grinned at the girl\u2019s reaction, but remembered her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got an idea. Why don\u2019t we play the feeder game again? Me and Denvert will try to fatten up both Nikki and Nicole and who ever eats the most food gets their tummy rubbed by the others.\u201d She said excitedly to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three kids grinned and nodded happily at the idea, Denvert in particual liking this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I\u2019ll feed Nicole and Denvert can feed Nikki.\u201d She said as she grabbed the first pizza, handing some slices to Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 kids grinned happily at this araingement. Especially Nikki and Denvert, who wanted to feed/be fed by each other greatly, being in their puppy love relationship<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She liked Nicole but she would't let her win. <br>\r\nThen both girls opened their mouths wide and the game began. Denvert dropped slice after slice in Nikki's mouth. Her mouth was much bigger then Nicole's so there fitted  much more food in her mouth and she had done this many times before. <br>\r\nNicole did't stopped chewing for a second. She wanted too win so badly. She admired Nikki so much, but if you could beat your idol You would be more then you dreamed off. Even if Nicole's dream was going on for less then a day.<br>\r\nDenvert looked one moment at his sister. She was very busy devouring the Pizza. He never knew his little sister could eat like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole eat's really fast.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No talking! Feeding!\" Nikki yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother slice disappeared in her bottomless stomach.<br>\r\nsoon Nikki's first pizza was in her stomach while Nicole was still halfway her second last. Denvert grabbed half of the slices of the last one and pushed them in Nikki's mouth that swallowed them as fast if she could and Belched loud and patted her stomach.<br>\r\nNicole grabbed two slices put the one on another and started eating them this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're done with our pizza's!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina stopped one moment feeding Nicole to cut the pie in pieces. After that she fast continued while Denvert pushed the first piece of pie in Nikki's mouth.<br>\r\nFor Nicole as for Nikki those moment were the best of her lives. Both wanted just to lie there and be fed and grow fatter for ever.<br>\r\nTina also loved those moments. She wanted too do this with her first boyfriend when they were about eight. He did't wanted to do this and they broke up. As the years passed she still kept her interests in the fat but she herself grew older while her liking fat staid with the younger kids but it was't a love relation anymore but she just liked fat kids. But since her first boyfriend broke up she had never enough courage too do it again until some time ago<br>\r\nDenvert also thought this was a fun game. But he was glad when he pushed the last piece of pie in the mouth of his girlfriend. Her cheeks were full with pie she looked a bit like a chipmunk. She chewed as much if she could and swallowed it all and Denvert cheered.<br>\r\nNicole looked disappointed while she was till busy eating her second piece of pie. She knew she could't win anymore, but still wanted to eat it all to at least become fatter.<br>\r\nNikki opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Nikki it's all gone. But you won!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was too busy eating to say anything. Nikki looked smiling at Nicole. She knew that it would only take a few days for Nicole's parents noticed their girl was now really fat and gaining. She wondered if Nicole would get problems with that. She hoped not<br>\r\nNicole finally swallowed the last part of pie and let out a cute little burp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did it. You finished all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but i was't faster then Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina started to Rub Nicole's belly. Nicole wanted to ask what she was doing, but noticed she liked it so she did't asked and made soft sounds of pleasure. <br>\r\nWhen Denvert noticed this he also started to rub Nikki's belly and also Nikki liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki still is't full.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled happily with a big grin. Nikki's huge butt was hanging over the edge of her chair and every part of her body was covered with fat. He liked this so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was just something about him that made her feel so happy. It wasn\u2019t just the fact that she was in love with him either. It seemed like this plump little boy knew exactly where her tummy needed his attention. She almost hoped he would let loose like last time and begin licking and kissing and really showing her belly some love. However, she kinda knew it probably wasn\u2019t going to happen with Tina and his sister so close to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked over at Nichole for a second. She could see that Tina was doing a nice job on her tummy as well. The older teen was grinning like she was able to explore a long awaited Christmas present she was finally able to open. She wasn\u2019t the only one enjoying her rubbing though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNichole herself was in absolute paradice as her fat toddler tummy was being rubbed. The dome was extremely round and pushing her little dress out to the point were Nikki could see some of the fabric begining to almost become transparent around her tummy, only a second away from ripping. Nichole herself had her eyes half closed in joy. She was even slightly beginning to pant from just how good Tina\u2019s touch was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki couldn\u2019t help but be glad for the little one, loving too see her fattened up. However, she was more in love with her own belly. She looked down and grinned as she was able to see the massive dome spilling out infront of her. Sure she gained very slight amounts in other places, but this is where 99% of her gain went. Her overly stuffed stomach was so large it looked like someone had taken a larger than normal beach ball colored it the same as her skin and attached it to her frame. She was so proud of how big she had gotten in the course of one day, and knew she had to get back to another buffet soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pleasure was about to go up though, as she noticed Den slowly getting closer and closer to her obese little girl belly. He slowly switched from rubbing her tummy to hugging the massive dome. He pressed his head against her belly button and closed his eyes. His hands slowly began to explore the sides of her gut as he pushed in his head a bit more. He then started to sneek a few quick kisses and even a lick or two when he seen that Tina and Nichole weren\u2019t looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki promply let out a little moan of delight as her completely exposed belly was loved in such a way. Both quickly backed up a bit, knowing that that had made both other girls look over at them. Nikki looked down at Denvert and blushed in both emberasment and apology at her outburst. Tina could only giggle knowingly, well aware of what both kids were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, all bloated feedees and happy feeders were intrupted as the door bell rang. Tina let out a sigh, as did Nichole as she had to stop her rubbing to go see who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon reached the door and opened it to find out it was\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know how that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much did you feed her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not much. I only gave her one and a half pizza and half a pie, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a: but? What was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nothing to do with it. The grandma from Denvert and Nicole took them out for lunch even before i got here. I did't feed her more then that one and a half pizza and that half pie. Really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at Tina who seemed to be telling the truth. She then remembered that Denvert's mother told her yesterday that Tina was very honest. When she accidentally gave her some extra money for babysitting Tina told her instead of taking it like most others would have. Anyway she let her keep the extra money as reward for being honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i believe you. Where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the kitchen with the others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda remembered how Nikki looked like when she picked her up by Tanja and Robbie so she was prepared so she was't so shocked when she saw Nikki but she was still wondered how Nikki was able to get so fat in just such a little time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sweetie. What did you do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our grandma took us all four too an all you can eat buffet!\" Nicole said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An all you can eat... at least now i know for sure Tina told the truth. So she did only gave her one and a half pizza and a half pie. That's not very much. At least not for Nikki.\" Linda mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a great time. We would like it to play again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in a few day when it get's very hot and daddy is finished preparing the swimming pool you can come swimming!\" Nicole yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled. She was a bit lazy and hated most sports but not swimming... at least swimming just for fun was about the only kind of sport she liked. Nikki's body was very heavy but in the water her body was less heavy and so it was easy to move for her, and she could swim already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun. Can i mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was gotten warmer the past days and i would't take long until it would be really summer. It was always fun for others to swim. Nikki could then also be with her friends and she would do some kind of exercise. Linda was't planning to put Nikki on exercise anymore but if she would do some exercise she would be glad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can. I would like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked one moment at Nicole and noticed that she was also getting pretty fat, but decided that it was't her problem. If Nicole was getting fat her parents need to decide what too do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm glad you had so much fun, but all fun things have too end once. Nikki needs to come home now. Come on Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Nikki.\" Denvert said sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come back soon!\" Nicole added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina waved with a smile.<br>\r\nAfter Nikki and Linda got in the car Linda turned too Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems they like you. Not only Denvert but also his little sister. I'm glad you finally made good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like it to swim when it's warmer.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and that won't take long.\" Linda said.     </span></div></div>",

She had expected to be in a great deal of trouble because of how large she was, especially after what had happened over at Tanja\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrived at their home. Nikki grinned as she waddled into the house. She could clearly see her fat, exposed, little kid belly jostling and shaking about as she moved. It seemed that with every step she took her plumper tummy would either \u201cjump\u201d up and down, slosh from side to side, or have a ripple wave sent through it. She was so pleased with her gaining progress in just a short period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wasn\u2019t the only one who had noticed this phenomenon. Her mother was also looking on at the display of obseness her daughter\u2019s tummy was putting on, and she wasn\u2019t close to be thrilled with it. She had expected Nikki to be very active over at Denvert\u2019s house. Yet, just like the last time Nikki had gone out, she had come home with an over stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki\u2019s mother was almost ready to say she shouldn\u2019t see the pudgy little boy anymore. However, this was really one of the first friends Nikki had ever had, and one big stuffing wasn\u2019t nessierly their fault. She could see how an unsuspecting family could be caught off gaurde by her little eating machine of a daughter. Not only that, but the promice of some exercise the next time Nikki and Denvert would met was enough to put her fears away for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth walked/waddled into the living room. Nikki\u2019s dad gave a look from the paper he was reading. He wasn\u2019t too surprised by what he had seen. This wasn\u2019t close to the first time his little plumper of daughter had come home in this sort of state. Besides, he wasn\u2019t as concerned about it as Nikki\u2019s mother was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki quickly took a seat on the couch. She grinned as she watched her still perfectly round little girl belly spill out infront of her and slosh about as she did so. She gave it a quick pat and giggled slightly in joy at how large she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then decided to\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She decided that it was wise too don't push her luck and don't eat until it was dinner time what would't take too long.<br>\r\nNikki flicked through some channels But Linda suddenly walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki gulped. She thought she escaped. She closed her eyes thinking her mother would be furious about what happened at Denverts house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's time that we buy a new bathing suit for you. If you want too swim. I think your last one is gotten too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened wondered her eyes. She would have expect everything but not this. Her mother friendly said they should shop for a new bathing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well... I maybe though about a bikini.\" Nikki tried careful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked her fat body and knew Denvert liked it too. In a bikini he could easily admire her body. She looked at her mother hoping she would stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bikini? I don't know... well you know what we'll see tomorrow if we buy one. Besides you need new clothes anyway. We can buy some new then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Sure! Of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda almost needed to laugh. Nikki looked like a hypnotized bunny. So surprised was she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she walked away Nikki looked still surprised and tried to look back too the screen. Her mother looked so fine with what happened. For a super sized always  hungry girl life was't so bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to go swimming not a bad idea. It's going to get hot past days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy when can i swim?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see... tomorrow we're shopping. The day after tomorrow we're gonna visit grandma and stay there until the next day and we're back late. She specially asked for you Nikki. You know how much she loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide grin split her face in two. Grandma was a big lady and she loved her only granddaughter. She also loved it to spoil her and gave her what she wanted and what Nikki wanted was food and her grandmother was also a big eater and she liked it that Nikki wanted to fill her shoes. Nikki also loved her grandmother and always liked it to visit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But after that i see no reason why you can't swim if it's fine with Denvert's parents of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wanted to call right now but she knew she needed to wait. After all her mother was right she really needed a new bathing suit. However she still hoped it would become a bikini and she also wanted to visit grandma. So she slowly laid back and looked at Casper's scare school and giggled at a funny joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was happy that Nikki wanted to swim. She still don't know if she would let Nikki buy a bikini. I would show all her fat rolls and that's not something she would like to show in public. But Denvert and Nicole knew Nikki was fat and did't seemed to mind so it was't a problem if they would see it. She could buy both and asking her to use the bathing suit in public. That seemed the best solution.<br>\r\nOf course there was still her mother in law. To be honest she could get very well along with her mother in law. Except for one thing. Spoiling Nikki. If it was letting Nikki watch a lot T.V she would't have a problem with it. Grandmother's spoiled their grandchildren that was normal but Nikki's eating was anything but normal. She hoped grandma would take it easy this time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it to see grandma again.\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i would also be glad to see her again. She's a bit lonely since grandpa... past away.\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth went silent after that. Nikki missed her grand father. She was pretty shocked when he died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dinner!\" Linda yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki fast got up. She was pretty hungry. She smiled when she saw they had steaks with gravy baked potatoes and cauliflower with a delicious cheese sauce. Of course she took a lot of mayonnaise and ketchup with the potatoes.<br>\r\nLinda baked four steaks and a lot of potatoes and a entire cauliflower hoping it would be enough for Nikki. Maybe with a big dessert after it. </span></div></div>",

Now not only did she have just the desire to gain for her own enjoyment. She hadn\u2019t thought about it much before her mom brought it up, but she really wanted a nice bikini. Not only for her own happiness at the sight and feel of her free belly sloshing around, although that in it\u2019s self was enough for the 5 year old to pig out, but also so she could impress little Denvert. She could just image what the little chubby boy would do if he seen her show up with a massive beach-ball belly for him to see. She almost sighed at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the food on her plate was more than enough to take her from her other thoughts. She quickly dug into the food like she hadn\u2019t eaten in a hundred days. She almost in hailed the potatoes as her knife and fork were going steadily through them like a machine. She couldn\u2019t help but grin as this thought entered her mind. She was just hungry little eating machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly moved on to the cauliflower. She wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of vegetables or fruit, although you wouldn\u2019t know with the way she ate it down. However, the cheese sauce that covered the white stocks made it seem pretty good. She quickly gobbled them down too, only pausing a few intermediate moments to savor their flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she moved on to main dish: the gravy covered stakes. This was by far the best part of the meal and the big bellied kindergartner was going to take full advantage of it. She almost moaned as she gobbled up the mass of meat that her mother had given her in a vain attempt to fill her up. This wasn\u2019t close to happening though and the pudgy child even took the 4th stake without asking, loving their flavors so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then though her mother, with a hopeless sigh, brought out the tall glasses. Nikki knew exactly what they were going to have. Extra thick, extra fixin' filled, extra fattening ice cream sundaes. She was almost drooling as her mother set out everything for the family members to make their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew they would only able to buy clothes in a plus size store and she must admit that she was a little ashamed that she had a kid of just five years old that was too fat too were normal clothes. But at the other hand the only parents who would see her there must have a fat kid as well. She still did't understood why her daughter wanted a bikini. But she would be glad if Nikki did some exercise, and really did't mind if she would swim in a bikini or bathing suit at that moment. Besides how much money could they ask for such a small piece of fabric?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bit surprised how much you're able to put in your glass.\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a gift.\" Nikki said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's sundae was really big. Linda decided to put the stuff away so Nikki would't take a second one. They all in silent ate their ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess who was at Denvert's house.\" Linda suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\" Bram asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina. That teenager girl. She seemed to be everywhere were Nikki goes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well was't Denvert a boyfriend from that guy Robbie and his sister Tanja. Tina was their babysitter and i guessed  Denvert's mother met Tina that way and also asked her for babysitter. That makes sense. Besides Nikki now knows her babysitter. That's for both a lot easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her spoon and started on her own small sundae. In the meanwhile Nikki was busy eating her own ice cream. <br>\r\nThen they suddenly heard a : RIIIIIIIIP! Nikki's T-shirt ripped in half right in the middle. Reveling Nikki's big belly. Linda was't surprised and did't react on it. Nikki just finished her sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it's time to put you in bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Nikki said. \"I'm kind of tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will put her in bath. You just stay here.\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda started to clean the table while Bram walked and Nikki waddled upstairs.<br>\r\nShe hoped Nikki's clothes would fit for a few weeks. She knew the answer would probably be no. Maybe a few days. She sighed. It was getting very expensive buying new clothes every few days for her growing daughter. <br>\r\nMaybe she could keep some of Nikki's old clothes for that girl Nicole if she was older. That little girl was pretty fat and probably could wear them if she was older since there were't much kids this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Bram washed his daughter and put her in bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you gonna sleep now. Tomorrow you need to go shopping and the next day too grandma. We leave early then and you know how much grandma loves you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki curled up in her blanket and felt very happy and looked at her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know daddy. I also love grandma and i like it to go too her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\"  Bram said and walked too the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad can mommy come for a kiss?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I will tell her to give you a kiss.\" Bram said and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at the ceiling. Slowly her hands moved to her fat belly. She liked the soft feeling of it and rubbing and moving it and let it jiggle. <br>\r\nWhen Linda entered she stopped and kissed her mommy goodnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodnight honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Nikki fell in a deep sleep.   </span></div></div>",

She even wore a smile on her face as she dreamed of wearing her new bikini. being about 5 sizes too big for it, while Denvert fed her and played with her big belly. A very good dream by all accounts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost sad it ended as she heard the door to her room being opened by her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki. Time to get up so we can *Sigh* get you some clothes that fit you.\u201d Linda said in such disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really was not thrilled with having her daughter being so fat that she was literally too wide to fit into her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this put the smile from her dream-filled night back on Nikki\u2019s face. She was more than thrilled to be too wide to fit into her clothes. She grinned even more as she slowly slid out of bed and looked down at just how big she had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer pyjamas, which had fit her growing form only a few days earlier, could no longer do so over her big round belly. In fact, not only did they not fit, but her shirt was now a complete belly shirt showing off the massive dome. Nikki grinned as she poked the mass of little girl blubber with her finger. She LOVED how big and round it was. It was one of the benefits of the \u201cStuffed\u201d look she possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly went over to her dresser and picked out the only things that would still fit her: a baggy pair of jogging pants and a sweatshirt. Even these showed off a good two or three inches of belly blubber. She grinned even more at this and went to the washroom to relive herself from the night before, as well do up her hair and such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of this, Nikki waddled downstairs and heard breakfast was soon on the way. She grinned and quickened her steps a bit more, now very hungry from not having her fatty belly filled throughout the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly waddled into the kitchen and grinned at what she seen. A nice big breakfast of cerial, pancakes, bacon, eggs, sausages, hash browns and toast were set out. Her jaw dropped at the sight of so much food. It was only her big belly growling that brought her back from the shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just then Linda answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I thought to fill you up a bit so the clothes will fit for some time instead of rip off the fist time you eat again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled happy and got in a chair and started to stuff her face. Linda looked and she was kind of glad she could make Nikki happy this way. Slowly he started to accept that Nikki was fat and would stay fat and probably become fatter and that Nikki was fine with it. <br>\r\nShe was't really happy with that but she tried many times to control her daughters eating and it never really worked she admitted that she was defeated. So she started to accept it. She also felt  bit sad for Nikki. She just seemed to never be full and always was hungry. If she was't could it be she would be thin then?<br>\r\nShe hoped Nikki would eat enough to get her at stuffed size so she could get clothes after Nikki was full so they would fit for some time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cereal was already gone and Nikki dove in the pancakes like a starved animal. She just ripped pieces of it so he looked more like a pig then a girl. She chewed loudly and let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki can you try to work  bit on your manners? Tomorrow we go to grandma and you know she loves you but also likes manners. Even when your just a little girl.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda heard one more chew but after that Nikki started to eat a bit more polite.<br>\r\nShe fast gulped down the eggs and bacon and started on the sausages. Of course heavily covered with mayonnaise and ketchup. She fast swallowed them in her big belly and continued on hash brown and toasts. She did't leave a crumb. After he last bite was gone she forget her manners and let out a belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Eh excuse me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her bloated belly. Of course Nikki was't full but Seeing that Nikki's belly was bloated mend Linda's plan had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nikki.

This just made the little feedee happier as she knew she was growing even rounder than she had expected. Denvert was going to love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused in her humming as she thought about her puppy love boyfriend.

Linda did't seem too notice or did't care. She looked for some nice clothes a few sizes too big so Nikki had some room too grow.<br>\r\nNikki was looking for a nice bikini since she knew her mother would't look for that. <br>\r\nLinda however did saw a nice pink bathing suit with a picture of a frog on it. Nikki found a nice, red, two piece bikini with a kitten head on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy i want those. Please can i have them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at the size. They seemed to be the right size but with Nikki you never knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well try them on and also try on this one.\" She said and handed her the pink bathing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki knew that her mom did't really want too buy a bikini so she also tried on the bathing suit. Thanks the stretching stuff it fitted her perfectly. However it showed every roll of fat on her body. After that she tried on the bikini. It was kind of tight and even while her belly covered most of the bottom piece Linda decided to also buy it to do Nikki a favor since she acted very nicely. She knew some other parents who had a lot of trouble when they needed too took their kids to buy clothes.<br>\r\nShe also found two very big T-shirts. One blue and on pink one with a print on it from: Hello Kitty and two elastic pants. Linda sighed relieved. Even while Nikki was very fat she did managed to find some nice clothes for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nikki i think we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded.

I should have known that i would become hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and decided to get in the water. Maybe it would take her thought of of hunger. As soon as the water came to her chest she felt how her body got less heavier and started swimming a bit. She liked it to just splash a bit in the water. Her mother did't need it to know she hardly did any exercise.<br>\r\nA small group of three slender girls about five years swim by her. Nikki got almost scared seeing how skinny they were. She shivered a bit. How could those girls look so happy. If they would get fat they would understand how good it felt.<br>\r\nSlowly she swim after them. <br>\r\nWhen the water got less deep the other girls saw Nikki's body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Wow men. You're fat.\" A girl with blond hair said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe that's why she can swim so good.\" An other girl in a pink bikini said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like a fat pig.\" An other  mean looking girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not nice to say.\" The girl in the pink bikini said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but she is. I bet she weigh even heavier then us three combined.\" The blond girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I would't want to weigh just as much if you do. You're way too skinny. I would rather have some meat on my bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're crazy.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's belly rumbled again. Should she...    </span></div></div>",

Nikki could see every single rib on all 3 of the girls thanks to the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Nikki didn\u2019t realize was that the 3 before her were having the same dilemma about her. They couldn\u2019t understand how a kid so fat could NOT want to be skinny like them. Everybody had to be skinny to be pretty and get a boy, even though none of them had boyfriends. Of course none of them had really looked for one as they were still quite young, but that was beside the point to them. All 3 could see every roll on the plumpened youngster\u2019s body, again thanks to the water, and thought it looked equally as horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 4 children\u2019s thoughts were interrupted as a cry could be heard from the other end of the \u201cbeach\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMarcy! Come\u2019on girls it\u2019s time to go!\u201d A woman who had the same blonde hair as the girl before Nikki called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three didn\u2019t speak another word and simply swam off towards the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt gave Nikki a moment of good feeling, not wanting to hear more about having to be ugly and skinny. However, her hunger soon returned to her. The fat girl clutched her big round belly and tried to come up with a solution to fill her stuffed looking tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked around fervently. She could see a number of food venders all along the simulated beach. However, none of them would give her free food and she HAD to eat! She could feel her stomach rumble yet again. It just wouldn\u2019t be quite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she spotted it. Well first she smelled the large pizza cooling not far from her before she seen it. A family of 5 skinny people, mom, dad, two sons and a daughter, had ordered it. It appeared too hot for them at the moment, so they decided to play a bit more in the pool while the tasty dish cooled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki drooled at the sight. If only it was for her! She wouldn\u2019t have waited. She would have shoveled the whole thing into her mouth and puffed up her hungry belly even more. Her stomach added a nice hungry growl in to let her know that EXACTLY what it wanted the fat little girl to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and seen the family was busy playing a game of pool tag quite a bit away from the pizza. She could get her pudgy hands on it before any of them caught her. Nikki though about it for a second more before she decided\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And the family was so skinny so they had small bellies to fill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well too bad for them. I'm hungry and a girl has too eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFast she wolfed the first slice down. It was kind of hot but not too hot for Nikki. Fast she ate slice two and three and burped softly. She looked at the family they were still busy an did't noticed her. There were still two slices left and Nikki was very hungry. She grabbed the two slices and put them on each other and fast eat them an burped softly again. The family was still busy playing and Nikki used that time to waddle away and fast got back in the water and swim a bit away. <br>\r\nWhen the family came back and noticed their pizza was gone Nikki was already disappeared between all the other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that was a good pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki felt a bit guilty that she had taken the pizza but she was so hungry without any money so she had no choice. Besides the family was so skinny so she guessed they did't bought to many food so they had enough money for another pizza. This did made her feel a bit better. <br>\r\nShe looked at her bathing suit. Too be totally honest she hated it. But she knew her mother would't like it if she would were something that showed her whole fat body. <br>\r\nBut this bathing suit was so tight it showed every roll of fat on her body. She splashed a round in the water happy she at least could wear her bikini when she went over too Denvert. But first she would go to her grandmother. Nikki always found it a bit hard to leave. Not only because grandma was such a sweet and nice old lady who spoiled her but also they need to leave her alone since her husband past away.<br>\r\nShe sighed softly and looked at the sky. Her grandma never really seemed to mind Nikki's extra weight. But now Nikki looked at her body she never before gained such a huge amount as weight since the past time thanks too Denvert, Tina, Denverts grandmother, Nicole and of course Tanja and Robbie. All feeding sessions had put a lot of pounds on her already fat body. Of course that was what she wanted but she wondered how her grandmother would react. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah i don't think she would mind.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and waddled back too her towel and went laying on it and closed her eyes a bit but noticed she was still hungry. Slowly she went sitting up straight. Her belly rumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men i'm still hungry. I wish Tina was here. She would stuff me. I'm glad she's my new babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother loud growl came from her belly. She put a hand on it and softly pat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I'm sure mommy will come soon and then i can fill you with some good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still her belly let out another growl and Nikki stood up and looked again round looking for some food. But that pizza last time was just luck. She did't saw anyone who would leaf their food so she would have a chance to eat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she suddenly saw a group of kids. Probably a kids birthday party. A man (probably the dad of the birthday girl) bought for everyone a pack of fries all kids ran forward to get a pack. Nikki also. The man handed every kid a pack fries and did't really noticed Nikki was't a part of the birthday group until he found out that one kid did't had fries but Nikki made sure she was gone at that moment. <br>\r\nShe fast wolfed down the fries in case someone of the birthday group might see her with a pack of fries. Thinking of it she now had two sort of steal some food two times in one day. Her belly felt good but her mind not. <br>\r\nShe waddled in the water and swim a bit. The water soon let her forget her worries. She slowly played in the water until she heard her mother and got out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Nikki. How was it.\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great. But i'm really hungry mommy. I did't had any food. Can we get some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i guess we can. You just dry yourself of and get dressed an the we will go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later Nikki was dressed and got in the car. </span></div></div>",

She was such a fat hungry kid that she actually waddled around and ate other people\u2019s food. She had to admit, that thought made her feel good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Nikki wasn\u2019t the only one who had noticed her gain. Linda couldn\u2019t help but see how much bigger her daughter looked since this morning. She could see her stuffed looking little girl belly clearly as her clothes were a little damp from Nikki\u2019s partially wet body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t figure it out. How could the girl be FATTER than when she went in the water! Didn\u2019t she work off some of those calories with all her swimming? Linda could only sigh and hope that all her exersize would help melt a bit of her tubby child\u2019s weight off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then pulled the car into the closet parking spot at a fast food burger joint. She took a few seconds to unbuckle her seat belt and get out of the car. The woman sighed hopelessly as she seen this was more than ample time for Nikki to get out of her seat and run up to get in line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was their turn to order.

Nikki would never become a slender girl, not even normal, not even chubby, and looking at what she eat even fat would't really describe her after some time. All because of that endless hunger she had. She had given almost anything to take that away. <br>\r\nNikki waddled to a table. Linda act like she did't see her daughters rubbing thighs or that her butt was hanging over the edges of the chair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki did you never think about being in an activity group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up with a painful look at her face. She hated gym and any kind of exercise, and with all her extra weight it was kind of hard for her too move. Besides at school she was always picked last since she was terrible in sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy i hate exercise. Besides the doctor said i was healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweet hart, but it could't hurt to do an activity group. You do't have to do a diet but just an activity so you lose a bit of that extra fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened her mouth but Linda cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know your healthy but i could't hurt to do some exercise and burn some fat. The doctor never said i should't do that or that it could hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stopped eating with a burger half eaten in her hand. She was really stuck. It seemed like her mother would still try too put her on an activity group and she hated that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can something with your new friends. That boy Denvert did some exercise. But maybe a fighting sport is't really your thing. But his sister did... ballet. Maybe you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled. Linda looked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I? On ballet. Mom have you ever seen that. That all all a bunch of stick figures. Did you see those clothes they were or those tiny shoes they were and those skinny legs? I don't think i will ever fit in any of those things. Think how i will look in those things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda must admit that image Nikki in such a ballet suit it would be unbelievable skimpy and fat would be pealing out everywhere. Linda must admit that thinking about Nikki doing ballet was something for in a cartoon. She remembered that those girls hold a rail and with Nikki's weight it would probably break off.<br>\r\nNikki wondered if Nicole still did ballet. She did't think so. Even if she still did it would't take long before she would stop since it would be difficult too do ballet with her weight. She grinned and finished her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So ballet is out of the question but something else? Football, baseball, basketball, kick boxing, self defense or some other sport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about sumo wrestling?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's only because they can eat a lot. Well you already half way there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what we will talk about this again later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki finished her food but knew that however her mother would start the topic again and she probably would need to do some exercise. Without talking she finished her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's go home. I need to pack stuff for tomorrow and cook dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked (in Nikki's case waddled) out too the car.  </span></div></div>",

She spent the rest of the day trying to suggest more active things Nikki could do around the house to help \u201cloose some weight.\u201d The woman hoped that maybe her daughter would do something that would help slow the expansion of her young waist line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wasn\u2019t about to let that happen though, and made sure to avoid anything strenuous. She had worked hard to grow her big pot belly out and didn\u2019t want her mom\u2019s hatred of her blubber to ruin it. She knew she looked so much cuter with the extra pounds she put on and knew Denvert would agree with her. She could picture how her young crushes face would light up at the sight of her big stuffed little girl belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis mood carried over into dinner where the little kindergartner practically demolished the large meal Linda cooked for the family. She made sure no was getting seconds tonight and even snuck a few things off her father\u2019s plate. She must have eaten a good 3-4 servings of food when you factor in the tasty chocolate cake she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, the little poker was in bed rubbing over her small beach ball sized belly.

She could see it jiggle slightly as Nikki did a few hand motions to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman didn\u2019t know what to do with her daughter. Even if she started swimming, she knew that wouldn\u2019t be enough to loose the weight she had already packed on. And here she was, gorging her young face with all sorts of treats and was about to feast on fast food. She was really at her wits end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably wouldn\u2019t have been so bad if Nikki had wanted to loose the weight. She just couldn\u2019t figure out why her daughter liked being fat so much.

She's healthy but i would like it if she just wanted to be a bit more active and tried to lose some weight and did't liked it so much. I can't believe she likes it being fat. Can you understand why she likes it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i dated with a fat girl some time. I must admit that all that fat felt soft and warm. A bit comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so i need to become fat! Is that it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. I like you no matter what size you are. But please not so loud i don't want Nikki to wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at the backseat and also thought i was better to let Nikki sleep. She would probably wanted food when she got up. With some luck they would reach grandma before Nikki woke up. <br>\r\nSince Nikki was woken pretty early and was a bit bored in the car she kept sleeping.<br>\r\nLinda read a book but watched to the backseat every now and then at the huge belly of her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki woke up when someone shook her shoulder. Sleepy she opened her eyes and yawned one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki time too wake up. We're here.\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki jumped out of the car and ran too the house of her grandmother. Her grandmother lived a bit away from other people. <br>\r\nShe did't lived alone. There also was another woman to cook, clean, shop and did other thing for her grandmother. After her husband past away she really needed a hand in the house. The name of the woman was Julliet. She was young and very beautiful. She did't cared about Nikki's weight and if Nikki's grandmother asked for food for Nikki she would get it. If it were fries or twenty burgers.<br>\r\nThe rang the doorbell and Julliet opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Hello it's so nice to see you again.\" She said happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Julliet it's nice to see you too again.\" Nikki said polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma is in the living room. I need to prepare a big lunch for when you would arrive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it starts and we're not even one minute here.\" Linda mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i would like some food.

If it looked like she ran fast to greet her grandmother, the fat child ran even faster to the food that was waiting for her. She licked her lips as her big ball like belly bounced with each step she took. Even the room shook slightly as the plumper little girl headed for the table full of tasty treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki quickly began to delve into the snacks put out by her grandmother. It was mostly baking the older woman had done thanks to Juliet\u2019s help and there was more than enough to feed a small army. Of course, one hungry Nikki could out do an army of grown men any day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little one had already downed half a plate full of Twinkies and was beginning to go after the cupcakes near by. She was piggy with her eating, so excited with so much good tasting food around her. Her grandmother\u2019s baking was some of the best, she even won awards with it. Nikki had placed her own seal of approval on it as she had eaten all 6 cupcakes as though they were crumbs on a plate. She couldn\u2019t help it. She was a fat and hungry little girl and the food tasted so good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe child paused briefly in her binging to let out a nice big burp from her frosting stained lips. She then grinned mischievously as she eyed a near by large angel food cake. She quickly began to grab chunks out of it with her bare hands and within only a minute or so, she had completely downed the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Bram and Juliet were shocked at how much and how fast the little one was eating. It was Linda who was the most angry though. She not only got to see her \u201ctoo fat\u201d child pigging out on treats, but also noticed how her tummy was now a good inch or two bigger, and they had only just arrived!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't mind if it's watching T.V or giving her presents. But i do mind when it's giving her food while she's very overweight.

But it was obvious too grandma that her daughter in law would't just let her kid eat what she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she needs to eat just like normal people. You all must be hungry.

It's easily her parents fault. I bet they spoiled her enough as an infant and toddler that she thought eating a lot was a good thing. I mean, sure eating is good, but not in the excess that SHE eats in. It wasn't a problem at all last time she was her. Sure, she was overweight; had a bit of a belly, but it was no biggy. But now, she's huge. I was thinking she would just grow up more than she'd grow out, not the other way around. She doesn't set a good example as a kid or for who she makes her parents look like; it makes them look like they neglect putting a cap over what she can eat, and just let her stuff herself to sleep. It's just sad.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the tv off, seeing no point in keeping it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yet, Nikki looks so happy.' she continued thinking, 'Not the typical happy-go-lucky happy that all kids should have, but happy...that she's being fed so much, as if she likes it. But that can't be right, cause no kid likes being fat, especially THAT fat! I think I should talk to her about it.'</span></div></div>",

Excuse me.\" She said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the five empty plates in front of her. Her face was covered with remains of what she just ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still hungry Nikki?\" Her grandmother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was thinking. Of course she was hungry like always but at the other hand if she ate too much her mom would be furious especially after she told her mother in law not too feed  Nikki too much. Her clothes felt kind of tight and if she would eat more they would probably rip and then her mother knew for sure she had been eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was enough grandma. For now. I better wash my face before mom sees me like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked too the kitchen and used the sink to wash her face and also her hands that got kind of sticky.<br>\r\nAfter that she went back too grandma who was looking in an old dusty photo book.<br>\r\nNikki looked curious at the photo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Nikki. Look that's your father when he was young. He was such a handsome boy. When he got older he got lots of girlfriends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at different girlfriends of her father. Then she saw him next too a photo of a chubby woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your mother Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So my mother was chubby in the past?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but she did her best to lose it all and she did. Look here's more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lost track of time while she got lost in tales of her grandmothers memories. She knew some people thought those stories were boring but she found them anything but boring. She liked it too listen too that old stories. <br>\r\nThen she heard someone snoring her grandmother fell asleep. Nikki walked over too the T.V and put it on too watch some cartoons. Suddenly she felt someone was watching her and looked up. It was Julliet. She seemed to have calmed down and a lot more friendly then last time Nikki saw her.<br>\r\nJulliet walked over too Nikki and wen sitting in a chair next too her and turned off the T.V. Nikki did't do anything. She was wondering what would happen and besides she already knew the episode.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hi Nikki. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine i guess. Are you all right? You seemed pretty angry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well you see i maybe overreacted a little. But you see Nikki i was worried about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Nikki. I know you like food. A lot. But i think you like it too much. You ate like you were't fed in weeks. Always you want more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My nieces like a new doll. However Nikki it's not bad too like food a bit but you like it too much. You also eat way too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed with a finger deep in Nikki's fat rolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And with eating so much this is what you get a fat belly. I remembered it when you were last time her it was't so big. You really got fat in the past time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i like being fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what... you like being fat. Nikki don't lie too me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't i like being fat. I like a big belly and all these rolls of fat i like eating and becoming fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nikki. No kid likes it too be fat. Especially not so fat like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i do. I know someone else who also does! Nicole the little sister of my best friend. I also know some kids that like my fat. Just like i do. It feels soft, warm and comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it. I really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulliet stood up and walked out confused. She need too think of a new way how to talk too Nikki. But first she wanted too look at it at the computer.<br>\r\nNikki turned on the T.V and continued watching cartoons. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It was as if she said she was going to jump up and walk on the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew how good it was to be bigger, though. She looked down at her clothed, but much bigger belly. She thought just how many people liked her tummy big. Just about everyone at Tanja\u2019s place, Tina, and especially important to her, Denvert. She couldn\u2019t help grin as that thought crossed her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then another entered it: all that food was going to make her even fatter for tomorrow. With all the stuffing and drama with Julliet, she nearly forgot about going over to \u201cswim\u201d with Devenet and Nicole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly lifted her shirt up, which was already showing a nice big sliver of fat from her gorging. She grinned excitedly as she seen just how fat, round and tight her little girl belly was becoming. It almost looked like she was carrying a good \u201clitter\u201d of babies in her young tummy. She gave her tummy an experimental poke and giggle with joy as she watched the big dome slosh back and forth in front of her. She couldn\u2019t help but give her tummy a nice big hug, happy at what she had accomplished at her grandmother\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer celebrations were cut short though as she heard the front door open. She quickly pulled her shirt down over as much of obese stuffed kid tummy and sat on the couch as if she had been doing nothing but watching cartoons the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Linda and Bram walked over as Nikki\u2019s grandma walked into the room. Nikki really hoped her mom wasn\u2019t going to notice just how much bigger she had gotten since the woman had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Linda took one unhappy look at Nikki's big belly. But at the other hand Nikki already ate a lot when they arrived and she asked her mother in law not too feed Nikki too much food. Besides since Nikki never got full she would be probably still be snacking but she was just watching cartoons without any food of any wrappers or plates near her. Maybe she really did't eat any food. She decided to gave Nikki the benefit of the doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was really nice to see the Johnson's again.\" Bram said. \"They're really nice people\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was it here Nikki?\" Linda asked. \"Have you been watching T.V the whole time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Grandma told me some stories about when she was young and grandpa still was alive and dad was just a little kid and how he met you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Grandparents slowly start to forget what happened recent but they can remember a lot about what happened years ago. They can tell stories for ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she fell asleep so i went watching T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram slowly shook his mother and she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. Oh my i must have fall asleep when i got lost in my memories. Oh you're home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mother. Did Nikki behave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah she was the sweetest kid. No problem at all. I think i could better start cooking. can you please call Julliet. she needs to help me with cooking. I can't do all hose things on my own anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked upstairs to the room of Julliet and opened it. Julliet was sitting in front of her computer. On the screen were a few pictures of obese woman and man who fed them. Julliet fast clicked and the site became small and slid too the underside of the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like it if you knocked next time.\" Julliet said sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry. I will next time. Grandma called. She asked if you could come down and help her making dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. Just give me five minutes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Linda got out of the room she opened the site again hoping that Linda did't see it and if she did would't put any attention too it. But she was so surprised about what Nikki said that she liked it too be fat she looked it up at the computer and it seemed there were a lot of woman who liked it to be fat and wanted too become fatter. This people were called feedee's and there were also the man who liked fat woman and want too feed them. That were feeders. There were sometimes pretty young woman. Some of them were even teenagers but not even near the age of Nikki. But she probably would become one later. Did't she said a boy liked her and her fat. He would maybe become later a feeder. If they kept in touch.<br>\r\nShe thought this was kind of disturbing but if this woman liked it them self who was she too stop them. So this little girl Nikki was just like them. So she did really liked it too become fat. She wondered if she need too do anything about it. If Nikki really liked it too become fat. She did't want o ruin the fun for a small toddler. But at the other hand being fat was very unhealthy. Finally she decided that she would't do anything about it herself. <br>\r\nNikki would't listen near would her grandmother and seeing how fat she was near did her parents. She would't give Nikki food herself but would't complain about it. After all Nikki was't her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nshe fast walked down to start helping making the food. At least she did't have too worry about what too cook since grandma already had an idea for dinner. <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

Nikki\u2019s grandmother enjoyed cooking, even if she needed help. Julliet was able to put the events of today out of her mind for a bit as she helped the elderly woman cook. Linda joined them and helped, while Bram handed them things and chatted with the group. Everyone was enjoying this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki on the other hand, wasn\u2019t having nearly so much fun. She was still hungry for more to eat and the smell of the food from the kitchen was making her more so. Even her round full tummy let out a nice big growl to be fed as she tried to sit there and watch cartoons. If only it was just her grandmother cooking, she knew the older woman would love to let Nikki taste the different foods and probably get a few snacks between that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe well fed little girl soon found that this wasn\u2019t working.

She rubbed her round soft tummy and began to walk away from all the tasty food she wasn\u2019t able to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly walked around, trying to forget about what was happening downstairs when\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She waddled into the room and sat on the chair by the desk, the quietly gasped at what she saw on the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the monitor screen was an open webpage; an internet article. The headliner was all that Nikki needed to see to keep herself from closing the page. The article was about people who wanted to gain weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did not like reading, probably because she always thought she had better things to do (like eating), but she was too interested in reading this article. Her eyes skimmed through the text, making sure she got every word; from the part about obtaining the desire down to the part about feeders and feedees, which really caught her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Nikki mumbled to herself, \"I am not alone? There are many more people who like being fat and getting fatter? I mean, I do have a friend who does, but I think she only wanted to get fat because I did. Denvert must be my feeder, and I must be his feedee, since he always was the first one to bring me food.\" Nikki continued reading, each sentance making her feel better about herself and her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki...\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned her head to the door, slightly scared.

Grandma was glad that it seemed like Julliet could get along with Nikki again. She loved Nikki but Julliet felt like family too her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right Nikki?\" Linda asked a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mommy. I'm all right. Everything is all right.\" She said with a naughty twinkle in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda wished the dinner was less fatty. She knew Nikki would stuff herself since her grandmother would let her and she could't do much too stop her. <br>\r\nThen she noticed how calm and friendly Julliet did. Maybe it was nothing but who knew.<br>\r\nGrandma made a lot of burgers and some mashed potatoes with a lot of greasy gravy and also some cooked potatoes with cheese, bacon, union and a cream on the top and after some time in the oven it tasted great. There was also some spinach with pieces bacon in it and a salad with a lot of dressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This taste delicious mom!\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda must admit that her mother in law was a good cook. If her mother would have cooked like this she would have been a little butterball herself like a child. Not as big if Nikki but there were't much children that could reach that size. <br>\r\nWhile she thought about it she must admit that she had been pretty chubby like a child and after she married Bram she went on a diet and exercised a lot and loosed all her extra weight. <br>\r\nShe was so happy she heard she was pregnant. Sure the pregnancy was terrible with throwing up and the pain of carrying a child all the time and get it out was also very painful. But she was happy with a girl. Thinking she could also exercise a bit with her when she would get older but Nikki showed at very young age she had more interest in food then in exercise tools. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki happy scooped the food in her mouth as fast if she could. She first pushed the spinach in her mouth and after that fast continued with the mashed potatoes with of course a lot of the greasy gravy. And after that she started on her potatoes with cheese, bacon and union like a starved animal and after she finished it she covered her burgers with a lot of mayonnaise and ketchup before they disappeared in her stomach. After that of course a second course until all the food would be inside her belly. She knew that no matter how much she ate she would never feel full.<br>\r\nAfter dinner grandma of course had something special. A delicious pie and a lot of whipped cream. After one taste of the cream Linda knew that it had a lot of sugar in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seemed like you really were hungry Nikki.\" Grandma said and gave her a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded happily when she suddenly noticed some relief an looked and saw the button of her pants popped of and her zipper was forced all the way down. Well she knew it would have happened at dinner. She wondered were the button went too. She knew her mother always tried to repair her clothes so relatives or friends could wear them or else she could always sell them.  <br>\r\nIt seemed like no one noticed and Nikki happy finished her piece of pie. Grandma put the rest of the pie back in the fridge. Nikki would rather have had another piece but knew she better could't push her luck. She already ate more food she normally had for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something you want too do before i put you in bath and after that straight too bed?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked around and smiled nice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i would like...\"</span></div></div>",

She got interested at those sites Julliet let her see and wanted to see more about fat and obese people that liked to gain and become fatter just like her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of sites do you two looked up?\" Grandma asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Julliet looked at the other. Thinking about what too say But Nikki did't want too lie too her grandmother and like she fed her she would't mind the sites. Maybe even like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her. It's fine i think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well after that argument we had i talked too Nikki and told her it's not healthy too be fat. But she told me she liked it and i found that hard too believe but i looked it up and it seems that there are a lot of woman that likes it to be fat and wants too become fatter. There are also man who likes them fat and feed them. There are a lot of these sites. I looked at some of them and well... I guess i learned a lot about fat people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Julliet that sounds interesting. could you tell me a bit more?\" Grandma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could better look at those sites. They tell a lot more about it. Look at feeders and feedees. That's what Nikki is a feedee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma stood up too get too her computer in her study room while Nikki and Julliet went too her room. Julliet took a chair from another room.<br>\r\nNikki's grand mother had two rooms each as big as a class room filled with bookcase's till the sealing filled with books. further the room had a lot of toys. Nikki played a lot with some of them and she sometimes still did. There were boxes with blocks, stuffed animals, small chairs and tables and normal ones, lambs, pillows, exercise tools, empty garbage bins, desks, comics, jars, a dummy, a small wooden figure people used to draw, tents, also a Indian tent, there was even a (empty) hand grenade and hundreds of other things grandma liked it to keep. Nikki even one found a pile of some small blackboards complete with a set of colored crayon's and a sponge still in plastic. <br>\r\nJulliet fast found a chair in all the junk and placed it by the computer and fast found the sites she visit before. She also read everything too Nikki since Nikki still had a bit trouble with reading. But listened and found it all very interesting. Also she loved the pictures she saw about fat woman who proudly showed their fat. Nikki thought how good it must feel too become so fat. <br>\r\nThen she saw a picture of a thin woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that picture doing there?\" She asked with a disgusted face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look this is how this woman looked a few years ago. Now pay attention.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clicked and suddenly she was a bit fatter, and again, and again until she was obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She first was so thin at the beginning and at the end she was like this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought about this. Then about herself. She looked at her fat body. She always had been fat but she was't so fat at first. The last time she gained more then in the years before thanks too Tina and Denvert. She also had gained as baby until now. She wished she could see her progress. Wait she could. Mama had a lot of photo albums. Grandma too. Maybe she could make something like that. One photo after another and look how she gained from time too time. She wanted too do that but decided it could wait. Until tomorrow at least.<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a knock at the door. Julliet fast clicked and the site shrunk and slid too the underside of the screen.<br>\r\nLinda opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nikki here you are. It's time for you too go in bath and after that straight too bed. Now shall i put you in bath or grandma?\" Linda asked while she already knew the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Now go find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked too her grandmothers study room seeing her look at the same sites like she and Julliet just looked at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma. It's time for bath and bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma looked up from the computer and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked too the bathroom and grandma filled the tub with water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw some of those sites. Seems like you're not the only one who want's to be a fat girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma washed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh grandma? Do you have photo's from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course dear. A lot. On the computer too. You parents send them too me. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow i want too do something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma was done washing Nikki and rubbed her dry and took her tooth brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me that tomorrow all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed Nikki's tooth and put her in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like a bed time story?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this story at one of those sites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki listened and enjoyed the story about how a girl got fatter and fatter and loved every moment about it. <br>\r\nAfter that grandma kissed her goodnight and Nikki fast fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

She even absent mindedly rubbed her big belly, which pushed her pajama top up quite a bit, as she slept. The fat 5 year old smiled as she lay there, dreaming about how cool it would be for her and Denvert to be the feeders and feedees she had seen on those sites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice as her dreams were, her hungry fat kid tummy woke her up with a loud growl. Still dazed from her sleep, it took Nikki a few seconds to figure out why her belly was so egger to eat, not that her fat belly wanting food was unusual for the little plumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then things became clear as the scent of a nice big breakfast filled her nose. The little fat girl sniffed the air happily as her big belly let out another massive growl. She grinned and rubbed her belly blissfully, loving how much more flesh was exposed from even a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hungry little poker got out of bed and landed on her feet, with a floor and belly shaking thud. She only grinned at this as she changed out of her pajamas into something that would fit over her poker frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this, she hurried as fast as she could downstairs. She knew that right after breakfast they were leaving. She was sad about that, but was happy as she was invited over to swim with Denvert today. Her mother was more than thrilled with this idea as she thought it would be a good way for her overly piggy daughter to loose some of the weight she knew her daughter was going to gain on this trip. Nikki of course knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen and was more than excited to see her boyfriend and show off her new pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fast as her little legs could move her tubby bulk, Nikki ran downstairs to get her fill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can go swimming today and... guess what, Tanja, Robbie and eh... little bit also come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great! I like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled. Nikki did't had good friends except eating until she met those kids at the grass field. Now she had Tanja, Robbie, Denvert and Nicole and even a new babysitter she liked. Maybe playing with her friends would let Nikki lose some weight.<br>\r\nGrandma made a omelet with five eggs, union, bacon,cheese, tomato and mushrooms. They were really good. <br>\r\nLinda did't understand why her mother in law used five eggs instead of one or two like you used for a normal 5 year old. But since they would leave soon and she did't want to leave arguing she kept her mouth shut. For now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're going swimming today!\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes grandma. Together with my friends.\" She took a bite from her omelet and looked at her grandmother and felt very sad. \"I will miss you grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Well you will come visit very soon again, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh.... Sure Linda said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma shoved some bacon on a plate for Nikki and also some bread drenched in butter and sugar just like Nikki liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let her enjoy  eating it and grandma giving since we will go soon.\" Linda mumbled so soft the others did't hear it. \"I think i'll go help your father. He's a total disaster with packing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she walked away grandma bend over too Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you had an idea yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Nikki said and even forget her breakfast for a moment. \"Well i would like to see some of my oldest photo's from since i was a baby until how i am now. So you can see my weight gain clearly. Is that wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all dear. I have enough photo's of you. I will ask Julliet to help me do that and post it too you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh grandma. 21st century. We have Internet now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Nikki. But i'm old. I sometimes just foget what we have and want too do it the old fashioned way. However i like DVD's they take less room and you can listen them in different languages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki finished her omelet and let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Excuse me.\" She said before she started wolfing down the bacon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was busy eating the bread Her parents came in and both took a toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mother but we need to go home. We have important things too do. Besides Nikki wanted too go too swim by her new friend so...\" Bram said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand honey.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they were ready to go. Even Julliet came out of bed too say goodbye. Grandma hugged Linda, Bram tight and Nikki even tighter.  <br>\r\nAll also hugged Julliet and waved while the drove away.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I always find it hard to leave my mother like that.\" Bram said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Don't worry. With the help of Julliet she'll do just fine.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki also found it hard to leave grandma but now she focused to go swimming with Denvert.</span></div></div>",

Everyone was already thinking about what was going to happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was more than happy to have left Bram\u2019s mother\u2019s place. She loved the dear woman, as was well as Julliet and was glad to have seen them. However, she knew how bad this weekend had been to her goal of getting her bloated little girl to drop some pounds. She knew all that non-stop high fat food and no exercise must have put a few good inches on the little child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed to herself as she came to the inevitable conclusion. All that food didn\u2019t help to satisfy the hungry child only made her blubber grow and increase her expectations for more food. She could only hope that all that swimming she was going to do today would help her loose a bit of the weight she had piled on in the two days they had been at the elder woman\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was also thinking about how large she had gotten over the time she had spent with her grandmother. However, she was much more happy about the outcome of her piggy eating. When she was sure her mother and father were looking elsewhere, she looked down excitedly at her big fat kid belly. She grinned and gave it a loving and testing poke. She could see the new layers of flab react to her light touch with a bounce of jiggling. Nikki giggled softly at that and couldn\u2019t wait to get into her two-piece bikini and show all her friends and her young crush how much she had gained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the car arrived home and Nikki waddled quickly to get changed into her bathing suit.

She also was't to happy that she wore a two-piece bikini that would clearly show every roll of fat but it would be just her friends so it would't matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you swim a lot. Lose a few of those extra pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you always teasing me with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki i'm not teasing you. Or i don't want to tease you. I just want what's best for you. best for you is if you would lose some weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at her mother. This sounded a lot more reasonable then normal. But anyway Nikki was't planning on losing weight. She would swim and if she lost any weight she would get it back with company.<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at Denvert's place she could already see her friends playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look who's also here. Did she feed you a tracking device or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stood up and saw what she mend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Tina is also here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked with Nikki into the garden. Little bit was the first one who noticed them and pulled Tanja's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look! It's Nikki.\" She yelled too the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked up just like the others. He smiled friendly in some swimming trunks what showed his belly and also a bit muscle from all the training he did. <br>\r\nNicole looked very sweet in a tight pink bathing suit. It seemed like she also gained a few pounds. <br>\r\nRobbie waved before jumping in the water with such a big splash it caused a mini tsunami that came right on Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nikki nice to see you again.\" Tina said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Linda asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well she wanted someone to keep an eye on little bit and Nicole. Those two can't swim yet, and i like it to swim a bit so it's a win-win situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine... but i don't want what happened before the first time i met you. If she get's a snack it's fine but not so much food to feed a whole orphan home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Tina said. If Linda would have put more attention to her she would have noticed the strange twinkle in Tina's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki nice to see you!\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also like it to see you.\" Nicole said. \"Look i gained, and i stopped doing ballet. The other girls were teasing me since they thought i was too fat. The teacher also said i was getting too fat too become a ballerina. Does't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since she met you she wants too be just like you. She tries to eat as much and as fatty food if she can without throwing up and does't do too much. I think she does look a lot better. I'm not sure what my mother thinks about it but at least she does't have to pay for those ballet lessons, shoes and clothing any more.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice that i have someone who wants to follow in my footsteps.\" Nikki said while she pulled out her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked with big eyes at his girlfriend standing for him in all her fat glory only wearing a two-piece bikini. Denvert could only see one piece of it since the bottom piece was't visible thanks too Nikki's rolls of fat, huge belly and tights. Denvert liked what he saw.<br>\r\nThe little Nicole also looked at Nikki from a short distance. When Nikki looked at her she knew she saw in the eyes of the little girl. Admiration and jealousy of being so fat. <br>\r\n In the meantime Linda was talking with Denvert's mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice she can come swimming here. She does't have that many friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem. I also like it. Denvert and Nicole need to leave most of their friends when we moved. Lucky we knew Tanja, Robbie and little bit and they knew a good babysitter. Tina is so nice too the kids. They all love her. Even Nicole who mostly had a bit trouble with babysitters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i know her. Oh don't forget if you give her food she never get's full. No matter how much you feed her. So don't give her too much.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked ad saw how Nikki jumped in the water causing a mini tsunami. She smiled since she thought Nikki finally had some good friends she could play with and lose some weight.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She found out pretty quickly how to float and was just lying their enjoying the sun on her big round belly, which stuck out of the water like a large fatty mountain. It looked as if it she was pregnant it was so large, but at the same time it held a softness to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one doing this.

She always liked it to fatten up kids and of course to touch and massage the fat and now she could do that with two kids. Of course Nikki was a first prize but Nicole sure was getting fatter and it Tina enjoyed it to also rub sun screen over Nicole's body especially her tummy.<br>\r\nShe took a look at Nikki. She would like to play the feeder game but that would be a bad idea since she knew Nikki's mother would be furious. She also did't think Denvert, Robbie, Tanja and Little Bit forget how angry her mother was last time. Besides Denvert's mother probably would be back pretty early and she did't think she could replace all the food before she came back and also Denvert's mom promised not to feed Nikki too much so except for Linda she also would have too face the rage of Denvert's mother .<br>\r\nOf course Tina would't have been Tina if she would't have some food in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cannonball!\" Nikki screamed loudly and jumped in the pool and caused a tsunami. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina and Nicole who were both next too the pool both got a wave of water over them. Nicole could't help and started to laugh. Tina also started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She  is so cool.\" Nicole whispered too Tina. \"When i met her i wanted to become a fat girl just like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So without meeting her you would't want too become fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole really needed to think about this answer. It took some time before she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think i finally still have wanted too become fat but not so soon. I want to be just like Nikki.\" She turned her head and saw Nikki floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went sitting and let her head rest against Tina's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But She's soooo fat! How can i ever become so fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it some time Nicole. You're still a little girl. You have years too gain. Don't forget Nikki is always hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but how can that be? I mean if your tummy is full it's full right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i looked that up and it could be Nikki has a problem with her brains. When your tummy is full it tells a part of your brain i'm full. But if that part does't work right you never are full. But maybe it's something else but i don't know what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish i had that. Then i could eat so much without getting full and get fat very fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fun but at the other hand you're always hungry. That's no fun. Image that. Always hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina. Do you want to help me too become fat?\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTina grinned widely what Nicole of course did't saw since her head still rested against Tina's chest. Tina's hands grabber a bit in Nicole's fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love too help you get fatter little piggy.\" She said happy.  </span></div></div>",

Both also enjoyed Tina\u2019s playing with Nicole\u2019s fat. Like Nikki, the little girl liked it when her tummy was played with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up at Tina and grinned very cutely at her. She could see how thrilled her request made her babysitter and was more than happy to make one of her best friends so joyful. Besides, Tina\u2019s approving look only confirmed that this was a good idea. Nicole had noticed that just about everyone liked how big she was getting. More importantly, she liked how cute she was getting with a nice big tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we play the feeder game, Tina? I\u2019m really hungry. \u2018Side\u2019s it will make me real fat.\u201d She said as she continued to look up at the teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina couldn\u2019t help but grin even more, seeing just how egger Nicole was to eat. She was starting to really become more like Nikki. Tina knew she both parents wouldn\u2019t really have any problems with her feeding Nicole.

We can play the feeder game.\u201d Tina said as she got up and went into the house for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to get working on all the food she knew all the children were going to want. She could still see everyone perfectly from the house, so she was okay with leaving the children swimming outside for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole went back into the water and floated over to where Nikki was.

Her mother would be furious if we did that. Besides if we feed her until she's full she'll eat up everything until the last crumb. But that Nikki can't play does't want too say Nicole can't play it. She can't eat as much if Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Feed me until i'm fat.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you want too become fat?\" Tanja asked. \"I know Nikki want too but i never knew you also wanted too become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i also want too become fat. So come on and feed me please. Make me fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i remember when Nikki played that game. But Nicole won't be able too eat as much if Nikki.\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad i'm kind of hungry.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i have some food in my bag. Go ahead and eat it but don't let you mother knew i gave you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Denvert found two pies in Tina's bag. Nikki looked smiling at them. She knew two pies would't be enough for her but at least she could eat something. Two pies in her huge belly would't be too noticeable too her mother. She hoped. <br>\r\nRobbie walked over too them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't feed you so much food but we can feed you two pies. Can i help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert thought one moment. He was't sure he liked another boy feeding his girlfriend but at the other hand Robbie was his friend and he did't seem to be interested in girls. At least not in the way of getting a girlfriend. Denvert just wanted Nikki too be happy. Nikki was happy is she was fed and if Robbie wanted too help him with it why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Sure i guess. Why not. How's my sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about her. Tina and Tanja make sure she's well fed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. You're ready Nikki?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i am. Come on and stuff me already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert and Robbie broke of lumps of the pie and pushed it in Nikki's hungry mouth. She chewed fast and swallowed it and Denvert and Nikki were both happy someone helped them. Nikki felt very happy. The only thing she did't like was that she knew that this would't take so long. But she did't want too think about this now. Now she just wanted to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole also felt very happy. Tina and Tanja fed her just as good if Denvert and Robbie fed Nikki. Nicole wanted so bad too get fat she chewed as fast if she could. She almost seemed like an eating machine. Her bowl pink cheeks did't stopped moving for a second.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i thought Nikki could pack it away but It seems Nicole has also a big stomach.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUURRRRRRRP!!! Come on keep on feeding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina poured the last pretzels out of a bag and a few seconds later Tanja pushed in the last cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait was that all the food i got.\" Tina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems so. She is really a fast eater.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she eat it all all ready? Even the donut's and the weenies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate the donut's about two minutes ago and the weenies were the third thing that were gone in her mouth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still could eat some more!\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just wait here i will get some more food.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina was so happy. She did't only had Nikki to fatten up but also Nicole. She knew that Nicole could never ever come close too how much Nikki would eat and she knew Nicole's tummy was almost full now but still she had an impressive appetite. Tina loved it.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The poor fat 5 year old had just finished eating down the two massive pies she had found in Tina\u2019s bag. They were delicious and did fill her a little, but she was fat and hungry. Two pies weren\u2019t going to be enough for her balloon of belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the idea hit her. Her young mind had formulated the plan perfectly, at least it seemed that way in her head. She grinned at both boys as she let out a nice big burp. She patted her big belly, as Denvert helped her explore the newly added pie fat, not being able to resist his love\u2019s growing belly. She looked over him and grinned, then grinned up at Robbie who was just happy from the game, not into feeding the same way Denvert was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know how we can play this game some more.\u201d She said slyly to both children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow?\u201d Denvert asked excitedly, wanting to see Nikki grow even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTina said I could eat anything in her bag, right.\u201d She said to both boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Robbie said back, not sure where she was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo when Tina brings out more food, all you have to do is fill up her bag and bring it over to me.\u201d Nikki said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys weren\u2019t sure how well this was going to work, but both did want to feed Nikki and were willing to give it a try. As Tina brought out the next batch of food and began to feed Nicole, both boys quietly filled up Tina\u2019s bag with as much food as they could and brought it back to Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew Nikki would eat the food the boys took too her. Just let her eat a bit more could't hurt. But she needed too be sure Nikki would't eat too much. She remembered how angry Nikki's mother was last time and everything was going so well lately. She was't planning to let it all be ruined by one feeding session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee i'm a hungry girl!\" Nicole said noticing Tina was lost in thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled and fed Nicole. Nicole must almost be full so she would't take more food so the boys would't fill her bag again. But still she kept an eye on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here comes some more.\" Denvert said while he slowly pushed a bounty in Nikki's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobbie looked at the food and looked with a pain full face at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure you mother won't notice all the food you ate?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki went sitting up straight.

I don't think my mother will notice. I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert and Robbie continued with their feeding while Tina hold one cookie above Nicole's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's belly was bloated and gurgled. There were crumbs all over her face. She looked at the cookie and felt her belly that was stuffed to the brim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... really... full... Tina. I can't... eat another... bite.\" Nicole managed too say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on. You know you want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked at the cookie and opened her mouth. Tina dropped the cookie in it and Nicole chewed a few times and swallowed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUURRRRRRRP!!! wow that's a relief.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled when she saw how the little girl was now almost squeezed in her bikini. Fast she took another look at Nikki and saw that the food in the bag was almost gone. She hoped Nikki's mother would't notice. After all it was't that much food.<br>\r\nThe kids all went back in the pool and Tina decided to do where she was here for and keep an eye at the two youngest kids. Especially at Nicole and the big belly of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki of course did't did any exercise. Not that Tina expected that. She also did't really hoped at exercise since Nikki would lose the weight but at the other hand her mother then would't notice that she had eaten. <br>\r\nShe wondered if the mother of Nicole would have any problem with the little Nicole fat. Well she would found that out soon enough.<br>\r\nNicole looked smiling at Nikki <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"See what a big belly i have.\" Nicole said too Nikki and rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also have a big belly.\" Nikki said while she showed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was jealous but knew how too hide it. After all Nikki had always been nice too her, besides she adored Nikki more or less.<br>\r\nThe two fat girls pushed their bellies to each other and rubbed the others belly. Tina enjoyed watching this so much it was hard for her to every now and then take a look at little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Niiki's the fattest girl ever.\" She suddenly heard a voice and saw Denvert who was sitting next too her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm not sure that's true. Nikki is just five you have teenagers who had a lot of extra years to fatten up... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then maybe the fattest five year old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's possible.\" Tina mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is't maybe the fattest girl yet but she can become that. I can help her with that! Too make her the fattest girl ever.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"I hope god will grand me to be there at that moment.\" Tina said dreamy.</span></div></div>",

He loved her, but he doubted that neither him or Robbie could carry her, let alone lift her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki layed flat on her back like Nicole did, her belly resting on her like a massive blob, and made noises similar to the ones Nicole made. Denvert and Robbie walked to her, and tried the same set up as with Nicole: Denvert gets the ankles, Robbie gets the wrists. Denvert grabbed his girlfriend's ankles, but she had too much meat on her bones for him to completely wrap his fingers around them. Robbie had no trouble. They tried their absolute hardest, but it was impossible; they couldn't even raise the tubby girl anymore than about an inch off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Nikki.\" said Denvert, \"I know you're big an fat, but my goodness you're so heavy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" said Nikki with a smile, accepting that statement as a compliment.</span></div></div>",

If this really becomes a long relation then she will come over here a lot. I know it's just puppy love but who knows. Maybe they stay in love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope they will.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However i'm a bit worried about Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly start too eat a lot and suddenly hardly moves. She did't that much exercise but now even less. She even stopped with ballet. Not that i'm so much worried about that. Kids can like something the first moment and not the next moment but she stops exercise, hardly moves and starts to eat even more. She was always kind of chubby but now she's really becoming fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't worry about it. She's just a growing girl. Maybe she has a bit of a growth spurt. She probably grows into it. A kid of her age normally knows when they have enough. So i would;'t worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled and stood up too help them when she saw they played the: save the whale game again.</span></div></div>",

Sure she could see how fat her little daughter was getting, and even a slight bit of weight added to her son. Even though he wasn\u2019t purposefully trying to gain, being around so much food had put on a few unintentional pounds on his frame. However, the pounds were really being packed on Nichole.

Maybe she wouldn\u2019t worry about her plump daughter\u2019s weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the door bell had sounded and Nichole\u2019s mother was brought out of her thoughts. She had ordered a number of pizza\u2019s for the group of kids, as well as Tina and the two parents. However, she wasn\u2019t sure this was going to be enough now that Nikki was over. She even looked a little worried as she paid the pizza man and got Tina to help carry the stack to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina on the other hand was more than thrilled that Nikki was joining them. She could tell that both chunky girls were going to be stuffed by this meal. She knew that Nichole\u2019s mother couldn\u2019t really deny Nikki so much food either, as this was going to be her dinner for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned slyly as she walked out to call the kids to dinner, wanting to see this next stuffing session play out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think i have enough with just a half pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really enough for you?\" Denvert's mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I'm... watching my... figure.\" Tina lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina knew how much other girls around her age were watching their figure some who did't even need too. So The mother of Nicole and Denvert believed it. Besides Tina could take something to eat when she would get home. Tina counted further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think almost one Pizza for Denvert and Nicole and Nikki... Well if Nicole really is eating more the normal i don't know how much she will eat, and Nikki would eat every pizza they have and still be hungry. Believe me that kid does't just have a big hunger but literally can't feel full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i heard that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the pizza's. Seven of them. Minus one for Robbie and Tanja and one for Tina who would probably give one slice too little bit and one for Denvert. That would be three pizza's. Four left. Nicole would probably eat two seeing what she was eating lately. And Nikki all what was left. She bought one pizza for herself and her husband. But i did't felt fair too the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what the kids can have all of them. I and Henk (name of her husband) can eat later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled knowing that with Nikki and Nicole there would't be a scrap left. A few seconds later all kids were inside still in bikini, swimming suit or swimming trunks looking what pizza too take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want this one! It has shrimps on it!\" Nicole yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robbie share a pizza Hawaii with me?\" Tanja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja and Robbie always had enough after a half pizza so they when they ate pizza they usually shared. Tina decided too take mozzarella and gave one slice too little bit and one pizza for Denvert and two for Nicole and two for Nikki plus what the others would't eat.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDenvert munched on his pizza but could't help too look at Nikki who clearly was really hungry. Nicole was also eating fast with a slice in each hand fast stuffing her face<br>\r\nTina ate slowly. Not too enjoy the pizza but she was watching Nikki and Nicole and every now and then a look at little bit to make sure the toddler would't choke. <br>\r\nTanja and Robbie also looked at the two fat girls who stuffed their faces while the slowly ate their half of the pizza. Also Denvert attention was with Nikki instead of his pizza. <br>\r\nWhen Nicole finished her first pizza and started on her second. Tanja and Robbie were done eating and so were Tina and Little bit. Denvert was busy with his last slice and Nikki already started at her second pizza. Tina had two slices left of her pizza and shove them too Nikki knowing she would eat them. <br>\r\nSlowly Nicole knew too finish of her entire second pizza. Tina could clearly see Nicole's bloated belly that stretched out her pink bathing suit. Good thing the made it of stretchy stuff else it would have ripped and she knew Denverts mother would have started too worry.<br>\r\nNikki had no problem eating her second Pizza and also the two last slices. She belched loudly what caused the others too laugh. Tina looked interested at Nikki's belly since she only wore a two piece bathing suit leaving her belly bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All gone.\" Nikki said with a smile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked at her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Tanja, Robbie, little bit your mother picks your up in a few minutes. Better get changed. I'll help little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four went outside while the other three stayed at the table. Partly because Nicole and Nikki did't felt much like moving after both bellies stuffed with Pizza but of course Nikki still had room for more food.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"When does you mother picks you up Nikki?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't... know.

The teen couldn\u2019t believe how lucky she was to have been placed in such a situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed how stuffed both looked. Nikki looked a little bloated, but knowing her, she could probably eat down another two big pizzas easily. However, it was Nichole she was more concerned about. The little one had been a bit hungrier than normal from all the playing she had done and wolfed down more than she was used to. She was breathing kinda heavy, not in pain, but just stuffed to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this, coupled with the fact that Denvert hadn\u2019t stopped staring at Nikki\u2019s perfectly round, unclothed belly that gave Tina an idea. She slowly got up until she was standing right behind Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow you two like it if me and Denvert rubbed your tummies?\u201d She said startling Denvert out of his fat induced trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone lit up at the idea.

Even through the swimsuit, which looked as though it was going to burst from the fat little toddler tummy inside, Tina could feel every pound the little fat child had put on. She greatly enjoyed rubbing over the large dome and could tell from the happy expression on Nichole\u2019s face, she also liked this experience quiet a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey weren\u2019t the only ones having a great time. Denvert instantly began rubbing his young whale of a girlfriend\u2019s belly. He was even more fortunate than Tina. Not only because of how much fatter Nikki\u2019s belly was, but the very fact that big round dome was free of any swimsuit covering it, since Nikki was in a bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little boy was going to take full advantage of this and did his best to explore every nook and roll on Nikki\u2019s every growing belly.

She had barely moved an inch for the two hours she sat on that couch. Actually, she seemed to have slumped even lower than before; she was now almost flat on her back. With notable effort, she stood up and walked out of the room and into the hallway, towards her own bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked into her bedroom. Bram was sitting on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what I'm going to do Bram...\" said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it this time?\" Bram asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting very worried about Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram groaned, \"You're always worrying about Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" said Linda, \"and I know that the doctor we went to said she was healthy, but that was weeks ago. Nikki's gotten so much bigger since then. I mean, look at her, she's growing everyday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram sighed, \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just not natural.\" said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, her eating habits aren't really the best neither,\" said Bram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a matter of what she eats,\" said Linda, \"it's how much and how often. She's always hungry and is never full, and on top of that, she'll eat almost anything she's given. I'm scared for her life, Bram, and I don't know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram looked at his wife, and saw tears swelling up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt her,\" said Linda, her voice starting to shake, \"but I don't want her to hurt herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram stood up and stepped towards Linda, giving her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know,\" Bram whispered, \"but sometimes, you have to do things you don't want to do. I think the reason she can eat so much is because you allowed her to, and now her stomach can stretch extremely. I think the best thing that can be done is to put a cap on how much she eats now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stood in the center of her bedroom, wearing her pajamas. The shirt didn't cover much of her belly; the bottom button sat directly above her belly buttom. The shirt also didn't have any slack at all, it was perfectly skin tight. It's a wonder how none of the buttons popped off yet, though that bottom one didn't even look attached. The pants didn't fair much better. Nikki didn't even bother trying to tighten them; her large waist and thighs filled out the pants almost too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki couldn't help but grin at this. She certainly wasn't going to tell her mother about this; she wants to see her body when she's about to go to sleep, end the day on a good note. She got into her bed and pulled the covers over her body. She raised a hand at the lightswitch and shut the lights off. She then turned onto her back and closed her eyes, blissfully rubbing her massive belly as she drifted off into sleep.</span></div></div>",

Nikki was't so bright in the morning but even she noticed something was't normal. <br>\r\nHer eyes flew open. Everywhere in her room was food. Next too her bed, on her desk, on the windowsill. There were even put a few extra tables filled with food. Nikki was't tired any more. She was hungry. Her belly rumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i'm hungry. Look at all this delicious FOOD! Look good wants soon it's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki started too eat like she was't fed in days. She wolfed all the food down. Plate after plate eating faster then she would be able too do for real. <br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened. Nikki looked up and saw her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nikki good you're up. Better fast eat that up Honey. You don't wanna become skinny do you? After this little appetizer we have the real breakfast. If you're done you will get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki continued eating and felt how her pyjama stretched more over her body. She did't understand what her mother mend by: You will get dressed . Now she thought about it her mother was also dressed way different then normal. In a beautiful dress.  Nikki could't remember her mother ever before wore that dress. She did't often wore such a pretty dress. Except on parties. So what was going on?<br>\r\nThen the buttons of her pyjama popped of one by one but she just kept eating, and eating, and eating. <br>\r\nThe plates were cleaned and she was done very soon if you knew how much there were.<br>\r\nNikki felt very good even while her pyjamas pants were ripped and shirt did't had a single button left. The door opened and in came Tina. Strangely dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tina. What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello your highness. Well i'm here too dress you of course and everything else what you want. I'm your personal servant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your highness?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. You're the obese princess off our country. You need to become so big and fat like no one before you did. You need too eat a lot. Your parents want you to gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My parents encouraging my weight gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course obese princess. Everyone does. Other countries are jealous they don't have such a fat princess like you. Come on princess. It seems like you did't gain the last time. Your parents won't be pleased. We need to do a lot of extra eating to make that up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I will eat a lot. Way and way more then normal too make up!\" Nikki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did't knew what happened but she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina opened her closet and she saw the most beautiful and biggest dresses ever. Made for obese girls like her. She loved them. Tina picked out one and helped her get dressed. <br>\r\nAfter she was dressed they walked out and Nikki noticed they were't in her old house anymore. This was a palace. A real palace and all doors and hall were wide like a real fat person lived here.<br>\r\nNikki looked around here. It was beautiful here. Just like she wanted her house to be. Not that she would be ever able to get such a house like this.<br>\r\nTina lead her too a room with a table full with food. Her parents looked like king and queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dear daughter. Fine your there. You don't want you breakfast to get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Nikki could't believe it. The table had enough food for several families and her parents want here to eat it all. Well after all she was the obese princess.<br>\r\nSuddenly Robbie and Tanja came out another room with between them Nicole also in a princess dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave some for your little sister.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nNicole is my sister now. Why not. It looks like Tina, Tanja and Robert were the personal servants of here and Nicole. But where was Denvert in this dream?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry up with your breakfast princess. You need too be done when prince Denvert arrives.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled widely and started too stuff her face. This world was perfect for her.   <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

We get to go to a buffet and I can eat all I want?\u201d She asked hopefully and very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda only sighed at her eagerness to pig out.

Then I\u2019ll take you to get some new cloths.

Hoping nothing embarrassing would happen like Nikki bursting out of her clothes.<br>\r\nWhen they walked in Nikki saw the manager. It was obvious that he recognized her. He dropped his pencil and note book and started too make strange coughing sounds. Nikki smiled a bit mean back. When they walked past the men Nikki could't resist too say: \"Men i'm starving. I'm really hungry. I need a lot of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with that man there Nikki? Do you know him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Never saw him in my entire life.\" Nikki lied with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda knew Nikki well enough too knew she was't telling the truth but also knew that if she told it with such a wide grin it was't anything important. She hoped.<br>\r\nNikki fast decided to take the same dinner like last time. Linda only took a small meal. After someone took their orders Linda looked at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki i saw that you took an all you can eat buffet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said i could eat as much if i liked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then there would't be a single crumb left. I wanted that you eat a lot not eat then out of business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they won't let you eat them out of business.\" Nikki mumbled angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? They won't let eat you out of business, and how do you know that may i ask? I know for sure i never took you here before. So?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well remember i was with Denver and Nicole and their grandmother took us out here. Well the manager was't really happy with what i ate or more how much i ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many plates were that?\" Linda said trying to stay calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember. But somewhat around... thirty or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda need to do her best not to scream too Nikki. No wonder Nikki got fatter everyday. Everyone was busy fattening her everyday. That's why she was gaining a such a high rate<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know what. I still want to go clothes shopping and i want your belly is bloated so that we have extra room to grow then we hopefully be able to were the longer then just a week.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki happy grinned at her mother and made herself ready too eat.</span></div></div>",

She was VERY hungry from her whole night without something to fill her fat young tummy. Now that her mom said it was okay, she wasn\u2019t going to hold back. She was going to eat and eat and eat some more until she either closed the place or they kicked her out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer plans might have been foiled too. Not by her unhappy mother, but by the buffet owner. He knew this girl was trouble from the first moment he laid eyes on her. In his business, he gained a 6th sense about these sorts of things. True, it was mostly fat adults and teens that caused him the most grief, but he knew more than a few fat children who would be delighted to gobble up everything in his restaurant, burp, and ask for more food. He even had to permanently ban one family after their chunky son and daughter, both only slightly older than Nikki, had eaten non-stop from the start of breakfast until the middle of lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was planning on watching this new little poker very closely. However, he soon had to leave for a family emergency. He didn\u2019t even have time tell the other members of his staff that it was okay to kick the fat little bottomless pit out if she ate too much. He hoped this little girl would be kind and not eat him out of business as he rushed out the door, leaving no restrictions on the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie grinned as the first 2 plates of her meal, this time breakfast themed, were placed in front of her and Linda. The hungry big-tummied girl only paused to lick her lips, before diving into the tasty plate filled with pancakes, bacon, sausages and eggs. She was already waving one of the waiters over to ask her to bring her another plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wondered what to do now. Of course it was his daughters choice but he was't sure if she could raise a child. But at the other hand his daughter believed in god. According to the bible killing is a sin. All right maybe it was't really alive but since that little ball of cells would become something alive she saw taking it away like killing.<br>\r\nHe totally forget it all when he walked back in and saw Nikki. His eyes almost popped out of his head. Nikki was still chewing when she noticed the owner and smiled. His face got purple. She knew he would like it to hit her but also knew he could't do that. He looked at the about forty empty plates next to Nikki. Nikki was busy cleaning another plate looked up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D... d... don't... you... think... you... have... eaten... enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought this was an all you can eat... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have eaten enough! Now get out and NEVER COME BACK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's very rude!\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she and Nikki walked out and too the car. Linda saw how every roll of fat on her little daughter jiggled like jello. Slowly they got in the car.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well i think you're full enough now to buy some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not full. I'm never full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that's right, You're never full. That's why you're so fat. Since you always eat because you're hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sound like if i like it.\" Nikki said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you liked it to be fat.\" Linda said looking smiling at her daughter. \"Or is't being fat as much fun if you thought?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i like being fat and round and soft. Being fat is fun but i was talking about always being hungry or do you think i like it? I never feel full. Always i hear i eat to much but no matter how much i eat i never feel full. I hear stories and cartoons were people say i'm stuffed but no not me. Everyone can eat until they can't eat another bite except for me. If you're hungry you eat something and it's over but i'm still hungry. All those times i've hunger pains because i'm still hungry. Do you think i like that. I would give anything to feel full like any normal human. Yeah i like being fat and i'm partly fat because i'm always hungry. But that does't want to say i like being always hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked with big eyes at Nikki. She never really thought about Nikki this way. She knew she was always hungry but she never knew Nikki did't liked it. But now she thought about and tried to image how it must be too be always hungry. She must admit if she was always hungry she also would't like it. Only food made her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know i never knew that. I thought that you liked it since you can eat then and become fatter and you said you liked being fat. I never knew you did't liked being always hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are thousands of people who are also fat! But they also are full once but they're also able to be fat. You don't have to stay hungry if you want to be fat. It's easier maybe but it's no fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda felt bad for Nikki. Always she was angry at her for eating so much and for being always hungry but it was never her choice. If you're always hungry and you're a adult you maybe could resist the urge too eat but Nikki was just a toddler. They don't have such a strong will power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You knew i never knew that. I just always wanted a slender kid. But you'll never will become slender. But at least it's not entirely your fault. That does make me feel a lot better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like it too feel full. Just for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe there's a way. I don't know. But first we need to go clothes shopping. Come on. We're here.   </span></div></div>",

I could ask Denvert's parents to help fund you a special party. It will be all food. Pizzas, snacks, pies, pastries, McDonalds, as much food as we can get get, and it'll be all for you.

Sweetykins, your going to be full! You're mommy promises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki didn't know what to say. So she burst out crying. Crying tears of joy. The prospect of so much food was delightful, but what that wasn't why. Her mother, who had always done nothing but complain about her weight and eating habits, was finally supporting it, and for the first time in quite a while, she seemed genuinely happy. Linda unbuckled herself and Nikki and picked her daughter up, embracing her in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there Nikki. Momma's gonna teach that mean old belly not to mess with her little girl!\" She pretended to throw a few punches at the doughy gut, like a superhero on TV. Nikki's tears began to dry up as she and her mother forgot about the hunger pains and began to play Momwoman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram was just serving dinner as Linda and Nikki arrived home. It was very surprising to see his wife holding up their several hundred pound daughter and fly her into the room like she did when she was younger (and lighter).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you two seem happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we are, Daddy.

But Momwoman tied them all up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" He picked his daughter up, struggling all the while, as he looked at Linda with sheer surprise. \"What's all this about, Linda?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bram, I finally saw things from Nikki's point of view. I have never been so happy to be a mother! It's like up until now I've been babysitting. Nikki is our daughter and by god, I'm gonna make up for all the cruel diets I tried to put her through!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have this idea. It's a little crazy, and it'll probably get us and our friends in some financial trouble but it's for Nikki. You ready to hear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Nikki sweetheart, do you want to start dinner without Mommy and Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be with you in a second, swety. Well Bram, it goes kinda like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda spent a few minutes explaining to Bram her plan to help Nikki's suffering. He seemed somewhat concerned. Linda was surprised at this, he had always been so mellow about Nikki's eating. But then again,never before had it threatened their lives financially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to do it for her. She deserves it Bram, after all my insensitivity about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Linda, that is an interesting idea. Are you sure you think we can recover from it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With some extra work, yes. I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, I have no choice. Nikki is getting a Banquet for her Birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was sneakily eating her dad's steak when she heard this. She instantly ran out screaming in delight. \"REALLY! HOLY COW! THANK YOU DADDY! THANK YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a tackling hug, and almost pushed him over. \"It's no problem sweety. But you're birthday isn't for a few more days. Mom and dad will have to set things up first. Maybe Denvert's parents don't want to spend money feeding you so much.\" Nikki's eyes almost changed to a sad look, so he quickly recovered, \"But it's no matter, because if they don't, we'll just put in some extra effort.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was so excited, she almost (almost) forgot to go back and finish her dad's steak. Linda and Bram gave each other a look. Both had different layers of emotion on them, but both knew one thing was for sure. Nikki would never be quite the same after this birthday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day both Linda and Bram were planning on getting things set up for the party. Bram was even beginning to call others and organizing things a bit. Linda was hoping this was this would make up for not being so sensitive to her daughter\u2019s feelings. However, the woman still wasn\u2019t thrilled about her daughter\u2019s eating habits and was planning on cutting down on the food after the party and getting her some real help. She might be feeling hungry all the time, but that didn\u2019t mean she had to get so fat, especially if she would feel hungry no matter how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Linda put these thoughts out of her mind for the moment as she had remembered that the whole reason they had gone out yesterday was to get her growing little girl some new clothes. With all the commotion, she had completely forgotten about doing so and was planning on taking her big bellied girl to get something nice for the party. So after a nice big breakfast, Linda put Nikki in the car and they were off to the plus size kids store at the local mall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was happy her mother was beginning to see things her way\u2026she hoped. She was hoping Linda would be more inclinded to feed her more food and more often her since she didn\u2019t like being hungry. However, what she told her mother was only a half truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki knew that she had never been truly satisfied and completely \u201cstuffed\u201d with food. However, the young girl also knew that stuffing her face enough DID take the grand majority of her hunger away. She still always had room for one more helping of food, but she did feel a great deal of \u201csatisfaction\u201d from her stuffing and loved doing it quite a bit. However, she knew her mom might be a little less than thrilled about letting her do so if she knew that, and kept THAT part of the story inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon their car pulled up at the mall which contained the plus sized children\u2019s store. The stuffed 5 year old couldn\u2019t help but grin at this. Not so much from the shoping she was going to do, which she did enjoy. It was more the fact that she was so fat that she had to shop at a special store for fat kids. Not only this, but she was so fat that she had to go back to the store so soon because she had already outgrown the fat kid clothes she had gotten before and they couldn\u2019t contain her massive young tummy. She grinned quite a bit at this thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she found herself holding onto her mommy\u2019s hand as she was led into the store. She smiled happily as she went past the smaller childrens\u2019 plus sizes into the largest section they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh as this happened. Sure she was going to be a bit more understanding of her daughter, but she still hated how larger her poor little girl had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuzie grinned as\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The owners knew that kids at Nikki\u2019s size got winded pretty quickly and wanted to make sure they had plenty of seats waiting for them. Nikki was glad too as she didn\u2019t feeling like standing and walking over to each rack with her mother. She much preferred to just sit on the armless chair and have her mother bring the clothes over to her. Not only that, but sitting like she was helped to show off her round young tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda could only sigh as she watched her daughter take a seat, the chair groaning as she did so. She could tell her porker of a daughter wasn\u2019t getting up anytime soon either by the contented look on her face. She probably would have made a bigger deal out of this, but she remembered the talk she had with Nikki and desided to just let this one slide as she began looking through the XXL little girls clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki just grinned as she watched her mother riffle through the racks. She could see just how wide all the clothes were and was so happy. She loved having her belly this big and LOVED being this fat. She couldn\u2019t wait to show off this new added poundage at her party either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then the little girl\u2019s thoughts were broken as she heard another girl sit down in the chair next to her own, agin having that chair groan as her bottom was plopped against the wood. She looked over at the girl. The tubby child was panting as she sat their, obviously worn out from her trip into the store. She was around 7 years old and had blonde hair done up in a pony tail and blue eyes. She was currently sporting a pink dress that looked about 2 sizes too small and it was easy for anyone who saw her to see why. Not only did this little girl have a nice layer of fat covering every part of her, but also sported a very large, slightly \u201changing\u201d, belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki could tell the girl\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... my name is Nikki and eh... i'm always hungry.\" The reason she told this was since she could see that the girl liked it to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that. You're pretty fat! No hard feelings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i like being fat! Besides you're also pretty fat so... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl started to laugh and looked smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're not the only one. I know i'm fat but i like it to be fat. I just hated that my clothes are so tight and rip of so fast. That's hard about being fat. By the way my name is Sandy. The also nicknamed me: Sumo Sandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki remembered seeing sumo wrestling once on T.V. Not that she liked sport or watching sport so much but seeing so fat people was something that interested her.<br>\r\nShe looked smiling at the girl. It was strange that in her entire class she never even met one kid that liked fat and since that lucky day they went for a pick nick and met people who liked it. First Tanya and Robbie and thanks to that Denvert and through him Nicole and thanks to all of them Tina. Well she did't really knew if you could call Tina a friend. It was a big difference in age but anyway they liked each other. Now she met again someone who liked it to be fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda in the meantime looked for some clothes. Maybe it was better that Nikki sat down. Taking Nikki with her could become difficult if she did't want too. Besides it did't hurt anyone if she sat down. She had some clothes for Nikki. But she still looked for some nice clothes for the party. Even while she knew they would rip during the party. Not that it was that big of a problem. She was good at sewing. Thanks to her mother. Always handy If you can repair you own clothes she told her, and she must admit she was right. Even without Nikki's expanding body that ripped of clothes and popped off buttons every now and then she and Bram also had some clothes that need some repairing and even Nikki had some clothes that needed to be repaired that had nothing to do with her girth. Mostly it did but not always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad my mother learned me sewing... \" She stopped when she remembered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy not asked her mother and father for help at the party? She had't seen them in a long time. That was partly because they lived very far away.<br>\r\nBut they loved Nikki. Their first grandchild. They had never seen a problem with Nikki's weight. Her mother was really a grandmother with the idea of a child need to be well fed. They visit them sometimes. Maybe she could ask them too come over for the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she bumped against another woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i'm so sorry. I was lost in thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too. Well me too. It's no problem. I'm Maxime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda suddenly  saw a nice dress with flowers and picked it up for Nikki. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Eh... I'mLinda. Good! Well Nice to meet you. I need to get back to my daughter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Nikki with the other girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. It seems our daughter's also met the other. At least I assume that's your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yes she is. What a nice daughter you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sandy even has her own job. Her weight helps her with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really what is it?\" </span></div></div>",

She thought there was no way this child could be a model! All the children she had ever seen in ads or on TV were always thin and acted very cutely. She could see that Sandy looked cute but she was possibly one of the fattest girls she had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine frowned a little bit at the woman\u2019s reaction to what she had said.

However, she had met the mothers of a lot of overweight children before and could tell that Linda was the type who wasn\u2019t overly thrilled by how large her daughter was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she could tell something else as she looked back at the two tubby little girls while she prepared her own pile of clothes for Sandy. She could see by the way Nikki was smiling and \u201cshowing off\u201d her weight to Sandy, that Nikki did enjoy being so big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, both mothers put this out of their minds for a moment as they both had finally gotten enough clothes for their obese little girls. Together, the two mothers headed back to see Nikki and Sandy who, from the looks of it, were becoming fast friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides the extra money would be nice for after the party. At least then they still would have some money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your daughter. As a model. Well i think she can. She looks good and they're always looking for young model's. For some reason not many mother's want their child to be a plus size model. But they do buy the magazines too find nice clothes for their kids. Hypocrit's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you could give her a job as a model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not me. But my boss could. I sure think he will be very interested in her. How fatter the kid is how better. You know... big is beautiful or bigger is better. That's how he thinks. I could of course advice my boss to take you but i don't think i have too. I'm sure my boss will love your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really well thank you.

Then you can tell me when the birthday party exactly is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked back to were Nikki and Sandy were and saw how they were playing with the other's fat. Both were giggling and seemed to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so nice. They look so cute together. Maybe they can make a shoot together. If my boss takes you you could ask him. I'm sure he likes it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thank you for everything. I call you too tell you when the party is.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Good. I see you soon. Come on Sandy we need to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that Sandy rather stayed with Nikki but with a disappointed face she said goodbye and waddled away with her mother. <br>\r\nLinda at the other hand was thinking what to do now. It was still pretty early. She could try too already ask if Nikki could become a model but at the other hand who knew how big and fat Nikki would be after her birthday.

Besides, she wasn\u2019t going to loose all her weight in 3 days\u2026or any weight knowing Nikki.

I did't knew there were models for that or else i would have made you a model a long time ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am i model now then?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not yet. I want to wait until after the party since after that you might be way fatter. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki smiled happy. Normally she could't wait until her birthday but now even less. She knew she would't get any other presents but being full for once was enough for her. However she wondered how much she could eat. She knew it would be a lot. There was one other big difference. At this birthday Denvert would come with Nicole, also Tanja and Robbie and Tina and Sandy. Before she met them she did't had any friends. Now she thought about it she noticed how lonely she had been. This was her first birthday with friends who were't family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Nikki. You're looking so strange suddenly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i was thinking this is my first birthday with friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm glad you finally have some. I thought that that maybe could have something to do with it. You know eat because you have no friends to play with and eat because you feel lonely and want to fill it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That never was the reason. I was just hungry. I mean if your kid is hungry you feed it. Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course but normally those children Don't eat enough for a whole playground.\" Linda said, but now on a friendly tone with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made a huge different for Nikki if her mother said it angry on a tone like if she did nothing then eating food or a friendly tone like she ate more but that was just how she was. Nikki liked this new change in her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Nikki we're home. Oh and Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to still fit those new clothes at your birthday  please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki looked at her mother. She was very nice for her lately. Besides she could try to eat a bit less so she would't outgrow her new clothes. Besides she also would't like it if she would be naked at her birthday <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom. I won't. Oh and Mommy... I would like to become a fat model.\"   </span></div></div>",

Of course this was mostly in her belly, since 95% of her fat was in her big round belly. Of course she did have a nice big layer of flab over the rest of her body as well, and was delighted to see how it moved as she got out the vehicle with the clothes she just bought. She was so happy to see how big she, the soon to be pretty model, had become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was the only person out of the two who was joyful about this. Linda frowned at how much her big bellied fat daughter was getting. She might have acted happy on the outside, but she was far less than thrilled on the inside. She had to find a way to get Nikki\u2019s weight down. I mean, she was becoming so big that even the fattest fat little girl clothes weren\u2019t really fitting her anymore. She had to think of something and soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked into the house, Nikki instantly looked up at her mother with a big smile on her face. It wasn\u2019t just from her thinking about becoming a model or her upcoming birthday. It was from the fact that she knew it was time for lunch. Her belly also helped to indicate this fact by letting out a loud growl in anticipation of the upcoming meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda got the hint Nikki was giving her, and nodded at Nikki. Even though Linda was trying to be more supportive, she couldn\u2019t help but let out a saddened sigh as she lead the tubby little girl into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then you will get stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I'm really happy you do this for me. I hope i can finally feel full. I would like it to feel that for once. How does it feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like you can't eat another bite. You feel completely satisfied and i personally can think of food at those moments. Everyone has that. It depends of how much they can eat. But finally they feel full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone except me. Well at my birthday that will hopefully change. Then i can finally feel full for once. After that i can become a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that after feeling full you could try too cut back a bit.\" I would like it that you could also try too lose a bit weight after that. Will you try to do that for me?\" Linda asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a bit of a dilemma for Nikki. She was't planning on losing any weight. But at the other hand her mother would feed her at her birthday until she felt full and she asked so friendly she could't say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... maybe... I can... but...\" Nikki looked painful at Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled friendly and walked out the room. Nikki was glad she did so she did't need to finish her answer. She also did't really lied. She did't said she would lose weight only that she could try, maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked upstairs. Fine Nikki never felt full and that she did't liked that and that she never thought of that before still it gave her a bit of a guilt feel that kept nagging on her. Anyway Nikki would feel full at her birthday. She promised herself that. But after that. Nikki always told her she liked being fat. But she could't really accept that. Fat was unhealthy. At the other hand that doctor said she was healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do i let my own daughter get fat yes or no?\" She asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure she loved Nikki. It was her own daughter. Her little girl. Suddenly she remembered when Nikki was born. A healthy girl with a weight that was about two or three pounds higher then normal but still a healthy weight. How Nikki was born and how cute she was. No one except she was allowed hold her. Else she started too cry. She drank awfully lot of milk. Other mother's were surprised since some of them not even finished their bottle. After she started to eat solid food she really started too pack on the pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered once seeing a report about a woman who loved her son and her son became so fat he was immobile. He died before he even turned thirty. She did't want that too happen too Nikki. Nikki was her only child.<br>\r\nNow she thought about that maybe she also needed to start thinking about taking a second child. Of course not to replace Nikki but a second child would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do i do with Nikki. She wants too become fat and i want her too be happy, but i don't want her to be fat since i don't want her too die at young age. It's so complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered how it would be if Nikki was't always hungry. Maybe then she did't became fat. Who knew. <br>\r\nShe realized she need too think about this again. She never thought about let Nikki become fat but as she was happy that way... but then she also would be unhealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to talk with Nikki about this again.\"</span></div></div>",

Nikki was lying on her back on her bed, with her shirt rolled up a bit so she could see all there was to see with her round belly with which she played with and jiggled. Linda sighed and opened the door enough to walk in, and Nikki noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki,\" Linda softly said, closing the door, \"we need to talk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sat up pulled her shirt over her large stomach and hugged it as if to protect it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Nikki, I don't want to hurt you. You're the only child I have and I want you to be as happy as you can be, that's all that matters to me. But you need to understand, I know you love being fat, I know you love all there is to love about it, but you must understand Nikki that you can't keep getting bigger and bigger like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's face turned into a very worried expression, \"Why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...It's just not healthy. I know the doctor said you were healthy, but that was almost a month ago. You've gotten much larger since then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Nikki said nothing, Linda continued, \"And to be honest Nikki, even if you're still healthy now, even if you're still healthy after your birthday, there's no way you'll stay healthy for much longer...In fact, I read a report about a mother who spoiled her son so much that he became immobile; he couldn't move. He didn't even live to become thirty years old. Nikki, I don't want that to happen to you, I can't have that happen to you. It just bites me whenever I remember that report, because when I do, I can't help but imagine that the same thing will probably happen to you one day Nikki...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears began to well up into Linda's eyes. Seeing her mom on the verge of crying put Nikki into a similar position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I...I like being fat.\" Nikki said, nearly sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but do you really need to be <i>this</i> fat?\" Said Linda, \"You're obese Nikki. Even if you like being fat, you don't need to be this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...I like being this fat...I want to get fatter...\" Nikki softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to end up like that boy?\" Linda asked. Nikki's eyes widened. Within the next few seconds, Nikki began crying. Linda sat on Nikki's bed and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, it's ok it's ok.\" Linda softly said, trying to comfort Nikki, \"We can find a decent medium where you can be fat and still healthy. You will need to lose quite a bit of this belly here, but Nikki, I swear, you will not be skinny. You can still be fat, just not as fat as now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I...\" Nikki started, starting to calm down, \"Can I still get stuffed full on my birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Nikki of course.\" Said Linda, \"I'll make sure your full before we start making you lose weight ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't know if I can...\" Said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and daddy can. We'll just cut off some of your food intake and keep you from sitting around all day. I know you don't like exercise, but it's not much, you can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will still be fat right?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nikki, I know you love being fat too much. I will make sure you don't loose too much. I swear Nikki, you will still be fat. You will never be skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...how much weight do I have to lose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda put a finger onto her chin in thought, \"Stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did as she was told and stood up on the floor. Linda took a good look at Nikki's belly and reached for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think enough weight for your belly to shrink...\" Linda said, poking her finger into the side of Nikki's belly, about an inch and a half away from front, but still a good several inches from her back, \"to here. That's quite a bit of weight to lose, but you'll still have some fat there. Like I said, you won't be skinny, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki cringed when she realized how much weight she had to lose, how thinner she needed to get. Like her mother said, she wasn't going to be skinny; she would still be far from it. It just saddened Nikki to know that she's not going to get any fatter. But the more Nikki thought about it, the more fair it seemed to her. Most importantly, hearing that story about that boy did scare her. She wanted to get fatter, but she didn't want to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChubby will have to do.</span></div></div>",

She also felt very calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki Your father and i need to go for a while. We'll be back late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am i home alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Tina promised she would come in less then a half hour. Dinner is in the microwave. Love you Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki continued watching cartoons. But soon she heard the doorbell and opened it. She smiled when she saw Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. How's my favorite gaining girl?\" She said happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile faded when she saw a painful look at Nikki's face. She slowly stroke about her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't tell me you had a fight with your mom again about your weight. I really hate it when that happens. But hey she will still stuff you at your birthday right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lead Tina to the living room and both went sitting on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was't really a fight, and yeah she will still stuff me at my birthday. But it was't a fight but... a talk. You know ever since i told her i don't like being hungry all the time she really changed. At least she seems to accept it more. Anyway today she talked with me about that I like being fat. She agreed that i could be fat but not as fat if I am now. She once saw a story about a mother who fed her son so much he was immobile and he died before he was thirty. She doesn't want that too happen too me, and too be honest i also don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina remembered that report. She followed every report and talk show about overweight people. She looked sad at Nikki. afraid that she might lose her favorite gaining girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you mean? Do you want to stop gaining and lose weight and become thin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly. I will never ever become thin. I will always be a fat girl but i'm afraid that i will be not as fat if i am now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wanna really lose weight?\" Tina asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but i don't wanna die before I'm thirty! I wanna become a bit older then that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked at Nikki. A bit confused. Everything that Nikki told was the same for her. Both wanted Nikki fat but both did't want Nikki to die at a young age. Tina loved feeding little kids but also knew enough that to much weight could lead too death. She forget that part with Nikki a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand. I also don't want you or Nicole to die at young age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't need to reach the age of hundred but at least about seventy so i can see my kids and grand kids. Well guess they will also become fat. I like being fat and become fatter but my mommy was right in one way. I'm healthy for now but once my weight will become so high that it becomes unhealthy. I don't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i understand. I liked fattening you but i also don't want you unhealthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will Denvert think? And Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They both love you. They rather have you alive and thinner then fatter and death, and as long if you still stay fat he will still think you're attractive. Your mother said you would still be fat but not as fat if you're now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. So I guess everything's all right. Oh besides.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bram drove up to his house. Nikki was in the car with him, in the back seat. The seat belt rested under her belly, which had to be done to get it to fasten; it couldn't reach around Nikki's massive belly. Nikki smiled upon seeing her home, because she knew the party was being hosted at her house, and that her birthday was today. This was the day that she would eat more at once than ever in her life. This was the day she would be able to freely eat and eat and eat without having to worry about being hounded on about it. But most importantly, this was the day she was going to be <i>stuffed</i>, stuffed full. Stuffed until not a bite could possibly fit. Stuffed until her belly became as tight as a drum. Stuffed until she would reach her limit. She was finally going to be <i>full</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them had left to get Nikki a shirt and a pair of pants just for the party, as both Bram and Linda knew that Nikki would probably tear through her regular clothes by the time the party was over. This new outfit consisted of a baige pair of shorts that where just big enough to actually hold itself around her waist without constricting it. The shirt was black, so stains wouldn't be obvious, and was so much larger than her that it practically made her look <i>smaller</i>. Not to mention, when Nikki tried it, she felt like she was sort of swimming in it. Nikki wasn't wearing this outfit now - she was going to change into them when it was time for her big feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing excited to see all her friends and the food, Nikki quickly unbuckled her seat belt and got out of the car the instant Bram pulled his keys out of the ignition and picked up her new outfit. Nikki ran, or whatever you would call it, straight to the front door and knocked it. Within a few seconds, the door was opened by a rather familiar boy - Denvert. Nikki gasped and lunged at Denvert, wrapping her chunky arms around him in the warm and loving embrace known as a hug. Nikki was caught in such a wave of happiness just from seeing Denvert that she didn't even notice everyone else screaming \"Happy birthday\" at her. Eventually the two love birds ended their hug and Denvert whispered \"Happy Birthday\" to Nikki. Nikki thanked him and looked past him to see everyone else. Her mother, grandmother, Tina, Denvert's mother and siblings, but unfortunately, not Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's smile looked like it would explode off of her face, \"Thank you!\" She cried. She then finally noticed that the table had been covered in cloth, and it looked like there were several things under the cloth. Nikki sarcastically wondered to herself what they were covering, knowing exactly what was under the cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki waddled towards the table as Bram finally walked in. Seeing Nikki closing in on the table, he verbally stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up Nikki.\" Said Bram as he pulled the large shirt and pants up so everyone could see, \"Gotta put these on first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned to her father, \"Oh yeah, that's right.\" She took the outfit from her dad and walked towards the bathroom to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBram turned to the table, \"So what all is here anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food.\" Said Linda, \"Lot's and lot's of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki can't possibly eat all of it can she.\" Bram half-questioned, pulling the cloth off. The entire table was covered in plates of various food, several of which were sandwhiches, chickens, soft candy, and more other types of food than what could be counted. There were also several drinks of soda on a chair near an empty chair, which would be Nikki's chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-uh.\" Bram concluded, \"All of this food put together would be bigger than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the idea.\" Said Linda, \"She wants to finally feel full. Since she can eat incredible amounts of food, at least for her age, without getting full, we had to kick it up a notch. There is no possible way she could finish this, but I wouldn't be surprised if she got at least half way through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!\" Screamed Nikki. Everyone turned and saw her just walking back in with her new clothes on, the shirt looking incredibly oversized on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...I've never seen so much food!\" She screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's going to take a lot of food before you finally get full, so we got a lot of food. All for you.\" Said Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned as she slapped her belly, \"Well let's hope It's enough. I'm ready to see how much I can hold!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert walked to Nikki and she turned to him. He looked her in the eyes and whispered, \"I heard what your mom is going to make you do...lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Nikki whispered back, \"After she told me about the story about the boy who got so fat that he couldn't move and died...I got scared...I love being fat, but I don't want to die...I don't want to be without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know...I don't know if I can survive without you...but whatever, it won't happen, I know it. For now, you have a lot of food and a belly to fill. Start eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will.\" Nikki said out loud, \"I will eat until I feel like I'm gonna pop!\" With that, she immedietly sat onto the empty chair, tore off the leg of a chicken, and started her feast.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki ate and had the time of her life. She was't the only one. Tina had taken a video camera and was taping every second of this. How the fat little girl would stuff her face and get fatter. Linda was't too happy about this. It seemed like Tina had some sort of sick fetish in overweight girls. But since it was Nikki's birthday she acted like she did't see it.<br>\r\nAt the other end f the table were her friends each with their own piece of pie. Tina had taken some food from the bakery for Nikki and a few extra pies for the guests so everyone could have a piece. Except for Nicole who got an entire pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she eat all that?\" Robbie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With any other person i would say no but with Nikki you don't know.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad Nikki needs to lose weight after this.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i also don't like it but her mother is right. Being too fat is unhealthy and can lead too... death. I don't want that too happen too her and I'm sure you also won't since we all like Nikki.\" Tina said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey but what about me?\" Nicole asked who stopped eating her pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Your weight is't high enough to be unhealthy. I'll keep an eye on you.\" Tina said friendly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was happy stuffing her face. and she slowly got fatter and fatter. Mainly around her belly but also the rest of her body fattened up while another piece of food went past her lips. There was no sign of stopping or that she was getting full. But there was still a lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey i was wondering... I mean it seems impossible but just image that Nikki eat's all the food then what?\" Bram asked Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Then she has eaten all the food. Listen I promised our little girl that today she would feel full for one and i keeping my promise. After that we will see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eats so fast. I wonder if she even taste it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina heard this and without stopping filming she walked over too Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she's gotta lose weight you could feed her extra fruit or vegetables. You don't gain from that. Or at least not much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked up surprised. Nikki normally ate bread with a lot f chocolate spread or a lot of butter with chocolate sprinkles or sugar. Suppose she gave Nikki also some fruit. She was sure she could find a way too make it tasty. During lunch she could also gave some fruit and during dinner she could use some extra vegetables. Then Nikki would be at least less hungry. <br>\r\nShe saw how Nikki slowly gained but did't do anything. This was her day. Besides she always ha been negative about Nikki's eating or the fact she liked being fat so maybe this was her punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was halfway through the table. People were now getting the food from her and some times feeding her. The black baggy clothes she wore were getting tight.<br>\r\nHer belly bulged out further then ever over the edge of her chair and hung between her fat legs. Her huge butt hung of the seat of the chair at both sides. Her arms got slowly more flabby another chin was coming and Linda was a bit worried that Nikki at her young age already had enough fat on her chest to gave the impression of some boobs.<br>\r\nTina kept filming. This was gonna become her favorite movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never knew Nikki could eat like this.\" Her grandma mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She really does have a big appetite.\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big? You can say huge.\" Tanja said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it also has an end.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was in heaven. She was't hungry anymore but also was't full. The food of the table was almost gone and she could see some guests stare in disbelief.<br>\r\nSuddenly her black clothes ripped and Nikki was left in tatters but kept eating. The last piece of food was a pie. Fast she grabbed it and ate it. Then she opened her mouth and let out a huge belch and finally for the first time in her life she felt... full. She felt like she would gonna explode. At least she was sure she would if she ate one more bite. Nikki thought a lot of her time about food but now she could't stand the thought of food. She must admit that even with the feeling she was gonna explode she liked the feeling of finally being full for once.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Did she really just eat nearly twice as much as she has ever eaten? Could she eat more? Could her belly really hold more food, or has it finally reached its limit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell if Nikki could conjure up the power, she would certainly tell you. She ran her hands across her massive belly in an attempt to sooth it, even if it did feel incredibly tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly hurts...\" Nikki quietly moaned, \"Please tell me there's no more food...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat statement was all that everyone needed to hear. If Nikki's belly was hurting, while that was a horrible thing since no one wants to see her in pain, that meant that she was definitely full. Finally, the bloated girl received the greatest birthday present she could ask for - being full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAppropriately enough, everyone in the room congratulated Nikki for not only having an inhuman appetite, but for also finally feeling the one thing she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki hiccuped, \"Did I eat all of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Nikki, all of it.\" Said Linda, trying to sound happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moaned in pain, \"Good...I can't eat another bite...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled. She thought she would never hear her daughter say that. After several months of always being hungry and trying to satisfy her hunger, Nikki finally said it. She couldn't eat another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys...\" Nikki moaned, \"I'm gonna pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert walked towards Nikki, \"Do you want me to rub your belly and make it feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at Denvert, \"Please don't touch my belly...it's...\" She yawned, \"I don't want to explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Nikki do you like being full?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up at her mother. \"No...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curiosity kills the cat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shrugged, \"It was worth it. Oooohhh, but it hurts so much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked to Nikki and grabbed her hand, \"Come on, I think you need some rest after that feast. You did good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki slowly got out of the chair, \"I do feel...sleepy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, let's go.\" Said Linda as she and Nikki walked towards Nikki's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, can I talk to her for a bit though?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda stopped and turned to Denvert, \"Alright, but only for a few minutes - Nikki's tired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\" Said Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, you were amazing.\" Said Denvert. Linda had just walked out of the room a few seconds ago, and Nikki laid on her back on her bed, still occasionally moaning in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki turned to Denvert, \"Thanks...I just wish being full didn't hurt so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're probably never going to eat that much food ever again. But still, you did great Nikki. I honestly didn't think you had it in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's in me now...and my belly hurts.\" Said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert rubbed Nikki's belly slowly, trying his best to sooth his bloated girlfriend. Despite Nikki's plead earlier, she made no protest to this and gladly enjoyed the rubbing, as it made her belly hurt a little less. Just a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki...\" Said Denvert, \"About your weight...is your mom going to make you skinny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened her eyes slowly and quietly answered \"No. I'll still be fat...just not this fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as long you don't die from being so fat then I'm happy. I can't live without you. If you have to loose weight to be safe, then do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to stay fat. I'm so glad mommy won't make me skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" Said Denvert, \"Well, you need to sleep, so I'll leave. Please feel better soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will...but I may have to skip dinner.\" Nikki softly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled. He leaned over and kissed Nikki on her chubby cheek and walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you still be here when I wake up?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom and my mom are talking about letting me spend the night here, so I'll maybe.\" Said Denvert, \"Anyway, have a nice rest.\"</span></div></div>",

She had only slept for a few hours, but that was all the rest that Nikki needed, and plenty of time for her body to digest the massive amounts of food that it was stuffed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki yawned and stretched, then threw her bed covers off her oversized body. The black shirt was torn, but not too bad; just enough so that the belly was visible and nothing else. The shorts were still doing their job perfectly find, but they only appeared that way. The button looked like it would beg to differ. As Nikki got out of bed, she noticed something - her belly was jiggling again. It was tight as a drum and and ready to explode just hours later. Now it was lax and soft, like it always is, though Nikki could still feel some food in her belly that was still digesting or haven't even started digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki yawned as she slowly walked to the door, wobbling and shaking as she did snow. Not only did she just wake up, but she also felt <i>heavier</i>. Of course she would always be a bit heavier after every large me, but she just had more than what could be considered an ultra-large meal, so naturally she was going to become significantly heavier than she normally would, and significantly bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened the door and waddled through the hallway. She walked into the living room and much to her happiness saw Denvert sitting on the couch watching TV. It took Denvert a few moments to notice Nikki was there, but when he did, he granted her with a huge smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you sleep good?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I don't feel as full!\" Nikki exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing.\" Linda pointed out from the kitchen, \"I'm almost done making dinner. You sure you have some room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tummy isn't empty, but I am NOT full anymore.\" Said Nikki, \"And thank goodness I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you wanted to be full.\" Said Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did...and I hope it doesn't happen again; I might actually pop next time.\" Said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki with the way you were eating I honestly thought you were going to pop.\" Denvert pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what's important is, she got her wish.\" Said Linda, walking into the living room, \"She wanted to feel full, she got full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is dinner ready?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda nodded with a smirk, \"Even after a feast like today's it's still always food with you. No, dinner's not ready; I have to wait on the oven to finish cooking and then dinner will be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Said Nikki. Linda walked back into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shirt looks bigger than your others.\" Denvert pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is. Me and my dad got this shirt and these pants just for the feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert chuckled, \"Looks like the shirt didn't do so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but hey, at least you can see this.\" Said Nikki. With that, she shoved her belly into Denvert's face soft enough for it to not hurt but hard enough for his face to sink in about an inch. Nikki recoiled back as Denvert became lost for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was...that felt good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, dinner's ready!\" Linda called out from the kitchen.</span></div></div>",

As she placed the pan on the table, Denvert walked towards the table, and Nikki waddled. Nikki sat in the same chair she was in when she had her feast, and Denvert sat in one of the chairs next to her. He couldn't help but notice the creaks and squeaks that Nikki's chair made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sat down in the chair across from the young couple. The chicken sandwiches weren't anything big, but not small, just roughly the size of the palm of an adult's hand. There wasn't many of them neither, mainly because Linda new she couldn't eat more than one and maybe a half, Bram had to go back to work, Denvert's appetite probably wasn't much, and Nikki couldn't possibly have an empty stomach now. Nikki's belly made a few noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still digesting huh?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Nikki confirmed as she placed a hand on the top of her belly, \"But I can eat a few of these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda shrugged as she took one of the sandwiches, almost on time with Denvert and Nikki reaching for one. Denvert wasted no time in taking a bite of his sandwich, but Nikki was almost halfway done by the time he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, please try to eat a little slower.\" Said Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Nikki asked with a full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, chew and swallow before talking.\" Linda commanded. Nikki did so and swallowed, then spoke up, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always finish before me and daddy, no matter how much you eat, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded. It was the truth; regardless of whether she ate as much as both her parents did or maybe even more, she would always eat fast enough to finish before both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Denvert here would like to eat with you, and on the subject of Denvert, I don't want you eating these sandwiches so fast that you clean this whole pan before he can have the chance to have another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded, \"Ok.\" She went back to eating, although this time, she would chew a little more slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" Said Linda before finally taking her first bite. The three of them ate for about a minute without talking. Within this time, Nikki started on another sandwich, despite eating slower. Denvert wasn't far behind, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uhh Nikki.\" Linda said, breaking the silence, \"I talked with Denvert while you were sleeping. You want to know what he said about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki stopped eating and looked at Denvert with a blushing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said that you are very pretty. He said that you have a cute face and that your belly looks cute on you too.\" Linda explained, \"He also said that he wants you to lose some weight, because he doesn't want you to die of obesity. He said that he can't live without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki put her sandwich down, got out of her chair, and gestured to Denvert to get out of his chair. He put his sandwich on his plate and he got out of his chair, the was suddenly greeted by flabby arms wrapping around him, an enormous belly pressing upon his torso, and a chubby face touching his cheek. Denvert quickly realized what this little surprise was and completed the hug by wrapping his arms around Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled at this scenario. For some reason she thought it would be a long time before that loving embrace between the two of them would break.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki laid in her bed in a deep sleep that had lasted for quite a while by now. Her feet were uncovered, mainly because her belly was like a mountain to the bed covers. Nikki's eating for today had left her very sleepy, even after her somewhat small dinner and the cat-nap earlier. This didn't stop her and Denvert playing with her enormous belly for a little bit after dinner. Unfortunately, her belly didn't sway or jiggle as much as it looked like it would, mostly because it was stuffed to its absolute max. Even when Nikki managed to digest some of the food during her cat-nap, the chicken patties she ate only filled the gap. It would take an entire night's rest before she would become empty again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for her, she was sleeping. Genuinely this time. Denvert wasn't with her; he had taken a spare room that was right next to Nikki's room, but that's besides the point. Nikki's mind was flourishing with a fantastic dream, probably the best that Nikki would ever have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Would you like some more my big bellied babe?\" Asked Denvert, \"My fat fiance? My voluptuous vixen? My gigantic girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese questions and somewhat cute names were responded with a giggle from none other than Nikki, albeit a bit...ok, A LOT fatter than she ever had been. She sat on a stool, but because of her enormous butt, only the legs of the stool could be seen. There was another stool that was under her incredible belly. This stool was there to hold it up, so that Nikki wouldn't fall over, and so it could be used as a makeshift table, because there's no way she could sit at a table - her belly could reach farther than her arms could. Her head was practically glued to her chest, because of how fat her neck was. Her arms were so big that it almost seemed impossible for her to lift them, and her legs looked like they weighed as much as Denvert, each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I want more.\" Said Nikki with a smile, \"I'm a growing girl, and my belly is only getting hungrier.\" She gave her belly a loud slap to emphasize her statement, and Denvert placed a plate on top of Nikki's belly. If one was lucky enough, they could see that the plate was loaded with a tower of cookies, but because Nikki wanted to eat them, they were gone in seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon finishing the cookies, Nikki licked her lips and said, \"More.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled and placed a plate loaded with chocolate candy. Needless to say, Nikki inhaled them and repeated, \"More\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More? Do you want more my sweet butterball?\" Denver asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes yes! More!\" Nikki exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More what? More candy? More cookies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything!\" Nikki cried. Denvert smiled and snapped his fingers. Suddenly, all sorts of candy, sweets, sandwiches, platters, just all kinds of food came raining down. From breakfast food to Hershey's candy to ice cream to pizzas to every single bit of food imaginable. Except fruit and vegetables - they aren't fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's face formed into a smile so big it looked like it was going to rip apart. She dove off of her stool and landed on her belly in front of the food around her, and wasted no time shoving any handful she could get into her maw and into her belly. Every couple of swallows, one could see Nikki rising a bit. With each passing swallow, Nikki's belly got bigger, and bigger, and bigger, pushing Nikki up higher, and higher, and higher. Everything went on in a blur, but eventually Nikki managed to eat every single crumb before her belly had become longer than Denvert was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki rocked back and forth before she finally rolled down to her butt. Unfortunately, her belly was so big that it was all she could see - it was the only thing she could see unless she looked left or right. Suddenly, she felt like someone was pulling onto her monolith of an abdomen, but then she quickly found out what the cause was - Denvert was climbing her belly. She was able to confirm this because Denvert was looking at her from the tip-top of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled at Nikki, who quickly smiled back. Denvert then slapped Nikki's belly with both hands several times and said, \"I know a cute girl with a big fat belly...Can you guess who it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ME!\" Nikki exclaimed before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're so fat.\" Denvert said with an obvious joking overtone, \"You're such a fatty Nikki. Look at you, you're made of fat. You're getting fatter and fatter and fatter. I've never seen such a fatty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled, \"I'm the fattest. Look at me, I'm a mountain of fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert giggled and slapped Nikki's belly, then chanted, \"Fatty fat fat fatty fat fat fatty..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denny, can I have some more food?\" Nikki asked, giving him a \"puppy dog eyes\" look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure my sweet fatty, let me just get down from WOAH!!!\" Denvert said before sliding down Nikki's belly. Nikki giggled, but then broke into utter laughter when she felt Denvert blowing a rasberry on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" Nikki pleaded between laughs, \"That tickles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert did not do as he was asked and continued blowing onto her belly. After a few seconds, however, he finally stopped, then got a somewhat dark look from Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert, would you please come back up here?\" Nikki asked. Denvert look scared, but did as asked and climbed back up his girlfriends belly. Nikki then grabbed his shoulders and shoved his face towards hers, planting their lips together. The two proceeded to smooch and smooch for what felt like an eternity. An eternity of utter joy.</i><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her stretching made her pajama shirt ride up rather high; in fact, she had to pull the shirt back down when she was done stretching, and even then, it didn't even touch her belly button. Normally this would mean that Nikki was in need of new pajamas, but since she is going to start losing weight, the necessity of new pajamas wasn't as big an issue anymore. Nikki rubbed her eyes and got out of bed. Her pajama pants did no better than the pajama shirt, but that wasn't particularly obvious because Nikki's belly and \"love handles\" practically covered the entire waistline of the pants, but rest assured, they were in terrible shape. Nikki walked outside of her room and into the hallway, heading towards the living room and kitchen, she was stopped when she saw a door open on her right, about midway through the hallway. Denvert walked out of the bathroom, and smiled upon seeing Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" Denvert greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" Said Nikki with a huge smile, \"Den, you wouldn't believe the dream I had last night! I had a dream, where I was super-duper fat! I mean, HUGE!!! And then you fed me with cookies and candy, and then you made food fall down and I ate it all! And then, you climbed on my belly and called me fat, then you fell down and blew raspberries on my belly, and then we kissed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...\" Denvert verbalized. He hugged Nikki and kissed her on the cheek, \"Your pajamas look good on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki blushed and sarcastically asked, \"Den, does this outfit make me look fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert chuckled and grabbed Nikki's \"love handles\", \"Outfit? I think THIS makes you look fat!\" He sarcastically confirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled, \"Oh no, it can't be! It must be the outfit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert tried his hardest to not laugh and carry along, \"I'm sorry, but you are fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pretended to be sad, \"Nooooooo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled and crouched so could hug Nikki's belly, pressing his cheek against the soft mass, \"Don't worry; I think you looked cute this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki pretended to be crying, \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Said Denvert. Suddenly, Nikki busted into laughter and fell onto her back, taking Denvert down with her, landing with his face planted on her belly. He quickly got up, but not without sharing the contagious laughter coming from his obese girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the laughter stopped, and the two just looked at eachother, still sitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a somewhat lovely silence, Denvert asked, \"Your belly empty yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki rubbed her stomach, \"Yeah, there's no food in my tummy now...and I'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert laughed, \"Where have I heard that before?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Bye!\" Denvert called as he waved his hand at Nikki, getting in the passenger seat of his mother's car. Nikki stood just outside the front door of her house, waving back at him, her chubby arm wobbling with the movement. Her mother stood next to her and waved goodbye as well, both of them smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the car drove out and vanished from eyesight and eventually earshot, Nikki sighed. She didn't like being away from Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked down at Nikki, \"Well, I guess we can start now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up at her mother, \"Start what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda crouched and patted Nikki's belly, \"You know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked down at her belly and held it with her hands. Even though she was plump everywhere, her hands looked very small right next to the massive blob of body fat that occupied her frontal midsection. Sticking out about a foot and a half, and hanging over her waistline, covering a good few inches of her large thighs. Between her obviously oversized frame, and the difficulty her clothing had to cover it, anyone could see that this child known as Nikki was an embodiment of Childhood Obesity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she was standing outside for all to see in broad daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Nikki finally said, \"What about me being a model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda thought about it for a second and softly asked, \"What about it?\" Nikki sighed, and Linda spoke again, \"Let's go back inside.\" With the command, Nikki followed her back into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat on the living room couch to have the ultimate discussion on Nikki's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed, \"Nikki, look, I don't think you should become a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...well...you're so young. You're not even in school yet. I don't feel that it would be good for you. And even worse, you'll be encouraged to get even <i>fatter</i> than you are now. Nikki, if I let you keep eating like you've always been, you would probably become immobile by the end of the month. You're <i>too</i> fat already, and I don't want to lose you to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki said nothing and looked down. Linda motioned towards Nikki and gave her a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered her voice to a whisper and said, \"Besides, school's starting for you next month. It would be illegal for me to keep you out of it. And even worse, there's one thing I won't be able to keep you from in school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if you lost a good fifty or so of your extra pounds, you'll still be fat, and you will be made fun of. Kids will laugh at you, be mean to you, and if you were to go to school at this size, I couldn't even imagine how bad it would be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Nikki softly said as she broke the hug, \"So what will I eat now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healthier food. Less sweets and sodas.\" Said Linda, \"And you'll have to move around more. Walk laps around in the back yard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sighed, prompting a frown from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki, I'm sorry, but I have to do this.\" Said Linda, \"If being fat wasn't unhealthy, I'd let you get fat until your heart's content. Unfortunately, it is, especially when you're this size, so I have to do what I must do as a parent. I hope you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\" Said Linda, \"I'm glad you do. Now that we have this cleared up, we can start trimming you down a little. There's a scale in the bathroom, let's see how much you weigh.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki slowly stepped on the digital scale in the bathroom. From Linda's point of view, she could see the entire scale, aside from it being under Nikki's feet. From Nikki's point of view, there was no scale to see - her belly obstructed her vision enough to hide the scale, and therefore, the numbers, from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen of the scale, just inches away from Nikki's toes, flashed with a solitary black line moving from one side to the other. It did this several times, until the screen flashed one final time and gave the result of its calculations. One would expect this number on a somewhat overweight adult, but when Nikki stepped on the scale, the scale responded with a whopping and frightening 252.4 pounds. The only possible way that such a number would be healthy for even a middle aged man would be if he was at least six feet tall and if the extra 50 or so pounds were muscle. This obviously wasn't the case for Nikki, as the extra 200 plus pounds were all pure, sloshy, heavy, body fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda cringed at the sight of such a high number, but wasn't particularly surprised. The only relief she had from the number was the fact that it wasn't any higher; she was expecting her daughter to be at least 260. Nikki stepped off the scale and was able to see her weight for a brief moment before the scale erased it. Unfortunately, she didn't know what the numbers meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did that say?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed, \"Right now, you weigh two hundred and fifty two pounds. That's...that's much heavier than your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wasn't surprised - she knew she was heavier than both of her parents. Separately at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very heavy Nikki, heavier than most adults.\" Said Linda, \"It's all my fault to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's face turned to sorrow, \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I deliberately let you eat as much as you wanted whenever you wanted.\" Linda explained, \"I blindly let you stuff your face whenever you could. Not once made you eat any healthy foods - just pizzas and burgers and junk food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...Denvert, Tanja, and Robbie uh...fed me a lot too.\" Nikki added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That too.\" Linda sighed, \"Your eating has been out of control for such a long time, and your has been increasing and your body has been expanding and...\" she sighed again, \"You were so spoiled that I can barely comprehend it. You were so fat - are so fat, actually - and happy; that was the only reason I didn't do anything - you were happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's in the past now. Your weight is getting out of hand.\" Said Linda, \"Just look at how slowly you walked through the house. You weren't too slow, but you walked with much more ease weeks ago. It's come to that time Nikki, your weight is starting to get the best of you. We can't let that happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't worry, I already promised that you can still be fat.\" Linda assured. She knelt down and gave Nikki's belly a soft pinch, \"You can still be my tubby little angel, just not a walking blob. Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda's playing made Nikki giggle for a few seconds. In between her giggles she said, \"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. It's almost time for lunch, so I'll get right to cooking.\" Said Linda, \"You just do whatever until I'm done.\"</span></div></div>",

If she would't do it on her own her mother would force her else in one way or another. But at least her mother only did it too help her and she still would let her be fat. That did made her feel a bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if i'm gonna lose it... I could just play with it. Before I can't do it anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her shirt and started to play with her belly. It was so huge that it felt so good. So soft and warm. She liked the pushing, rubbing and pulling it.<br>\r\nShe was so lost in it she did't even heard the doorbell. When she heard someone coming into the room she lowered her shirt and looked up. <br>\r\nA man with a white beard and a friendly smiled walked in.

I wish you had told about her earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Linda.\" Sumo Sandy's mother said. \"Sorry we could't come at the party something important came between it but i did recommended you by the big boss. He even wanted to see Nikki for himself and since he had a free afternoon he decided too come. I tried to call you but the number i got must have been wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i thought again about this modeling... I'm not sure i want to do this. I want that Nikki is gonna lose weight and you want her to be fat. Besides school is starting and I don't want her to miss school because of a photo shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Miss you have nothing too worry about. I understand you concern but don't worry. I don't need your daughter to become bigger. She's big enough all ready. But listen I know what your thinking. It's normal you're thinking those things. But i have models of all sizes. Some are chubby, some fat, some obese or even bigger. If Nikki does lose weight like you say don't worry. I can use smaller clothes on her. It will take a long time until she becomes too thin for my clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never gonna be thin! I'm gonna stay fat. Maybe not obese but I'm gonna stay fat!\" Nikki said.   <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You also don't have to worry about school. We can have photo shoots after school or in weekends or vacations and it's not like we have a photo shoot every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm still not sure about it.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did say no too Nikki but now those reasons did't matter anymore. But still she did't know if she wanted to let everyone see she had a hugely fat daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we pay you. I already have some ideas for great photo's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is that?\" Susan asked still not sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that depends on the shoot of course and experience. Since she's new i think $30,000. For the first shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda who just took a sip of her energy drink started to cough. She looked with wide open eyes at the man. She was shocked. If Nikki could made such much money with one shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't seem too pleased . All right we make it $35,000 then. How's that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... \" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was thinking fast. Fine she was unsure about this modeling but Nikki could still lose weight, would't miss school and would make a lot of money. Whatever would happen too Nikki that money would be very handy. Maybe for college if Nikki ever went too college of course. But even if she did't so much money was always welcome. Too buy a house or a car and who knew what else. Especially if she put it on the bank until Nikki would be eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she does't need to gain. She can lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure miss. Besides before she's too skinny for my clothes she needs too lose a lot of weight. If she does starts too lose too much i will let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And not during school time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me when she can and when not and I will make sure she won't miss a second of school. So what do you say. Can you daughter become a model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Give us a call when you two are ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda tried her hardest to smile, bringing up a half smirk, \"Ok. Nice to meet you...eh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Mason.\" Said the man, sticking out his hand for a handshake that Linda accepted, \"Nice to meet you too Mrs...Glemcer right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handshake between them broke, \"Well I hope we can see you and your daughter again very soon Mrs. Glemcer\" He turned and walked towards the door, leaving the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked at her mom excitedly, \"Mommy, can I stay here with Nikki?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy's mother smiled, \"Well first you have to ask her mother. Linda, is it ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Said Linda, \"we could really use the company. Especially Nikki, she usually is the visitor rather than the visited.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Said Sandy's mom, \"I'll pick you up tomorrow morning ok honey?\" She asked her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" Said Sandy. She then happily waddled quickly to Nikki, who wore a rather wide smile, \"This is going to be so much fun!\" Sandy whispered, \"We'll play together, sumo wrestle together, and eat lots of food together too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...\" Nikki verbalized, \"Come with me, I'll tell you.\" She got up and walked down the hallway to her room, but Sandy stayed behind for a few seconds to say goodbye to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to lose weight.\" Said Nikki. She and Sandy sat on the floor of her room, and due to Nikki's statement, Sandy looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom's scared. She thinks that I'll get too fat to move and that I'll.....well...die.\" Nikki explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to be skinny?\" Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Said Nikki, \"I will never be skinny!\" She pulled up her shirt and grabbed her massive belly, \"See this? It would take me years to get skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy laughed and pulled up her shirt to grab her own belly, \"Same here, I hate skinny! So bony and small! Big and soft is where it's at!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Said Nikki as she and Sandy gave eachother high fives.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So do you wanna sumo wrestle?\" Sandy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wrestle. Is't that more for strong people. With a lot of muscle. We don't have much muscle. We have a lot of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not wrestle. Sumo wrestle. That's different. For that you need to be fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah i heard about that. Now i remember. So that's why your nickname is Sumo Sandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. It's really easy. You have a circle on the floor you grab each other and try to push the other one out of the ring. The one who's out first loses. You also lose if you fall down and don't get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if two people fall out together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they looked who hit the floor first. So wanna do it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think i'm really good at it.\" Nikki said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy looked at Nikki and must admit she would really be good at it. Sandy maybe was a fat girl but Nikki was fatter. Thanks to her huge appetite and her recent birthday. It would be hard to push her out the ring.<br>\r\nNikki took some tape to make a circle at the floor. Her bedroom was pretty big. One of the nice things about being an only child. You could get the best room. There was carpet on the floor so Nikki did't thought you would fall too hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is this circle big enough to hold a sumo wrestle match?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think so. We can try it out. But before that we take most clothes off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we need to wrestle naked?\" Nikki asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No of course not. But you don't wear any shirt while wrestling. At least the man don't. Woman sometimes were a shirt but only to cover their boobs. So it reaches to right under their chest. And no long pants. Just something that looks a lot like a diaper. It's more easy to grab the other this way. At least i think it's more easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does come you know all these stuff about sumo wrestlers. I mean i know it's your nickname but that does't mean you know everything about sumo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Father was adopted by two Japanese people. When he turned twenty he moved too America and fell in love with my mother, and then i came along and well you know. Anyway my father before lived in Japan. Sumo wrestlers are adored there. He still a huge fan of sumo wrestling and he often watched it at T.V. I also watch it sometimes and he told me some things about it. My Japanese grandparents are very nice too. They also adore sumo wrestlers and have a bit of hope I will become a sumo wrestler once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really gonna do that? I mean do you really wanna become a sumo wrestler?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure. I would like it to make my grandparents happy but perhaps they are dead when I'm a sumo wrestler. I also need to like it. I like to do it sometimes for fun but for work... Besides it's not so famous in America. But if i move too Japan i could make a lot of money. I'm already fat and i'm just a little kid so i have a head start but I'm not sure. But I still have a lot of time to decide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Nikki undressed and was just in her underpants. She did't think she need a T-shirt yet. However she was so fat she had some small boobs but Nikki did't really cared about them. Besides she was only here with Sandy. She was just a girl around her age that also was so fat she had some small boobs. Both knew it was only fat and not really boobs yet but still. <br>\r\nBoth stepped in the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right first we bow.\" Sandy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls friendly bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Now grab the other and thy to push her out of the ring!\" Sandy shouted While she grabbed Nikki around her middle.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nBut Nikki also grabbed her around her middle. Sandy pushed but Nikki did't moved a inch. Sandy knew it would be hard to win this. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

However, she did remember that the boy kept on gaining, even after the doctor told him he was in bad health and Nikki was in good health. However, she knew being fat was always unhealthy. I mean you couldn\u2019t REALLY be healthy and fat right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment the phone rang. She quickly answered it and was surprised to hear that it was Maxine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, Linda. I\u2019m just calling to let you know that I talked to my boss about Nikki and he said he\u2019d be more than happy to meet with her.\u201d Maxine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. Did he happen to mention when?\u201d Linda asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe said he could see her on the 23rd.  Now, just letting you know, Nikki will have to get a physical by the company doctor. It\u2019s required to make sure she\u2019s healthy enough before she can be hired as a plus sized kids model. He\u2019ll meet with you after that.\u201d Maxine said, hoping Linda wouldn\u2019t mind the formality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan grinned as she heard this. The 23rd was next day after the birthday party. The doctor was SURE to say she wouldn\u2019t be healthy and she\u2019d have the perfect excuse to put Nikki on a diet. Sure she really didn\u2019t want her daughter to be unhealthy or jepordize her chance to be a model, but the woman figured that she already knew her daughter had to slim down. At least this would give her a chance to finally put her obese child on a diet. I mean, there was no way a girl so big could actually be healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll see you both there.\u201d Linda said as she hung up the phone, a bit happier now that her \u201cplan\u201d was formulated.</span></div></div>",

Because of bad days you also have good days that you're happy to wake up since it's gonna be a fun day. You know some days are gonna be funny because something happens. A holiday, a movie is coming out or your birthday. <br>\r\nNikki was very happy it was her birthday. Of course this was a special day for her. the first day she would finally feel full. But she knew she needed to wait until the other guests were here. Besides she did't want to let her friends miss it. She counted on her fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Denvert, Nicole, Tanja, Robbie, Tina, Sandy. That are six people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprised Nikki realized this was the first birthday she had with friends. She never had real friends before. Of course she had her family that was coming. Aunt and uncles. Some close friends from her parents. But never friends.<br>\r\nHappy she got up and pulled on some clothes her mother bought especially for this day. They probably would rip of today but that did't matter. She fast walked downstairs and turned on the T.V. It took her mind a bit of food. She knew her mother would find it a bad idea if she ate before a her huge feast and for this one time she accepted it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater her parents came down. Linda hugged her (since she could't pick her up) and kissed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy birthday Nikki. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry. I can't wait until it's time to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nikki we have to wait until... \" Linda was cut off when the doorbell rang. \"Can you get that Nikki? I'm sure it's for you and i still have some work to do for your... present.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got up and walked to the door. She opened it for Denvert, Nicole and Tina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina picked us up to go to the party.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in. I think Tanja and Robbie also come soon and Sandy and my family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that Sandy?\" Denvert asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh a obese girl I met at a clothing store. She works as a plus sized model. I'm maybe also gonna do that.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Oh a girl. All right fine then. All right.\" Denvert said relieved now her heard it was a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids continued watching T.V while Tina helped in the kitchen. From time to time Nikki opened the door for Tanja, Robbie, Sandy and her mother, her aunt and uncle from her father's side, two aunts from her father's side, a aunt and uncle and baby cousin from her mothers side and the grandparents from her mother's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is the day. Today you're gonna feel full.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. We'll see. I'm sure gonna eat a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how about us?\" Nicole asked. \"Don't we get any pie?\" She rubbed her belly that was slowly getting bigger each day, she was turning into a real butterball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nicole. I took a few pies from my work for the guests and one whole pie especially for you.\" Tina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Nikki heard her mother calling. She and her friends walked in and looked around surprised. The whole table was full of food. A lot of different kinds what did't matter really since there was hardly food Nikki did't liked. Everyone looked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we all know Nikki is always hungry.\" Linda said. \"I never was too happy with that. But It seemed Nikki herself also did't was happy with it. She did't liked she never got full so for this one time I made a lot of food only for you Nikki. Well eat Nikki until you're full. Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki went sitting in a huge chair and looked at the table full of food and started her feast.    </span></div></div>",

The second she had entered the room she had forgot about anything but the tasty spread of food that had been put out for her to gorge on. She was even visibly drooling as Linda gave her little \u201cspeech\u201d to the crowd of friends and family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki waddled as fast as her young fatten legs could move her, her already massive belly sloshing from side to side as she moved about. She hopped up on the chair at the side of the table and began to dig in on the first two plates she could get her hands on. They were gone so quickly, no one who was watching could really tell you what had been on them. She kept up this pace with no signs of stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course all of Nikki\u2019s friends were excited at this spectacle. They all loved seeing Nikki fat and happy in some form or another. However, it was mostly Tina, Denvert and Tanja that really loved the sight.  The 3 feeders watched intently as the round bellied little girl gobbled down the food, so happy to be able to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids might have been excited, but the adults were a little less than thrilled. Sandy\u2019s mother and Nikki\u2019s grandma were happy to see the 5 year old so happy and contented. However, the rest of the crowd was more than a little shocked by the sight. I mean anyone who knew Nikki knew she loved her food, but this spectacle topped anything she had done before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina grinned as she watched Nikki intently. She loved feeding this child and this was by far the best stuffing session Nikki had. She didn\u2019t want to miss a moment of the fun. However, she heard a belly rumble behind her. She slowly looked back to see the source of the hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sandy and Nichole had mixed expressions on their faces. They loved seeing Nikki pig out, but both little butterballs were fat and hungry too. The sight of all that food was getting both their big appetites going.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone was so focused on Nikki almost no one noticed that Tina went over to Linda and gave her a few pies extra. She took them too the kitchen and cut them in pieces for the guests. The other people were happy with their piece of pie since seeing all that delicious food that was eaten without taking anything from it was hard for most.<br>\r\nDenvert had a wide smile just like Tanja and Tina. For them this was pure enjoyment. Nicole liked it also now she had some food in her round belly but was a little jealous that Nikki was getting so fat while she also wanted to be fat. How could she ever beat Nikki in becoming fat? Sandy also enjoyed her friend becoming fatter. Robbie was interested in how much Nikki could eat but he was't so excited like the others.<br>\r\nNikki's family was't so happy except her grandmother would had no problem with her granddaughters size.

Well except Nikki.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki enjoyed this. It felt like her endless feast. And she was still hungry but she felt it slowly became less. Maybe she would finally feel full. Nikki was happy eating and she felt how each bite added more fat to her fat body. Her arms jiggled with each move she made. Her cheeks were puffy and pink and started to cover more of her face. Her thighs looked like small tires and her feet slowly got covered by fat on her calves. The roll of fat where once long in the past Nikki's neck had been became bigger. Nikki's Belly was huge. It pushed her shirt up so much it looked more like a bra. Nikki's belly bulged out forward more and more and formed two huge rolls that hung between her fat legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never saw such a fat girl.\" Denvert mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither.\" Tanja said. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n And still Nikki was eating. The table still was't empty and finally Nikki grabbed the last piece of food swallowed it and something happened to her. A strange feeling. She did't want anymore food. Normally she always wanted more food since she was hungry but now... she finally, for the first time in her life she felt full. She really did't wanna think about food now since she normally thought a lot about food.<br>\r\nHer friends and family all looked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" Linda asked carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I... I feel full finally. I really don't think I can eat another bite. I also think I'm not able to move.\"</span></div></div>",

She really didn\u2019t want to see her little girl get so round. I mean she should be LOSING weight not gaining it.

Even with all of her friends including Tina it was still hard to hold Nikki. They moved her as fast if they could over too the couch. Nikki happy laid back both her hands on her huge belly that made gurgling sounds of digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it wise to let her eat that much?\" Linda's mother asked her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I promised her I would let her feel full for once. You know I never have been fond of her weight. She always told me she liked being fat. She was telling the truth. She did liked being fat. But she did't liked it that she was hungry all the time. I never really realized that she was always hungry. I was so hard on her and it's not entirely her fault she's always hungry. She did't asked for that endless appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda nodded in the direction of Sandy's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that woman over there. She's the mother of that other fat girl. Anyway her daughter is a model for plus size clothing. I asked her if Nikki could also become a model. She made an appointment with her boss to see me. Tomorrow. But first she get's a check up there to see if she's healthy. If she is't I have a good reason to put her on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. That's very clever. Then it seems like not you but that doctor put her on a diet. But there's just one thing. What if the doctor tells you she's healthy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on how can she be healthy? At this weight I can't believe she's healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you believe you did get a daughter that would eat like a hippo? Did you really think your kid of six would weigh over 200 pounds? Since she does I can see that. Did you think she could eat all the food on the table? There are so many things that don't seem possible but then suddenly they happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no possible way she's healthy. Come on you don't believe she's healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would say no and I can't believe any doctor I know would think that Nikki is healthy. But still I'm no doctor. At the other hand you were't skinny either when you were her age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... but I... I mean... That was a long time ago! And i lost all that weight! Besides I was't even near Nikki's weight when I was six!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But you were also kind of fat and it took you a lot of time to lose it. Remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put her on a diet. Makes sure she exercises two times a week. Maybe together with me. Maybe she then starts to like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Tina put on a nice Disney movie. The princess and the frog. all kids were watching, Tina too however Denvert was while watching leaning against Nikki's belly that was like a huge ball of fat and was softly rubbing it. Tina did the same wit Sandy and Nicole who both liked it to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to meet my mom!\" Sandy said. \"I'm sure she could use a babysitter. And I would like it to have you like my new babysitter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy. She's already our babysitter.\" Said Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And ours!\" Nicole yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And mine.\" Nikki added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm here for all of you.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina always wanted a fat child to babysit and now she was surrounded by three fat girls that she could help get fatter,    <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Of course, Nikki wasn\u2019t thinking of her mom and a few of the other shocked people at the party, she only really seen those who had come over to congratulate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese child grinned as her belly gurgled in front of her. She was happy that everyone was so proud of how big she was getting, but didn\u2019t want her party to stop with this movie, even though she was enjoying watching it. Nikki quickly looked over at the other children and asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, could you give me a tummy rub?\u201d She asked as she let out a small contented burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much fun as the movie was, everyone in the room grinned as they heard this request.

Right everybody.\u201d She asked the children around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them nodded happily. Just about everyone in the room was thrilled with how large Nikki had become and did want to play with her massive belly. The only child who wasn\u2019t enthralled with the idea was Robbie. He wasn\u2019t a feeder or anything and was getting into the movie.

Don\u2019t worry, I think there\u2019s more than enough for everyone to rub.\u201d Tina said gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of Denvert, she was probably the one who was the most looking forward to this. She did say gently though to make sure no one accidentally hurt Nikki.

All were gently rubbing Nikki's belly. <br>\r\nNicole suddenly smiled and lifted her shirt showing her own big belly that was getting bigger each day. Slowly she brought her bare belly to Nikki and started to give rubs and rub her belly against Nikki's belly at the same time.<br>\r\nNikki noticed the trick and smiled since it felt really nice. Sandy saw it too and also started to rub with her belly.<br>\r\nTanja rolled with her eyes. She noticed what Sandy and Nicole did but knew the other's could't do that since their bellies were too small for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah rub some more. Oh I like your belly rubs.\" Nikki moaned in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is a lot of you to rub. This might take a while.\" Robbie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled. Sure she loved children but with every family she was a babysitter she was a bit disappointed with how skinny the kids were. Sure she still liked the kids and for some reason the kids always loved her. She saw it like a gift and used it. But Nikki became some sort of her head prize. All those years of babysitting finally gave her Nikki. The child she always wanted to babysit. <br>\r\nIf there was one thing she wanted more then be Nikki's babysitter then it was being Nikki's mother. She knew of course that that would never gonna happen but that could't keep her from wanting it. <br>\r\nShe knew that century's ago when dad's were gone like a sailor the mother or other relative took care of the children and if they died then someone needed to take the child in house. At least until the father returned. Mostly they of course wanted a christen to take care of the child.<br>\r\nTina knew the bible but did't really was praying for each meal or before bedtime. But She wanted to do it if it mend she could take care of Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything all right Tina?\" Nicole's voice wake up Tina from her daydreaming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah. I'm fine. I was just lost in thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I maybe can't get Nikki but I'm still young. Tina thought I don't look that bad. I can easily get a boyfriend and get pregnant and get a kid and fatten her up. Or him. It did't really matter to her. But she was a bit sad that the child most likely no matter how much she tried to fatten it up would reach Nikki's size.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids kept rubbing for some more time but Finally Nikki was fine and they went back too watching the movie. However except for Robbie most kids had enjoyed the rubbing much more then the movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut finally the prince and princess kissed and returned back the human form and opened a restaurant and lived happily ever after. At least for now since they would probably made a sequel of it. Like Disney almost always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Tanja, Robbie I think It's time for you two to go home.\" Their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to go to Sandy. But you probably see her tomorrow.\" Sandy's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole, Devert you also need to say bye too Nikki.\" Their mother said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Denvert did't wanna go but finally their mother dragged them to the car. Tina stayed some longer helping Linda cleaning a bit from Nikki'sfeast hoping the woman would like her a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was very happy. The party was a success She was fat and happy. Finally she had been full but she was a bit worried what would happen now since she knew for sure her mother would't be to happy with this  </span></div></div>",

Deep down she knew all girls wanted to be skinny and \u201cpretty\u201d.  I mean, that\u2019s what every girl she had met had told her, plus what all the magazines and T.V shows said. Her daughter was just too young to understand the \u201cproper\u201d way to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina helped out with the clean up. She was hoping to score some brownie points with Linda. She felt so sorry for Nikki to have to put up with this woman.  I mean she wasn\u2019t overly mean or anything, but Tina really wanted Nikki to be around people who would accept her size and her love of it. Of course the teen made sure to bite her tounge about this around both parents, not wanting to upset the woman she was trying to get in good with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo a degree Tina\u2019s plan was working. Linda was beginning to warm up to her a little bit, although she was still not all that happy with the teen. I mean she knew if Tina had her way, Nikki would be fed non-stop and be the size of a house! Still, the teen was very helpful and Nikki seemed to enjoy her, feeding or no feeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Linda noticed the time and quickly walked into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for bed.\u201d She told Nikki as the little girl\u2019s show ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah it is but... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat is pealing out everywhere!\" She said while she pulled at a love handle that was pealing out of her armholes. \"But look at the bright side. You did feel full. How was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very strange. For the first time in my life I could't think of food. Or for as long if I remember. I did't want any food why normally I always want more. It also felt a bit painful being so... eh full. But it was also pleasant. Both a bit. But not something I needed to feel again anytime soon. Guess I won't.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you ate a bit to much. Then it hurts. Well we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked with big eyes at the building while they walked inside.

He can see you right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. come on Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was getting pretty tired. Even short distances were getting difficult to walk for the highly obese kid. She was happy they used the elevator. But she was also afraid what the doctor would say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" A friendly voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked in and Nikki saw the doctor was a woman. She relaxed a bit. She normally liked woman more then man when she had a doctors appointment. Linda noticed that several times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Nikki. Sandy told you about me. I'm doctor Dear. Well If you strip down we can start to see if you're healthy enough to work here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda chuckled. There was no way Nikki was healthy. <br>\r\nShe was weighed on a special scale.

She wanted to be sure she gave the pair the correct news about her most recent patient\u2019s health. She then looked up at the two and grinned happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNikki\u2019s as healthy as a horse even if she\u2019s as big as one.\u201d The woman announced happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one happy with this news. Nikki was ecstatic! Not only from the fact she wasn\u2019t in any danger, but that she didn\u2019t have to lose any weight or diet. The chunky child quickly lifted her hands and shouted a \u201cYes!\u201d in triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor giggled at her reaction and was happy to see the child so glad. She was however a little puzzled by the reaction Nikki\u2019s mother gave. She would have thought the woman would have been just as thrilled as her daughter at this news. She could see the lithe mother relived, but she wasn\u2019t happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was indeed not pleased. She was relieved to hear that her daughter wasn\u2019t in any danger, but she had now lost her last excuse to get her fat child on a diet. She looked over at the doctor and quickly asked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But she\u2019s so\u2026.large. I mean how could she possibly be h\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHealthy? Well despite what most people think Mrs. Glemcer, you can be perfectly healthy and large at the same time. I don\u2019t think you have to worry either. It seems that Nikki was almost built to be very large. She could probably even stand to put on a great deal more weight and still have no health problems.\u201d The doctor told Linda as she shifted her focus from the woman to her daughter by the end, poking Nikki\u2019s belly lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese child giggled happily as the doctor played with her belly. She really liked Dr. Dear. She was far more pleasant than most doctors she had been taken to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Linda looked like someone hit her on the head. She gasped for air. Nikki was healthy. Nikki was so large and still was healthy. She could't believe it. She suddenly remembered what her mother told her. She had been right. Be prepared at everything she might say. But she never thought Nikki could be healthy.<br>\r\nNikki seemed very happy with this news. She had a wide smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was thinking what she needed to do. She would have liked it to drag Nikki out the building no matter what and put her on a diet right away. But she just told Nikki that if the doctor said she was healthy they could go see the boss. But that was before she heard Nikki was healthy. I need to listen to my mother next time she told herself. I can't  walk away right now. Not after I told Nikki we could go if she was healthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we go nooooow?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told the boss you two can go. He will see you right away. He's on the tenth floor. The big door in the middle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed and pulled herself together and stood up. She had no choice and needed to take Nikki to see the boss. She wondered what he was like. <br>\r\nSlowly the two took the elevator to the tenth floor and walked to the big door. It could't miss. Linda knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" A friendly voice answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda and Nikki opened the door and walked in. Linda saw the man made good money. The office was big and very nice. You could see big covers of some special editions of his magazine. The boss himself was chubby but surely not fat. He had a wide smile and gray hair. He stood up and stuck out his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must mrs. Glemcer and your daughter Nikki. How do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda shook the hand and mumbled: \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear that. I got some information from the doctor's office. Well you're a big girl Nikki.\" He said friendly with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I sure am!\" Nikki yelled and clapped her belly.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well I must say I'm very happy to meet you. You're perfect for some clothing we wanted to show. I'm sure you'll fit right in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh there are a few things Nikki is going to school soon. I don't want her to miss school because she needs to come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. Nikki is't the only kid here. We always make sure that our photo shoots are after school or in weekends or during vacations. We also call a few days before the shoot because you might have something planned that day. It's a nice job and she's perfect for it. I wished I had heard about her earlier. It also pays pretty good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really how much are we talking about then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell It depends on several things and Nikki is new so I think it will be around $30,000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda gasped for air. Nikki would get so much money for just one shoot. That money would be very handy. Surely after Nikki's birthday. She could also put a lot of it at the bank for when Nikki went to college. If she went to college of course. Even if she did extra money was always welcome.<br>\r\nThe boss understood Linda's gasp for air wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not enough? Well all right then we make $35,000. But Nikki just started. After  few shots she will receive more money. Oh a little extra you can have some clothes from each shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked up surprised. If Nikki needed to show those clothes they should fit her and she always had trouble finding clothes for Nikki.<br>\r\nLinda decided she might as well give up. Nikki would't miss school, seemed to be healthy, would receive a lot of money and would like it to be a model. A plus-plus-plus-plus-plus size model she thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great here I have the papers. Now just sign here, here and here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda read it all and signed it with a sigh.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Her plans of dieting were dashed by the doctor\u2019s words. She couldn\u2019t believe her obese daughter could actually be healthy, but the doctor\u2019s tests were thorough. Then, just as her mind was starting to grasp these revelations, she was told her daughter\u2019s portly state could earn her big bucks. She just couldn\u2019t handle all this all at once!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately in the hallway she heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you guys are. How did it go?\u201d Maxime asked as she waited outside the office with Sandy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda could barely open her mouth at this point.

A shoot only brings in about 2000-3000.\u201d Maxime said with a bit of chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda, now a bit more able to think clearly, nodded her head. She was really disappointed but kinda thought the other number was a bit too high to be true. Still, even $35,000 a year was a VERY big number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I guess it is.

She decided she would do this soon with Nikki. It was maybe better if she knew what she could expect.<br>\r\nThe four walked inside. Maxime asked where the shoot was (fifth floor) and they took the elevator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey you're always hungry!\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except that one time on your birthday.

She gulped and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxime knocked at the door. A man in his thirties opened the door. He had a small beard a wide smile. He maybe took photo's of plus size models but he was kind of skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Maxime and of course our small sumo wrestler. Nice to see you again.\" Then he saw Nikki and Linda. \"Oh are you the other girl for the shoot with her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nikki and Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sandy has a few shoot's with another fat girl. Did't you get our message?\" The man asked Maxime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... but Sandy has done many shoots alone or with someone else. All went fine so she does't really matter. But this are just some friends from us. Linda and Nikki Glemcer. Nikki has just become a model. She wanted to see how it goes. A shoot... and to eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. She's a big girl. I hope I can work with her once. Come in and take some food. We would't want that you lose weight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Sandy happy walked to a table full of food and both started to eat. Linda in the meantime looked how they put everything ready and took Sandy and made her ready for the shoot. But the photographer did't seem to happy. He was watching at his watch the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is she? She should have been here already!\" He yelled and dialed a number on his cellphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Linda asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he talks and shouts like this then something is wrong. Don't worry. It has nothing to do with you so he won't blame you. But something is wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust the the man shouted in his cell phone: \"SICK? SHE'S SICK! We have a shoot today!.... Can't come?... You did't thought about calling me. This is an important shoot!\" Angry he turned of his cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Maxime asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That other girl we needed for the shoot does't come. She's sick at home. But I need to do this shoot but i miss one fat girl. Unless...\" A smile slid over his face when he looked at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki cared more about the food then the shoot. There were food stains all around her mouth. Linda was't to happy with Nikki eating again but she did't say anything. Maxime and the man walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Miss... Glemcer was it right? You know for this shoot we needed two fat girls. But one is sick and can't come. But since your daughter is here... Maybe she could... eh do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda opened her mouth but before she could say anything he said: \"Of course she get's paid. I need to ask the boss but I think he's fine with it. He mostly is and this shoot is important. She's going to model anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was thinking. She did't planned this. She did't even planned to let Nikki become a model. At the other hand this man asked for their help and he was really friendly. Besides he was right. She was gonna model anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to ask Nikki.\" Linda said and walked over to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nikki. It seems a kid for the shoot could't come. She's sick at home.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at her mom with a piece of food in each hand. She did't understand where her mother was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to...

Sure she might not have gotten enough food, like usual. But she over heard the adults talking about making sure there was lots more the next time she came in. Apparently they had planned for the smaller, and less hungry, girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course food was already on the tubby 5 year olds mind. I mean all that work had made her appetite roar to life. Even after all the food she had eaten at the shoot, her fat belly still wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at her mother, who was still rather flabbergasted from the days events, and quickly said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m really hungry mommy. Lets stop for some food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda could only sigh. She still wasn\u2019t thrilled with what was going on. I mean she was happy for Nikki. However, her daughter was still massive. I mean she could clearly see this from the modeling agency. They had photos of other fat kids, both boys and girls, and very few were bigger than Nikki. The little girl wasn\u2019t just fat, she was the fattest of the fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she knew that Nikki had worked hard and did manage to keep her appetite in check better than normal. So she decided to stop for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay Nikki. For being such a nice girl at the photoshoot we can stop.

I was sure that the doctor would say you were unhealthy because you are so... fat. I never thought that you could be healthy at this weight. If you really were unhealthy I would have a reason to let you lose weight... but it seems like my plan did't work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki could't help it and started to giggle. Sure she was a bit surprised that her mother tried to trick her into let her lose weight but after her plan failed she let Nikki become a model and she even got her first shoot. So anything worked out fine for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mommy I'm healthy even at this weight. I could even gain more and... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki you were healthy and you maybe could gain more and be healthy... but that did want to say you need to gain more weight. Please Nikki. I know you don't wanna lose weight but try not to gain more. You're fat enough at this weight are't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at her mother. Nikki did want to gain more just like her friends but her mother asked so nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe I can try... \" Nikki slowly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I tried enough times to let you lose weight. You only end up fatter then before and still you seem to be healthy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm just lucky. Maybe I have a protection angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think a fat protection angel.\" Linda said and stopped in front of the bakery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki jumped out the car and waddled slowly (But very fast for Nikki) too Tina. <br>\r\nThere ware't many people and Tina was just a bit daydreaming looking out the window at a woman who had a boy and a girl by the hand. But except their gender and length of their hair they looked so much alike that Tina was sure they were twins. She thought how much fun it would be to fatten them up. Wondering who would gain the most. The boy or the girl. Maybe the same amount. Of course it depended if one of the two watched his figure or one of the two wanted to gain but Tina doubted that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tina how are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina woke up from her daydream to see her real favorite fattening kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nikki. Nice to see you again. I guess you're hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina I'm always hungry. You know that by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Here take a pie. Don't worry I'll pay for it.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina I'm gonna be a kid model for clothes for fat kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a magazine here with clothes for fat kids?\" Tina said surprised that she did't knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I just had a photo shoot. Well to be honest it was for another girl but she did't showed up so they asked if I could take her place. It was very funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at how Tina talked with Nikki. <br>\r\nSoon Nikki would go to school. She worried a bit how Nikki would act on school. She must be the fattest kid at school. There was now doubt she would get teased with her weight. But maybe she would like or ignore it. Maybe she would finally wanna lose weight but Linda doubt it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Tina. How much do we need to pay for that pie?\" Linda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh eh nothing. It's eh... on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. All right then. How is it going here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great. I get a lot of work experience. When I'm done with school I can start working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanna work in a bakery.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be honest I would like to combine preparing food and taking care of children. Maybe I can work at a children daycare. That would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say thank you for the pie Nikki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*munch munch* Than you *munch munch* Tina.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime. I hope I can soon babysit you again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda and Nikki stepped back in the car.

Linda knew how cruel kids could be and knew that Nikki would be made fun of a LOT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs sad as Linda was, Nikki was just the level of happy and even more so. The tubby child was on cloud nine and not just from the pie she had just gobbled, although that always helped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so happy because she got to be a fat model. Yes, the actual term was plus-size but Nikki still was a little too young to understand that. All she knew was she got to have fun, show off her cute blubberiness to everyone and get fed.

I was afraid I drove over here for nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell I suddenly got a message. I need to do some things and I can't take the kids with me. Tina can't come so I thought maybe they could stay here if it's not a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no problem at all. Sure they can stay here.\" Linda said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was happy Nikki had at least some friends.

Wanna see?\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for answer she lifted her shirt and showed her fat belly. Denvert looked at it with a sigh. He noticed that his sister got pretty fat the past days. He must admit that he liked his sister fat but it was't same thing that he felt for Nikki. He just thought his sister looked better fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you look good Nicole. Maybe you can also become a plus-size model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is a plus size model?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's the same work like a normal model. But now the models are fat! They like models with big bellies, thighs a big butt and bowl cheeks and a lot of love handles! Just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me too. Can I become one?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's not for me too decide is it. Your mother need to decide if she wants you to become a plus-size model and even if she does you  first need to talk with the boss. If he thinks you're good to become a plus-size model you're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked up. He would't admit it to his sister but he thought his sister was kind of pretty. She had a perfect skin and nice hair, a perfect white smile and cute blue eyes. He thought his sister would be great as a model if she would't be fat, but if they wanted a fat girl she was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a plus-size model. We went today and we were lucky and could do a shoot already since some other model did't showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I would be a great fat model!\" Nicole said and acted like if she walked on a catwalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think you are.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not near as fat if you.\" Nicole said sadly and let her head hung.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on Nicole.\" Denvert said trying to comfort his sister. \"Almost no one can get as fat if her. She just has an almost endless appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not always fun Nicole. I'm always hungry. Except for that one time on my birthday I never felt full. Always felt hungry. From when I woke up until I went to bed. I could always eat some more. Feeling always hungry is't always so good. But you can eat more that way and gain more. If my parents would have given me more food my entire life when I was hungry I would't even fit through the door by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does it come that you always hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know. Guess something went wrong when I was born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're perfect. Since the moment you were born.\" Denvert said with a smile and hugged Nikki.     <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNormal Nicole would tease Denvert at this moment but she did't since she really liked Nikki and Nikki had always been nice to her instead of some other kids her brother hang out with. <br>\r\nShe hoped Nikki and her brother would fall in love and get married and get a lot of fat kids. She also would get fat and get a lot of fat kids and maybe some of her kids would fell in love with some of Nikki's kids and they would be even more family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up at her brother and his girlfriend and asked:</span></div></div>",

Linda was busy cutting some vegetables for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we have some food?\" Nikki asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. We're hungry.\" Nicole asked on her sweetest tone that could melt anyone's hart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked at them. She was't happy to let Nikki eat more but many kids got some snacks when friends came over. Just a small snack could't hurt. She knew very well that Nikki had more in mind then a small snack but she could try bringing them a not to big snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I will give you some snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLina sighed. There was no hope now Nikki would lose the weight but at the other hand she could be relieved that Nikki did't had any health problems. Suddenly she started to wonder why she hated it so much. She did't want Nikki to become fat because... yeah because of what? She said to herself that it was because it was the best for Nikki but Nikki was happy being fat and getting fatter, she also said because fat was unhealthy but she was just told that Nikki was healthy even if she would gain weight. Should she maybe just give up? <br>\r\nWell school would start soon and she knew how cruel kids could be. If Nikki after being teased wanted to lose weight she would help Nikki but if not... what would she do then. She decided to think about it when the time was right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids waddled back too Nikki's room. Nikki and Denvert went sitting on Nikki's bed and Nicole started looking through Nikki's toys looking if she saw something nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole you're supposed to ask someone if you could look through their toys.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. I never played so much with them anyway.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point. If she does it with you she also does it with other people who do mind. My mom always says since I'm the oldest I need to watch after her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like if I would listen to you.\" Nicole said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should. I'm your big brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you're maybe older and taller then me but I think I'm fatter then you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki smiled since she must admit it was true. Nicole had gotten pretty fat there was a chance Nicole was heavier then Denvert, or else she would be soon. <br>\r\nBut they did't need to find out yet since Linda knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Snacks!\" Nicole yelled and opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda came in with a tray with six hot dog's and a bottle of mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. She put the tray down with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" She said and left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not  just as much food as I hoped for but it's better then nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She covered her first hot dog with mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard and started stuffing them in her mouth. Niki laughed since seeing how she ate you almost thought she was a pig. She totally used no manners and eat like a starved animal.<br>\r\nDenvert would't admit but he liked seeing his sister eating like this but he fast got distracted seeing how Nikki wolfed down her hot dog's also covered in mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard. She almost did't chewed. He almost forget his own hot dog's and could just at the last moment stop Nicole who tried to take one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm those tasted good.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go...\"    </span></div></div>",

That's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly stepped forward. Denvert wondered how much his sister weighed. She always had been a chubby child but she really was starting to pack on the pounds. He knew for sure that as long if their mother did't mind (and maybe even if she did) Nicole would become a fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And? Tell us?\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I weigh 70 pounds!\" Nicole said proudly. slapping her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert was impressed. All right she weighed not near as fat if Nikki but for a four year old 70 pounds was pretty impressive. He whistled. <br>\r\nNow Nikki stepped forward. Nicole was also curious how much Nikki weighed. slowly she stepped on the scale and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what is it?\" Denvert asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I can't see it. My belly is in the way.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole started to crawl over the floor over too the scale. She looked at the number and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how much is it?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's... it's... 265 pounds! That's more then three times my weight!\" Nicole yelled and looked sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Nicole. You will also reach 265 pounds once.\" Nikki said comforting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But not at the age of six right? I wish that witch of Hansel and Gretel would find me and fattened me up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you would end up in the oven of the witch! You would't want that to happen right.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right your right I would't want to be eaten but I would like it to be fattened up. Or I can be the big bad wolf and eat seven goats. Hmmm... I like goat meat. Image that. Seven goats inside my belly. How fat would I be then. Hee if I'm a wolf then after I eat the goats I can also eat red riding hood and her grandmother, and then if the hunter comes... I eat him too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert and Nicole both laughed. Nicole as wolf who would swallow every fairy tale character. That was a story Nikki would like to read. Nicole kept talking while she put her shirt back on and put her shoes on.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Now what do you wanna do?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

This trip alone had winded both Nikki and Nichole. Even Denvert was a bit under thrilled with the idea of doing much of anything else.

He would't admit it to anyone not even himself but he liked his sister but she never knew when she needed to shut up. She always said what she thought without thinking and that was some times very annoying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that could be.\" Nikki said. \"But I know one thing for sure. If we marry there's one thing he won't do what other married people do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Denvert asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry his wife up the stairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three kids burst out in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I admit that I won't do that no matter how much I love you.

He liked what he saw. A highly obese girl. Unable to move fat that spread out in every direction. A belly that stretched out several yards, but still with a pretty fat face behind some gigantic boobs. Fat everywhere.<br>\r\nHe woke up from his daydream and noticed he was still rubbing Nikki's belly but he saw Nicole was getting impatient.

Nikki wasn\u2019t as annoyed as her boyfriend had been. She found it cute how Nichole was, even if she was impatient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, truth be told, Nikki would have loved to actually join in and give the toddler\u2019s growing tummy a nice big rub down. She was very proud of how well the younger child was doing with her gain. I mean, she wasn\u2019t nearly the size of her, but then again few, if any, were. Still, the fat toddler had put on an impressive amount of weight in a very short period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point the low patients of the fattened younger sibling had run out. The child huffed as she sat down next to Nikki and instantly lifted her shirt up just enough to show her belly alone. She didn\u2019t say a word, but gave her brother the cutest puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki giggled at the sight and looked up at Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time to give Nichole her tummy tubs too.\u201d She said as she happily looked back at the child<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNichole grinned and nodded excitedly as she stuck out her big belly.

I do. I like this a lot. It feels so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you get fatter it feels even better, and if you're stuffed belly rubs help you to make you feel better. At least I think so.

She was so fat and at the same time so confident. From the first moment she saw her she wanted to be so fat. She loved it, she wanted it, She needed to be fat. She would almost worship Nikki. But she wanted to become just as Nikki, if that was possible. She did her best for it. She swallowed every edible thing that came near her reach and even ate herself sick once. <br>\r\nShe stopped ballet since that would burn too many calories. Besides ballet was't fun anymore. Even before she started gaining she had been a chubby girl. The only one. All other were terribly skinny. Really toothpick figures. She really jumped out because she was chubby. The other always teased her. Especially when they needed to change. The pinched and slapped her belly and said mean things about it. She did wanna do ballet at first but now she was glad she stopped.  <br>\r\n      <br>\r\n\"I wanna be fat.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna be fat.

If you eat more after you're full you need to throw up. Then you lose those calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know more ways to gain faster?\" Nicole asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat a lot of fattening food. Try to avoid exercise. Do things you can do while just sitting at you butt. Ask Tina. I believe she also knows a lot about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so to. I wonder why Tina knows so much about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe she used to babysit a family with a fat kid, or she babysat a child and his or her parents wanted him or her fatter.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be.\" Nicole mumbled. </span></div></div>",

I mean the two girls wanted to get fatter and were glad for Tina\u2019s help. And, even if Denvert wasn\u2019t gaining, he did like to eat and found the food Tina provided very tasty.

Those kids all were also fat and stuffed their face with junk food and were all pressed in too small clothes, and every parent had an excuse for the kid's huge weight.

True many of the kids featured were a bit young, around Nikki and Nichole's age, but they still seemed happy enough. Especially when they large tray of fattening snacks was brought out to show how \"out of control\" their eating was getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this was both a blissful and a problem for the two fat girls watching. All loved watching these happy kids pig out. However, the thought of eating so much food brought Nikki and Nichole's appetites roaring to full force once again. Both girl's tummies rumbled loudly as they watched the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert paused the DVD and looked over at Nikki, who had chosen to sit next to him, and Nichole, who was sitting next to Nikki. He frowned a little bit. Not from the fact that these two were hungry, but from the fact he knew neither could eat yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I betcha you two want some more snacks, huh?\" He asked the two fat little girls sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nodded back to him as both bellies rumbled again, one after the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The two girls waited several minutes, until he returned bearing food\u2014a tray of brownies, some cookies, a few bags of candy, two 2-liter soda bottles, and two pies. \"Look good?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" Nikki replied, patting her round belly and causing the layers of fat covering it to shake. \"Feed me first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy smiled. \"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lay back, grinning, and Denvert laid the tray of brownies on her prodigous belly. She began to wolf them down, digging into the tray with fat fingers and stuffing hunks of brownie into her mouth. Denvert and Nicole looked on, happy and smiling. Nikki paused about halfway through the tray, put a hand on her stomach, and gave a loud belch right in Nicole's face. \"Nice one,\" the other girl replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki moaned in pleasure as she stuffed herself, her plump face covered in brownie crumbs. Her double chin jiggled as she chewed. She finished the tray and asked Denvert, \"Can I get something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, he uncapped one of the soda bottles, and began pouring it down her throat. She gulped it down, and she could feel her massive stomach begin to fill with liquid, a full sensation growing and growing. Finally, the bottle was empty. The fullness swelled to a crescendo. Nikki laid both hands on her belly and belched loud and long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UUUUUUUURRRRRRRPPPPPPP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole laid her hands on her friend's belly and giggled. \"It's all sloshy,\" she said, kneading her fingers into the fat and listening as Nikki's tomach emitted glopping and sloshing noises. Nikki moaned in pleasure, and burped again as the motions caused the soda to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I feel so \u2014\" she belched deeply\u2014\"UUUUURRRRRRPPPPPPP\u2014big!\" She motioned for Denvert to bring over one of the pies. He did so, and the fat girl happily buried her face in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, she was done. Nikki smiled and hiccuped, and the button popped off her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole asked, \"Nikki, can I feel your belly again? It's so nice and soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki collapsed onto the couch. \"Sure. Go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole moved over, and lay down on top of Nikki, whose massivebelly enveloped the other girl. The fat was so nice and soft, and Nicole could both hear and feel the food and soda sloshing around inside her  friend's tummy. She smiled, and laid her hands on the soft flesh. \"I wanna be fat like you,\" she said, grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki opened her mouth to answer, and felt gas once again rise from her belly. She belched resoundingly in Nicole's face, then smiled. \"Well then, let's feed you next. I've had enough for now. UUUUUUURRRRRRRRPPPPPPP!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least then I have something in my tummy.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl went lying on the couch and opened her mouth wide. <br>\r\nDenvert grabbed the cookies and started to stuff them in his sister's mouth. Nicole enjoyed it. She happy munched on the cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I go look if I can find some more food. You stay here keep on feeding her.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert nodded while he kept pushing cookies in his sisters greedy mouth. Nicole was happy. Just open your mouth then something was put in it and all you had too do was chew and swallow. After that repeat the process. The only thing the fat little girl disliked was that it soon would be over. As soon if they were out of food.<br>\r\nShe suddenly noticed that what she got now was candy. So that mend that they were out of cookies.<br>\r\nNikki returned suddenly with a bag of pretzels and also three big chocolate bars. She grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you found something.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole closed her eyes to enjoy it more. But when she heard that she opened here eyes a bit and there appeared a happy sparkle in her eye when she saw what Nikki had brought and closed her eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wanna be so fat. Was only Nicole could think of. She liked Nikki. She liked Nikki more then any other boy or girl who Denvert brought over ever. Nikki had always been nice to her while some other boys told her to beat it. Nikki had never been mean to her. But she was also jealous at Nikki because she was so fat. Even while the little toddler was starting to get very fat herself she was't even near Nikki's size and she knew she would probably never will be.<br>\r\nNicole noticed how tight her pants were getting. The were pushing in her belly flesh. Suddenly she felt relieved. She knew her pants button flew of. She did't cared and giggled softly before opening her mouth again. This time it was filled with pretzels. <br>\r\n She greedy opened her mouth glad the feeding would go on a bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister is really packing on the pounds.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I never knew she wanted to become fat. Sure she always had a large appetite. But she never ate to gain. Just because she was hungry or because she wanted to chew on something.\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's kind of sweet that she wants to be fat just like me.\" Nikki said. \"Don't you think so to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I just hope our mom is fine with it.\" Denver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Nikki think. She knew her mother never was fond of her weight and she knew very well that she tried many times to let her lose weight. Not that it had any effect. She wondered how the mother of Denvert and Nicole would react. She never seemed to have any trouble with a fat kid or having a fat kid. Nikki remembered how many pizza's she and Nicole got. Their mother had never said anything insulting about her weight and did't seem to have any problem about it. But of course that did't want to say she would still be fine if her own daughter would end up getting fat.<br>\r\nWould she be mad at Nikki? She wanted to be like Nikki but that was't really her fault. Was it? <br>\r\nDenvert emptied the bag pretzels in his sisters waiting mouth and started to open the first chocolate bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know were she's leaving it all.\" He took one moment to look at his sisters belly and continued \"Correction I do know were she is leaving it all.\"<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Still, she wanted to focus on how good Nichole looked at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat little sister was laying full on her back, shirt up to her chest and pants unbuttoned.

I know something but what.\" He whispered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so busy thinking and the girls were so busy eating that they heard the footsteps when it was already too late. At that moment Denvert realized what it was. Why would an old lady leave the back door of her house open unless she was at home.<br>\r\nThe next moment Ms Crandle appeared in the kitchen.

Nikki finally swollowed the mass of cookies in one big gulp and went right back to looking sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you kids know it's not nice to break into other people's houses and eat thier cookies? Those were for the bakery I sell my pasteries too.\" She said as she came over to the three guilty kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're really sorry, Mrs.\" Denvert said, still not looking up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah. It's just my mommy wouldn't let us eat and we're SO hungry!\" Nikki added, still looking very sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I know you probably didn't mean any harm Nikki, but you can't break into other people's houses and take thier food, even if you hungry. Besides...\" She slowly bent over and patted her large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mommy probably stopped you because you really don't need anymore food. I don't want to be mean, but honey you've really ballooned over the last little bit. Your mommy just wants to make sure you're healthy.\" She said, really not trying to hurt the tubby girl's feelings, also noticing how big her friend was as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on Nikki, lets take you and your friends back home. I'm sure your mother's very worried about where you went to.\" She said as she stood back to let Nikki and Nicole come down off her counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm here to pick up some pastries for the bakery.\" Said a familiar voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki Denvert and Nicole waddled to the front door and there was a big smile on their faces when they saw Tina. She wore her bakery uniform. Nikki thought that it looked really cute at her and wondered why Tina did't had a boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm afraid I don't have as many if you ordered. I had three little kids that broke into my house and ate most of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked surprised and then she saw Nikki, Nicole and Denvert and giggled. She understood who ate the cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Tina.\" All three kids said polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know each other?\" Mrs. Crandle asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm their babysitter.\" Tina said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's our favorite babysitter.\" Nikki added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They ate most of the cookies. I just wanted to put another batch in the oven when I found them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what I take them home in the meantime you can put that batch in the oven. Don't worry about the missing cookies. I'll pay for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Won't you boss mind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long if he get's the money for it he don't mind. Come on kids.\" Tina said and took Nicole by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina smiled seeing the growing love handles at Nikki and Nicole and how their fat jiggled with each step. She liked it so much and knew that they both got fatter each day. She knew Nikki was a hungry girl just like Nicole but  she never would have thought that they would break in other peoples house to get more food. Even while she liked it she knew she needed to make sure it would't happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you three were so hungry you broke in her house to get food?\" Tina asked. \"Listen Mrs. Crandle is a friendly old lady who knows Nikki and would't make a big deal about it but other people are't so nice. You can't break in someone else his house. It's just not right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know. We were hungry and just wanted some food, and since Nikki's mom would't give us any more food we thought of another way.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina remembered how angry Linda could react, especially about Nikki's weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no use crying over spilled milk. Just make sure it won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you so worried about it? Is't it our problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If other people  find out you broke in in someones house and they hear I'm your babysitter they could think I had something to do with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tina why don't you have a boyfriend?\" Nikki asked suddenly curious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... oh well I never found the right man. I don't have so much luck like you have with Denvert. I did have some boyfriends but they were't a huge success. The latest one only wanted sex with me. But I did't was ready for that so when I'm told him that he left. I'm still a virgin and happy with it. however some of those sluts at school say I'm a loser for not having sex yet while some of them had sex at the age of twelve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did the other boyfriends broke up with you?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not important.\" Tina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe truth was that she told the first two about the thing she had for obese children and they found that so wrong and sick they broke up with her. The third one did't count since he only dated her to make his ex-girlfriend jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're here.\" Tina said and brought them to the front door. \"All right  see you soon. Bye now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids walked inside. Linda was in the living room busy sewing. She did't noticed they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are.\" She said friendly.       </span></div></div>",

They knew Linda could go pretty ballistic on them all if she knew what they had been up to. Of course the fairly happy response Nikki's mom gave them took away their fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom. We just came in from....playing.\" Nikki replied, trying to come up with a believable excuse for being outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda paused and grinned at what she had just heard. She liked the sound of her tubby offspring playing outside. That meant running and moving and the general burning of calories from all three plump bodies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she could really only control what happened with Nikki's frame but she was starting to get a little concerned with the other two kids. Denvert wasn't too bad. I mean he was chubby, but was he pretty thin...at least compared to his sister. Nichole was the one she had seen fatten up since their last visit and didn't want Nikki's \"bad habits\" rubbing off on this little toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese thoughts were only reinforced by what happened next. Nichole, Nikki and soon after Denvert waddled over to her as she was sowing. Nikki had wanted to steer clear of the room, just in case her mom could somehow tell what they had really been up to, but Nichole had just barged into the room. To make matters worse, both her and Denvert knew why she had done so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, neither older child could stop her before she looked up at Linda and asked, completely oblivious to what the woman had been thinking before,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we have a snack?

How does some hamburgers sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" Nicole yelled happily with sparkling eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert rolled with his eyes. His sister created a huge appetite with a taste for fatty food for one or another reason. Well he knew by now that junk food also was the favorite food of his fat girlfriend so he did't said anything and by the way he also liked hamburgers himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked downstairs and took some burgers out of the freezer. She also took some tomatoes, lettuce, pickles and unions to put on the hamburgers. At least then the kids would also eat at least some vegetables. That was always better then none.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three kids watched some more cartoons while Linda made the burgers. When they were finished the kids happily start eating them. Linda looked a bit worried at the little Nicole. Her belly was pushing the fabric of her clothes to it's limited.<br>\r\nSuddenly the doorbell rang. Linda opened the door and was happy it was the mother of Denvert and Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello I'm back. Thanks so much again for babysitting. Did the two behave a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they were no problem at all... eh could I talk a bit with you alone? Upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh of course. No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda took her too her study room. She went sitting on a chair and looked at the other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a problem.\" She asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. But I noticed your daughter is well... gaining a lot of weight lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I noticed that to. Nicole always had a big appetite but lately her appetite really went through the roof.\" She said with a laugh. \"But as long if she's happy and is fine with it I'm not worried. I think it has partly to do with Nikki. You know your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course. But how can it has to do with Nikki?\" Linda asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well Nikki is pretty big herself... nothing wrong with that, don't get me wrong but it seems like Nicole want to be like her.  It seems like she made Nikki her roll model. Her hero. And she want to be just like her. Just as fat. I think that's the reason why she gains so much. But it will take a lot of time before she reaches the size of your daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda thought about this. She could't believe that Nikki became a roll model for a little girl.  Also the part that she did't saw Nikki like a really good roll model. But it could be. She must admit it looked a bit like that. She remembered that when she was a kid herself she also had some roll models. First as a little kid characters from cartoons and comics and later from stars like Madonna and Jodie Foster. But that were't roll models that in dangered your health. At the other hand she heard enough stories about girls who starved themselves just to look like those super models. That was't healthy either so what was so wrong about wanting to be like Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really see a problem with a fat kid. It's most important they are happy. If you don't have fun in your life because you want to stay healthy you did't really life at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's true. Besides.... Nikki became a plus size model. A Model for clothes for fat kids. Maybe that's something for Nicole. Then she can earn some money for later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. That's a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I will make an appointment for you with the boss.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a nice little reward after having to move so much from before. Besides, all three children had been more than a little stressed from their encounter with Mrs.Crandle and that can sometimes make a person hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 3 children were glad for the snack, even Denvert. True he only had one burger and was pretty full from that, but it appeared he was gaining a bit of an appetite too. Heck he was even just a bit more plump than he had been even a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was nothing compared to Nichole. She had ballooned so much no one  would think that a single burger could fill the hungry young child and that was true. The cute little girl had already downed her first burger and was moving on to her second. Her big round belly looked like it would burst out of her dress any second. However, the fabric was able to hold back the big wall of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki on the other hand had beaten Nichole and was already munching down her 3rd burger. She happily flaunted this fact as she showingly grabbed it off the plate and wolfed it down. This was mostly for Denvert's enjoyment but a little for Nichole as well. She wasn't trying to be mean to the child, but more to encourage the younger plumper. In fact, she even gave Nichole an approving smile as she gobbled down her second burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe younger, fatter, sibling to Nikki's crush finished her second burger with a nice big burp. She licked a little stray ketchup off the side of her mouth as she reached for a third. However, it was at this time her mother came downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys. It's time to go.\" She said as she watched her children pigging out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course neither child wanted to leave. Denvert was happy to watch his young girlfriend pig out and Nicole wanted to fill her fat tummy up completely, much to the chagrin of Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww...mom, can't we stay?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I wanna stay.\" Nichole said after heavily swallowing down the mass of burger in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother thinks for a moment before she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that that sometimes was the case but even if Nikki would suddenly grow she would still be obese.<br>\r\nLinda picked up the phone to call the boss to make an appointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Nicole and Nikki were both wolfing down their latest burger. Denvert enjoyed seeing the young girls eating. He wondered how they could eat so much. He also did't understood why he liked it so much to see two girls stuff themselves. He did't know why he liked it but he knew he liked it.<br>\r\nNikki wolfed the last of her burger down while Nicole was only halfway. She looked disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hoped I would finish my burger first this time.\" She mumbled with her mouth full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't take it so hard Nicole. Nikki is older and has a bigger mouth then you, and also a way bigger belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but I'm working on my belly.\" Nicole said softly while munching on her burger and rubbing softly her belly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki must admit Nicole made a great process. She got a nice layer of fat over her entire body and she was't gaining for such a long time. However Nikki was still way bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert smiled at her and slowly said.\"You're still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" Nikki said with a big smile. \"I'm glad I once felt full but it was also kind of painful. And I could't think of food while that never has been a problem before. That was strange. I don't really wanna feel but more when you could still eat more but you're not hungry. But to get there I still need to eat a lot. But my mother does't like it when I eat so much. Your mother is way easier in that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert remembered how furious Nikki's mother had been the first time he met her. Together with Robbie Tanja and of course Tina. They stuffed Nikki good but when her mother picked her up she was really furious. Especially at Tina who was suppose to look after the children.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother even wants me too lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think my mother will ever do that. At least when I don't want to.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Linda put the phone down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made an appointment for the day after tomorrow at 14:00. Its that all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it's fine don't worry. I have the address. It would be fun for Nicole to be a plus size model. It's always handy if kids have some extra money for when they go to college.\" She said and walked over to the kids.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It wasn't that Linda was so glad they were leaving because they were bad kids. Heck, she was glad that Nikki knew them and had these friends. It was just that once they were gone, Nikki would have less of an excuse to eat so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on kids. It's time to go.\" The woman said to her portly offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the chubby boy and fat girl nodded at their mother, looking almost defeated. Denvert got up and, taking a big chance, gave Nikki a hug as he said goodbye. Hoping his real reasons for doing so wouldn`t be found out by either mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Nikki. Maybe you can come over soon.\" He said a bit sad but also a little hopefully as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, his cover was aided as Nichole waddled over and happily hugged as much of Nikki's tummy as she could as well. Smiling happily at the feel of so much warm and snuggly fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya, I wanna play with you more and eat lots of snacks with you too.\" She replied happily at the idea of them gorging again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Linda and Nichole's mother couldn't help but go \"Awww\" at the sight, despite how little Linda was thrilled with that last part. Still, it was time for both kids to go and their mother said her goodbyes and took both her children home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki sighed a little as her friend and boyfriend had to leave. Of course there was an upside to this though: they had just left her with the last 2 burgers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could see a good part of her daughters huge belly since her way too small shirt rode up looking more like a bra then a shirt.<br>\r\nNikki liked the crumbs from her lips and let out a soft belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we go visit Denvert and Nicole again soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I don't see why not. Maybe we can also buy school supplies together. Soon you're going to school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki still was't sure about school. She of course heard about it. Enough kids said they hate it but at the other hand you also met a lot of other kids there. She hoped Denvert and she would be on the same school and her other friends too. But she was't sure what she needed to do at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like Denvert and Nicole a lot.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I like them too. It are nice kids. But I just would like it a bit more if you three would't eat so much!\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We like eating, or being fed. That's what we like to do for fun. It's playing for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No playing is what I and my friends did when we were little. Playing tag, hide and seek, football, that is playing. Were you need to move and run with your friends. You should try it once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you need to move a lot. I don't like running, and I bet Nicole does't like it either. I also think Denvert also does't like running and moving a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you would like it more if you were't so fat! So you could look a bit more like a normal child!\" Linda screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like being fat and I don't want to lose weight ever!\" Nikki screamed back at her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being so grossly fat is't healthy!\" Linda screamed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it and I'm perfectly healthy! They told you that!\" Nikki screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They told me that!\" Linda screamed and she was now really angry. \"But i doubting if that is the truth. Anyway it would be unhealthy to let you lose some of this disgusting fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the last word she slapped a part of Nikki's bare belly so hard it left a red hand print. Nikki got tears in her eyes since it hurt really bad. Linda did a step back. She was shocked at what she had done. She never liked it that Nikki was fat or liked being fat but really hurting her was something she never had done and she could believe she had done it and she was scared that she let her anger take control for a second. She could't believe what she had done but there was still a clear red hand print were she slapped Nikki.<br>\r\nNikki started to cry. Linda fast walked over to her and hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry Nikki. I'm really sorry. I never wanted to do this. I was a accident. Really I did't mean to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Nikki's crying stopped and she looked with wet eyes at her mother. She looked sad at Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I just lost my temper for a second. I never mend to hurt you. You know I would never really hurt you on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded. Even while she and her other never agreed about her weight Linda was her mother and she loved her just as she loved Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need to do something upstairs. You're sure you're all right?\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda went upstairs but when she was upstairs she still had trouble to understood what she had done. She did't understood. You don't slap your kids. Not even if your angry. At least not so hard it leaves a hand print. She felt really bad.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should't keep complaining about her weight. That's what caused it. But it stays unhealthy. At the other hand they said she was healthy. Maybe I should really stop?\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, it was an honest mistake that she wasn't going to make again. Especially after what had just happened. She did really love her daughter and NEVER wanted to hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still the lingering question about what to do about her overly plump little girl's weight. She wasn't going to hurt her but she knew she couldn't except the fat. She could easily except Nikki. After all she was her little girl and she loved her with all her heart, even if she wasn't the littlest little girl. However, being so fat couldn't really be all that healthy. She didn't care what that quack doctor told her or Nikki. She had to keep trying to get her daughter to see things correctly about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course what Linda wasn't getting was that she was the one not seeing things correctly. She had been stuck in the \"skinny is the only healthy\" idea that she had been brainwashed in since she herself was just a little girl. Nikki, despite her size, was healthy and very happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, despite what had just happened, Nikki was smiling happily as she tended to her lap covering round belly. You see the fat 5 year old had started out just trying to sooth the area Linda had slapped. Soon though the sting from the slap had disappeared, as well as the hand print Linda had made. Now all that was left was lots of beautiful fat little girl blubber for Nikki to rub, explore and love and she was doing all three of those as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this was the very scene that Linda noticed as she walked back into the room. She instantly frowned but wasn't going to go after Nikki again, with her words or hands. The poor child had been through enough already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother came over to her and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It does't hurt that much anymore. Maybe if I would have been skinny it would have hurt more.\" Nikki said with a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\neven while she was a plus size model her mother was't happy with it. She wondered how other children there looked like. Then she remembered something Bram once told her. You can find anything on the Internet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy I'm going on the Internet. Is that all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Go ahead.\" Linda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed when she saw all Nikki's fat jiggle while she walked out the room. She took the remote and flicked through some channels. Not really looking what was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I not able to let that girl lose weight. I mean I'm her mother and I want her to stay... No to become thin... and maybe a bit sportive. But she keeps gaining weight and for some reason I'm not able to let her lose weight. What Is needed for her to lose weight. Take her to Jenny Jones? Or Dr. Phil? Or Jerry Springer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest Linda hated Jerry Springer. It was always about one man or woman slept with someone else. always the same thing. And the guest to beat up the other. She wondered if they maybe reversed that. You're not going to fight anytime. Of course it could be that someone once loses his patience but that every guest start to fight. <br>\r\nJenny Jones and Dr. Phil at least tried to help people. She had seen some talk shows with kids with weight problems. At the end there was always a dietian and some advice how your kid could lose weight. She wondered if it would help if she would take Nikki to such a show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait a sec. What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to the other channel. She saw some fat and obese children running. Some were sweating and moaning. <br>\r\nThen came a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this kids are overweight. Here at fat camp we'll help them to lose weight. Kids stay here for a whole summer and will drop some of that extra weight. Is your kid overweight send it to fat camp. You won't regret it. We have hundreds of happy people who finally have a healthy thin kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was surprised. She never really thought of that but why not. It was possible she could lose weight. at the other hand those kids seemed to be a bit older then Nikki. She wondered which age the kids must be to enter. She loved Nikki but she was a handful. If she was on fat camp she could rest a bit. Maybe even have some quality time with Bram. That would be nice.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it would't be such a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took her laptop and looked for fat camp. Soon she founds a lot of sites about fat camps slowly she went from site to site. Tales about what they did, way's to lose weight and kids who tried it. It all seemed pretty good. The only problem was Nikki was just a toddler did they take kids at that age. Another thing was if Nikki would be fine a few weeks away from her mother. Sure had been once to her grandma  a week but a few weeks without someone she knew. But maybe it was the best way for her to lose weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see from which age they take kids.

After all losing so much weight at such a young age wasn't very healthy for children still growing so much. Not only that but sending toddlers away from their parents for such a long period of time wasn't something many thought was a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like Nikki was going to be spared the dieting Linda so badly wanted, until Linda clicked on the last link of the page. The mother's face lit up as she saw what the page told her. Although fat camp was a bit too much toddlers, they did offer a day camp right in the city specifically for 4-6 year olds. It was to get chubby toddlers active and make them exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Linda was sold on the idea, even if they price was a bit high. She'd be willing to pay it if it would help her obese little girl drop some pounds. She instantly picked up the phone and began to call the company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course while this was happening, Nikki was also searching for fat toddlers as well. However, it wasn't weight loss she was after, it was weight gain. It was a bit hard for her, since she couldn't read yet, but thanks to finding a video about fat kids on a talk show, she was able to use this to find more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned as she watched the obese kids happily play and stuff themselves, despite the announcer talking about how horrible their blubber was. The big bellied little girl didn't pay attention to this, she just happy watched the children, who she thought looked great and so much cuter with all their added pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nikki looked up and saw her mother. Linda looked at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See Nikki. Being fat is very unhealthy.\" Linda said and looked at her obese daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded. She did't put any attention to the bad thing the man said about being fat but Linda thought she looked it up to see how unhealthy being fat was, and Nikki knew it was wiser to let her mother think that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway get downstairs. I got a little surprise for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was surprised. She wondered what her mother mend. The next moment she got suspicious. She knew how much her mother wanted her to lose weight and if she thought of a new way she assumed Nikki would like it also. Now we know Nikki never did but her mother still tried.<br>\r\nHer mother took her to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever heard about fat camp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Nikki said telling the truth, she understood the word fat and camp apart but not together.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well fat camp is a place were overweight kids and teens go to to lose weight. Since these kids ares sick and tired of being fat. The want too become thin. Well I thought it was a perfect way to send you a few weeks to fat camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki felt terrible. She did't want too. She was thinking what to do . Crying, stamping with her feet screaming: \"I'm not going\", Or maybe both. But before she could decide Linda continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're too young for fat camp. They think it's unhealthy losing so much weight at such a young age and that your a bit young to be away from your parents so long. But I found a link to a day camp that is special for toddlers age 4-6 for losing weight. Is't that good news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was closer too the point of crying then laughing. She did't want to go to any stupid day camp with a bunch of kids she did't know and she especially did't want to lose weight. She thought she made that clear by now to her mother. Why was it so hard for her to understand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh but mom I don't really want too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Nikki this is very expensive. But I'm willing to do it just for you so you become healthy. Do you understand?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nNikki nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed you to be full at your birthday, I allow that Tina is your babysitter and I even allowed you to become a plus size model so please try to lose weight at this camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did't know. She was't planning to lose weight no matter if she did or did not went to the day camp but she did't want to make her mother angry again. She was tired of all the fights she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you also looked at the computer a way to lose weight and this is it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked scared. The only way she looked at it was because she could see fat kids. Not because she wanted to lose weight.<br>\r\nLinda finally saw her chance. All this time maybe this was the way. It did't cared to her If Nikki wanted it or not. She fast filled in a forum.<br>\r\nSince Nikki could't read yet she did't knew what her mother was doing but she had a bad feeling about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Nikki asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Filling in a form so you can go to the day camp.\" Linda said well she filled the last things in and clicked on send. \"So that was all. This is gonna cost us a lot of money but if it helps you lose weight I'm willing to pay it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki nodded with a empty expression at her face. </span></div></div>",

We start in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at the other kids. She was without a doubt the fattest but the others were also fat. Two boys and three girls. <br>\r\nThe first girl had long blond hair till half way her back and had a big belly, butt and thighs. While Nikki looked at her she blow a pink chewing gum ball.<br>\r\nThen there was a black haired girl who was fat all over. She wore a way too short shirt that clearly showed her big belly.<br>\r\nThe third girl was tanned with long black hair shiny hair till even over her middle, and was also fat all over. She wore some short army clothes but smiled friendly and played a bit with her hair.<br>\r\nOne of the boys was white with black hair and a big belly that friendly waved and a smaller boy with brown hair. She would rather call him chubby then fat. He seemed to stand a bit apart from the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... Hello.\" Nikki said since she did't know what else to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" The blond girl said. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My... my name is Nikki.\" Nikki answered. \"And who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sasha. That's Jammie and that tanned girl is Kelly. Over there is Gordo and Jack.\" The blond girl answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're here to lose some weight. Well looking at you I'm not surprised.\" Jammie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not planning to lose weight. I don't wanna lose weight I like being fat and I wanna stay fat!\" Nikki said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right! She passed.\" Kelly yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what did I do?\" Nikki asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed. Remember what I just said? So you're here to lose some weight. That was a test. We don't wanna lose weight. But we needed to make sure you was one of us so we tested you and you passed.\" Jammie said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also don't wanna lose weight?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one here wants.\" Sasha said. \"We were all dropped here by our parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true Sasha. Some kids do want to come here. They did't want to be fat anymore or are tired of being teased with being fat. So a lot of kids want to come here.\" Jammie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... That might be true but they did't get a chance. They need to come here if you liked it or not.\" Sasha said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not planning to lose weight. Besides that... I'm hungry.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did't you had breakfast. Rules for the parents are to give your kid a healthy breakfast before coming here.\" Gordo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe healthy but not tasty that's for sure!\" Kelly said angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does't matter. I'm always hungry for some strange reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you never felt full?\" Jammie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only once. But that time I really ate a lot.

Cool!!!\" Gordo shouted back as he too quickly got in on the feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wasn't going to be left out and quickly wedged her plump young body between the two fellow fatties and began to shovel as many of the tasty waffles into her mouth as she could. They were diet waffles and weren't nearly as good as the ones she had at home, but she was hungry and she hadn't seen anything else around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, all 6 children were stuffing their faces as fast as they could. The large tray of waffles, which had been the morning snack for the entire camp, was quickly polished off by the 6 overweight eating machines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll 6 toddlers weren't satisfied with this meager snack though.

My mom said them all the time.\" Kelly whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just could't bear to see our nation to be filled with fat people. So to help them and our nation I decided to do something about it. I started to think and decided to start at the bottom. A weight lose camp for young kids. But for young kids it's hard being away from their parents so long so I decided to make a day camp from it. So young kids could lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if we don't want to?\" Sasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a stupid question. Everyone here wants to lose weight. You all six agree with me.

Nikki was lying in bed. Linda went sitting in the desk chair and softly drove it to Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was always at your side.\" She said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop saying that. You were never at my side. You never wanted me to get fat. You always wanted me to lose weight or go on a diet and exercise you never cared what I wanted. The only time you did it was on my birthday. That one time and the only reason you did that was because you hoped I needed to loose weight after it. Yeah mom I heard you talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I did push you a bit. I apologize. I'm sorry for everything I did. But it was only with the best interest. I only wanted to help you become healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't wanna. Not if I need to lose weight. Besides you heard those doctor. I'm healthy, and she has studied for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki there's something else I need to tell you. Maybe you noticed my belly got a bit rounder too... I'm gonna have a baby. A little girl. just like you once were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did't say anything. She did't know what to think. Other kids at daycare sometimes had younger brothers or sisters who came with their parents to pick his or her older brother or sister up. Did this mean that mommy and daddy wanna replace her? Would something else happen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are now gonna be the bigger sister. Is't that great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know it's a girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I checked it at the hospital. It was the only way to know if I need to paint the baby room blue or pink. Also  the answer if  could use your old dresses. So what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Nikki answered telling the truth. \"But what about me. If she's here instead of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Nikki don't be silly.\" Linda said and hugged Nikki. \"She's not here to replace you or something. She's gonna be a part of the family. I will love her just as much as I love you. Love is't a bottle Nikki. It's not that I need to share it over two girls. I love you both equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it can be fun.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're the oldest I expect you help a bit taking care of your little sister. Believe me they're much more fun then dolls. Besides you also like Nicole. That little sister of Denvert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up. She did't thought about that. She must admit she really liked Nicole. So maybe a new sister would also be all right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only hope she does't eat so much like you. Linda thought but did't said it. When Nikki was born she was glad and expected that she could exercise with her with whatever she would do. Football, base ball, gymnastics or even ballet. But she soon discovered that Nikki would't do any of those things. With Nikki's size the only sport that she would be good in would be sumo wrestling. She was't planning to let Nikki do that.<br>\r\nBut maybe she could do something like that with her new child. Who knew maybe Nikki would join.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess It's no use is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Letting you lose weight. I tried about a dozen of things the past time and not one of them came even close to letting you lose weight. I want you to lose weight so you be healthy. So what am I doing wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point. What you said. You said: I want you to lose weight. Is't it about what I want? It's my body after all.\"<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"I don't know Nikki. I really don't know. It's like fate does't want you to become thin. I tried so much and so many people were against it. I don't know. Maybe I should accept it but I don't want that you have serious health problems before the age of ten.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>About two months went by and Nikki gained some more pounds. However Linda finally found a way not to let Nikki lose weight but slow down her gain a bit. She bought a lot of fruit. Nikki ate about everything what was edible. Of course she liked chips and cookies more then fruit but that did't want to say she did't liked fruit and food was food so she replaced some of her food intake with fruit. It at least took away a part of her hunger but never entirely.<br>\r\nLinda's belly also got rounder each month. Nikki was still a bit worried sometimes, but she must admit thinking about a little sister like Nicole seemed pretty good. She was a bit excited and did't liked it she need to wait several months. Her parents were slowly started to make lists and think about several names and stuff they needed to buy.<br>\r\nFor Nikki came something important too. Her mother took her too school. Sure Nikki knew it was going too happen but still it was all a bit suddenly for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy do I really need to go to school?\" Nikki asked a bit scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Nikki. You do need to learn how to write and read. It's all very important. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but... it's my first day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey it's every ones first day. Not only yours. Besides look at the bright side. Tanja, Robbie and Denvert also go to your school. Is't that nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked up surprised. She did't expected that but she must admit that did make her feel a lot better. At least she would have some people to talk to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right we're here.\" Linda said and stopped the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Nikki by her risk and between all other children she walked to Nikki's class. She was a bit worried. There were kids of all shapes and sizes some were also fat but even the fattest were't near so fat if Nikki. he would probably be teased a lot. But maybe that would make Nikki wanna lose weight.   <br>\r\nShe opened the door and saw the teacher there were already some other kids and parents that kissed their kids goodbye.<br>\r\nThe teacher was a young slender woman who seemed to get really along with children. She walked over to the teacher and introduced herself and Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. So this is Nikki. We're glad to have you hear Nikki. I'm your teacher Miss Tatcher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised since she had never seen a kid Nikki's size but she was used to not show it when a kid was a bit different in any way. She talked a bit with Linda while Nikki looked around a saw Tanja and Robbie and waddled over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nikki. Is't it cool we're all in the same school now?\" Tanja said. \"I heard Denvert would also soon be here. We can put our desks together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki went sitting on a chair and miss Tatcher noticed that Nikki's rear was too wide for the normal chairs for kids in first grade and she promised to take a bigger chair for her during recess. She already saw some other children staring and pointing at Nikki and whispering. She knew this girl would probably have a hard time at school. If kids were a bit different like in her case very fat other kids would tease her with it. She would try to stop that as much if she could but knew she would't be able to totally stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so excited to learn how to write!\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" She heard suddenly someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her head and Denvert running towards her and he started hugging her. over her shoulder she saw his mom holding Nicole tight by her risk. She waved at her and she waved back. After all parents left the teacher said all students could make groups. Nikki and Denvert shove their desks next to each other against Tanja and Robbie's desks.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"All right.\" Miss Tatcher said. \"Welcome to our school. I hope we all have a fun time here. This year I'm gonna teach you how to write, read and how to count. I hope we can have a fun first year.\"<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

It wasn't the most interesting thing the girl had heard, but she understood what was going on. However, this wasn't what made the lesson so hard for her to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teacher went on in her happy kindergartner voice about the first letter alphabet, Nikki and the rest at their little grouping of desks noticed a number of other kids staring at \"little\" Nikki. Some were shocked, most were simply curious and more than a few looked a little too mischievous for Nikki's own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki wasn't at all thrill with those eyes. She didn't mind the extra attention she was getting. Heck some of it was kind of nice for the obese little girl. However, she knew more than a few looking at her weren't fond of the little butterball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over at her friends for some support. She got it from everyone there. Even from Robbie who wasn't overly into her blubber or gaining gave her some much need encouragement, even if it was only in his eyes. However, the overly portly little 5 year old could also see the worried looks in everyone's eyes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, the teacher finished her lesson and the class was let outside for recess. Nikki instantly stood up but was a little unsure about following everyone else outside. It was only when Denvert grabbed her hand did she feel okay enough to go with him, well after grabbing her recess snack of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly let her boyfriend lead her outside where most of the other children were playing some sort of game, or talking with their friends. Of course Nikki only wanted to sit and eat her snack, which she did at the first tree with adequate shade for her and Denvert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or do you wanna stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. It's just how the others were looking at me. Not everyone looked so friendly. Some even looked a bit mean. Don't tell me you did't see it. I like being fat and gaining and eating of course it's one of my hobbies. But I'm a bit afraid how some would react.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenver looked at his girlfriend. Nikki was right of course. She was obvious the fattest kid in class. Probably the heaviest kid in school. He was't sure since he knew obesity in children was a growing problem. Nikki of course was an easy target for other kids. But he would't let that happen. Not if he could stop it. Then he could at least used all the training he had from his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he saw two girls walking over too them. One was a bitchy girl with a big curl in her yellow blond hair and fire red lips. A short skirt that left her flat belly bare and some sunglasses on her forehead.<br>\r\nThe other seemed kind of muscular especially at her young age. She had dark brown, straight her that fell around her face. She wore black pants and a dark blue sweater and had a mean grin that showed her teeth and braces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well. If that is't the queen of flab.\" The blond girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a name. It's Nikki or are to stupid to remind that.\" Nikki reacted snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should go too the Zoo. We have no place for a hippo in our class!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We seem to have room for dogs. A bitch like you is also in the class.\" Nikki said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seems like the fatso has something to say. Guess when you stand on the scale it says: people please one at a time.\" The dark haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you two go bother someone else?\" Denvert asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it because of that wide load there. We have trouble getting around her.\" The blond one said<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I bet you're the fattest kid in class. You're even heavier then our teacher and she's an adult.\" The dark haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow did you found that out all on your own? I know I am the fattest girl in our class. Perhaps on the entire school but a least I'm nice an I look good.\" <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Do you really think that you look good? You are a disgusting fat pig. I'm a beautiful girl.My mother told me that.\" The blond one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well I work like a model.\" Nikki said confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert was cooking from anger from what the girls said against his girlfriend. Suddenly he saw Robbie and Tanja walk so innocent in their direction. They could better stop teasing Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? A model? Act normal. Which magazine would want you to become a model? You're way too fat to become a model.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop teasing or else...\" Denvert said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else what.\" The blond girl sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would stop teasing if I were you.\" Tanja said with a voice as cold as ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or else? What can you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanja was fast. She bend through her legs stuck on leg out and waved it over the ground and knocked the girl legs away and in less the a second she stood right up again while the blond fell on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do ballet. It's not only a fun way of dancing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond girl stood up and snapped with her finger and the two of them walked away.<br>\r\nNikki smiled happy now she knew that even if life would be hard she could count on her friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, after what just happened, the kids were less than enthusiastic to take a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRue wasn't doing much at the moment. This internal conflict Nikki and the others were having wasn't something she noticed. To her, they just seemed like nice kids who could be her friends. The only real thing she noticed with this group was just how fat Nikki was. I mean, it was really hard not to notice it. To her that didn't matter. I mean she looked more cute with so much blubber on her, like a big warm teddy to cuddle up with, not that she wanted to actually do that with Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end it wasn't Nikki, Robbie or Tanja who decided she was okay. It was Denvert who really noticed this chubby young girl wasn't here to cause trouble. Besides, he had to admit she did look pretty cute with so much fat on her. True, his young heart belonged to Nikki, but that didn't mean he hadn't noticed her pudge. After all, he did like fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe you can play with us...\" He said as he finally took a seat between her and Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others thought for a moment, before accepting his proposal. They too could see this girl probably wasn't going to be mean to Nikki about her weight. In fact, Nikki decided it would be okay to actually start on her cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese girl took out the slice and happily licked her lips at it. Her plump middle couldn't help but give off a loud grumble. It hadn't been fed since this morning and all the stress of the day had made her extra hungry.

You can't really miss that belly of yours.\" Denvert said too Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's because of my mom. Short after I was born she started to get really fat. Maybe that's why I like big bellies so much. That fat was so warm and soft and I always liked it to sink a bit in it.\" Rue said. \"But she died about one and a half year ago. Hart attack.

Whatever mistrust she might have had for this cute plump kid was now gone and she was starting to get really glad that she had met this child. Even with her normal group of friends, she was feeling a little lonely with no one else coming over to talk with her....at least not nicely anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were temporarily put on hold as she was forced to get up, her big round belly sloshing as she did so, and waddle back to class.

She really hoped she could sit with her new friends. She didn't want to be made fun of by the others at her table again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like way too long, Nikki and the group had reached the classroom.

It took a few moments, but the nice lady walked over with Rue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello kids.\" The adult said in her friendly kindergarten voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Rue. Would it be okay if she sat with at your table?\" She asked, unaware that they had met before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone grinned and nodded happily to the teacher before Rue almost ran to get her stuff.

Come on!\"<br>\r\nThe lazy girl groaned, but waddled to the center of the hall nonetheless. She could feel all the other kid's eyes on her, and she pulled her gym shirt down self-consciously, but it quickly rode back up. Apparently her mom hadn't bought quite large enough a size...<br>\r\n\"Okay children. Repeat after me; 'what's the time, Mr Wolf?'<br>\r\nThe children chanted the phrase, and Nikki picked a number at random.<br>\r\n\"Four.\"<br>\r\nAll the other children took four steps towards her, then chanted again.<br>\r\n\"What's the time, Mr Wolf?\"<br>\r\n\"Er, three!\"<br>\r\nThey took another three steps forwards, but this time when they all sang out the phrase, Mrs Tatcher whispered loudly to Nikki; \"Say Lunchtime!\"<br>\r\n\"It-it's lunchtime!\" said Nikki, and the kids scattered.

However, she never got closer than a few meters to even the chubbiest other children, her feeble muscles letting her down again.<br>\r\nIn less than half a minute she was completely exhausted, her legs failing and sending her stumbling to the floor, trying desperately to provide her lungs with air.

She nodded, trying to blink the tears away. \"Come on, you can sit on the bench whilst the other's finish the game.<br>\r\nWith a great heave, she managed to pull Nikki to her feet and led her to the bench at the side of the hall, while the other children giggled at her.

It didn't look <i>too</i> hard; you got to keep your knees on the floor, and she thought her arms weren't too weak to manage at least one or two. She followed the rest of the class in adopting the position, but her stomach practically scraped the floor even before she bent her arms! Red in the face, she tried to pull her shirt down to prevent her belly hanging out, but it sprang back up again.<br>\r\nDetermined to succeed at least once, she resumed the position and tried to do a press-up, but the moment her arms bent they collapsed under her considerable weight and she fell onto her stomach, knocking the wind out of herself. By the time she'd got her breath back, everyone else had done at least four and Mrs Tatcher had given the order to pack away the mats.

I'm still busy learning all your names. I'm not ready to already learn the names of your siblings. But you said you like being fat, and Denvert and Rue too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's right.

It would seem the events of the gym class had amounted to nothing after all. <br>\r\nOr at least; that was how it seemed until a gust of plot-convenient wind caught Nikki's jacket as she was lifted from the car and the letter Mrs Tatcher had given her fell out her pocket, landing on the gravel of their driveway.

Gymnastics, running, football, baseball, hockey, volleyball, swimming even cheer leading and ballet would be fine with her but she did't do any of those things. According too Nikki exercise only made her tired. <br>\r\nShe tried several ways to let Nikki lose weight, but it never worked. And now this teacher thought that she knew it better.

I knew that other kids would tease you. Kids do that you know. They can be really cruel. I know that. That was another reason why I wanted you to lose weight. Not the most important reason but one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else was standing in the letter?\" Nikki asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that you were obese and out of shape and fast were out of breath. You know the normal things we talked about. More then once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does't she mind her own business.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was also a bit angry at Nikki's teacher.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The following morning, after she'd dropped Nikki off at school, Linda sat in the car for a long while just outside the school gates, thinking. She hadn't told Nikki about the appointment; she'd been too tired for the inevitable argument, but as she'd watched her daughter waddle into the school building, it had felt like a betrayal of trust. Hopefully she wouldn't be too annoyed; the young girl had a temper to match her appetite.<br>\r\nFinally, she put the car into gear and accelerated away from the school. If she delayed much longer, she'd be late for work!<br>\r\n//////<br>\r\nA few hours later, Nikki was sitting cross-legged on the carpet along with the rest of her class, listening disinterestedly as Mrs Tatcher read them a story about a crocodile who wore a top hat. She didn't like carpet time at all. She thought the stories were boring and too difficult to understand, for a start, but her legs also went numb from her weight, making her feel very uncomfortable. Worst, the classroom was quite small, and though there were only ten of them in the class space was very limited, so she was pressed up against the other kids. It made her slightly self conscious how much space she took up with her wide form. Suddenly the door opened, and a plump woman entered the classroom, quickly going to stand at the back. Mrs Tatcher finished her sentence, then looked up at her.<br>\r\n\"Mrs Caroline, what can I do to help you?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"I've got a school nurse's appointment for Nikki.\" The woman answered shortly. <br>\r\nMrs Tatcher gestured at the woman.<br>\r\n\"Go on Nikki, go with Mrs Caroline.\" Confused, the young girl heaved herself to her feet, and followed the plump woman out the door.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I have an appointment.\" said Nikki, trying to match the woman's speedy pace with difficulty.<br>\r\n\"Your mom booked it last night, now hurry up.\"<br>\r\nThe answer only made her feel more confused; surely her mom would have told her if she'd had an appointment?<br>\r\nFinally, they arrived at the nurse's office, much to Nikki's exhausted relief. She leaned against the wall, panting for breath; that quick walk had been exhausting. Meanwhile, Mrs Caroline poked her head into the room and had a brief conversation with the nurse, before shooing the young girl inside.<br>\r\n//////<br>\r\nMr Ragni had worked as the school nurse at Westhama school for 13 years, and he had seen a huge amount of ill kids come through his office; today, however, he would have the dubious pleasure of examining the largest five year old he would ever meet. He had been told by Mrs Tatcher why he was to see Nikki -a general health check-up with a focus on weight-based issues- but he hadn't expected her to be so... <i>big</i>. He had a daughter himself, a tiny six year old girl, and though she had a big appetite he was always careful to feed her a balanced diet. Seeing Nikki, still out of breath from the short walk down the corridor, made him wonder how her parents had failed so badly at something so simple. Still; he had a job to do. He smiled widely.<br>\r\n\"Hello Nikki. Do you know why you're here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n\"No. Mom didn't book anything.\" she wasn't the smartest child, and had never registered the phone call at dinner as anything relevant.<br>\r\n\"Oh, she must have forgotten to tell you. Don't worry though, we're just going to do a quick examination, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"What's an examination?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, I just have a- I have a look at you. To make sure you're healthy.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm very healthy!\" Nikki said, offended.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you are, it's just my job to make sure. Now, first you just need to stand as straight as you can on this little pad. He gestured at the bright painted weight and height measurement machine. <br>\r\nShe waddled over and stood on it, and Mr Ragni checked her height; 104 cm, or 3'5. <br>\r\nThen he checked the scale. God... 294,5 pounds. He knew adults who weighed less than that! Nonetheless, he checked the BMI chart, though he knew the result already. Morbidly obese. He struggled to keep the optimistic smile on his face as he felt a surge of sympathy for the girl.<br>\r\n\"See! I'm fine.\" said the girl. He looked at her.<br>\r\n\"Well, er, let's finish the examination first, okay? You can step off the pad now.\"<br>\r\nHe rummaged around in a drawer for a moment, before finding his tape measure and turning back to Nikki. Pulling her outgrown shirt up, he looped the tape measure around her soft, rounded midsection. His hands were cold against her warm flesh as he pulled the tape round, before he encountered a problem; it was too short. Even pulled tight around her middle, his 50 centimeter measure was too short. He half-heartedly attempted to measure her hips, but though they were slightly smaller than her waist, it was still a futile effort.<br>\r\nHe returned the useless tape back to his drawer, before turning back to Nikki, stethoscope in hand.<br>\r\n'Could you take off your shirt, please?' he asked, and once she had obliged he placed the cold metal of the device against her flabby chest, listening to her heartbeat. After a long, uncomfortable minute, he sat back again, making a note on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n'Well, I think that should be all, you can-' he started, but Nikki butted in.<br>\r\n'I told you I was healthy.' She said smugly.<br>\r\nHe looked at the girl, still breathing slightly fast from the walk, belly sagging over the waistband of her tight shorts, and considered for a second.<br>\r\nHe was going to have to talk to her mother'</span></div></div>",

It was free time and kids were playing, drawing and looking in books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Nikki. Why did you need to go to the school doctor?\" Tanja asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Nikki answered. \"I'm not sure if I really needed to go there. I mean my mother did't tell me. Perhaps it was a Nikki from another class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well every kid needs to go to the school nurse once a year. But mostly they do it alphabetical.\" Denvert said calmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did the doctor said about your weight?\" Rue asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that? I'm perfectly healthy.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he told you that?\" Rue asked clearly. \"Did he really said: 'You're are healthy'? Or did you just assume you're healthy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at Rue  not really understanding what she mend. But now she thought about it she realized the doctor did't said she was healthy. She just assumed she was healthy. He did't told her she was healthy but he did't told her she was unhealthy. She looked at Rue who looked a bit worried at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he did't said I was healthy but he did't said I was unhealthy so I guess... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki I don't think he thought you were healthy. I've been to several doctors and mostly they had something bad to say about my weight. My sister had the same problem. You are way fatter then me or my sister at your age, so I can't believe he thought you were healthy at you're weight. Perhaps you're healthy. I mean those doctor's only see numbers. They don't know how healthy you are. They only believe the numbers. If they say you're unhealthy they believe that. If they say you're not they believe you're not healthy. I don't think he thought you were healthy since your weight is much higher then average.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked at her new friend. She liked Rue. She did't really liked what she was saying now but at the other hand she might be right. What she said did make sense. Perhaps she was right and did the doctor really thought she was unhealthy. Now she thought about it every time she told him she was healthy he more or less avoid the answer. <br>\r\nNikki swallowed worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think he thought I was unhealthy?\" Nikki asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he thinks you're healthy. Sorry Nikki.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... now what?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess he want to have a talk with your mother. But like Denvert said: Every kid has once a year a check up by the school doctor. You also go to the school doctor if you feel sick or are injured but... you also needs to go if one of your parents make a appointment for you. Would you mother make a appointment for you because she think you're too fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She would!\" Nikki, Denvert, Robbie and Tanja answered together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did't she tell me? Why.... why... why. I mean I'm a nice girl right. I'm maybe not perfect but be honest nobody is perfect.\"       <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Maybe she just forgot.\" Tanja suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.... Nikki said slowly. I'll ask her when she picks me up.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Mrs Tatcher had tried to get her a larger chair to sit on, but it was school policy that all pupils had the same equipment and it hadn't been allowed, so she'd just have to deal with the normal chairs.<br>\r\nWhen the worksheet arrived, passed over to her by Tanja, Nikki leant forwards and squinted at it. Adding big numbers to little numbers; 3+7. She considered the question. Maybe... 6? She liked 6.<br>\r\nWith an effort she reached forwards and picked up her pencil, quickly scribbled a wonky 6 on the paper, then sat back with a groan. Because of her huge stomach, she had to sit quite a way back from the desk, and reaching the tabletop with her short arms was quite a challenge. She took a few more deep breaths, then leant forwards again. 2+6. Was that 8? Or 9? Sitting back again, she looked around the classroom, already bored with maths.<br>\r\nOut the window, she could see other kids running around in their PE kits, playing games whilst their teachers watched. She didn\u2019t understand what they liked about exercise; she\u2019d never done any herself, and it looked tiring. Then again, they were all laughing together, and it looked like they were having fun\u2026 the only times she felt as happy as they looked was when she was eating.<br>\r\nOn the subject of eating, there was a sudden ringing sound as the bell went for lunch. Mrs Tatcher looked up, surprised. <br>\r\n\u201cOh, is it that late already? Leave your worksheets on the table, and you can go outside for lunch.\u201d<br>\r\nNikki grinned. Finally! A meal would take her mind off the unexpected appointment. She was having a cooked school lunch today, which was quite rare. Heaving herself to her feet, she waddled as fast as she could towards the canteen, completely forgetting to wait for her friends or even grab her coat. Despite her head start, however, she was still nearly last in line to be served, as the older and slimmer kids streamed around her like water around a rock, speeding into a disorderly line in front of her. By the time she\u2019d puffed her way into the queue, she was panting for breath and starving hungry, but at least ten minutes from being served.<br>\r\nBy the time she got to the front, her knees were aching and she was utterly ravenous.<br>\r\n\u201cExtra of everything!\u201d she demanded of the serving lady. The slim woman looked at her tiredly.<br>\r\n\u201cMagic word?\u201d she asked, tonelessly.<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Extra of everything please!\u201d<br>\r\nShe was quickly served large portions of French fries, beans and sausages, and though far less than what she\u2019d have at home she hurried to a table without so much as a thank you, sitting down on a bench. The wood creaked ominously beneath her, but she was too hungry to even notice as she grabbed a handful of fries, stuffing them into her waiting mouth. She stabbed a sausage with a plastic fork, shoving the whole thing in her mouth at once and chewing on the scalding hot meat. In less than five minutes, she had finished eating, but though her stomach was swollen and full, she was still hungry for more.<br>\r\nPicking up her tray again, she heaved herself out of her chair, almost slipping on the polished wooden floor, before heaving her heavy body back towards the remnants of the queue.<br>\r\n\u201cCan I have some more\u2026 please?\u201d she asked, recognising the tired server from before. The woman squinted at her.<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 seeing as you asked nicely, I suppose.\u201d She doled out another portion onto Nikki\u2019s plate, sending her rushing back to her seat to eat her new meal. Despite the fact she\u2019d already eaten the equivalent of three normal meals, she didn\u2019t even slow down as she practically poured the fast food down her throat. Finally she lurched a final time to her feet and put her tray away. Though she could have still eaten more, she knew from experience that the serving ladies would never give her more than two servings.<br>\r\nShe was tired now, the food in her bloated belly making her sleepy. She stumbled out of the dining hall and into the play room, quickly collapsing onto a chair in the corner, sitting awkwardly to accommodate for her overstuffed gut. Maybe just a five minute nap, she thought. Just five minutes\u2026<br>\r\n///////<br>\r\n\u201cNikki? Nikki?\u201d the words permeated her hazy dreams of food, dragging her reluctantly back to the real world. At a third \u201cNikki!\u201d she opened her eyes. Mrs Tatcher was staring at her, hands on hips.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you everywhere, young lady! Classes are about to start, and everyone\u2019s waiting on you!\u201d<br>\r\nShe mumbled a vague apology, attempted to get to her feet, then sat down again suddenly. Her belly was still swollen from lunch, but it was rumbling hungrily again now.<br>\r\nMrs Tatcher grabbed her under the arms, and with a heave, lifted her to her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cNow come on!\u201d she said, hurrying back towards the classroom. Nikki followed reluctantly, moving at a snails pace, but soon they were back at class. Everyone looked at her as she walked in the door, pinning her down with her eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019ve you been?\u201d whispered Tanja questioningly. <br>\r\n\u201cFell asleep\u2026\u201d She mumbled in reply, shuffling towards her seat. After what seemed like an hour, she reached her chair and sat down on it heavily.<br>\r\nThen, several things happened at once. She was aware of a loud cracking sound, then suddenly she was falling backwards, but before she could so much as move a finger something slammed into the back of her head and suddenly\u2026<br>\r\nDarkness and dreams.</span></div></div>",

He was shining a little light into her eye, and she blinked.<br>\r\n\"Nikki?\" he called. \"Can you hear me?\" <br>\r\nShe blinked a few more times, then groaned.<br>\r\n\"Owwwww. My head hurts!\" she complained tearfully.<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" he said, \"You've had quite a fall. We've telephoned your mom, she should be here in a few minutes to pick you up. Okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" there was a pulsing ache in the back of her head, beating in time with her overgrown heart. \"What happened?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, ah, it would seem that when you sat down, the back legs of the chair snapped off and you banged your head on the radiator. Luckily, Mrs Tatcher, Mrs Lowe and Mr Carrow were able to carry you to me. I've had a look; you seem to be okay, so you can go home with your mom when she arrives.\"<br>\r\nNikki lay on the examining table, and though her head was painful, she actually felt quite comfortable. There was a soft pillow behind her head, and she was still tired from lunch. By the time she drifted off to sleep yet again, she could barely even feel the pain in her head.<br>\r\n///////<br>\r\n\"Nikki! Are you alright?!\" Her mom was standing at the side of the table, a scared expression on her narrow face.<br>\r\n\"Huh? Yeah...\" said the young girl drowsily. \"One more minute...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on Nikki, we're going home right now.\" Linda insisted, but suddenly Mr Ragni had taken her by the arm.<br>\r\n\"Actually, Mrs Glemcer, can I have a word with you?\" he asked, leading her away to the other side of the room. Nikki didn't really care; she was far too tired. She caught a few words of their conversation, though she didn't know what any of them meant. \"Morbidly obese\", \"future heart problems\" and \"diabetes\" were all words she heard thrown around, but they made about as much sense as Greek would have to her young ears. <br>\r\nEventually, Linda came back over.<br>\r\n\"We're leaving now Nikki,\" she said, her voice shaky. There were tears on her cheeks. \"Come on.\" <br>\r\nReluctantly, Nikki heaved herself off the table and followed her mother, whining about how much her head hurt. They were soon outside as Nikki stumbled along slowly with Linda rushing ahead, drying her eyes on a tissue she'd produced from somewhere. Half way to the car, the young girl sat down for a rest on the wall. She was shaking off the last vestiges of sleep now and her head was hurting more again, now matching the near-omnipresent ache in her knees. Eventually, she caught her breath as well as she ever did nowadays, and waddled to the car where her mother was standing, gazing at her daughter as if she was an alien.<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" she asked unsurely, and at the sound of her voice Linda seemed to remember who she was.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes.\" she opened the door to the car and, with a great effort and some pulling from Nikki, managed to heave her huge daughter into the car. She was a strong woman, but just getting Nikki into the car was an ordeal that left both of them panting for breath. Nikki shuffled across to the middle seat, the only one where she could sit comfortably, and strapped the seatbelt across her flabby belly. She should really be sitting in a car seat, but she had long ago grown too large for even the very biggest on sale. The sides dug into her soft flesh and the plastic creaked whenever she moved. Never particularly careful, Linda had determined that the best option was just to not use one at all.<br>\r\nThey quickly accelerated away from the school, heading for home. As they sped through the empty streets, Nikki spoke. <br>\r\n\u201cMom, did you book me to see Mr Ragni?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNot now Nikki.\u201d Said Linda, voice slightly shaky.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me I was going to see him?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNikki! Not- not now. We can have this conversation when we\u2019re back home, but for now, please shut up!\u201d As soon as she\u2019d said it she felt bad, but she just could not cope with her daughter getting all \u2018moral high ground\u2019 on her at that moment. Back at the school, Mr Ragni had told her of the results of his examination, and\u2026 oh, God.<br>\r\nShe knew Nikki was overweight, obese even, but according to the knowledgeable nurse, she was far beyond even those classifications. She was, in his words, \u201cPerilously large\u201d. Apparently, she was now at risk of a whole host of things she hadn't even recognized the names of. He had then instructed her that she should put her daughter on a strict diet and exercise plan- or risk losing her altogether.<br>\r\nShe glanced at her daughter through the rear view mirror and sighed, quickly wiping her eyes again with a tissue. She knew how much her daughter loathed exercise, and how important food was to her.<br>\r\nIt was time to make a difficult decision.</span></div></div>",

So would this doctor think something else. However Rue said that the she could't believe that the doctor thought she was healthy. Perhaps that girl had been right the entire time.<br>\r\nBut since her mother did't seem to wanna talk about it she waited.

I just did't want a discussion about it. Besides it was't my idea. Your teacher came with the idea. I just  did't wanna go though all that stuff with you again. But I'm more worried about what the doctor told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't think the injury is fatal. My head hurts but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about that. However I rather that you stay at home for two days. But that's not all. The doctor gave you a check up. Even he was shocked about your weight, and he had seen some pretty overweight kids in his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm a bit overweight?\" Nikki asked not really impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Nikki, you're not, you're way beyond overweight. He told me he never saw any other kid so overweight and more out of shape then you. I got a list with risks you can have in the future longer then the list of times we argued about your weight. He was really worried about your health Nikki and honestly I am too. But you knew that. I never really liked it you were so fat but lately it's really starting to become a problem. I see you're getting tired from walking even short distances. You're getting teased, and I knew that was gonna happen. Nikki you can't go on like this. You need to go on a strict... a strict diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! No please anything but that! I hate dieting! Besides I need to be fat to be a plus size model!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki even if you would lose 200 pounds you will still be fat enough to be a plus size model. I'm afraid you never get slim but I wanna get you at least on a weight without having to worry about any health risks. I'm sorry Nikki but you're in serious danger of health risks. Besides I heard you broke a chair today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T... that... was... a... ac... ac... accident.\" Nikki said between tears. \"He... broke... under... my... my weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. That's one of the problem's of being so overweight. So Nikki I know you won't like it but you're going on a diet and that's final.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki now really started to cry long and loud. She could't deal with a diet. It sounded to her like a fate worse then dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Nikki to help you lose weight you can go on a activity group. I have a whole list of activities here you can choose from. Perhaps you can do something with your friends. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Tears still streaming down her face, she turned and blundered through the doorway and up the stairs towards her room. Moving faster than Linda had seen her move since... well, ever, she practically ran into her bedroom and slammed the door, her wailing sob suddenly muffled by the thick wood.<br>\r\nLinda wiped her eyes on yet another tissue, trying to work out what to do. Nikki would need some time to calm down, she always did after a tantrum, but she'd never seemed quite so upset before...<br>\r\nShe groaned, holding her head in her hands. As if it wasn't difficult enough to accept how badly she'd failed with her daughter's health, now Nikki was making it hard for her when she tried to fix her mistakes! So many hours spent trying to be a good parent, trying to teach ABC's and numbers and seasons and countless other things, and at the end of it, the <i>damn</i> girl got upset when she tried to literally save her life! She'd poured so much love into her, and this is what she got back...<br>\r\nAnd then, in a sudden burst of glorious enlightenment, she realized what she had to do. Perhaps... just perhaps... it was because she'd tried <i>too</i> hard; been too soft, and caused her daughter to become soft herself. Perhaps if she was firm, Nikki could firm up too? It was worth a try, God only knew she'd given everything else a go.<br>\r\nPulling out her laptop, she opened up Excel and began quickly drawing up timelines and tables, graphs and schedules. Working at the sort of speed only a woman trained eight years as a secretary can, she had soon finished a multitude of documents, her daughter's future now in the form of a dozen charts. Hand shaking every so slightly, she clicked print, and listened as the computer in the next room began inking Nikki's life for the next few years.<br>\r\nThe time for apathy had passed; the obese girl was overdue a proper lifestyle, and Linda had taken it upon herself to enforce it.</span></div></div>",

That was the first time in months she'd climbed all the stairs without taking a break, and now her knees and chest hurt again as well as her head. She lay face down on the cotton sheets, sobbing into the pink covers and wishing her mom could just understand and let her be. She wasn't <i>that</i> fat! Maybe Mr Ragni had made up the things he'd told her mom to get revenge for breaking the chair...<br>\r\nEventually, she heaved herself out of the bed and waddled over to the window, leaning against the sill. It had started raining, fat drops splashing against the gravel path outside and dripping off green leaves. Before she could properly take in the unaccustomed sight, however, the window began to steam up from her breath, irregular from the walk over. Perhaps it would be nice to be able to move around without getting so out of breath, or even go outside occasionally...<br>\r\nSuddenly, her stomach started rumbling. It had been hours now since she'd eaten at school, and she was used to eating every half hour or so when at home. Perhaps she still had some candies under her bed? She sank to her hands and knees, clumsily shuffling through the mound of wrappers that had built up over the last few months, but had no luck. She'd have to go downstairs to find something to eat.<br>\r\nShe opened her door as stealthily as she could and sneaked into the corridor, glancing around for any sign of her mother. Nowhere in sight. She began climbing down the stairs, wincing as every step creaked and groaned under her impressive weight. Half way down she stopped briefly to catch her breath, before hurrying down the last few stairs and heading for the kitchen. She glanced up as she waddled towards the doorway, and froze. Linda was standing, arms folded, face resolute, in the entrance to the kitchen.<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello...\" she said, trying to assemble her round face to look as guiltless as possible. \"Can I have a- uh, a snack?\"<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm hungry...\" she whined loudly, and was surprised when her mom's face didn't even change.<br>\r\n\"Good. Perhaps you'll lose some of that weight.\"<br>\r\n\"But- but mom, I'm hungry!\" Spluttered Nikki. She was used to being able to change her mother's mind with ease, just by whining a bit and pouting, but today Linda's face was resolute.<br>\r\n\"No food until dinner, and that's final.\" She said firmly, and Nikki gasped, tears once again welling in the corners of her eyes.<br>\r\n\"But that's hours away!\"<br>\r\n\"Four hours.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll starve if you don't give me food!\" Said Nikki, and Linda smiled thinly.<br>\r\n\"I think starving is the one thing you <i>don't</i> have to worry about, young lady. You can go outside, or you can play in your room. No TV except on weekends from now on.\"<br>\r\nThe corpulent young girl could only stare, shocked. She'd always been able to watch as much TV as she wanted, always been allowed to eat what she wanted... she'd never had restrictions before at all. Now, suddenly, her comfortable life was crashing down around her head. Not even really processing the conversation they'd just had, Nikki stumbled slowly back towards her bedroom, and once more collapsed onto her bed.<br>\r\nThe tears were streaming freely once again, but this time they was silent, aside from her heavy, ragged breathing.<br>\r\nAt least dinner was going to be big... right?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After some time Nikki was cried dry. She could't cry anymore. She could't remember she ever felt so sad. Not even that time when she broke her arm  two years ago. At least everyone then wanted to help her and do things for her. But this sounded to her like the most cruel thing ever. No more food. No more T.V on top of all that. After eating watching T.V was her biggest hobby. She also liked books but the trouble was she could't read yet. Just a few words. She did't thought her mother would read  her a story. But perhaps her father, if he got home.<br>\r\nShe went sitting on the floor on her fat but. She decided to play a bit with some of her toys. She need to wait for four hours anyway. She would like to sneak into the kitchen but knew her mother would guard the kitchen, and to get to the pantry she need to go through the kitchen. There was no where else food in the house. <br>\r\nShe need to keep herself occupied for four whole hours. She reached for her box of toys. She turned it upside down and looked for some dolls or other toys to play with. When she found some she noticed how much room in front of her was occupied by her belly She really need to stretch her arms out. She started to play but she could't really keep her mind to it. Every time her mind drifted of to her true love... food. Finally she threw the barbie doll against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is stupid. Besides that doll is way to skinny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She crawled over to the doll noticing that when she crawled her belly dragged over the floor. She liked that feeling. She picked up the barbie doll and pushed on her belly. Her belly was very flat. There hardly was any belly. All those barbie dolls in every commercial was as flat if a surfboard. While if Nikki looked around in the town or at the playground or in the swimming pool she saw a lot of fat and obese persons. Sure there were also enough skinny persons, but still. It was't really realistic. Did her mother want her to look like this? If she carefully looked at it she thought that it was impossible to have such a body. Besides how where you able to have a baby with such a tiny waist. If her belly was about eight months pregnant she would break in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid doll. Is this how girls need to look like. I rather be fat. I like it.\" She said while she threw the doll away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true she liked being fat. She admitted that she did't liked that she got out of breath so fast. At the other hand she did't liked moving. The only reason she did move was because she needed to. If somebody would carry her she would have liked it. But no one was able to carry her. Not even her parents were able to carry her. Her father had been able to carry her some years ago but even then it was kind of difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did my mother has to be so worried about my weight? I wish I had a mother who did't cared about my weight! Who just wanted me to be happy! I can't help it I never feel full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled on her belly and saw her barbie doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you. You give girls the idea you need to be a toothpick girl with the waist of a insect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she smiled. She picked up different toys of her and put them on her desk. She picked some paper and pencils and started to draw the faces of her toys but instead  of the tiny waists some of her toys had she drew them fat. With big bellies, rubbing thighs, bowl cheeks and flabby arms. She just need to look in the mirror to see how a fat person looked. She must admit she liked doing this. True she was still hungry and did't liked that but at least this kept her occupied until it was time for dinner. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Unlike most other kids her age, she didn't have many toys; she'd always preferred to just watch TV or eat something instead playing with dolls or making things, and now when she couldn't do either she didn't know what to do.<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of sitting bored, she noticed her wardrobe. That was it; she could play dress-up! She waddled over to the closet and pulled open the door, then dragged a few outfits out onto the carpet and began getting undressed. However, she soon ran into a problem. Normally, her mom or dad helped her with changing clothes, and on her own she was having difficulty. She was barely able to reach around her oversized belly to reach the waistband of her pants, never mind actually undoing the button and taking them off. She couldn't even get her shirt off on her own.<br>\r\nDepressed, defeated and out of breath, she lay back down on her bed with a groan. 'It's not like the clothes would have fitted you anyway', pointed out a voice in her head snidely.<br>\r\n\"Shut up.\" She said out loud, then immediately felt a bit stupid; only a few hours without food and she was already starting to talk to herself. Not that she had anyone else to talk to; she was too angry at her mom to try and talk to her, and her dad wasn't home yet. She wondered how long it was until dinner now. She had a big clock on the wall, but she couldn't read it, and she didn't know how long she'd been drawing and playing for.<br>\r\nLying on her bed, she was beginning to feel tired again, as she usually did after doing anything nowadays. Despite how long she'd already spent asleep that day, her eyes became very heavy as her body decided it needed a rest. <br>\r\nAt least her head didn't hurt so much now, she thought as she drifted away into sleep. Always stay positive...<br>\r\n///////////<br>\r\n\"Nikki!\" Linda called up the stairs. \"Time for dinner!\"<br>\r\nInstantly she was wide awake, and before she was even aware of where she was she was halfway down the stairs, belly rumbling loudly and constantly. Stumbling down the last steps, she waddled as fast as she could into the kitchen and all the way to her seat, collapsing into the chair even as the wood groaned ominously under her wide rear.<br>\r\nStony-faced, Linda placed a small starter in front of Nikki, then watched as the young girl shoved it into her mouth and swallowed once, finishing the plate in less than five seconds.<br>\r\n\"What'smaincourse?\" She asked in a rush.<br>\r\n\"That was the main course.\" Said Linda, taking back the plate and going back to the sink to wash it up.<br>\r\n\"What?\"  Nikki stared at her blankly.<br>\r\n\"I said, that was the main course.\"<br>\r\nNikki half smiled, waiting for her mom to reveal the joke, to pull out a big bowl of pasta, or meat, or <i>anything</i>. She'd eaten that starter so quickly she didn't even know what it had been, and her stomach was rumbling so loudly the neighbors probably thought a plane was going overhead.<br>\r\n\"I don't know why you're smiling, Nikki, this diet is no joke.\" Linda said icily, and the 5 year old's smile dropped from her face like a wet bar of soap from the hand.<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud creaking of wood as she slumped back in her chair, and her mom lurched forwards. Linda's icy mask broke, worry sprawling across her face as Nikki's eyes rolled back in her head, showing the whites of her eyes.<br>\r\nShe needn't have worried too much though; At the thought of meals being like this forever, the girl had just fainted dead away.</span></div></div>",

Then he saw Linda and Nikki passed out in her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going om here?\"He asked looking at Nikki and Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm not sure.\" Linda said. \"I made a appointment to send Nikki to the school doctor. Well he said Nikki was morbidly obese, what was't really a surprise and put her on a diet. I also forbid her to watch T.V except during weekends. I also want her to do some sort of exercise. She did't want to choose herself so perhaps I can pick one for her. Well after dinner I told her that what she ate in five seconds was the main course she just passed out. I don't know why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about that bandage around her head?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah she fell at school and hurt her head. But that had nothing to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey are you really sure this is the right way. I admit Nikki is too heavy for her age, and I know it's unhealthy, but forbid her to watch T.V. I understand you don't want her too watch too much T.V but can you just say... only watch a half hour each day instead of no T.V at all. Also putting her on a crash diet. How much food did she get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Linda told her how much or more how less food Nikki got he put on big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all she got?\" He asked in disbelief. \"Listen I understand you want her to lose weight, I do to, but putting on such a strict diet. I don't think that's good for her. Crash diets are only good for adults. There's also the part she does't wanna lose weight so she has no will power to eat less. At least give her some more fruit and vegetables. They have't that much calories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked with a irritated face at her husband. She was't fully agreeing with him. At the other hand he did sound reasonable with just a half hour T.V a day and giving Nikki some more fruit and vegetables. Perhaps Nikki would't make such a big drama about it. Well she would probably make a drama about it anyway but hopefully she would't faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also think we need to follow the diet too.\" He said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can't be serious. I'm not fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doe's have much will power. How do you want to motivate her if you can eat delicious things like meat, gravy and fries while she only can have a small amount. You want her to lose weight. You making it easier if we too follow the diet. That's fair. Else she sees us eating things she cant have. That's just teasing her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. You're right. But it's not fair to him... her... it... to our child.\" She said and patted her bulging belly. \"If I need to follow a diet while being pregnant... do you think that's good for the child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True... but then eat food when Nikki is at school or in bed. At least so she can't see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly they heard a mumbling sound at Nikki got up. After a few seconds she remembered what happened and looked with a terrified look at her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki,\" Bram started. \"I talked with your mother and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't put me on this diet! I starve! I just had a main course that was smaller then a appetizer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki calm down. Let me finish. You're allowed to watch T.V A half hour a day. I also talked about your portions. Well they will get a bit bigger but mostly with vegetables and fruit, and to make it easier for you we will also follow the diet. I also have you rather stay at home tomorrow.\" Looking at her bandage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So can I have some more food now?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine I will make some fruit for you.\" Linda said and sighed. \"And you can thank you father for all those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki still did't agree with the diet but she was wise enough to did't push her luck now. She needed to think of something. But what?<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The following weeks had been utter hell for Nikki. Her meals were far too small, mom was extremely strict, and her dad was of no help at all. She had tried talking, reasoning, even begging for them to stop making her diet. She felt as if there were shackles around her. The only time she saw her friends was at school. Her mom wouldn't let her play with them at all. Unsure of what to do, Nikki fell into a depression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I can't keep doing this. First the diet now, I can't see my friends. Mom pulled me from plus sized modeling. What else is she going to take from me?\" Nikki sobbed into her pillow. She was in her room which is where she always went to after school. Nikki looked at a crude drawing of her mother. She had made it just before her diet had started. She didn't understand why her mom changed so suddenly. Maybe this was her moms plan all along. It had to be. At least that's what Nikki's logic was. Her mom was jealous of Nikki. Nikki was fat and happy. Her mom was skinny and grumpy all the time. Nikki grabbed the drawing and promptly ripped it apart. Seething with anger, she stomped on the remains as hard as she could which was pretty difficult for her since her belly was all she could see when looking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"That....will...teach..you.\" Nikki said between heavy breaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nikki, its weigh in day. Get over here right now!\" Linda shouted from the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nikki waddled her way out of her room. She hatted this day of the week most, Friday. Friday was when she stood on a scale and wait for her mom to pass judgement. Last week Nikki didn't loose any weight which made Linda furious. \"This week will probably be no different.\" Nikki thought. She hobbled onto the scale and after a few seconds it showed her weight. Nikki had no lost any weight at all. In fact, she gained one pound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How is that possible! 283 pounds! You gained weight, Nikki! Who gave you food? Was it those friends of yours?\" Linda asked with an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"No they didn't! I only ate what you put in my lunchbox.\" Nikki replied. Which was a lie, Danvert, Nicole, and Tanja had been giving their lunches to Nikki everyday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't want to hear your lies. Go to your room. No dinner for you tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Why do you hate me so much?\" Nikki whispered <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"To you room, now!\" yelled Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Nikki waddled away leaving Linda standing in the bathroom. Once Linda heard the door to Nikki's room shut, she began to silently cry. \"I don't hate you, Nikki. I just can't get you to see what you are doing to yourself.\" After recomposing herself, Linda walked to the kitchen to prepare dinner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The past weeks had been the worst weeks of Nikki's entire short life. She did't want to be on a diet and eat small meals that she could eat in a few seconds. She wanted to eat. No, not really eat, she wanted to pig out. Stuff her face. Wolfing down a mountain of food. She felt like she could eat a horse. Literally. Well her mother did let her eat some fruit ever now and then. It was't much... but better then nothing. She was happy her father had done at least something for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really need more food.\" Nikki whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was, there was only food in the fridge, the freezer, the cupboard and in the pantry. The fridge, freezer and cupboard were all in the kitchen and the only way too the pantry was through the kitchen but Linda was guarded the kitchen like a tiger. She even put a lock on the pantry. Besides, even if she was able to get something to eat her mother would find it out. She always knew it if some food was missing.  <br>\r\nHer mothers baby bump got bigger each week. She wondered if her mother followed the diet. Sure she followed the diet around her but further. It did't really mind. t did't changed anything for her. Her mother was thin so she did't need to diet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rue had been right the entire time. She knew the doctor did't thought I was healthy. Well doctor's had probably said the same to her many times. I wish her sister could take me home. She would feed me. Or Tina, she would feed me too. But my mother don't let me see my friends or Tina. Just because she thinks they feed me... what they probably will do now I'm saying this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki knew that there was't a way to get the food inside the house. So if she wanted food then she need to get food outside. Point is, Linda kept a eye on her the entire time. Climbing out of the window was impossible for a girl of her size. Why did she have Linda for a mother. Why not Denvert's mother or Tina. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But there must be a way. Tina would take food to me... but my mother is watching me every hour of the day... wait a second. Maybe Tina can bring me food during the night! Perhaps Rue's sister can help her. I need to wait until my parent are asleep. I just need to call Rue and Tina tomorrow. Rue can ask her sister if she can help Tina get some food to me when it's night. Then I can pig out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to smile. Something she had't done for some time now. Why did't she thought of this before. She knew Linda would be furious the next weigh in moment but that was worth it and perhaps Linda would give up. She doubted it but... who knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I did come on with a plan. But I need to be patient.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took some paper and some pencils, since she could't read yet, could only watch a half hour T.V each day, and was't allowed to eat much food Nikki started to draw to kill time. She got pretty good. She still liked drawing heads of toys and cartoon figures on fat bodies and she got better at it each day. Her belly rumbled but hopefully she could change that soon.     </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Linda was at a crossroads. There was no doubt a diet and exercise plan would be beneficial to Nikki, considering her immense size and ravenous appetite. But at the same time, she couldn't just cut her favourite thing out of her life; it would devastate her! And forcing her into exercise would just do more harm than good, considering she got winded from climbing the stairs at home. Granted, helping her lose weight would stop that, but she couldn't just throw it on her. She's only five after all!<br>\r\nBesides, she figured internally, her obese offspring hadn't shown any health problems. Nothing <i>too</i> serious anyway, just laziness and difficulty to find clothes her size. She never once said anything about chest pains or anything of the sort her whole life, just either that she was tired or she was hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, Linda decided to not worry about putting her globular girl on a diet. At least not yet; she was only young, and had all the time in the world to diet. Until something <i>serious</i> happened to her, she could let her eat all she likes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she did begin to feel a guilt rising within her; she'd yelled at her own daughter to shut up, and for no good reason. Time to remedy that.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright sweetie?\" She asked softly, keeping her eyes on the road, \"How's your head now?\"<br>\r\n\"Still hurts a bit,\" Nikki mumbled, eyes blinking tiredly. She must've just been about to settle down for a nap.<br>\r\nLinda let out a sigh. \"Nikki, I'm sorry for snapping at you. Mommy just had a lot to think about and didn't mean to yell.\"<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" the porky girl nodded slowly, \"you didn't look so good when you came outta the doctor's office. Did you get sick?\"<br>\r\n\"No, no,\" her mother chuckled, shaking her head, \"He was just telling me to make sure you're safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin appeared on Linda's face as an idea came to her. \"I know what'll cheer you right up; some ice cream and a good rest on the sofa!\"<br>\r\nNikki gasped, the drowsiness in her eyes replaced by a look of pure surprise. \"You mean it?!\"<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetheart,\" Linda nodded, sounding as sincere as possible, \"you had a bad fall, so you need to take it easy until you're better!\"<br>\r\nA huge smile broke across Nikki's face, pushing her cheeks over her eyes a bit, and her large legs kicked in a new-found excitement. Her stomach sounding its approval in the form of a loud grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Linda parked the car into the driveway and heaved Nikki out of her seat. She watched adoringly as her dumpy daughter waddled ahead of her toward the door, bouncing on her toes by the door and causing her large belly to bounce up and down with her.<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright,\" she chuckled, unlocking the door and pushing it open. She followed Nikki inside as she made a slow beeline for the living room, getting a helpful push from her mother onto the sofa after a few unsuccessful attempts to raise her leg up onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then sweetie, what kind of ice cream would you like?\" Linda asked, kneeled down and setting Nikki into a laying position, propping a pillow behind her sore head head on the armrest.<br>\r\n\"Ummm...chocolate,\" Nikki decided, then shook her head, \"wait, strawberry...no, vanilla. Wait, chocolate! Um...\"<br>\r\nHer mother could only smile. \"How about all of them?\"<br>\r\n\"Oooh,\" the greedy girl smiled, then gave a frantic nod, \"yes please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda stood back up and flicked on the TV to Nikki's favourite channel before heading into the kitchen with Nikki's order. She didn't feel bad about this at all; Nikki was happy, so she was happy. The way she saw it, she was <i>her</i> daughter, so why not let her eat to her sweet little heart's content? Mother knows best, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doting mother looked at Nikki's sweet request; a bowl of ice cream, housing one scoop of vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry each. A colourful plastic spoon sat next to it. <br>\r\nIt was perfect...but it needed something. Something to cheer her right up after a particularly bad day.<br>\r\nLinda took a glance up to the clock, and decided she could give her just a little bit more to eat, just for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a few bottles of toppings from the cupboard, squirting strawberry sauce on the vanilla scoop, mint on the strawberry, and of course, chocolate on the chocolate scoop. Her dear girl loved chocolate a lot, so she'd definitely love this.<br>\r\nShe put the bottles back, and reached into another cupboard to grab one of Nikki's favourite chocolate bars from a multi-pack. <br>\r\nNext was a large glass, filled up to the brim with chocolate milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting it all on a tray, Linda carried the unhealthy meal into the living room. Nikki's face broke into a wide grin as she sat up, and Linda set the tray on her lap.<br>\r\n\"There you are, my little princess,\" she cooed, pecking her on the plushy cheek, \"that should hold you until dinner.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks mommy!\" Nikki squealed, licking her lips greedily before digging in to her treats.<br>\r\n\"You're very welcome,\" Linda stood back up, giving her daughter's soft brown hair a stroke, \"just ask if you need more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she withdrew upstairs and left the portly girl to her gorging.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nikki happy started eating her ice cream like if she had't eaten in days. The ice cream tasted terrific. Especially with all the toppings. She was eating so fast she almost swallowed her spoon. Soon the entire ice cream disappeared in Nikki's huge pouch and she belched loudly and leaned back and reached for the chocolate bar which she stuffed in her mouth in just a few bites. A few gulps and belch later and the chocolate bar was gone. The only thing remained was the glass of chocolate milk. She put the glass to her lips and started drinking, and drinking, and drinking, until the glass was empty. She put the glass down and let out such a loud belch she was sure her mother could hear it upstairs. <br>\r\nEven after all that food Nikki was still hungry. No wonder since she was always hungry except that one time on her birthday. It seemed a bit long ago. That one time. That was the only time she felt full. A bit of a strange feeling. Like if you can't think about food at that moment. A bit strange for her since food was always on her mind. She was't even sure if she did want to feel it again. It felt good in on way, but it was such a strange feeling for her. Normal other people felt like that every time after they ate.<br>\r\nNikki let out another small belch wondering if she should ask her mother for more. She knew that no matter how much she ate she would still be hungry for dinner but she just wolfed down a ice cream, chocolate bar and a glass of chocolate milk. She ate it pretty fast. If her mother heard she already finished her treat so fast she might be a bit upset. She closed her eyes while thinking and a few minutes later you could hear a soft snoring together with the sound of the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki. It's time to wake up.\" Linda said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's eyes slowly opened and she saw her mother. She yawned again and stretched herself. She looked again at her mother and went sitting up straight with that she again felt a pain in her head. Linda saw the painful look at Nikki's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does you head still hurt?\" She asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does.\" She mumbled looking at her mother like if she was a little, sad girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you stay home tomorrow. Maybe also the day after tomorrow. A least until you feel better.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did't say anything. Staying at home two days did't sound so bad. At least Raiza would't tease her for some time. Sure she would miss Denvert, Robbie, Tanja and Rue but it were only two days. They would be okay. But still... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. Can you tell my friends I'm fine but I stay home two days. I don't want them to be worried.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure Nikki. No problem.\" Linda said friendly. \"But now it's time for dinner. You're hungry right.\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Always mommy. You know that always. I can't help it. I'm just always hungry. I can't stop it. I would like it if I could stop it. But eating always take away some of my hunger. It also made me fatter. That was one of the fun things about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed softly. She would never understand what Nikki liked so much about being fat. She was a a slender and fit child when she was young. The complete opposite of Nikki who was the fattest, and most unfit child in class. Why did Nikki liked it so much? She also used to have problems with her parents about music, clothes, boyfriends but that was something all parents had with their kids. Sure there were enough fat kids but normally they wanted to lose their fat. Some of them did't do any effort to get rid of it. They were just sitting on their fat butt while wolfing down a hamburger with fries ans a milkshake thinking how to lose weight. They were lying against themselves but at least they wanted to lose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda put a lot of spaghetti on Nikki's plate wit a lot of tomato sauce with minced meat and some rasped cheese on top of it. Nikki smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh by the way Nikki before I forget. The day after tomorrow we have a photo shoot. I think it's better if you stay at home that day from school but we can do that photo shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Nikki cheered before she started to wolf down her spaghetti.     </span></div></div>",

Time really does fly.<br>\r\nBeing gym class, she was sceptical to what this new activity was going to be, so she stayed seated till she heard the instructions.<br>\r\nMiss Tatcher, who had taken a mental note of Nikki's hatred for exercise, had a plan B. \"Pretty basic, we're going to see how many times you can touch your toes within a minute.\"<br>\r\nThe kids nodded, sounding up for it. Nikki was being swayed, since it sounded like no running was involved.<br>\r\nAs Miss Tatcher demonstrated how to properly stretch down and up, Nikki decided to join in, so she slowly raised her heavy self from the bench and waddled over to join her friends.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Nikki!\" Miss Tatcher smiled at her, her plan had worked, \"Decided to join in?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh,\" Nikki nodded, a shy little smile on her round face.<br>\r\nRaiza, the girl who had teased her earlier, scoffed quietly and whispered amongst her friends. \"This oughta be good.\"<br>\r\n\"Since it'll be easier to keep track, and since I know some of you will say you did more than you actually did...\" Miss Tatcher explained while, during her last statement, playfully eyed a girl who just giggled along with some of the others, \"we'll take it in turns, and I'll time you.\"<br>\r\nThe kids all nodded, and she organised them to line up against the wall, calling each kid to walk out next to her and begin as she timed them.<br>\r\nNikki was nervous. She looked down at her huge round belly. She couldn't even <i>see</i> her toes, let alone touch them!<br>\r\nShe watched as Raiza took her turn, and eventually Miss Tatcher stopped her stopwatch.<br>\r\n\"Thirty-four,\" she nodded, smiling, \"very good!\"<br>\r\nRaiza smirked proudly and skipped back in line, muttering and giggling with her friends.<br>\r\n\"Alright...Nikki!\"<br>\r\nNikki gulped, slowly waddling out to take Raiza's place beside Miss Tatcher. Her nerves only got worse as she felt the eyes of everyone in the class on her, judging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, go!\"</span></div></div>",

I don't want you too tease your classmates and I don't care what size, skin color, freckles or whatever they have!  I told you before not to tease but you just keep doing it. If you tease her or any other kid one more time then I really will punish you. Understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I understood Miss Tatcher. I'm sorry.\" She said but it did't sounded like she felt sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. So hat's Nikki zero.\" Miss Tatcher said. \"Tanja your next.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki walked to he other and watched the rest. After some time Nikki found out that she was't he only with zero. Some other kids also had trouble or were't able to touch heir toes. That did made her feel a bit better. She would have felt bad if she would have been the only one in her whole class with zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does't matter you have zero.\" Rue said. \"I also have zero. I'm not in good shape.

I rather just sit on the couch in front of the T.V with a big bag of chips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki heard other kids sometimes that they hated some classes at school like math or french but she hated without a doubt gym time the most. <br>\r\nShe looked at some of the other kids and saw Raiza who gave her a mean look. For some reason Raiza did't seem to like her. She did't liked Raiza but that was more because Raiza teased her. She though Raiza would tease her more often.<br>\r\nShe was glad she had Denvert, Tanja, Robbie and Rue as friends. In movies or cartoons bullies mostly pick someone who was alone and had no friends. With her friends around her Raiza probably would't tease her too much. With your friends around you you were strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's six times. Not bad Tony.\" Miss Tatcher said to a boy, after that she looked at her watch. \"All right gym time is almost over so get changed and get back to your class room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kids walked back to the dressing room.       </span></div></div>",

Of course, being kindergartners this wasn't too unusual. However, both tubby little girls knew it was going to be bad as Raiza was involved. Even now she was pointing at the two and whispering something to her friends before a bunch of giggling could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Raiza and a few other kids came over to Rue and Nikki with a look that let them know they were going to cause trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, do you two have any brother or sisters?\" The mean thin child asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing what to do, Nikki simply shook her head at the skinny child. A few smirks and giggles came out of Raiza's back up gang before the mean child continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Figures.

She tried to treat every kid equal. She did't want that other kids would tease this girl just because she was obese. But she did't encourage kids to become fat. But she was here to teach the children. Not to tell parents they fed their kids the wrong and too much food. That was't her job. Only the school nurse could do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Tatcher!

She did't really blamed her. Kids can buy their own food so if a child was overweight or obese it was the fault of their parents. <br>\r\nOf course this was different for Nikki who was normally always hungry, and was fed by Tina and others. Linda always tried to let her lose weight but Nikki must admit that she was happy her mother packed in a big lunch. Well she knew it was a big lunch but also knew that it would't be enough for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a big lunch Nikki.\" Rue said surprised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have also a pretty big lunch yourself.\" Tanja said who only had two sandwiches and a apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but Nikki's lunch is bigger.\" Denvert said. \"And after that she can still eat more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rue asked. \"Can so much food fit in her belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She as a almost unstoppable hunger.\" Tanja said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost?\" Rue asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was at my birthday.\" Nikki said with full mouth. \"I never felt full. Not once in my entire life. So that was my birthday present. I would be able to feel full for once. Did't felt so good after all. But at the other hand feeling hungry also does't feel so good. But except for that one time I always felt hungry no matter how much I ate. But eating made some of the hunger go away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it sure showed at your body. But I like that.\" Rue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Tatcher went sitting at her desk and start eating her own lunch while the kids around her were eating, talking, singing and playing. She felt a bit bad for Nikki. She thought Nikki would have a hard time. Raiza would't tease her again. At least not for some time. But Nikki was a easy target for bullies. She did't want Nikki to be the scapegoat of the class but she also did't want to treat Nikki different from the other kids. It was a bit of a dilemma for he young teacher. They did't teach you this at the teacher training college. What did she needed to do?<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Heck, thanks to how many sandwiches she had eaten it looked like the tubby little girl was building a sandwich bag fort on the table, not that she really cared all that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this caught two sets of eyes in the room. First, poor Rue could see this clearly. In fact, she was amazed at how fast Nikki was eating. Of course she didn't realize that she was going at a very good pace herself. After all, she had exercised too and, even if it wasn't at Nikki's level yet, she was a chubby little girl and chubby little girls loved to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course both gluttonous girls also caught the eye of Ms. Thatcher.

She didn't want this cute little fat girl to get any fatter (who looked even fatter thanks to how much she had eaten), but she could tell from before just how sensitive she would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to a decision right then and there.

A little thin brother, and a fat older sister. She 19 and she's a BBW. Her boyfriends loves BBW's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BBW. Is that some kind of car?\" Robbie asked joining their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! BBW stands for Big Beautiful Woman. At least that's what she told me.\" Rue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your big sister is already 19?\" Tanja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be totally honest she's my half sister. We have different mothers. When she was about five years old her mother died in a terrible car accident. But our father remarried with my mother. She also loves my mother even while it is't her real mother. Anyway that's why she's so much older then me. But I love her as a sister.\" Rue answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"So your sister is also fat.\" Denvert asked interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's because after her mother died she was so sad she started to eat way too much and got fat.When she finally realized how fat she got she first started to look on the web how to lose weight but soon found out that there was a large group of people that loved fat woman and liked their girlfriend big round and soft. She found out she liked the extra weight too. So she became a BBW. Or that's what my father told me. She now lives with her boyfriend. She visits every now and then.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right kids pay attention!\" Miss Thatcher said. \"Time for next class. Grab your pencils or whatever you use to draw with. We're gonna make a snake. Each of you grab a piece of paper and draws a piece of the snake. after that we put them all together. All right start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll kids grabbed some paper. Rue fast started drawing. Nikki was more thinking what she was gonna do. At home she had drawn a snake sometimes but aways colored them totally green and that seemed a bit boring to her. She looked over at what Rue was drawing and was jealous at how good Rue was drawing. She was making a nice pattern. Rue was very good at drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very good.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" said Rue. \"My parents and sister also say that. They suggest I might need to become a artist.... I don't know... maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRue did gave Nikki a idea. She started to draw a pattern. Different from the one Rue was making since she did't want to copy her friend but she must admit she soon started to become happy with the result.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Of course both tubby girls, and even Denvert, was pretty hungry though since they hadn't had a snack after lunch. However, both girls were just happy they weren't picked on again. Of course that was mostly given the fact everyone was kept so busy with the different lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the time had come for the end of the day. Since this was kindergarten the kids got out at about 1pm, instead of the normal 4pm and they're class was the only one outside at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half the students were loaded on to the small bus, apparently living far enough away to need some form of transportation to get home. About a quarter of the other students had left to walk home. Thankfully this group included Raiza and her cohorts so neither Nikki or Rue would have to be teased by them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was still one person who was looking to talk to them.

If I take her while someone else s picking her up people would think I'm kidnapping her. But if she needs to walk home and does't live to far away... sure I can take her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Rue!

But just when she wanted to just talk to her Rue saw the car of her mother and run away. Ms Thatcher decided to talk to them another time. After all she still had a entire school year to talk to them. She sighed and walked back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Tina was driving the kids home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Tina you said you family had three cars.

Because that would't be fair since he people who would get cake first would have a smaller piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know for sure.\" Tina said softly while she pushed the knife in the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't need to have such a big slice. I'm not a big eater.\" Tanja said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina still cut out pretty big pieces for Tanja, Robbie and Denvert and also a piece for herself but more then half of the cake was left for Nikki. as soon if they started eating Nikki started eating like if she had't eaten in days. With both hands she stuffed lumps of the wedding cake in her mouth. Tina watched enjoying seeing this and at the same time made sure Nikki would't choke. The others also liked their cake but Tanja and Robbie both knew that they woud' be able to finish their piece but seeing how Nikki ate that would't be a problem.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

He wasn't trying to be mean, but he was a tubby little boy and wanted a bit more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the little boy's second helping didn't come close to comparing to Nikki's massive cake binge. The tubby little girl got all two bottom layers of cake for herself. Since this was meant to feed 100-200 guests for a wedding, both layers were pretty large but not large enough for an ever hungry little fat 5 year old who devoured the whole thing in only 7 minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pleased burp, Nikki licked the icing off her hands, which at this point were completely covered in it. Her cute, chubby, face also looked as though she had an unevenly grown beard of frosting. However much of a mess it was, it only made her look cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this wasn't the biggest change on the girl. Her already obese belly had pushed out further with the onslaught of so much food. True the massive dome was so large it was sometimes hard to tell immediately if she had gained anything or not. However, Tina could clearly see the tubby young dome was already a good inch or so large than before. Needless to say Tajna, Denvert and Tina were thrilled at this sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm....yummy. Can I have some more?\" She asked sweetly to Tina as she patted her exposed young tummy and let out another burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The thoughts were going through her head about her sibling. What Tina and Tanja said made perfect sense. She never met another kid with a endless appetite so why would her sibling have it. Perhaps she would become a sportive and slender kid. Did her mother get what she wanted anyway. But even then her mother would probably not pushing Nikki so hard to exercise. That was a good thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nikki but perhaps he or she is pretty nice. He or she won't have the endless appetite like you, but he or she might not like exercise and rather plays with her big sister on the couch in front of the T.V. We don't know.

Nikki would love her new brother or sister no matter how big or slender they were. However, she was hoping she'd have a nice fat brother or sister who would want to stuff his/her face alongside her. Maybe even become a plus size model like she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, these thoughts quickly left her head at the mention of cupcakes. She instantly dove into the tasty treats with abandon and was about as messy with them as she had been with the cake. Heck, she nearly ate them all but did leave just enough time for Denvert to reach over and grab one for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nice big, happy, burp Nikki was done her dessert's dessert. She patted her big round belly happily before she cutely began to lick the icing off her sausage like fingers. It was only putting a dent into it the massive amount of frosting that she had spilled on herself, but being the fatty she was, this little girl wasn't going to waste any of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides this gave her a chance to look over and see Denvert finish off his cupcake. She was finally starting to really notice that she wasn't the only one in the room gaining weight. The plump little boy had put on a few more pounds since knowing this gorgeous, gorging girl. She didn't mind this at all. In fact, like Denvert himself, she thought his extra pudge made him look all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course Tina agreed with Nikki, however she wasn't sure how much of a \"gainer\" her young boyfriend was. However, that wasn't the most pressing matter for her at the moment. The snacks had run out and she had to find something fun to keep them all entertained.

She must admit that she liked the Disney movies just as much as the little kids. She liked the songs the funny characters, especially some minor characters that Disney added for some fun. She also liked cartoons for kids. Especially some cartoons she used to watch herself when she was small like my little pony or the snorks. She had a lot of DVD's for kids and she normally took them with her when she babysat kids which was another reason why kids liked her so much as their babysitter. <br>\r\nShe must admit that while she looked at the four kids she missed Nicole a bit. She might be younger then the other kids but she was part of their group. She liked Nikki very much because she was obese and gaining and Nicole because she was fat and also did her best to gain. It also showed on her body. Tina had eye for that detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki, Denvert, Robbie and Tanja were busy deciding which movie the were gonna watch.

She was enjoying how large it had gotten just in the last couple of days and playing with her blubber made her feel nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this gave a nice little show for Tina. The feeder teen was able to see each and every bulge of fat as the little girl stroked her gut. The creamy white dome jiggled and shook with delight as the cute little girl rubbed over her tummy. As much as Tina liked these sort of movies, it was hard for her to keep her attention on the screen while this was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other person in the room who was having some trouble paying attention was Denvert. The young boy had chosen to sit right next to his crush and got the best view of Nikki's belly play. He couldn't help but grin at how cute he thought his young girlfriend was and even held Nikki's other, free, hand as they watched the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't long until a loud grumble was heard coming from the same dome that had distracted so many. Nikki blushed a bit. Not so embarrassed by how hungry she was, despite how much had eaten earlier, but more from interrupting the movie for everyone. Still this didn't stop her from looking over at Tina and asking,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there anymore snacks? I'm really getting hungry again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina looked on a bit nervously.

She really thought that the teasing would convince her daughter to lose weight. But it seemed it did't work. She still wanted to gain. She could't believe it. Was't there anyway she could let her fat daughter lose weight. It was unbelievable how many times she tried and did't succeed. It seemed like her daughter could't become thin.<br>\r\nShe softly rubbed her pregnant belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please whatever you are don't be like your sister.\" She whispered so soft Nikki could't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe loved Nikki very much and when the new baby was born she would't love Nikki more or less then now and she would love the new baby just as much as Nikki but she always wanted her kids to be slender and active. She always hoped she could do do some exercise with Nikki when she was pregnant. But as the years went by and Nikki's weight climbed up, Linda need to face it  that  Nikki would never be a slender or active kid. She just hoped her next kid would be active and slender. After all what ever Nikki had what caused that she never got full was very rare. How big was the chance her second child had the same. At the other hand her baby could see Nikki as her roll model. But of course there was also a chance Nikki would steal her food. That way she surely would stay skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not worth it mommy. I like being fat and getting fatter. So do Denvert, Tanja Robbie and Rue. Also Nicole and sumo Sandy but they're not on my school. But they all like it and they do protect me. They also like me fat so why would I do something what I and they don't like. The mean way more to me that what one stupid girl said to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was proud how wise that last sentence sounded. Even if she was't so happy with the weight gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy could you do something so I don have to go to gym anymore?\" Nikki asked with her sweetest look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nikki you did't think seriously I would do that. This way you get at least some exercise. It's more exercise then you ever did in your life. It would be good for you. There's no reason why you should't go to gym, and perhaps you lose some weight this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's so haaaaaaaaard!\" Nikki whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To bad sweethart. If you were't so fat then it would probably be easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki angry went sitting at the table. She looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we eat?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"When your father get's home. He would take some junk food on the way home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Junk food. I like junk food.\" Nikki said and licked her lips.  </span></div></div>",

She would have loved just to sit there and watch everyone else run about...preferably while stuffing herself with something tasty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this time her belly let out a grumble. She looked down at the massive, round, tummy that covered her lap and gave it a loving rub. Despite what her mom wanted, she wasn't going to get rid of her beautiful blubber anytime soon. In fact she planned on adding a bit more to her frame once her dad got home with the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed something rare for her to see. Her mother's slight bulging baby belly let out a loud growl of its own. Linda blushed as she gave the dome a loving rub just like Nikki had to her own a little while ago. She was getting a bit hungrier than normal, now that she was eating for two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki grinned a little at this. She actually liked to see her mom with a nice \"fat\" tummy on her. Yes, she knew that was her baby sister in there but still she thought her mommy looked much better this way. Unlike Linda though, Nikki really hoped her soon to be sibling followed in her in footsteps. She really liked the idea of a nice fat little sister to gorge alongside her. She giggled a little to herself as thought about how similar it would be to Denvert having Nichole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then her father came home with the tasty food her mother promised he would bring.

She hadn't planned on sleeping as she really wanted to wait up until her pre-planned midnight snack. However, with so little food in her obese belly and all the exercise she was forced to do today, her young body couldn't hold off sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her hungry tummy woke her about 12:30 in the morning. She frowned down at the dome. She hated having it so empty. Fortunately, she knew her parents were going to be asleep by this point and the ungraded kitchen would be all hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Nikki slowly got out of her bed. Despite how careful she was, the tubby little girl's mattress did make a lot of noise, having been relieved of the heavy weight that was sitting on it. Even now, Nikki's pyjamas were too tight and a nice sliver of her big, round, belly poked out between her pants and shirt. She rubbed that area and licked her lips. It was snack time!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat child slowly, and as quietly as she could, went downstairs to the kitchen. Flipping on the lights she licked her lips again as she thought of the first place she should check. She quickly chose the fridge and opened the door to the appliance with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore her stood a treasure trove of food that made her fat kindergartner tummy rumble. She didn't know where to start and instantly grabbed the first dish that she saw: her mother's potato salad. She reached in and grabbed messy handfuls of the substance and greedily ate down everything she could get out of the dish, even going so far as to lick clean the container itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki let out a nice happy burp before she moved onto the next things she found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just because her belly is so big because there's a child inside it. My belly is even bigger but I'm not allowed to eat for two because there's no baby inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached inside and found some sausages and fast started to stuff her face.

Yes, the 5 year old glutton had emptied both the fridge and the pantry, just to fill her obese fat kid tummy. What a tummy it was too. Now, Nikki's PJs never fit her all that well but now her top was pushed up to be only a belly shirt. Her PJ bottoms were also forced down, although still covered everything that needed to be.

You should thank me that I tried to don't let you eat too much yesterday but instead of that you emptied the entire kitchen in your fat gut. How can you stand that fat gut?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the way you can stand that bony body of you.\" Nikki mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would kill for a pickle.\" Linda mumbled. \"But now I first need to go to the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe angry looked at Nikki who brushed some crumbs of her belly. Why was that kid so hard to control in her eating, and why did't she want to lose weight willingly like every normal girl would. Instead of that she liked it to eat every scrap of food in the house. How could this be her kid?<br>\r\nShe looked at Nikki still in her pajamas who were at the point of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get that fat ass of you upstairs and get dressed! I need to take you to school!\" Linda screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki fast run upstairs. She knew her mother would be angry but insulting her. Did she really thought that that would have the right effect? Perhaps since she knew how much Nikki hated it. But this only encouraged her to become fatter to show her mother how much she disliked it.<br>\r\nShe fast looked in her closet to look for nice clothes that fit. Well too be honest she looked for clothes that fit. Lucky for her she knew which clothes were too small or else it would take her a long time to find clothes that fit.<br>\r\nShe really started to hate her mother. Why did she tried so hard to let her lose weight. It was her life and her body right. But it seemed her mother thought different of that. She looked at herself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I look good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran downstairs and found her mother cleaning the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well get your bag we leave in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But I did't had breakfast yet, and I did't have anything for lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's what happens if you eat all the food in house. Besides I would say you ate more then enough, and you have enough fat to live on a few days without food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumpy Nikki waddled to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She loved little kids. That's one of the reasons she started teaching. She also liked the high voices of little kids. When she was younger she used to babysit in every little kid in the entire neighborhood. She did a pretty good job since she was asked many times to come again. Sometimes even two families asked her to come on the same day. <br>\r\nShe looked smiling around in the class. Her eyes paused a moment when she saw Nikki. She was surprised again how a kid of her age could be so fat. She felt kind of bad for her. With her size it was no wonder some others teased her. She did't approved teasing no matter what. But still it would be good for that girl to lose some weight. She really need to talk to her or perhaps her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice to see you all again. I hope you're all in the mood for learning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki did her best to think about anything else but food but it was hard for a girl which mind was normally only about food and gaining and getting fatter. That were  things she liked<br>\r\nShe must admit that she lately discovered some problems about being fat. She still liked being fat and still wanted to get fatter but she was very fast out of breath. even walking short distances like from the playground to her class room made her tired. Also her feet were getting sore more and more, and she got trouble with moving. She must admit it was a bit difficult. But not so much that she wanted to stop being fat, or stop getting fatter by eating hamburgers, fries and... There she was thinking about food again. Her tummy rumbled loudly. She could't wait until lunch time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert looked sadly at his girlfriend. He saw she had trouble. He would gladly stuff her with food until she was totally stuffed while he very well knew that he could't afford that. But he still wanted to do it. He hated seeing his girlfriend being so hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Tatcher started each day by telling a part of a story. In that story was a word the learned to write that day. There was also a song with it. Nikki must admit it did take her mind a bit of food. Not enough to don't feel the hunger pains going through her body but enough to don't let her loose her mind.<br>\r\nAfter that the kids got some free time.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She at least left some food from every ones lunch. She did't want that they did't have any food because of her. Especially Denvert and Rue since she knew they both had a big appetite. Well she sure hoped her mother would give her breakfast the rest of the school year.<br>\r\nPerhaps her mother would't deny her breakfast if she did't had any late night snacks. But then she at least had to be able to eat more at dinner. It was some sort of vicious circle. But she was her friends very thankful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty mean of your mother send you too school without breakfast. My mother or sister would never let me go to school without breakfast.\" Rue said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother or sister?\" Tanja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah my parents need to work sometimes in the morning so then she takes me to school and watches over my little brother. He almost turns 1!\" Rue said<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"So you also have a little brother?\" Robbie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah did't you remember. I told that to Raiza and her friends in the...... Oh yeah you were't there. That was in the girls locker room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoken about her I believe she's planning to do something mean.\" Tanja said and looked in the direction of Raiza and her friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think you're right and I believe I and Nikki are the target.\" Rue mumbled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Softly breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did she fell asleep?\" Nicole asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure looks that way.\" Tina said. \"It's a lot of work. She used the muscles in her jaws so much she's exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked surprised. She did't knew that while chewing you needed to use muscles. Even if it were only the muscles in your jaws. She never got tired from moving the muscles in her jaws. But at the other hand she never would have been able to eat so much. Nikki used them very much eating so much food. She knew she would't be able to eat so much but who knew, maybe once in a day in the future. Perhaps. She was a gaining girl after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she did't leave anything for us,\" Sandy mumbled. \"I'm also hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Do you really think I would let you go hungry,\" Tina said and opened her backpack and took out a few pies. \"I knew that this would probably happen so I took few pies extra for the guests. That includes you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda looked a Tina with mixed feelings. One part of her was happy she brought some extra food for the guests, and she clearly loved and cared about Nikki and she knew Nikki liked her too. <br>\r\nBut at the other hand with Tina around Nikki seemed to gain more weight. She also did't forget what happened the first time she met Tina. How she and the kids had stuffed Nikki. She seemed to like kids but especially fat girls. <br>\r\nShe wondered why. Or perhaps she just saw things there were't there. After all Tina was a babysitter. Why would she be a babysitter if she did't liked kids. Also why would a teenager girl be interested in fat little girls. She could't think of any reason why so she was't sure if Tina really was interested in fat little girls but it seemed that way.<br>\r\nSo all with all Tina would't be helpful with Nikki losing weight, but at the other hand she took good care of Nikki and the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina in the meantime cut the pies in pieces (two extra big pieces for Sandy and Nicole) and everyone was talking with each other. Mostly about what Nikki had done who was still sitting passed out in her chair.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised she was able to eat so much. Even I can't eat all that well everyone says I'm fat. I'm a fatty, fatso, fat-ass, super-sized-Sandy, fatty fat two by four can't fit through the cafeteria door. That's how some kids call me,\" Sandy said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kids can be cruel some time,\" Tina said. \"I know that. Believe me I know. I was many times seen like a freak. because I... eh... that does't matter really. What I'm trying to say is that I know how it feels to be teased. It's no fun. That's why I hate teasing and bullies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, what's happening with Nikki now?\" Asked Tanja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\" Asked Robbie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what will happen to her now?\" Tanja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing I guess,\" Tina said. \"She wanted to feel full for once, that happened. She fell asleep so she will wake up later I guess. I don't see why something should happen.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nTanja nodded while eating her piece of pie.</span></div></div>",

The last thing she remembered was the feeling of being full, though now she was hungry due to her long sleep digesting everything in her belly. She stifled a yawn, then realized that she was still in the dining room, having been not moved from the chair since she got done with her feast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could even attempt at getting up, her mother walked in. \"Good morning Nikki, sleep well?\" Linda asked, knowing that she and her husband would of had a hard time trying to move Nikki to her room, so leaving her there was the best plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki let out a large yawn, \"y-yea...\" she then replied, still trying to wake up. Nikki then attempted to get out of the chair, Linda having to help her out after a while due to being tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now today we're going to go to where Sandy works to see if you can be a plus-sized kid model, but before that they have to make sure you're healthy.\" Linda said, though for once Nikki didn't look so down about that, in fact, she perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! I can become a fat model!\" Nikki said, slightly hopping at the news. \"<i>After</i> the doctor gives the ok.\" Linda replied, trying to calm her little butterball down. \"And that leads me to something I need to say...\" Linda soon said after Nikki calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been mulling it over last night, and I've decided... I'll try not to complain about your eating habits, <i>but</i> I want you to try and control your eating a bit. I'm not going to force you on any sort of diet or exercise, but all I ask is for you to practice some self control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was stunned. Her mother was willing to let her be, so long as she didn't base every decision on her stomach? It was like a dream come true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>However</i>\" Linda continued, \"If the doctor says you're unhealthy, I will be putting you on a diet until school starts. You understand?\" Nikki silently nodded. Linda sighed \"Good, now lets get you ready to go, don't think they want you coming in mostly nude\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was perplexed, she hadn't even noticed her clothes had ripped off!</span></div></div>",

After that they got in the car. <br>\r\nNikki normally hated going to the doctor but now she was looking forward. However a part of her was scared. This check up would decided if she could become a fat model or... needed to go on a diet.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"All right Nikki we're here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki got out of the car and looked at the big building in front of her and looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the doctor's office?

The doctor will give you a full check up. If you're healthy you gonna come over here once in a while to pose with some clothes on. Then some people take pictures from you and use those in their magazine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda walked inside. Nikki slowly waddled after her mother. However she must admit that even waddling short distances made her run out of breath. Linda walked to the woman behind a desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you?\" She asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Linda and Nikki Glemcer. We had a appointment with the doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets see. Ah here it is. Mrs. Glemcer and her daughter. The doctor can see you now. Take the elevator to the third floor go right and then it's the first blue door at your left. Can't miss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki was happy that there was a elevator. Walking stairs to the third floor would be torture for her.<br>\r\n A few minutes later they were by the blue door and Linda knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come inside!\" A woman said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda and Nikki entered. A chubby woman was sitting behind a desk. She smiled friendly at Nikki. Nikki smiled friendly back. She liked that this doctor was a woman. She felt easier around woman then around man except for her family members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Nikki. What a nice name you have. Now I'm gonna give you a check up. You don't have to be afraid. I not gonna do you any harm and I don't gonna use needles. I know some kids hate that. But I don't need needles for a check up. Now can you take your clothes of except your underwear?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda helped taking of Nikki's clothes. The doctor put her on a scale and wrote down the weight. Her measured her and did some tests. Asked Nikki some questions. Ask to walk a bit and did a few more tests. He looked at his computer for a while and then at Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Mrs Glemcer it seems like your daughter is...\"          </span></div></div>",

A large chocolate pudding with sprinkles and chocolate milk, with a large bowl of Frosted Flakes wth extra sugar, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. She was a very happy girl, and Linda was a very happy mother. After getting her dressed, Linda had a surprise for her. Before she went to bed last night, she sewd herself a red cape and mask. The Momwoman game they played yesturday was one of the first memories she had gotten as a new, revitalised mother, and she was intending to relive the happiness of that moment again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were down at Nikki's room, ready to start Momwoman's next adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Nikki, how does today's adventure start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I sort of have an idea. Momwoman is flying over the ocean when she saw he big bad guy, Dr. Volcano! He was a living Volcano with arms and legs who wanted to take over the world! Momwoman wouldn't let him do that, so she grabbed him and took him to the Super Jail that magically made bad guys forget who they are. But he'd have to stay there because he was a talking Volcano, so he would probably get reminded. She decided to go home and visit her best friend, Nikki, but she found that Dr. Volcano had...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Turned her entire house into an Evil Gingerbread Kingdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda smiled as their imaginations began to meld. They were now entirely inside this imaginary world of theirs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomwoman had no choice but to eat through the Kingdom and it's evil Gingebread Soldiers until she found Nikki. But she soon found that the castle was too big, and there were simply too many gingerbread men to eat! Her belly was already the size of a house! She thought that Volcano had finally beaten her...until she saw Nikki! Nikki didn't have any super powers, so when she ate the magic gingerbread, she got some. She became Super Nikki, the Hungriest Girl in the World, and she quickly ate the attacking gingerbread men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody messes with Momwoman or her new sidekick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomwoman got up and shook Super Nikki's hand, \"Thanks Super Nikki, without you I'd be toast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Momwoman! But it's not over yet! Dr. Volcano actually made the entire world into gingerbread that looks like normal! I have to eat the rest of it to turn it back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomwoman grabbed Super Nikki under the arms and flew into the air, and straight into the wall of the castle as Super Nikki began to eat, her big belly growing all the while. Soon the entire Kingdom was inside her titanic tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it Super Nikki! But we still have a little while to go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMomwoman brought Super Nikki closer to the ground and she began eating the road. People all across the city became frightened as they saw Momwoman carrying Super Nikki as the little blob devoured everything in her path, turning back into Gingerbread Men once they saw her. Soon all of America was in Nikki's belly, and she began drinking the milky ocean. Once it was dry, she was flown down into the middle of the world where she began eating it from the inside out, speeding it all up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hungry slurp, Super Nikki gobbled up the last of the moon. Momwoman rubbed the belly to help relieve the pressure of it's planetary meal. She put her ear to her belly button and heard magic sounds fixing up the world and making everything normal again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice work Super Nikki. You saved the world and proved to be the best sidekick ever! And with the world inside your tummy, it'll be much easier to protect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so the day was saved thanks to Momwoman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda and Nikki were lying down in the kitchen laughing their heads off as the adventure finished. Gingerbread crumbs were all over the floor, as well as an empty bottle of milk, the contents of which was churning away inside of Nikki's slightly bloated tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun! Though in future, before the party can MY Nikki only pretend to gobble stuff when Super Nikki does? We need to save it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Super Nikki can learn to fly with Momwoman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why just fly when she can get Momwoman's super muscles? Say, do they keep the world inside of Super Nikki forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, the president asks her to let them out after a few days because every time she had a drink she'd flood President City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, and Super Nikki is one thirsty girl! She drank a whole ocean! You want to try and drink another ocean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda poured Nikki glass and glass of water for quite some time, but stopped after her sixth bathroom trip. They got at least a bathtub worth in, though! Yep, Linda was a changed woman. From now on, if she could, Nikki would be full to the brim with food as much as possible, and would grow into a World Record. Sure, she'd probably get complaints, get told how bad of a mother she was and how she was hurting her child. She'd just shrug them off, her new perspective was that a good mother kept her child happy! That's how her mum raised her, so that's how'd she'd act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, after the party, she knew Nikki would be seeing a LOT of buffets...</span></div></div>",

One part of her wanted too give it back too her but her other part knew it would be very handy. Tina was fine with it. She was very rich and could easily get the $150 back from her father if she asked. Her sister asked more money then her every week to buy new clothes. Besides the $150 would be used to buy food what would give her a lot of entertainment and seeing that fat adorable girl eating herself even fatter was her worth  $150 and even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well that would be very nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can go.

My treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're my friend, of course I'd do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki rubbed her fat, rumbling tummy as Tina dialed the pizza place up. The teen smiled. She had a coupon for a free pizza party! Nikki had no idea what was going on when a car pulled up carting pizza boxes by the fours out. There must have been sixteen pizzas! There was no doubting that Nikki liked this new opinion of her mothers. And just the idea that this was going to be small in comparison to her party drove her a little nuts with happiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU ARE THE BEST PEOPLE EVAH!\" she was of course referring to Tina, her friends and parents, but instead the Pizza men were just very confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda was driving home with one of her biggest food shopping sprees she had ever seen, letalone actually do! She smiled like she just discovered the meaning of Christmas at the thought of her daughter digging into it. Ironic that just the other day she would have sighed depressingly at the same thought. She eventually came to a red light and decided now was a good time to call Denvert's parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Denvert answered the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Denvert. Are your parents home? I want to speak with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenvert was a little scared. He thought that she was going to ask that Nikki stopped seeing him for all the times he and Nicole fed her. Of course being so young he failed to notice how happy her tone was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay...I'll go get my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Linda? Den seemed worried, what's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The matter? I'll tell you what is the matter! For quite some time now I have seen my little girl feast on food like it was her only possible function. I let people look after her who tried to feed her more, and I watched her get new friends who were interested in cramming her mouth full of junk as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're upset at me for letting Den and Nicole do that? That's understandable, I guess I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Upset? No I'm not upset with you, I'm upset with me! Nikki likes her weight, and she likes to eat and eat and eat, but now I realise that she actually does see a down side. She's never full! Can you imagine that? Torture! Absolute torture! Well I won't have it any more! This mother is making it up to her little girl and in a few days it'll be her birthday. I need enough food to feed an army, and I need your help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! I've got things sort of planned out. You, me and some others will have our kids stay over at my house with Tina babysitting overnight tonight. We'll empty our bank accounts and go on a shopping spree to get enough food for the party!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EMPTY OUR BANK ACCOUNTS? ARE YOU MAD!? Linda, I see you've had a change of heart but...empty our bank accounts to buy your daughter a big meal? We'd be financially ruined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Afterwards we'll all pool togethor to keep us all afloat. Me and Bram have it all worked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, what you're suggesting is...outlandish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't what I'm suggesting, this is what I need! This is what Nikki needs! I'm not going to guilt you into helping me, but my baby needs to feel full, and I would do anything to let that happen. Hell, if it was an option, I'd feed her my car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're...really serious about this. If it means that much to you, yes. We will help. I'll bring the kids over tonight and explain it to my husband. I just hope that Nikki appriciates what we're doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was in tears yesturday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis brought a smile to the womans face, \"Make the calls, let's do this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda eventually made it home. She'd have to make a few trips in and out, but she'd get all those groceries in eventually. Once inside she saw Nikki. Stuffed with pizza, and Tina feeding her garlic bread. They knew that her opinion had changed, but weren't quite sure how'd she react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi! Welcome back. I know you guys were tight on money, and that Nikki was allowed to eat more now, so I ordered a few pizzas. Hehe...\" Tina was very nervous as she looked upon Linda.</span></div></div>",

She looked at the stretched swimsuit and was afraid it would't stretch much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"wait a second.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and pulled her arms out of the bathing suit and pulled it down until her belly was bare. Tina stopped Nicole from entirely pulling out her bathing suit and hold it so just her chest and belly were bare afraid that if Nicole was naked and she rubbed her some people might get some strange ideas and she would never able too babysit them again. But there was no harm in rubbing someones belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls felt so good while their bellies where rubbed.

But at least there's now more water in the radiator.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What happened then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried not to hit a cat... and drove the car in the creek.\" Linda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others could't help but started to laugh.

It just sounded very funny and Linda also started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you were so late she had dinner with us. I hope you don't mind.\" The mother of Denvert and Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina and Denvert hold their breath.

Two Pizza's and two slices was't more then she would get at home. At home she would probably have eaten more. Besides that Nikki had been the whole morning busy swimming. At least she thought. So it was all right. Besides Nikki did't looked too much different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Nikki put on your clothes then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki fast ran outside.

Nikki's mind raced all the way home, what would mom do, what could she do? She looked down, not that she had to look far, at the massive blanket that barely covered her stressed and stretched belly.  Her hands unconsciously found what she could of it and slowly started rubbing it, her exposed skin was tight but still remarkably soft to her touch, despite all that she just finished eating.  Deep down inside she was still hungry and felt that she could eat a cake or two and another full large pizza or three.  A soft sigh escaped Nikki's mouth aw she thought about being fed again, allowing her belly to get even more majestic and large then it was, she started kicking slowly realizing that it had reached her knees at least if not a little further.  This excited Nikki to no end she was the biggest, hungryest little girl she knew and she didn't want this to stop.  Her silky smooth skin moved and rippled as she rubbed and gently slapped her monstrous belly, imaging all the tasty foods she would eat and how much her soft belly would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car pulled up to the house and stopped at the top of the drive way Nikki realized.  She only stopped and looked up because she felt her mother's cold piercing eyes staring at her through the rear view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Linda's question felt like the coldest of ice daggers in her daughter's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um,\" It was all Nikki could think to say as her hands immediately stopped exploring her soft ball like middle she looked down ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly young lady,\" Lind didn't yell which got to Nikki far more then any loud tone could. \"Now when you get into the house you are to go straight to bed,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom I'm still hungry,\" Nikki said sheepishly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bed, because from the looks of it you have already eaten a weeks worth of dinners,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Nikki was cut off by Linda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO BUTTS MISSY,\" when Linda got loud Nikki knew not to argue \"ROOM, BED, NOW!\" Linda's furry finally bubbled to the surface as she release her yelling upon her stuffed child.  Nikki slumped as best she could in her chair, it was pretty hard with that beach ball of a belly sticking off her front. \"MARCH, LITTLE MISSY!\"  Nikki clicked her seat belt and slowly waddled into the house, as sad as she was she couldn't change the fact that feeling and watching her belly swish from side to side s she made her sad waddle to her room.  Linda follows slowly behind her, feeling slightly defeated as she passed the door way.  Her husband came out of the kitchen wearing a slightly messy apron and wearing oven mits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baby, what happened I could hear you yelling from in here,\" He kissed her forehead and held her in his strong arms for mere seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nikki had an incident,\" was all Linda could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I see,\" he tried to reassure her that is was ok, while hiding his excitement in the fact that his daughter has a hunger and the belly to prove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't know what to do,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know honey, but lets talk about it in the kitchen I'm still cooking dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...who should we follow in our continued adventures</span></div></div>",

She wasn't even that hungry after the cookies she'd eaten an hour ago, but she loved pizza too much to care about how full she felt. She stared out into the rain, waiting for Vivian to appear in the pizza place's door, practically tasting the seconds shuffle by. After what felt like at least an hour her mom hurried out, three boxes of pizza under one arm and a bottle of pop clutched in her other hand. She pulled open the car door and climbed inside, shaking the rain from her dark hair and depositing the pizzas on the passenger seat. She turned to smile at Natasja in the back, who was straining desperately towards the pizza boxes.<br>\r\n\"There we go. One pizza with everything on it, and two pepperonis.\"<br>\r\n\"Are they all for me?\" The six year old asked, eyes wide. Vivian laughed.<br>\r\n\"No, silly. The pepperonis are for me and your sister.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Right.\" She paused sadly, then realized that still left an entire pizza for her. \"Can I have some now?\" She asked enthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"Not just yet, Nat. Wait until we get home.\"<br>\r\nFor Natasja, the journey home felt even longer than the wait in the car. The pizzas were emitting a delicious, enticing smell, and her slightly rounded stomach had begun to grumble in anticipation. By the time they finally parked behind their flat and Vivian let Natasja out of her car seat, she was practically bouncing along behind her mother as they climbed the stairs up to their room. Vivian smiled at her daughter.<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Nat. I don\u2019t normally see you so energetic! Perhaps I should buy pizza more often?\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cYes! Yes!\u201d Natasja skipped up the flight of stairs and waited impatiently at the top for her mom to catch up. Eventually, they reached their floor and Vivian unlocked the door, letting the six year old zoom across the room to the table, where she sat half exhausted from the climb, half eager for the meal.<br>\r\n\u201cOne minute, wait for your sister.\u201d Said Vivian, and not a moment later the bedroom door opened.<br>\r\n\u201cHi Rebecca.\u201d Said Natasja. \u201cWe\u2019re having pizza!\u201d She pointed at the boxes in their mothers\u2019 arms.<br>\r\n\u201cGreat!\u201d She said, joining her sister at the table. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d<br>\r\nRebecca was almost as fond of pizza as her younger sister was, and it showed on her nine year old body; a thick midsection and rounded belly were obvious beneath her tight shirt, and tight jeans revealed her large butt and chunky thighs. Her dislike of exercise had left her limbs soft and flabby; the furthest she liked to walk was to the fridge and then back to her bed.<br>\r\nVivian deposited the pizzas in the middle of the table, then went to the cupboard to grab some glasses. Without even waiting for her to return, her two daughters ripped open the boxes and began eating, stuffing delicious tomato-sauce covered slices into their hungry mouths.<br>\r\nVivian turned back towards the table, glasses in hand, but before she could sit down\u2026</span></div></div>",

She just wanted to sit down and get a bite to eat after a long day, was that too much to ask?<br>\r\n\"Sachar residence, who's calling?\" She snapped.<br>\r\nNatasja watched from across the room as suddenly as what little color was normally present in her mom's face disappeared in less than a second. With a quick glance at her daughters, the young woman began speaking quietly and quickly into the receiver, face drawn. Natasja tried to listen in, but her mom had switched to rapid fire Swedish. Shrugging, she returned to the pizza. All the more for her! She swallowed the last mouthful of her second slice and immediately moved on to a third, as Rebecca finished off one of the pepperonis. She had loved pizza for as long as she could remember, and usually managed to persuade her mom to buy it three or four times a week, sometimes more if she'd been good. With most foods, she'd stop eating if she got too full, but with pizza she just couldn't stop.<br>\r\nBy the time Vivian slumped into the final seat around the table, all but one slice of pepperoni were gone. In total, Natasja had eaten one whole pizza, and Rebecca had finished off nearly two. As a result both girls were lying back in their chairs, painfully swollen bellies peaking from beneath their tops. Vivian gritted her teeth; true, they were young, but they should know better! She closed her eyes and breathed, in and out, in and out. She had bigger problems.<br>\r\n\"Girls?\" She asked, but got no response. \"Girls!\"<br>\r\nBoth children woke with a start.<br>\r\n\"Uh. What?\" Asked Rebecca. Natasja's hand snaked out towards the final slice of pizza but Vivian slammed her hand down hard on top of her daughter's.<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Natasja drew back, tears beginning to well in her eyes. Vivian grimaced.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Natasja, but I need you to pay attention.\" She opened her mouth, then thought better of it, got up from the table and went to pour herself a whisky.<br>\r\n\"Mom, what's up?\" Asked Rebecca again. \"You're acting weird...\"<br>\r\nVivian threw back the whiskey, then returned to the table with a grimace.<br>\r\n\"Girls,\" She began, \"I'm going to have to go away for a while. Do either of you remember your cousin Gina?\"<br>\r\nBoth children shook their heads, mystified.<br>\r\n\"Well, she's my sister's daughter. She's about thirty, and she's got two daughters. You're... you're going to go and live with her for a while.\"<br>\r\nThere was a period of complete silence around the table for a long time, as both children processed the information. It seemed like even the cars outside had stopped to think. Vivian toyed nervously with her ring, twisting it on and off of her finger.<br>\r\nEventually Natasja spoke.</span></div></div>",

She was imagining all the food she could sneak away with and eat without her mom's ever-watching eye. One of her favorite things was eating food on her own, whilst watching TV or just lying around, but despite Vivian's generally lax dietary expectations she had a hard line on Natasja sneaking off with food.<br>\r\n\"But... but why?\" Asked Rebecca, looking far less enthusiastic than her younger sister. \"Where are you going? Why can't we come?\"<br>\r\nVivian sighed, rubbing her temples.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Rebecca, but I can't answer that. Gina's lovely, I promise, and her daughters... well, I'm sure you'll get along just fine.\" Rebecca tried to interrupt, but she spoke louder. \"Look, I don't know how long this is for, but Gina'll sort it all out. Please, don't make this difficult for me.\"<br>\r\n\"But mom! What about my friends at school?\" Rebecca complained loudly.<br>\r\nVivian slammed her hand down onto the tabletop for the second time, making both girls jump.<br>\r\n\"Enough! I'm your mother and you <i>will</i> do what I say. Now, we're leaving tomorrow. Pack tonight, and make sure you take all your clothes, books, whatever else we can fit in the car.\"<br>\r\n\"Can't we say goodbye to anyone?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but no. We're leaving before school tomorrow morning. Anyway, this isn't forever; a few months, at most.\"<br>\r\nRebecca turned her eyes downwards. She didn't like this at all, but she could tell that no matter what she did it wasn't going to change her mom's mind, not this time. She turned back to Natasja, but the plump young girl had fallen asleep again in her chair. She shook her head.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She grumbled reluctantly.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Vivian looked very relieved. \"Now, go pack up your stuff. Help your sister when she comes through as well.\"<br>\r\nUnenthusiastically, she trudged into the bedroom and began collecting her stuff, soon being joined by her yawning younger sister as together they began packing for what Natasja thought was a holiday, but Rebecca knew was something different altogether.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natasja woke up as the car entered a driveway, the sudden change from tarmac to gravel beneath the tires jolting her from a deep sleep. They had been driving all day in the hot sun, but luckily Natasja had spent most of it in slumber, only waking up when they stopped in the drive-thru of a McDonald's for a large meal. Now, finally, they had reached their destination; through the window, the six year old could just make out a large country house surrounded by trees. It was all very exciting!<br>\r\nThey pulled to a stop and got out, both children stopping for a moment to admire the house in front of them. All their lives, they'd lived in a small, two bedroom flat, but this house looked like it must have at least five or six bedrooms! It seemed old, the stones overgrown with ivy and moss sprouting between the tiles of the roof. Vivian barely glanced at it as she staggered to the door, rubbing her eyes in exhaustion. She'd driven for nearly eleven hours without a break or food; although her daughters had eaten at the McDonald's, she'd hardly even taken her eyes off the road the whole day. With a sigh, she rang the doorbell, hearing it chime discordantly inside. A minute later, the door was pulled open, revealing a young, pale woman standing within. She had very long blonde hair and bright blue eyes, and was as slim as a twig. All in all, she looked astonishingly like her aunt.<br>\r\n\"Vivian! Good to see you again.\" She smiled warmly.<br>\r\n\"You too, Gina.\" Vivian said, rather more lacklusterly. Any energy she'd had that morning had been sapped out of her by the long journey and her elder daughter's constant pestering.<br>\r\n\"And this must be Natasja and Rebecca. My, it's been a while since I've seen you two! You've grown a bit since then.\" She grinned at the two children, and they smiled unsurely back. \"I'm Gina, as I'm sure your mom's told you. It sounds like I'm looking after you whilst Viv's away, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Said Rebecca, not quite sure what to make of this woman who looked so much like their mother. It was a strange quirk of their family tree that although Vivian was Gina's aunt, Vivian was in fact four years the younger.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to head inside?\" She asked them. \"If you need the bathroom, it's second door on the left down the hall. Opposite that's the living room Just hang out in there for a minute okay? Me and your mom need to talk adult stuff.\" She moved aside, letting the two kids squeeze past and into the house, before stepping out and closing the door. Her smile disappeared as she turned to Vivian, and a second later the two were engaged in a muttered Swedish conversation. After a few minutes, Vivian nodded, and handed her niece the keys to the car.<br>\r\n\"There's a case in the glove compartment. Keep it safe, and don't open it. I'll keep you informed on the phone. If it looks like all this' wrapping itself up, you'll be the first to know. And thanks for doing this, Gina.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem, Viv. You always were my favorite aunt; in any case, it makes sense. They're practically the same age as my two, it's perfect.\"<br>\r\nVivian nodded again.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Hopefully they'll all get along. Now, I really must say goodbye to Nat and Rebecca, then catch my bus to the airport.\"<br>\r\nGina nodded this time, blonde hair moving in waves around her pale face. With one arm,s he pushed the door open and let Vivian step inside, then, with a furtive look around, followed her aunt within and closed the door behind them. </span></div></div>",

I thought you would be more mature then this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja did't understood why her sister acted like this.

Maybe living here was't so bad. A big room and a big bed. here even was a T.V in her room and a few closets.  <br>\r\nNatasja started to unpack. Then she heard some footsteps coming to her room.

Big butts, and rubbing thighs. Also flabby arms. While Natasja mostly was kind of shy for some reason she felt good with those two. After all they were family. That and she needed to live with them for some time anyway, she might as well try to get along with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're our cousin? Or something like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our mother was her mother niece. That means we're second nieces for their mom.

She had long, black shiny hair and a perfect white skin. Natasja thought she looked a lot like the Bratz doll Jade. except the Bratz doll wore her hair in two tails an wore make up. Venus wore her hair just loose and did't wore any make up. But just like the doll she wore cool clothing that looked cool at her. That was why she probably got her nickname Bratz doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai Natasja. Had a nice weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh yeah. Very nice. And how about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was okay. Hilary is sick.\" She said and pointed to the empty seat next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's too bad.\"       </span></div></div>",

She took Natasja to the toilet and got another pair of pants for her. But then came the hard part. to button the pants. The teacher tried as hard if she could but Natasja was just too fat for her pants. She finally used a small rubber band to button her pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might wanna ask you mother to take you clothe shopping.\" Her teacher said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she came back in class Johnny was talking with Timmy. The other boy of her group. Venus smiled friendly at her and when Natasja looked at her she knew she maybe finally made a friend. It felt good.    </span></div></div>",

I dont feel like eating with my normal friends today anyway.\"<br>\r\n\"thanks Venus\" said Natasja for the second time in ten minutes.<br>\r\nafter another few minutes the bell went for lunch. Natasja and Venus set off together in the direction of the lunch hall.<br>\r\nwhen they got there they both went and ordered what they wanted. Venus, despite her young age, eclared that she was on a diet and only ordered an autumn salad and water. in comparison, Natasja ordered a pizza, fries and a sugary fruit juice. <br>\r\nThey both sat down in a remote corner of the hall and proceeded to eat their lunches. Venus pecked occasionally at her food, ot really eating much. Natasja, on the other hand, proceeded  to stuff her pizza  into her mouth as though she was afraid it might disappear. As she ate, she could feel her belly slowly expanding and pressing against her already tight shirt. <br>\r\nTen minutes later Natasja pushed away her now empty tray. Her shirt had ridden up during the meal and about a third of her swollen belly was showing between her shirt and pants. Her deep belly button was clearly visible under her strained top. Venus stared in amazement. glancing over and seeing Venus staring at her distended belly, Natasja blushed slightly and tried to pull her shirt down to cover it. it wasn't quite big enough, however, and a bit of belly was left peeking out.<br>\r\nVenus whistled. <br>\r\n\"you sure do eat a lot!\" she muttered.<br>\r\nNatasja blush deepened<br>\r\n\"Sorry\" she said nervously. she was worried she might have just lost her newfound friend.<br>\r\n\"no need to apologize\" laughed Venus \"im just surprised by how much you can eat!\"<br>\r\nNatasja smiled gratefully.<br>\r\nSuddenly...</span></div></div>",

When she got there she found that she was spoiled for choice. There was ice cream with a flake, some delicious looking tarts and a large chocolate cake. After much deliberation, she finaly decided on the cake, ordering two slices. She told the serving lady that one was for her friend. When she got back to the table she set down her plate and sat down. Venus eyed the double helping of cake but didn't say anything.<br>\r\nQuickly Natasja started on her chocolate cake, savouring the rich, sugary taste. As she finished her first slice her abused belly started feeling almost painfully full, and her shirt was slowly pushed up by her growing stomach, her deep belly button emerging into view from beneath her strained shirt.<br>\r\nStill she pressed on, starting on her second slice of cake, and although she now ate slower than before, she was still ploughing through it at a good pace. All the while the uncomfortably full feeling in her belly grew. As she finaly finished her second slice, she looked down and realised that her shirt now showed almost her entire belly and the elastic band that was serving to button her pants was stretched almost to breaking. <br>\r\n\"Ouch\" she muttered \"my belly hurts.\"<br>\r\n\"Im not surprised\" commented Venus \"you just ate enough to feed five of me!\"<br>\r\n\"I cant help it.

What they saw was a duo of boys, one of which quite chubby, the other muscular. The muscular one, noticing Natasja's tears, spoke again.<br>\r\n\"Aww, is the piggy crying?\" He mocked.<br>\r\n\"Shut it, Julian\" spat Venus \"go pick on someone your own size\"<br>\r\n\"What, someone strong and muscular, not short and fat?\"<br>\r\n\"She's not fat!\" Said Venus \"just a little bit chubby.\"<br>\r\n\"Your seriously trying to tell me that she's not fat? I just watched her eat enough for three people. I bet she can't even stand up without snapping the elastic band she's using as a pants button 'cos her bellies too big to button it normally.\"<br>\r\n\"I can stand up without snapping it!\" She said tearfully \"just watch.\"<br>\r\nAnd with that she heaved her swollen bulk out the chair. Unsurprisingly, the sudden movement snapped the elastic band on her pants, letting her overstuffed belly ooze forwards, pushing her zipper down all the way with a grating noise. <br>\r\nWith this, Natasja burst into tears and ran from the hall. She could hear Julian's mocking laughter as she ran away down the corridoor. She ran blindly through school, before hiding in an empty classroom. She sat down in the corner, exhausted from her short run. It was the most exercise she'd done all week. She sobbed into her hands, crying miserably and wishing she wasn't so chubby. Suddenly she heard the door open and someone step into the room. She raised her tear stained face from her hands to see...</span></div></div>",

The boy turned his head and saw her. <br>\r\n\"Go away!\" she shouted tearfully.<br>\r\nThe boy looked startled.<br>\r\n\"Im not here to make fun of you\" he said \"i just wanted to make sure you were ok.

It was so mean of him to say that stuff to you.\"<br>\r\nAt his words Natasja slumped down against the wall.<br>\r\n\"He's right though!\" she cried \"I'm just a fat, ugly pig! I only have one friend and i can't even control myself to stop eating even when i'm already completely stuffed!\"<br>\r\n\"Thats not true.\" He said calmly \"your not ugly at all. Anyway,\" he continued boldly \"you have two friends. Venus and me.<br>\r\n\"But i don't even know your name and i've only just met you.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm James. I'm in your class but i sit on the other side of the classroom\"<br>\r\nShe smiled at him. She hadn't thought anyone would care enough about her to bother coming after her.<br>\r\nHe smiled back at her. Suddenly he stood up. I'm going to have to go and find Julian now. Else he'll get annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Bye\" she said.<br>\r\n\"I'll see you later.\"<br>\r\nHe turned and walked to the door. As he reached it he paused. <br>\r\n\"Just thought I'd mention it it\" he called back to her \"the zipper on your pants is down and i can see your underwear\"<br>\r\nAnd with that, he turned and left the room.<br>\r\nNatasja, blushing bright red, reached down and tried to pull the zipper on her pants up. It was very difficult. gritting her teeth and sucking in her belly in as far as it would go she just managed to get it zippered to the top. She quickly grabbd a few rubber bands and used them as a button for her pants. Panting, she stopped sucking her stomach in and it pressed tightly against the front of her pants. The rubber bands stretched alarmingly but held.<br>\r\nNext, she tried pulling her shirt down to cover her exposed belly. She got it to just above her belly button, but no further. Frowning, she sucked in her belly as much as she could and just managed to cover her belly button. However as soon as she exhaled her shirt rode back up exposing it again. <br>\r\nShe bit her lip wondering what she should do. Finally she decided on just walking quickly to her classroom when the bell went and hoping no one commented on her exposed stomach. Shakily she got to her feet and went over to the door. She sat down on the edge of a table and waited nervously for the bell that would signal the end of lunch. <br>\r\nA moment later...</span></div></div>",

She joined the bustle of people in the corridoor outside and walked as fast as she could towards her classroom, hoping no one would say anything about the wedge of belly left uncovered by her top. She self-consciously reached down and tried to pull her top down further but it was hopeless. Her poor shirt was already stretched almost to breaking point and it just wouldn't cover her belly button.<br>\r\nShe noticed a couple of people looking at her as she approached her classroom but luckily no one commented. Natasja wasn't sure if she could stand any more nasty remarks. She entered the room and sat in her seat, noticing she was one of the first back from lunch. After a moment the other children began to arrive. She smiled at James as he came in and he smiled back, although she noticed his eyes flickering quickly down to her half covered belly. She tried again to pull her shirt down but it made no difference. <br>\r\nA few seconds later Vemus came in and sat down next to her, looking concerned.<br>\r\n\"Are you all right?\" She asked \"you ran out the lunch hall and i couldn't find you anywhere.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm ok\" Natsja replied \"James found me and was nice to me.\"<br>\r\n\"That chubby kid who was with Julian?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. He's nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, well i'm glad your ok. You might want to pull your shirt down though. Your belly is sticking out.\"<br>\r\nNatasja coloured.<br>\r\n\"I can't\" she whispered \"my shirts too small\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" asked Venus \"well i suppose you could ask the teacher. She probably has a spare\"<br>\r\n\"I can't. I already went to her when i broke my pants. If i go again i'll look really stupid.\"<br>\r\n\"Well ok. You should seriously buy some bigger clothes though. You seem to have 'outgrown' these ones.\"<br>\r\n\"i'll ask my mom to take me after school\"<br>\r\nAfter that they chatted for a while, waiting for the end of the day. As the minutes ticked away on the big clock on the wall Natasja could feel her stomach slowly digesting the food within it. By the time the bell went for the end of the day she could pull her shirt down almost the whole way over her belly. Her stomach still stuck out quite a bit but only a couple of centimetres more than usual. That was good. She didn't want her mother to say anything. As she and Venus left the classroom Venus suddenly spoke.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Natasja. Do you want to come over to my house after to school tomorrow?\"<br>\r\nNatasja stared at her, eyes wide. No one had ever asked her round to their house before!<br>\r\nVenus noticed her expression.<br>\r\n\"If you don't want to come you don't have to, you know.\"<br>\r\n\"No it's fine. I think i would like to go to your house. I'll ask mom and tell you what she says tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Great\" said Venus \"i'll ask my Dad in a minute\"<br>\r\nBy this point they hd got outsie and suddenly Natasja spotted her mother.<br>\r\n\"Bye Venus. See you tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n\"Bye Natasja\"<br>\r\nNatasja then went over to her mother and they both got in the car.<br>\r\nAs they drove away from school Natasja's mum spoke.<br>\r\n\"Who was that you were with just there?\" she asked<br>\r\n\"That was Venus\" said Natasja \"She's one of my new friends\"<br>\r\n\"Really? Who are the others?\"<br>\r\n\"Just one other. James. He's a boy in my class.\"<br>\r\n\"Well Natasja, i'm very impressed. You've made a real effort at meeting new people. As a reward you can have a special treat. What do you want?\"<br>\r\nNatasja's answer was rather predictable to anyone who knew her.<br>\r\n\"Mom, could we go to the pizza place?\"<br>\r\n\"I had a feeling you were going to say that\" she laughed \"fine. As a special treat. We'll go later at supper time\"<br>\r\nA minute later the car pulled in front of their house. It was a large place as Natasja parents were quite rich, mostly due to the massive sum of money Natsja's mother had recieved upon the death of her parents. Once they got into the house the first thing Natasja did was change her clothes as the clothes she were currenly wearing were uncomfortably tight. However, as she searched through her wardrobe she realised that all her clothes were tight. After a while she decided on a relatively new pair of jeans and her largest shirt.<br>\r\nTaking them out, she walked over to the full body mirror in the corner of the room and started changing. First came the jeans. They went on quite easily to start with, but it took a bit of effort to get the zip up. However, she sucked in her belly and pushed the button into place without too much difficulty. She let her belly out and looked in the mirror, noting with disress that her belly hung over the top of her jeans by a good inch, almost covering the button. Maybe visiting the pizza place wasn't the best idea after all.<br>\r\nNext came the shirt. Despite it being the biggest she had it was still tight around her belly. Luckily, it was large enough to tuck into her jeans, and that stopped her belly hanging over.<br>\r\nShe examined herself in the mirror, deciding that this outfit was good. She would wear it again tomorrow so that she didn't have any more unfortunate incidents like at lunch today.<br>\r\nAfter that she went downstairs and watched some television for a bit.<br>\r\nAfter a while...</span></div></div>",

In pure terror she called \"MMUUUUUMMMMMMYYYYYY!\", her mum rushed over and said \"you've gained a little weight honney, the doctor weighed you when you were sleeping and you weigh... 400lbs darling.

She was having the best dream she could ask for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja found herself in a huge room (and I mean HUGE). The room had a ceiling, but the walls went farther than her eyes can see. Her stomach grumbled. She rubbed it and looked around. Nothing. Just then, the floor opened in front of her. Something began to rise from inside the hole. When she saw it, she squealed. It was the biggest pizza she ever saw. It was enormous! She wasn't much good at measuring, but she guessed she could walk across the pizza and take about 20 steps to cross it. Her belly growled, then, one word came to her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to eat the gigantic pizza. She was tearing the crust off and shoving it into her mouth. She took occasional pauses only to chew the food and send it straight down to her hungry belly. After about 5 minutes of constant gorging, she had already eaten about 15% of the pizza. She stopped. Her belly hurt a lot. But about 3 seconds later she realized her belly wasn't sore from the food; it was sore because it was trying to blow that pants button off! The button eventually gave up and blew right off her pants. The sudden fall of her belly destroyed the zipper too. She began patting her belly, proud of her gain. \"About time that button flew off! That thing started to hurt!\" she giggled and sat back down near the pizza. She found herself eating slower than before, but she didn't care, she was eating an incredibly huge pizza and that's what mattered! As she constantly stuffed her seemingly bottom less belly, her shirt began riding up her body. But it eventually found its limit and ripped. Her belly was now fully visible, and boy was it big. She was now halfway done with the pizza. She decided to take another break. She noticed her shirt was ripped and her pants (which were already being destroyed by her weight) had several tears on it, mostly around her thighs. She smiled at the tears and rips. She heard the sound of something hitting the ground. She turned around and saw a scale. She got up (which took about a minute) and waddled as fast as she could (which wasn't fast at all) to the scale. She stepped on it and it read 348 LBS. Natasja cried with glee at the number, but her was about to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natasja, wake up\"</span></div></div>",

I think that it would take twenty steps to cross it and i could eat the entire pizza all by myself. Oh after eaten half of it there was a big scale. I stepped on it and it read 348 LBS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Lucky you it was only a dream.\" Vivian said while she started to dress Natasja. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!

It was all just wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Natasja. You don't want too become so fat. No one wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think it was great. Why not mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Natasja. hundreds of people try to lose weight. Do you really think they would do that if it was great? Being too fat is unhealthy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But also hundreds of people smoke and that's unhealthy too and they still do it. So why not being fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian sighed while she pulled Natasja's shirt down trying to cover most of her round belly what did't really worked. She looked in the closet and pulled out a dress that was able to cover her rounds daughter's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well also hundreds of people tried to stop smoke because it's unhealthy! Just get over it Natasja! I don't want you too become fat so you're not going too become.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja decided to keep the thought about how good it felt too herself and got out bed and waddled downstairs. She went sitting at the table and her mother started to make breakfast. <br>\r\nNatasja looked a bit at pictures of her family. Then she looked at a picture of her grandmother from fathers side. She had seen this picture many times but now she noticed her grandmother was fat. She did't knew her grandmother. She died before Natasja was born. Natasja wondered if it got something too do with why her mother was so upset about the being fat.<br>\r\nHer mother put a big bowl of cereal on the table and a big glass of juice. Natasja fast started too eat but kept thinking. She decided to take the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mom. How good did you knew daddy's mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very good. You know your father and i know each other from since we were toddlers. She was like a second mother for me. I was very upset when she died. She was a wonderful woman. Why do you asks so suddenly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing. Just wondering when i looked at those pictures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian looked at her daughter with a strange look but it kept too that. The rest of the morning went on in silence. She took Natasja too kindergarten, but while dropping her off she said: \"Please try to do something with other kids!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja looked around at all kids who were playing until the teacher came in wondering what she would do, but for some strange reason the picture of the giant pizza and her weighing 348 LBS kept in her head.  </span></div></div>",

Excitedly she waddled over to the last remaining half of the pizza and set the scale down by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she started tearing into the pizza, gluttonously pushing it into her mouth. She moaned as cheese, sauce and buttery bread disappeared down her throat, more and more filling her up and out.

She resumed her amazing gorging session, speeding up the rate at which she consumed handful after handful of fattening pizza. After several more minutes, she finished her bite and burped softly. She looked at how messy her hands were and noticed that her palms and fingers were visibly fatter. She wiggled them and noticed that they were getting slightly harder to move. She smiled and turned around toward the scale, and nearly lost her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, this added bulk is taking some getting used to,\" Nastasja said to herself. She waddled toward the scale, her body jiggling with every step, and got onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n371 lbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery increase of the number made Nastasja more excited, more greedy, more hungry.

After a little more thought, she simply decided that is some other effect of the remote. She searched for something to do, beyond just floating. She managed to flip herself around and get a look at the solar system. She thought it fun wave her hand through gas giants and watching the gas move around her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got bored of this quickly though, and found other things to do, mostly playing around with the chunks of ice that began to orbit around her. For an unknown amount of time to her, Mia felt that even though had gotten much larger, belly had remain empty.known that there was even close to enough food to fill her on earth, picked a chunk out of it's  orbit, put it in her mouth, and swallowed. It didn't taste particularly good, but it gave her nice chilly feeling in her tummy. She ate more, until there were only a few left, just out of her reach. She tried and tried the get them, but she just couldn't reach them, and this frustrated her. She looked for something to move her forward, but could only  move  forward a tiny bit,  not enough to reach. She tried paddling, which seemed to work, it tired her so much that by the time reached the last pieces of ice, she was hungry after she finished them. She floated a little while longer, then saw a bright light off in the distance, with what seemed like more chunks of ice. she new they were to far for her to paddle to them, but if she could get the remote again, she make herself big enough to reach them. She turns herself around and sets her eyes on earth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia looked around everywhere in space and on her body to find the remote. She drifted off to try to find the remote floating around, and she searched her immensely flabby folds to see if the remote got stuck in her fat.  Unfortunately she couldn't find the remote.  Mia Lin then felt a movement similar to footsteps on her body behind her. It felt as someone was walking on her soft, vast back-neck fat. Mia felt the footsteps coming closer to her head, and she anticipated what the mystery person will do to her.  Suddenly, Mia was blinded as two hands covered her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEEEEEEEK!\" Shrieked Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" Shouted the mysterious person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia recognized the voice and turned her head around.  It was Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! I have found you!\" Shouted Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure did,\" said Amy, \"I grabbed on to you as you were growing so I wouldn't get stuck under you.  Look at how big you got!  Your cheeks must be the size of the Earth! And your belly must be big enough to make you the cutest girl ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd indeed Amy was right.  Although Mia's celestially gargantuan amounts of fat was spread out throughout her body, most of it were concentrated on her belly, making it look even more bloated than ever. Mia's chest and bottom area were also puffed up with fat in proportion to her belly, making Mia appear more adorable for a girl who is fatter than the solar system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think so?\" Mia Lin asked, \"Because I may be the cutest girl in the solar system, but not the cutest girl ever. I played with Jupiter and Saturn and ate space ice before I got bored and hungry, so I'm going home to eat more food to be even bigger and cuter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Mia!\" Amy interrupted, \"I got something for you!\"  Amy rummaged through her pocket to bring out the fattening remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The remote!\" Mia shouted, \"You found it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had it with me the whole time,\" Amy explained, \"Now we can make you even bigger, fatter, and cuter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I wanna eat food at home!\" cried Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, you are so big that the Earth is like a tiny marble compared to you. You can place Earth in front of your face, and your mom and everyone in the world will make food for you,\" Amy convinced Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea, Amy,\" Mia said, \"Why haven't I thought of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then floated under the solar system and carefully rested the Earth on top of her astronomically-sized neck.  As the Earth rested on top of the blubbery ocean of Mia's neck fat, Mia didn't take into account that the rest of the solar system is now on her. The Sun, Mercury, and Venus sat upon her massive buttocks, the asteroid belt and Mars laid upon her blubber-filled breasts, covering up any exposed nudity, and the gas giants lay softly on top of Mia's ginormous belly.  Mis didn't mind, as food was on her mind right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's mother was wondering what happened to her daughter.  The last time she saw Mia, Mia was fatter and even taller than Mia's mom (Which was strange considering her weight and proportions), holding a strange remote, and went outside to the backyard.  Mia's mom doesn't know where or how Mia got the strange remote, but that wasn't on her mind right now. What was on her mind was to call Mia for dinner.  She just cooked the biggest Chinese buffet just for Mia.  Mia's mom then opened the door to find that the backyard is covered in a giant wall of fat. Not only that, but the entire neighborhood was covered by the same wall of fat.  Mia's mom looked up to see her daughter's fat face looking directly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Mommy!\" Mia said to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, hello Mrs. Lin,\" Amy introduces herself to Mia's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia! What happened to you?!\" Mia' mom asked in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy and I made myself fatter than the solar system!\" Mia explained, \"Do I look cuter mommy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin's mother took another good look at her daughter and a smile formed on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those massive chubby cheeks of yours do bring out the best in you, and you do have as much bigger tummy that I can't see, so you are much cuter than before,\" Mia's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaaaaay! I love you mommy!\" Mia Lin yelled in excitement, \"Now let's eat! I am starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin's mother brought her home-cooked dinner outside.  Because of Mia's massive gravitational pull from her body, Mia's mom was able to easily walk up Mia's neck to bring her the Chinese buffet. Amy and Mia's mom ate some of the dinner, but it was Mia who was fed all of the food.  Although the dinner barely made Mia larger than she is currently, it filled her stomach enough that she wasn't hungry anymore.  After dinner, Mia's mom then returned back inside the house and let Mia play with Amy some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Amy. Do you have the remote?\" Mia asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure do,\" said Amy as she brings out the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, Amy! Now make me bigger so I can be even cuter than before!\" exclaimed Mia.</span></div></div>",

Amy pointed the remote to what she can see of Mia Lin's body (which happens to be her extremely huge and chubby cheeks and neck).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Mia! I'm ready!\" shouted Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Amy!\" responded Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then pressed the Maximum Fat button,and Amy and Mia watched as the remote shot a bolt of energy into Mia's exposed body.  Mia Lin started to feel her body fill with soft blubber, even faster than before.  Mia and Amy saw that Mia's gargantuan neck fat was growing larger and wider, causing the Earth that was settled on Mia to move farther away from her face.  Mia didn't mind, as she can always move the planet closer to her face at any time.  Back at Mia's house, Mia's mom saw out the window that Mia's head was moving farther away from Earth, indicating her that Mia was expanding even larger than before.  Mia's mom became even prouder of her daughter for becoming cuter than ever, but she worried that She wouldn't be able to meet Mia anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in space, Mia's body was growing exponentially with fat. Mia's belly grew rounder as it swelled with adipose while her rump and chest grew slightly slower than her belly.  Mia's body expanded with trillions and trillions of pounds of blubbery fat per second until she became the size of the Oort Cloud.  The Oort Cloud couldn't stay stable under Mia's gravitational pull, and the Oort Cloud imploded into Mia, causing space rock to land on Mia's blubbery mass of a body.  Mia, being too fat to care, didn't get hurt by the implosion of the Oort Cloud, and Mia is still growing fatter and larger.  Her body is fattening rapidly, effecting nearby celestial bodies in the galaxy.  Nearby stars and nebula became attracted to Mia's body, and they spread all over her colossal belly, buttocks, and breasts, as if they were becoming Mia's new clothes.  Mia felt tingly as the hot star dust cover her immense fat as the stars and nebulae continued to spread all over her.  Mia continued to grow and grow to the point where she is larger than the Milky Way Galaxy.  The galaxy couldn't maintain its shape in the presence of Mia's expanding body, and it covered her blubbery body instead.  Even the supermassive black hole found in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy couldn't stop Mia's growth, and all the mass that got sucked inside the black hole escaped and landed on Mia's body, causing the black hole to disappear.  All that is left of the Milky Way is the matter flimsily covering Mia's naked body.  After that, Mia's body suddenly stopped growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack where Mia and Amy were, Amy and Mia observed what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Mia!\" Amy yelled in excitement, \"You are larger than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think so?\" asked Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do.  Your belly must be bigger than the galaxy!\"  said Amy as she hugs Mia's fatness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia had to agree with Amy.  Mia felt that her belly was fatter than the Milky Way, and she believed that made her the cutest girl ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, I'm going to ask my mom what she thinks of me now.\"  Mia said to Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's going to be really surprised,\" Amy responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia moved the Earth closer to her face until she can see her backyard.  Once her face is at her home, Mia called for her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!  Come out!  I need to show you something!\" Mia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's mother heard her daughter, and went to the backyard.  She found her daughter's extremely fat face in front of her, and she ran to her daughter's fat and hugged it without end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mia!\" Mia's mom exclaimed, \"I have missed you dearly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you too, Mommy!\" responded Mia, \"Look how big I've gotten!  How cuter do you think I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, you're the cutest girl I have ever seen.  I am your mother, so nothing will ever change the fact that you will always be the cutest.\" Mia's mom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, mommy.\" Mia replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too, sweetie,\" Mia's mom said, \"Mommy's going back inside to rest, so don't get into any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, mommy.\" Said Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mia's mom went back into the house, Amy found something peculiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mia.\" said Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Amy?\" responded Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a strange light up in space.  Wanna go and check it?\" asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I saw that light before when I was as big as the solar system.

The blob was colored blue and had similar proportions to that of Mia's body.  Upon closer inspection, the blob happened to be a little girl as fat as Mia!  The girl appeared to be around the same age as Mia, and her face was similar to that of a human's, except for her two antennas on her head and her light blue skin.  The girl appears to be wearing a blue jumpsuit with red stripes that covered the majority of her body.  The blue girl was most definitely an alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, who do you think that is?\" Mia asked Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, I'm pretty sure that is an alien as big as you,\" answered Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue alien girl then notices the galaxy-sized girl that is Mia and approached her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you don't look you are from here.  What's your name and species?\" Asked the massively obese alien girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Mia, and this is Amy.  We're humans from planet Earth,\" answered Mia. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Lora and I am an Obesimite. I am from the Plane of Obesus and I was searching for life out there in space.  Look's like I found life after all.\" answered Lora, \"Can I ask you something?  You said that you were from a planet, but you are as big as me.  Also, why are you naked and have a star swirl on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my friend Amy just made me fatter than a galaxy, and my clothes have ripped off.  It looks like I'm wearing my home galaxy in place,\" responded Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains it,\" said Lora, \"Come on.  I'm bringing you to my home to give you clothes and food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK!\" exclaimed Mia and Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia followed Lora as they floated close to the edge of the universe where the Plane of Obesus resided.  When they entered the Plane of Obesus, Mia and Amy couldn't believe their eyes.  The Plane of Obesus appeared to be a colossal city that spanned entire universes.  Colossal dome-shaped buildings of various sizes lined the flat yet infinite plane.  There also appeared to be Obesimites like Lora scattered throughout the plane, wearing similar jumpsuits like Lora and having sizes as large as and even bigger than Lora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Lora!\" exclaimed Amy, \"This is your home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, the Plane of Obesus is the paradise for Obesimites,\" explained Lora, \"Here, everything is infinite.  Us Obesimites can get as fat as possible without worries of starvation, poverty, or limited space.  In fact, it is our life goal to become as fat as possible, and since we have eternal youth, we cannot die doing what we love, so it would take a really long time to reach that goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we going to meet your mom and dad?\" Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obesimites are an all-female species, so I don't have a dad.  You can meet my mom, however.\" explained Lora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora, Mia, and Amy then reached Lora's dome house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here is my house. Obesimite houses always grow whenever we grow, so we won't worry about getting stuck.\" Lora explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then opened the door and yelled, \"Mom! I'm home! I'm back from space and made new friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora, Mia, and Amy all entered the house and saw Lora's mom.  Lora's mom is at least 60 times the size of Lora and is wearing a huge apron on top of her jumpsuit.  Her face is also of that of a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello, sweetie,\" Lora's mom responded \"Allow me to introduce myself to your friends. My name is Zena and I am Lora's mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mia and this is Amy,\" Mia responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, my friends are humans from Earth and they want to come over for some food and clothes.\" Lora explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems one of then is already accustomed to life on Obesus,\" said Zena, \"Mia and Amy, I will allow you to stay here if your mother allows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can be arranged,\" said Mia as she moves Earth closer to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" yelled Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mia?\" Mia's mom responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I stay over at an alien's house?\" Asked Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you can, sweetie,\" responded Mia's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mommy!\" Mia said as she moved Earth away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mommy said I can stay here!\"  Mia said to Zena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that you brought your home with you,\" said Zena, \"I thought that you accidentally got a star swirl stuck on you.  Never mind.  Just get into the dressing chamber to wear your jumpsuit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy then entered the dressing chamber.  The dressing chamber activated, and a jumpsuit materialized over Mia's body.  The jumpsuit is also blue like the jumpsuits of the Obesimites, but Mia's jumpsuit has a red Oriental pattern printed on it.  Amy also has a jumpsuit materialized on her, but this one is blue with tiny red polkadots on it.  Mia's jumpsuit also materialized under the Milky Way Galaxy, so Earth won't be trapped in the suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy exited the dressing chamber to meet Zena again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you got your Obesus brand jumpsuits,\" Zena said, \"These suits can stay elastic even if you become a billion times fatter than me, so you won't have to worry about any wardrobe failures. Now I'm going to prepare dinner for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zena went to the kitchen, Lora went up to Mia and said, \"Hey, Mia and Amy. Let me show you someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then led Mia and Amy to a different room. The inside of the room appears to be a large baby room, and in the middle of the room is a giant crib.  Inside the crib is an Obesimite about half the size of Lora wearing a blue pajama jumpsuit with red flower patterns.  Lora then picks up the baby Obesimite in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my baby sister, Trini,\" Lora explained, \"She was born a month ago, and she loves to eat! Mommy and I love her very much!  Sometimes when my mother is asleep, I feed Trini to about my size and play with her for hours.  I make sure to eat twice my size so that my mother wouldn't notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's very adorable,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course she is,\" Lora responded back, \"Trini, say hi to Mia and Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungee!\" Trini babbled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Trini doesn't know how to talk yet and this is the only word she knows.\" Lora responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then gently placed Trini back on her crib to let her sleep.  Mia, Amy, and Lora then exited the room and decided what to do next.  They finally decided to:</span></div></div>",

Lora was the first to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, when is dinner going to be ready?\"  Lora asked her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Lora.  I didn't hear you and your friends walk in,\" Zena answered, \"I'm done preparing dinner.  Lora, would you be a dear and bring Trini and your friends to the dining room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, Mom,\" Lora replied back, \"Mia, Amy, go to the dining room while I go get Trini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Lora,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy went to the dining room where the dinner will be served.  At the dining room, Mia can only see large, oval-shaped seats and tubes hanging from the ceiling.  Zena then arrived at the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Zena,\" Mia asked, \"Where is the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked.  We Obesemites eat our meals from the tubes hanging from the ceiling.  It is much faster and more efficient that way,\" Zena answered, \"There are tubes like these scattered throughout all the rooms in our house, but we usually eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the dining room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Lora came into the dining room carrying Trini. Lora then placed Trini on one of the seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Mom. I brought Trini,\" Lora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungee!\" Trini shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Trini,\" Zena said, \"Mommy will feed you everything you need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is this dinner going to taste like?\" Mia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes like anything you want it to be,\" Zena replied, \"Now let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora, Zena, and Trini then placed a tube in each of their mouths and started to chug the paste that is entering their mouths.  Mia then followed suit and placed a tube in her mouth.  Mia noticed that the paste tasted like Chinese food when she started to think about Chinese food, and she chugged away like the Obesimites.  Mia felt the paste convert into body fat as soon as she swallowed the paste, and she saw that her body is becoming even bigger than before, especially her belly as it filled up with paste and spreader out with fat.  Mia also saw that the Obesimites chugging on the paste are growing bigger, wider, and fatter as they feed on the paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, who was the only one watching Mia and the Obesimites eating the dinner, then decided that she wants to get fat with them.  She doesn't want to be rude by not being the only one eating dinner, and she also has the remote, so she can always use the Shrink button if she gets too fat.  Amy then placed a feeding tube in her mouth and lets the paste enter her esophagus.  Amy then felt a strange, tingly sensation as the paste is instantly turned to fat.  Amy's belly spread out farther than she could see, and Amy was losing the ability to stand as she cushioned herself onto her expanding rump and thickening legs.  Amy could swear that she was rising as her buttocks grew rounder with fat, and she felt her head weighing heavier as her cheeks and neck grew with tons of fat.  If she wasn't in her jumpsuit, then she would have become naked a couple of minutes ago due to her clothes being ripped from the fat she is amassing.  Amy was certain that she is now larger than Jupiter at this point.  <i>Is this how Mia feels when she is this fat?</i> Amy thought as she allowed megatons of tasty fattening paste to enter her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia, Amy, and the Obesimites continued to grow bigger and fatter drinking the paste for a while.  As they are feeding on dinner, the house grew along with them so it won't break from the inside from the beings' cosmic girth.  They ate dinner until they heard a ringing noise.  Zena then removed the tube from her mouth and declared that dinner is over.  Lora, Mia, and Amy removed their tubes, and Zena removed Trini's tube from her mouth.  Trini was about to cry, but Zena comforted her as she carried Trini back to her crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone has grown immensely from the dinner.  Lora, Zena, and Trini grew at least four times their original sizes before the dinner, but Mia has grown bigger than Lora, being now twice of Lora's current size.  Amy was still the smallest of the beings who ate the dinner, but she was now at least the size of the solar system, which is still an impressive feat for a once thin little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Lora!  I'm now bigger than you!\" exclaimed Mia as she jiggled and flaunted her belly, \"I am now cuter than ever before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get your hopes up too high,\" Lora said as she rubs her own belly, \"I can get as big as I want on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget about me!\" the now Solar System sized Amy shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey, Amy.  I haven't noticed that you grew too.\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm loving how big I got,\" Amy said, \"I hope I don't have to lose all this weight if my Mom finds out.  I'm still keeping the remote, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Zena entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, girls,\" Zena said, \"It's time to go to sleep now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But me and Amy have no place to sleep,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can sleep in my room,\" Lora responded, \"I have temporary beds set up for an occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At this size, we don't even need beds!\" Mia joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mia, Amy, and Lora had their chuckle at Mia's joke, they then went to Lora's bedroom to go to sleep.  Lora set two mattresses for Mia and Amy to sleep on while Lora slept on her own bed.  The three girls then say good night to each other and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, an hour passed, and Mia was woken up by:</span></div></div>",

Not only that, but she was also very hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want food,\" Mia said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia walked slowly out of Lora's bedroom to not wake anyone up.  She went to the living room and found a feeding tube hanging from the ceiling.  Mia placed the tube in her mouth and turned it on.  Mia was chugging down on paste faster than she had done during dinner.  Mia could see that her body, especially her belly, rump, and chest, was expanding larger and fatter with every gulp she makes.  The house also slowly expands to occomodate her growing body.  Just then, Mia started to become drowsy as she ate from the tube.  Mia couldn't keep herself awake long enough, and she fell asleep with the tube continuing to feed her paste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then woke up in the morning and noticed that something isn't right.  She was in the living room with a feeding tube in her mouth continuing to feed her paste.  The living room is also much larger than usual.  Mia then removed the tube from her mouth and examined her body.  It was unbelievable.  Mia has drank so much paste while she was sleeping.  Mia is now at least twice the size of Zena, making her the fattest being in the household.  Her oriental pattern jumpsuit is now stretched out farther than before, still without any sign of stress.  Her belly and rear are now cosmically fatter and rounder than before, rippling with waves of fat every time Mia takes a step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.  What am I supposed to do?\"  Mia said to herself, unsure how to explain this problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mia heard someone coming to the living room.  Mia saw that it was:</span></div></div>",

Mia was now much larger than before, even bigger than Zena.  The living room was also more spaceous than it had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia!  I have been looking for you ever since I woke up and couldn't find you!\" Amy exclaimed, \"What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got hungry and went to get a midnight snack,\" Mia explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like you got more than a snack,\" Amy said as she pushed her body against Mia's ginormous belly, \"You're much fatter and softer than before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, what am I going to do if the aliens see me like this?\" Mia asked Amy in a worried tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, I have the remote,\" Amy said as she held up the remote, \"I can make the aliens bigger so they won't notice anything strange about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great plan!\" exclaimed Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia then brought Amy on top of her belly and carried her to Lora's room, where Lora is still sleeping.  Amy pressed the maximum fat button to Lora, and Lora began to grow with megatons of fat per millisecond.  The Obesimite's body was bloating out everywhere with adipose, her belly was rippling with waves upon waves of fat as she grew, and her rump and chest ballooned out much farther than before.  Lora's bedroom also grew more spacious to accommodate Lora's expanding size.  This continued until Lora was about more than half the size of Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy then went to Trini's bedroom where Trini is sleeping soundly in her crib.  Amy used the Maximum Fat button on the remote on Trini, and Trini rapidly expanded with fat.  Trini's body fill up with blubber, and her belly fat pressed against the bars of her crib as she grew before her crib grows alongside her.  Trini giggled in her sleep as her body grew bigger and rounder with fat.  This went on until Trini was half the size of Lora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy then went to Zena's bedroom where Zena is sleeping.  Amy pressed the maximum fat button to Zena, and Zena rapidly grew much fatter and faster than the previous two Obesimites.  Mia and Amy almost had to move out of the way of Zena's rapidly growing body, but they didn't have to since the house became much more larger and spaceous as Zena grew.  Zena's belly, breasts, and butt filled up and rippled with blubber as she grew under the influence of the remote.  When Zena stopped growing, she was only 60 times the size of Lora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy then crept slowly back to Lora's bedroom.  As soon as they got there, Amy decided to use the remote on herself to complete the illusion.  Amy pressed the Maximum Fat button on the remote, and her body grew bigger and rounder with fat.  Mia felt the weight of her friend as she grew on her belly, and Mia felt happy that her friend was becoming bigger.  When Amy stopped growing, she was the size of a galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, now no one will notice,\" said Amy as soon as she stopped growing fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Amy.  I don't know what I would do without you,\" thanked Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem,\" Amy responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia and Amy then napped until it was truly morning, when Lora, Trini, and Zena woke up.  Lora woke up with Mia and Amy when Lora asked the two a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, does something feel different around here?\" asked Lora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh, no?\" replied Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know why, but something feels weird about this room,\" said Lora as she wonders if her room got bigger, \"Oh well.  It's probably nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia, Amy, and Lora then went to the living room and decided to:</span></div></div>",

Inside Trini's room, Trini was sound asleep as she slept in her crib, her gigantic body shivered with fat every time she breathed.  When Lora , Mia, and Amy are inside the room, Lora pulled down one of the feeding tubes from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In order for the game to be fair, we must all be the same size when we begin, so Mia, we have to be at your size before we start,\" Lora explained, \"Would that be okay for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I can wait,\" Mia responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Lora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then placed the feeding tube in her mouth and chugged down at the paste.  Her cosmically gigantic body grew with fat and her belly and rear expanded outward as she downed the paste.  Her belly fat rippled constantly as it filled with more fat.  A couple of minutes later, Lora was finally the size of Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, I can be the size of you if I want to be,\" Lora said to Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it's my turn,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then pulled another feeding tube from the ceiling and gave it to Amy.  Amy, who was now on the floor, placed the feeding tube in her mouth and started eating the paste.  She grew with fat at the same rate as Lora, and her belly and rump grew out as she gulped in the paste.  However, since she was smaller than Lora, Amy needed more time to grow as big as Mia.  After a while, Amy was finally as big as Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Mia, I'm finally as big as you!\" Amy exclaimed with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Amy.  Now we're the biggest and cutest best friends ever!\" Mia responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I have to make Trini as big as us,\" Lora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then pulled down another food tube from the ceiling and woke Trini up in her crib.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trini, wake up, it's time for the food game,\" Lora said to Trini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungee!\"  Trini responded back with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora then placed a food tube into the baby Obesimite's mouth, and Trini sucked on the tube like there was no tomorrow.  Trini grew bigger and fatter with every gulp of paste she takes in, enjoying how her adipose shake and jiggle endlessly as she feed.  Trini's belly and rump pressed against the rails of her crib as she grew before the crib and the bedroom expands to accommodate Trini's size. It didn't take too long until Trini is the size of Mia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's a big baby,\" Mia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Trini.  You're as big as Mia.

That wasn't even a minute! What happened?!\" Mia Lin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungee!\" Trini cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know! I thought I set the timer to 30 minutes, not 30 seconds! The machine pumping the paste must be bugged!\" Lora exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe someone manually turned the machine off,\" an unknown yet familiar voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin, Amy, and Lora turned around, and they were surprised when they saw Zena at the control panel of the paste machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!?\" Lora exclaimed surprisingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look's like you girls were having an eating contest late at night,\" Zena said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I can explain...\" Lora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Lora.  I'm not going to ground you,\" Zena responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Amy asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm proud that you girls want to eat more and grow bigger like a good, healty Obesimite.  I occasionally get midnight snacks when I was little, so I would do the same if I was in your shoes,\" Zena explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that mean we're not in trouble anymore?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, but you made a big problem,\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" the three girls asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls forgot to include me in your eating contest!\" Zena exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? But Mommy, you're much bigger than us! You'll eat way much more in the eating contest!\" Lora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you girls were as big as me,\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Are you going to fatten us up to your size?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.  Now put your tubes in your mouth.  I'm going to make you girls as big as me,\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin, Amy, and Lora placed a tube in each of their mouthes, and Lora helped place a tube into Trini's mouth.  Zena then turned on the paste machine, causing paste to flow into the colossal girls' mouthes.  The girls drank and drank the paste, causing them to grow bigger and fatter with each gulp.  Their bellies, butts, and breasts grew bigger, fatter, rounder, and jigglier with each consumption of paste, and their bodies rippled endlessly with tremors of fat as they ate.  Soon, all four girls were each the size of around 240 galaxies, which was Zena's current size, and Zena turned off the machine in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! I'm as big as you!\" Lora exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, and you look much more beautiful this way,\" Zena said, causing Lora to blush in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we're all the same weight, can we start the eating contest?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you can right now. Just put the tubes in your mouthes and I'll start the machine timer for 30 minutes,\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin, Amy, and Lora placed a tube in their mouthes again, and Trini still has a tube in her mouth.  Zena then set the timer for 30 minutes and started the machine, which caused paste to be pumped into their mouthes.  All 5 girls were chugging and chugging paste as it enters their mouthes, causing them to grow and grow and grow much cosmically bigger than before.  Their bellies, bottoms, and busts grew tremendously large, round, and soft and jiggly with adipose, and their intense eating caused their blobby bodies to shake intensely like a water bed if it's filled with blubber and was several galaxies large.  As the contestants grew, the house grew more spaceous to accomodate the growing girls' sizes.  Mia Lin could feel entire galaxies worth of food and fat enter and pass through her maw, which reassures her that she would be the cutest girl in her universe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the 30 minutes were done, the machine stopped pumping paste into the 5 massiver beings, indicating that the contest was over.  The girls and mother removed the tubes from their mouthes and measured each other to find out who the winner was.  Unsurprisingly, Zena grew the largest as her size was now 48000 galaxies large. Mia Lin was at 2nd place with a size of 4800 galaxies.  Lora was at 3rd place with a size of 2400 galaxies, Trini was at 4th place at a size of 1200 galaxies, and Amy was last at a size of 480 galaxies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, we ate so much and grew so big, yet even the baby is bigger than me.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so huge and cute...\" Mia Lin said as she jiggled her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good contest, Lora. Now let's go to bed.\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mommy, we grew so big.  Wouldn't everyone else at Obesus be mad or jealous of us?\" Lora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, sweetie.  I'm sure everyone else will catch up to us.  Now you girls go to bed while I help Trini get into her crib.\" Zena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin, Amy, and, Lora then traveled to Lora's room as Zena rocked Trini to sleep.  The girls went to their beds and prepared themselves for sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lora.  Your mom's pretty nice.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. She always looks after me and Trini and wants us to be happy and grow as big as possible.\" Lora responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd better check up on my mommy soon.  I bet she's worried about me right now.</i> Mia Lin thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three cosmically massive girls then went to sleep for tommorow.  The girls then woke up in the morning, and they decided to go to:</span></div></div>",

She didn't have a whole lot to do in her motorized wheelchair, so she picked up new, or should I say modified, her existing hobbies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TV always had some daytime game show on and she got really good at guessing the answers or solving the puzzles. Her favorite game was actually the Price is Right. She got very good at guessing prices, and her family was pleased that she was developing math skills. When she got really bored, she entertained herself with cartoons. That took the lion's share of her day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer family would come in and talk to her throughout the day, asking her if she needed anything. Somehow, they always ended up fetching her food. Besides TV, that is what she decided to do: eat. Mia loved eating after all. The day after her accident, she found out about a very interesting meal called the Manchu Han Imperial Feast. The feast features 108 dishes from China, spanning two dynasties. Ever since she found out about it, she wanted to eat an entire feast by herself, so she worked to reach her goal. Her doting family was happy to oblige her on her quest. They would not know about the gigantic meal she had planned until she felt ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n108 dishes. It almost didn't matter what they were. She was fascinated because it was a really big number...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she pushed the limits of her appetite. She ate when she didn't even feel the slightest bit hungry. Even now, she was consuming a portion of pork lo mein that could feed an entire family, and an order of almond chicken, for dinner. She had eaten only a while ago, and was battling a protesting stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say her family was somewhat surprised and encouraging at the table. \"Looks like that broken leg helped you finally get a good appetite, Mia. You look comfortable in there,\" her grandma commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin smiled at her nana and kept plowing away. Her constant eating had gotten her to appreciate table manners more, so she wasn't nearly as messy as other small children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No kidding,\" said the father. \"She's definitely gotten heavier since the first time I put her in that chair. I feel the difference every morning, lifting her out of bed and into that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one asked you to <b>lift</b> her into the chair,\" her mom chided. \"We know you like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father looked incredulous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner came to an end with Mia Lin getting the clean plate award: A terribly aching belly. Mia Lin complained that she wanted to sleep. Her father came to the rescue, basically carrying her up to her bedroom. He half-heartedly pleaded with her not too pack on too many pounds while he had to do this. Mia, being sympathetic, kissed her daddy.  \"I'll try,\" she lied. She was a sweet kid, but she lived to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother \"problem\" with Mia having a broken leg and a reason to practice eating was that she gained a lot of weight in all the wrong places, and her whole figure ballooned out of her clothes. Whatever she wore fit rather poorly. She hadn't torn anything, thank god, but she was well on her way--and everything was harder to fit--and they couldn't take her to the clothing stores in her condition. So she lounged around in sweatpants and sweatshirts most of the time. These were her most elastic clothes. Her belly still surged past the limits of her tops after a good meal, proudly displaying three or so inches of yellow midriff. Laden heavy with food. Her nighties didn't fare much better: they looked ridiculous buttoned up, but at least it was still possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind serving dessert in bed if you want it,\" he said. Even with his complaints, he wouldn't deny his little princess while she was convalescing. \"I'll come back up and give it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tempting, but Mia Lin had to assess her needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will the father do next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly was able to touch the floor easily, her butt was rounder than before, and she was begining to form breasts from being so fat.  Her clothes were also beginning to be tighter, and her shirt was unable to cover her belly, but Mia Lin didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My belly's so big!\" Mia Lin said, \"I must be even cuter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin went back to the upstairs bathroom to measure her weight.  She found that it became a bit more difficult to climb the stairs every time she grew fatter.  When she stepped on the scale in the bathroom, Mia Lin could barely see the number as it was obsecured by her belly.  However she could faintly see the number 167 over her large tummy.  Mia Lin was happy to know that she became 167 pounds, more than 4 times the weight a girl her age, and rubbed her large belly in celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin went back downstairs to watch some television.  The channel was currently Nick Jr., and the show Mia Lin watched was Ni Hao Kai-Lan.  Mia Lin liked to watch Ni Hao Kai-Lan since the show, along with her mother, helped her learn Chinese.  As Mia Lin watched TV, she wondered if Kai-Lan would be cuter at 167 pounds like her current weight.  Mia Lin imagined how Kai-Lan would appear with a <a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://animexpansion.com/forums/uploads/1330418615/gallery_1_645_47106.png\">belly as big her's</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://animexpansion.com/forums/uploads/1330418615/gallery_1_645_47106.png\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> and then went back to watching the show.

Mia Lin's mom hae made her a very big breakfast, and Mia Lin ate so much food that she gained 10 more pounds, bringing her weight up to 177 pounds.  Mia Lin went back to watching TV and playing with her large belly until the doorbell rang.  Mia Lin then waddled over to the door, opened, it and got surprised to see who it was.  It was Amy, who was carrying a bag full of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Mia!  How have you been?\" Amy greeted, \"Woah! You're belly got so big and fat since the last time I saw you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Amy.  I've been eating a bunch to make me even more cuter, and I think it's working,\" Mia Lin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, let's go to your room and play with your belly.  I got something to show you,\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come on in!\" Mia Lin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then went inside Mia Lin's house, dragging the full bag behind her.  Mia Lin's mom saw Mia Lin with Amy, and Amy greeted Mia Lin's mom and talked for a bit.  Mia Lin and Amy then went inside Mia Lin's bedroom, and they started to play with each other.  Mia Lin sat down, letting her belly spread on the floor in front of her, and Amy started to knead Mia Lin's belly with her hands.  Mia Lin was at bliss when Amy was massaging her belly, while Amy was surprised that her friend's big belly was so soft and jiggly even at that size.  Amy even placed the side of her head on Mia Lin's belly, pretending that someone was trapped Mia Lin's stomach and was screaming to get out.  Mia Lin and Amy laughed at that joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia Lin, your belly is super fun now that's it's big as a kick ball!\"  Amy exclained, \"The rest of your body also grown bigger, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I think my face is becoming soft and squishy too,\" Mia Lin said as she pressed her hands onto the cheeks on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that, and your butt and chest is also bigger,\" Amy explained, \"I bet Miss Teacher will think you're super cute now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want to go to daycare looking ike this,\" Mia Lin said somberly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?  I didn't see you this sad about your size before,\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only one person at daycare will hate me more at daycare,\" Mia Lin explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, Roxanne?\" Amy asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm scared that she'll call me bad words if she sees me like this,\" Mia Lin explained some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, it's just Roxanne.  She's always mean.  You can't let her words get to you!  She isn't throwing sticks and stones at you.  Just ignore her!\" Amy motivated Mia Lin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're right, Amy,\" Mia Lin perked up, \"So what if Roxanne says bad stuff about me for being bigger?  I bet she is just jealous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then bursted into laughter, confusing Mia Lin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy? What are you laughing about? I didn't tell a joke yet,\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a joke?  But you already said one!  Hahaha!\" Amy exclaimed, \"Roxanne being jealous?  Imagine Roxanne, after calling you names and bad stuff for being fat, looking as big as you and wanting to be bigger!   She would look very silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia Lin then imagined Roxanne as fat and wide as her, with a giant belly bulging out of her dress.  Mia Lin then bursted into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahaha!  You're right, Amy!\" Mia Lin said, \"Mean old Roxanne would never think to look as cute as me in forever! Hahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls soon ended their hearty laughter together, and Amy remembered something important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Mia! I forgot something,\" Amy said, \"It's in my bag I brought and it will help you get bigger and cuter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what is it?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy zipped open her bag, and revealed to Mia Lin:</span></div></div>",

The label of the can says \"Weight-Gainerol\", and there was a before and after image of a really skinny man becoming a normal looking man, and a sign that said \"CHOCOLATE FLAVOR! GUARANTEED IT WILL WORK! NO SIDE EFFECTS!\".  Mia Lin was confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weight-Gainerol? Is this something you eat?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard this is a weight gain sup-la-ment,\" Amy explained, \"It's something very skinny people eat to become normal weight, but I bet this can make fat people become fatter.  I just found a whole bunch of these cans in my closet, so I thought I could use it on you to make you grow bigger much faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does this work? I don't think all of this can can make me even bigger,\" Mia Lin continued to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it makes you more hungrier,\" Amy exlplained more, \"but this can is super heavy, so I also think that this stuff is made of the stuff in junk food that makes you fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's open the can to see what's inside!\" Mia Lin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then removed the plastic top and tore off the foil cover.  Inside, the girls see grayish-brown powder that filled up the entire can and a spoon that measures out one serving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's powder? But eating powder is hard to do!\" Mia Lin exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you have to mix this in water or milk and then drink it like with powdered chocolate milk and milk,\" Amy explains, \"The can says that you must drink one serving in a glass of water per day to easily gain weight, but I want to see you eat all of this so you can grow bigger and fatter very quickly.

Mia Lin scarfed down the cookies and cakes as Amy pushes them into Mia Lin's maw, and Mia Lin swallows them with ease.  The cookies and cake were instantly digested and turned into body fat as soon as they landed in her stomach, a side effect of the weight gain powder.  Mia Lin continued to eat all the food handed to her until they were all gone.  When Mia Lin ate the last cookie and cake, she was much fatter than before.  She easily gained 20 pounds, making her weight now at around 370 pounds, despite there being only 10 pounds of snacks.  Another side effect of the powder, perhaps.

Amy was impressed by Mia Lin's speed. One by one, Mia Lin left empty chip bags on the floor, and she isn't showing any signs of stopping yet.  Amy also saw that Mia Lin's belly was growing bigger and rounder as she ate.  Amy wanted to squeeze and play with Mia Lin's belly, but she feared that would interrupt Mia Lin's binge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mia Lin finished all the chips and rinds, she went to the jerky next. She grabbed all the jerky, opened them out of the wrappers, took a handful of opened jerky, and bit into the jerky as much as she can.  Mia Lin adored the flavor of the smoked, dried meat, and she continued to chomp her way through the jerky at a relatively fast rate.  Amy was still impressed by Mia Lin.  Normally, beef jerky was tough to bite through, but Mia Lin was able to chew through it as if it was made of cotton candy.  After Mia Lin finished all the jerky, Amy took note at how big Mia Lin got.  Mia Lin must have grown at least 15 pounds from all the chips and jerky, bringing her weight up to 192 pounds.  However, after all the jerky was finished, Mia Lin suddenly stopped eating.  Mia Lin still has the candy, cakes, and soda to finish the entire bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Amy?\" Mia Lin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mia?\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you:</span></div></div>",

When they saw their mothers, they ran over as fast as they could and latched onto their legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" Mia-Lin said, loking up at her mother. \"Is it okay if Amy comes over for supper tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Mia-Lin's mother said, \"As long as it's okay with Amy's mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy had already asked her mother if she could go over to Mia-Lin's house for supper, and her mother now said \"Sure, it's alright with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's and Mia-Lin's mothers had known each other since their daughters had started coming to daycare, and were friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What time should I have her ready to go?\" Mia-Lin's mother asked Amy's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does 20:30 sound?\" Amy's mother said after a moment of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That should be fine. She doesn't have any allergies, does she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, she should be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I'll have her ready at 20:30, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Thanks for taking her off my hands for a while, I'll be sure to return the favor sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem at all, really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin said \"Thanks for letting Amy come over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's mother smiled and said, \"No problem, Mia-Lin! I know how you two like to play together. See you later, Amy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye, Mommy! See you later!\" Amy said, hugging her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now,\" Mia-Lin's mother said. \"Shall we go home? You two look hungry for a snack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we're really hungry, Mommy!\" Mia-Lin said. \"Can we get some Wendy's on the way home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Mia-Lin's mother said, walking out the door, towards her car, by which Amy's mother had placed Amy's booster seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gonna be good,\" Mia-Lin said to Amy. \"Make sure to order twice as much as you usually do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be sure to,\" said Amy, thinking of the big belly she was gonna have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the Wendy's drive-up, as per Mia-Lin and Amy's request, Mia-Lin's mother ordered 4 Frostees, 4 Baconators, 4 Large French Fries, and 4 5-piece Chicken Nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home, the girls started on their Frostees and chicken nuggets. As they ate, Amy said, \"We've each got a lot of food, Mia-Lin. I'm not sure I'll be able to finish it all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Mia-Lin said, starting on her second pack of chicken nuggets, \"I'll eat whatever you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got home, Mia-Lin had eaten most of her first Frostee and all of her chicken nuggets, and Amy was starting on her second pack of chicken nuggets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls carried their food inside, sat down on the living room couch, and turned on the TV before continuing their \"snack\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin started eating her Baconator next, finishing it about the time Amy started in on hers. Amy was a little full already, but she knew she had to keep eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mia-Lin started in on her fries and second Frostee, Amy slowly but surely finished her Baconator, finishing feeling almost totally stuffed. She slowly spooned her second Frostee into her mouth, watching as Mia-Lin finished her second pack of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm stuffed, Mia-Lin,\" Amy said, patting her swollen stomach, \"You can have my fries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, thanks, Amy!\" Mia-Lin said eagerly accepting the golden treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin ate the last of the girls \"snack\" and gathered up the garbage, including Amy's now-empty Frostee cup, and went to the kitchen to throw it away. When she came back, she had a box of Twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Mia-Lin! Are you still hungry?\" Amy exclaimed, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not hungry, exactly, but I'm not totally full yet, either. Want a Twinkie?\" Mia-Lin said, munching on a Twinkie already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... sure, I'll take one,\" Amy said hesitantly. She ended up having 6 Twinkies, half the box, each time saying, \"This is my last one, I swear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Twinkies, though, was apparently not enough for Mia-Lin, as she returned to the kitchen, and once again brought out a box of Twinkies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, when offered, declined to take another, but simply sat and watched Mia-Lin eat every last Twinkie in the box, her belly beginning to bulge out from underneath her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Mia-Lin got up once again to throw the trash away, Amy feared what she might bring back this time. But Mia-Lin was apparently satisfied, for she returned empty-handed, and sat down next to Amy on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls rested and digested in front of the TV for the next few hours, becoming increasingly eager to eat supper as time ticked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a coincidental turn of events, Mia-Lin's mother had decided to prepare some traditional Chinese cuisine for supper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin and Amy gorged themselves on fried rice, dumplings, sweet-and-sour pork, sweet-and-sour beef, sweet-and-sour chicken, and crab rangoon, taking heaping helpings of everything, and tall glasses of whole milk to wash everything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they were done, both girls were utterly stuffed, barely able to waddle back to the couch. As they sat down, Mia-Lin unbuttoned her shorts, letting her bulging belly out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good supper, don't you think, Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very good. Your mom's an excellent cook, Mia-Lin.\" Amy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I'm lucky to have her,\" Mia-Lin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I got to eat your mom's cooking all the time, I'd look like you in no time!\" Amy grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin laughed and said, \"That's probably true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only an hour and a half until my mom gets here,\" Amy said a bit sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Mia-Lin. \"Let's be sure not to waste it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna watch a movie?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it,\" Mia-Lin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the girls rested and digested, Amy stuffed like never before, and looking forward to it once again.</span></div></div>",

We just had a huge dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did't answer my question. Are you hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not... really... i think... but i'm not full. I could... eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. We need to let you eat a bit more every day. A bit more then you can. This way your stomach can slowly stretch out and hold more food. Trust me this is the right way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then. I guess.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin put the movie they were watching on pause and walked to the kitchen and returned with two big bags of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think fast.\" She said while she threw one bag at Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A whole bag of chips. If i eat all this i will pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you won't. Trust me. You need to keep eating. If you finish the whole bag you can stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the play button and ripped open her own bag and started to eat hand fulls stuffing them in her tiny mouth.<br>\r\nAmy slowly started on her chips wondering where her friend was keeping it all. She looked at Mia-Lin's  belly that was slowly starting to peek out under her shirt. I looked so soft and comfortable. She also wanted one and this gave her the strength to eat faster. She was able to finish half the bag before she started to feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i'm full now but i need to eat more to get fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed more and more chips in her mouth. Chewing was now problem but swallowing was getting hard. She tried to focus on the movie but her belly started to hurt from all the extra food. It made gurgling noises in protest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just need to finish this bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked for a bit more room in her over loaded stomach that hurt now even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How faster i'm done how better.\" Amy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to eat faster. It hurt but she kept going. She wanted also a big belly.<br>\r\nShe felt like she would pop after eating the last chips in the bag. <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"I don't feel so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's normal in the beginning. But after some time your body will get used to hold more food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there also other things that help you to gain weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell. Les exercise. Stop running and climbing all the time and stop smoking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't smoke! I'm just a toddler!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... right. Oh if you eat snacks be sure they're high fat. Butter, chocolate, chips, junk food, Chinese. The best fattening foods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From my grand mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She wanted you to be fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she wanted a thin, fit grandchild. She told me ways to lose weight. But if one way let you lose weight the opposite way will let you gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... makes... sense. But you did't lose any weight. How did you grandmother react?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too happy. We only see her at birthdays from family members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's horrible having a grand mother that hates you.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Oh well that's my fathers mother. My mothers mother and i can get along very well. She also stuffs me with food. She always said: A big belly is a happy belly. A thin belly is just a cry for help.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then my belly will be very happy soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and then we can gain together. That sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the heard someone at the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I guess my mother is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment Amy's mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Amy! Are you ready to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" Amy said a bit sad. \"See you tomorrow Mia-Lin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. see you tomorrow.\"   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You must feel sick to your stomach! (Although Amy looked fine) Oh well you don't look to be in pain i guess i will let you get big, but not too big ok.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy giggled with joy and she asked her mother: \"So how about let's go to McDonald's to start they have real fattening food there so I can big quickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her Mom said: \"Okay.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they drove off to Mcdonald's. Amy ordered 8 Double Quarter Pounders, 5 Big Macs, 10 Double Cheese Burgers, and Several Super-Size Fries along with a large drink. <br>\r\nAmy's mom brought the huge meal to the table and then Amy began her monsterous gourge fest. She devoured the food at a breakneck pace each crumb sliding into her slowly expanding belly, barely bothering to chew and often swallowing whole. It was a long 30 minutes before she was finally done, Amy's belly was extremely bloated and full. She moaned in pain and thought: \"Ohh man, I ate too much, maybe I should take this at a slower pace, but my belly's getting bigger and I'm doing what Mia-Lin advised, keep stuffing myself past my previous limit. My belly will stretch to accomodate and therefore lead to a big soft stomach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's Mother noticed her daughter Was in pain so she asked her daughter: \"See this is why I was objectionable at first!

The sky was gray and it looked cold and wet and it would probably rain today. Mia-Lin hated bad weather. She liked the sun more. When it shined on her yellow skin it looked like gold. At least that's what she thought it looked like.<br>\r\nStill in her pajamas she went down. She waddled into the kitchen and took a box of cookies. She took it over too the T.V and turned it on. Fast she started to eat the cookies. <br>\r\nShe knew her mother would come down soon and her mother had't much trouble with Mia-Lin's weight but she knew that her mother would't like it if she ate cookies before breakfast. After the box was empty she fold it flat and tucked it deep in the trash can. <br>\r\nFive minutes later her mother came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia-Lin. You need to go too daycare today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So please get up and get dressed. I will make you some breakfast. How does a cheese omelet sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yummy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin waddled as fast if her chubby legs could carry her up to her room. She opened her closet and looked through her clothes and pulled out some jeans and a pink jumper. When she tried to put on her jeans she noticed they were awfully tight around her belly. She need all her strength to button them. Also the pink jumper was tight on her and it did't totally cover her belly. You could see a stroke of yellow flesh. She  tried to pull the jumper down but not too avail. Her jumper would't stay down. She decided too leave it this way. She wasn't planning too going outside and it was pretty warm at daycare. And if she did went outside she would wear a jacket.<br>\r\nFast she went back down. Her mother was busy baking a large omelet with about five eggs. when he was done she shove it on a toast and put another toast on top of it. Just like her daughter liked it. Mia-Lin happily ate her breakfast. Of course two toasts with omelet were't enough for the hungry, Chinese toddler and after two bowls of cereal with sugar and two toasts covered heavy covered with chocolate spread. and three tall glasses of whole milk she was done. Mia-Lin only liked whole milk. Every other kind she found taste to much like water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right your done with breakfast? Can we go then? I have work to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin let out a small belch and nodded. They walked too the car and her mother tried to buckle her in her car seat but Mia-Lin's belly was just too big for the car seat that had fitted two weeks ago.<br>\r\nShe gave a light pat on her daughters belly and used the belt of a normal car seat for her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You outgrew you car seat honey.\" Her mother said while she got in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin was a bit playing with a doll she left a few days ago in the car and looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Chun-Name might have some old car seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChun-Name was the Aunt of Mia-Lin. She also had a chubby daughter two years older then Mia-Lin. When she outgrew her stuff Mia-Lin could have them. However many times her clothes were kind of tight on Mia-Lin while her niece had no problem back then wearing them.<br>\r\nMia-Lin was busy too comb the hair of the doll when she suddenly remembered she and Amy tried to also gave Amy a big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy can we get some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked at her in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be hungry. You just had breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's not for me. You see eh Amy wants also some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy also get's breakfast from her mother. So why do i need to buy her food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well we want some food at daycare \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get food at daycare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Yeah but Amy and i want some more. We also want some food before lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Honey you have a big belly and i'm sure you can wait until lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about Amy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy is not my child.

I got good news!\" Amy grinned as Mia-Lin sat next to her. Smiling in return, Mia-Lin looked over to Amy and pinched Amy in the side. \"Amy!

Good thing I didn't told her, or else she would be terrified!\" Amy laughed as she looked down at Mia-Lin's bulging shirt. \"You look larger yourself.

Isn't it locked, Mia?\" Amy inquired as both girls looked over to the snack bar where the kids received their daily snack. \"No one is there. Let's go!\" Mia-Lin whispered as both girls walked- err waddled; to the food bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their disappointment, the counter-tops were devoid of food. \"Awww. We've just had snack time fifteen minutes ago, but it looks like the janitor's cleaned up the spot.\" Amy whined.<br>\r\n \"Is the gate unlocked?\" Amy asked quizzically  as the Mia-Lin waddled to the side of the serving bar.<br>\r\n \"Nope,\" replied the Chinese girl as she budged against the stubborn gate, but to no avail. \"The gate is locked. Looks like we won't have food this time arou-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What do you kids think you're doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls turned in fright as one of the male caregivers, an adolescent in his mid-teens, walked in their direction. \"You kids better know that this is not snack time! Mia, you know the rules: One snack per day. You need to cut down on your food intake.\" Stopping ten feet before the children, the teenager sighed as he looked at Mia-Lin's nearly-exposed belly before his eyes settled on Amy's larger gut. \"My, Amy... Fine. Stuff yourselves if you like. Just don't tell anyone else both of you are allowed back here-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Both girls called jovially, though at a whisper. The teenage man merely shook his head as he unlocked the gate. \"If both of you- Hey- .... Fine! Eat away!\" The caregiver growled as Mia-Lin and Amy squeezed past the caregiver. Shaking his head, the teenager sighed quietly as he walked back to the play area to supervise a group of kids playing with Lego blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy! What'll we do?\" Mia squeaked with delight as she opened the mini-fridge door. Both girls' eyes widened at the contents inside. Six boxes of Oreo cookies and four gallons of grape juice were tightly packed within the fridge.<br>\r\n \"I dunno. I want to eat the cookies!\" Amy squealed as she nudged Mia-Lin's shoulder.

Dimples forming in her chubby cheeks, Mia-Lin grinned. \"Let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they were stranded within the wilderness for a week, Mia laid on her back as she poised the gallon-bottle above her mouth. The crispy, tangy flow of grape juice found its way to Mia's stomach as the indulging girl stuffed herself with the sugary beverage. Amy, on the other hand, was busy stuffing Oreo cookies into her mouth one after the other. <i>\"Burrrrrp!\"</i> Belched Mia as she tossed the empty grape juice bottle aside. Amy's eyes widened as Mia started to stuff Oreos into her mouth. \"M-Mia? How can you drink so much?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin's eyes twinkled above her juice-stained cheeks and lips. \"My mother makes sure I drink more than one glass of milk per day! Why, this morning, I drank three glasses of milk and had buttery toast! If you wanna be like me, you should drink whole milk! It's extra fattening!\" The sliver of gold skin expanded as Mia's shirt rolled up slightly when Mia shifted her weight. \"Eat Chinese food, Amy! It is delicious and fattening. Especially with loads of sauce...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls kept eating, Mia's shirt caused discomfort as the Chinese girl's growing blubber pressed the end of her shirt upwards, revealing a deep bellybutton along with more of the yellow flesh.

Mia-Lin's rolled up top, though covering her underdeveloped chest, struggled and failed to cover Mia's potbelly as the Chinese girl's girth pushed the lower-edge of the shirt to several inches above her bellybutton. Groaning this time, Mia's sore arms finally succeeded to propel the growing butterball to a sitting position as her potbelly nestled between two fat-laden thighs. As Mia  sat up in bed, the little girl's golden belly pushed out further as it formed a muffin-top around her waistline. The Chinese girl, of course, only giggled as she scooted off from the edge of her bed and onto the toy-littered floor before she caught a glimpse of herself in a nearby play-mirror. \"Wow,\" began Mia-Lin as she waddled over to the mirror- her muffin-top spilling over her outgrown shorts- before she took a closer look at herself in the mirror. \"I'm beautiful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia-Lin had always been chubby since birth, yet the level of stuffing in the past several months lent credit to the Chinese girl's dimpled-bowl cheeks which protected her jawline by providing warmth, plushness, and an odd aesthetic-beauty to the girl's cherubic face. Below, Mia-Lin could only giggle with her fingers inside of her mouth as she saw her \"bra-\"like shirt struggle against containing her thickening torso: In several months, at least, Mia would need a sports bra just to contain her fattening chest should she continue with eating tasty Chinese food, brownies, and other delicious stuff...<br>\r\n \"Oh, my tummy!\" Mia-Lin cried with joy as she stuck a sausage-like index finger through her deepening crease-lined bellybutton: What had once been a slight bulge on the girl's mid-section was now a mound-like potbelly which provided additional warmth, girth, and numerous love-handles made only to be tugged, stretched, folded, and teased to the delight of a little girl's belly-play! Even when standing up, Mia-Lin noticed, the sides of her obese torso were lined with fat rolls; as she lowered onto her pillow of blubber, Mia only squealed as she watched her sides crease up further. \"I'm so fluffy!\" Squeaked Mia-Lin as she dug her sausage-fingers deep into her love handles whilst on her belly. Her fat rolls only jiggled, bounced, and stretched in response to the obese girl's poking, prodding, and hugging of her own voluptuous form. Of course, these tickling sensations only gave Mia-Lin further reasons to massage her own girth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not quite as large as she wanted to be, Mia-Lin only bit her food-stained fingernails with glutton as she came to a conclusion whilst laying on the floor: She was an obese girl now. It was going to be a long way until Mia-Lin became immobile, but- for now, at least- the Chinese girl could play with as much blubber and such to her heart's desire: What a way to get back at her father's mother for wanting her to be thin!

Anh-Lin watched with a smile as she saw her little girl <i>inhale</i> vast quantities of rice, tofu-sausage, noodles, and soy sauce. The younger girl's stomach growled as this sudden influx of food found its way to her bloated tummy for later conversion into even more pillow-like fat rolls, love handles, and the beginnings of a proper chest. Looking down, Anh-Lin frowned as she saw her daughter's girth struggling to expand beyond her strained panties: It would do both justice if Anh purchased sarongs with elastic waistbands to give her not-so-little daughter plenty of room to grow into. Also, shirts were out of the question if Mia-Lin kept outgrowing them in Anh-Lin's desire to mother a morbidly-obese child: A swimsuit top or an elastic bra would help Mia-Lin cover up her chest whilst giving her golden stomach little resistance to expand, thereby reducing the strain of Anh-Lin's daughter's precious weight gain <b>and</b> giving Anh-Lin an abundant view of Mia's cherubic girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes or so, Mia-Lin burped as she surveyed the tabletop littered with empty plates. Her dimples deepened as the chunky girl grinned. \"I finished!\" Rubbing her bare tummy with soy-covered sausage-like fingers, the fat little girl's double chin folded out nicely as she looked down and grinned even wider at her beautiful frame. Anh-Lin only smiled as she moved to pick up her growing lard-ball of a daughter before she brought Anh-Lin into the living room, all while the little girl bounced her fat rolls with joy as each segment of flab tickled her body.</span></div></div>",

Anh-Lin, whom sat on the quilt-layered sofa, could not help but grin at her daughter as she watched the Chinese child's visceral fat rise and fall with each breath from the child's body; Mia's thickened thighs and rump were slowly oozing through her panties as the golden flesh struggled against what were Mia's last set of outgrown clothes, and her fat-ringed arms were gradually tearing apart the seams of the jumper's short sleeves so as to accommodate more cloud-like blubber. Though Mia's clothes were far too small to facilitate further growth, the Chinese mother was quite pleased with the morning's stuffing and its latent consequences of bloating up Mia-Lin for the day....<br>\r\n Glancing at a red-rimmed clock, Anh-Lin's heart sank as she read the time. <i>Ten o'clock! I had better get Mia-Lin ready for her play date!</i> Taking another look at Mia's extended undergarments, Anh sighed as she stood for the main corridor; Mia-Lin was going to have to wear one of her mommy's bras and a pair of mid-thigh shorts, for all clothes within the child's closet were of absolutely no use to the obese girl. Steadily, Anh-Lin began to rummage through her drawers before she withdrew an older pair of shorts and a plain white sports bra: The shorts would be perfect for reaching down to Mia-Lin's knees whilst the sports bra would help to cover up the child's thickening chest and allow for her prodigious stomach to expand at will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes after she was dressed by her mother, Mia-Lin waddled down the steps of the house as her protruding belly hang over the button &amp; zipper of her mother's shorts; one hundred and thirty pounds of little girl blubber vibrated, shook, and oozed as the child struggled into her seat with the assistance of Anh-Lin; thereafter, the mother entered the driver's seat and started up the vehicle as she pulled out of the driveway to reach Amy's home.</span></div></div>",

So Ahn-Lin cooked more, and Mia-Lin ate more, meaning Ahn-Lin had to cook more, and the vicious circle of Mia-Lin's growth turned faster and faster. Now, six weeks later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunchtime, dear!\" called Ahn-Lin, giving the fried rice in the wok one final stir. From the living room, she heard a series of huffs, then a dull <b>thump</b> of Mia-Lin's bulk hitting the floor. Then, shuffling, and a good deal more huffing and wheezing until the absolutely enormous Mia-Lin waddled into the kitchen, drenched in sweat from just the short walk from the living room- and still eating chips. In just a month and a half, the enormous Chinese girl managed to nearly double her weight, from 130 pounds to an absolutely whopping 209. 79 pounds in just 42 days, which looks impossible until you understand how much Mia-Lin was eating. In fact, the only time she wasn't eating was when she was asleep, and even then she still needed occasional snacks throughout the night. She now wore exclusively crop-tops and shorts, as there was no shirt in the world that could stand up to her exponentially expanding belly- and even those clothes she frequently outgrew. Upon smelling the fried rice, her belly, stuffed though it was, let out a hungry groan. Mia-Lin winced, rubbed it soothingly, and just managed to heave herself onto the kitchen chair. Ahn-Lin, smiling, ladled rice into a bowl, leaving Mia to attack it with the biggest spoon in the house. <i>How large can I make her?</i> Ahn-Lin wondered, looking at her daughter's enormous belly, pressing into the top of the table. <i>500 pounds? 1000? More, even?</i> She was startled out of her reverie by Mie-Lin's spoon clanking against the bottom of the bowl. Hurriedly, more rice was added from the wok, but at this rate all the rice in the wok didn't quite look like enough. Ahn-Lin began cooking some noodles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day..</span></div></div>",

Just turned five, she was due her routine pediatric check-up, to ensure she was developing properly and whatnot. Normal, normal, everything looked normal - though he shook his head slightly as he spotted her BMI - 29! Nearly obese, and still so young. Ah well - he recalled speaking to the girl's mother about improving her diet at their last appointment, so with any luck she'd have shed those excess pounds by now.<br>\r\nHe heard a knock at the door, and the faint sound of heavy breathing. Ah, this must be Mia-Lin now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" He called.<br>\r\nDr. Turnbull considered himself a professional man. It took a lot to make him drop his manner of an austere, traditional doctor - but as the door was pulled open, his mouth dropped wide open, and it was all he could do to contain a gasp, his spectacled eyes bulging wide as they struggled to take in the sight before him.<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Doctor.\" Ahn-Lin greeted him, giving her massive daughter a light push on the back to prompt her forwards. Mia-Lin waddled forwards with some difficulty, and with significant help from her mother, climbed up onto the adult-sized chair at the side of the room and settled down. Walking was difficult for her nowadays, and she tried to avoid it whenever possible - just the short trip into the building from the car outside had left her wheezing and panting, thick thighs rubbing together with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a hold of himself, Dr. Turnbull's mouth snapped shut, and he turned to his screen so as not to stare at his patient.<br>\r\n\"Good, ah, good morning. Nice, ah, nice weather we're having.\" He blathered, trying buy time to collect himself. How?! This couldn't possibly be the same girl, could it?<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose it is.\" Ahn-Lin replied, glancing out the window. \"Are you alright doctor?\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, fine, yes.\" He said, steeling himself this time before turning to face them. \"So, ah... this is Mia-Lin?\" He queried, praying that it wasn't.<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" Ahn-Lin answered. \"For the pediatric check-up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Turnbull chanced another glance at his patient. She wore a straining crop-top over her bulging chest, the undersized garment leaving her entire stomach uncovered to sag over the waistband of her immodestly-short shorts. He wiped his brow in dismay.<br>\r\n\"Yes, the check-up. Well, ah - we'll start with height. Could you please stand against the wall here, Mia-Lin?\" The young girl looked dismayed. She was still out of breath and sweating from the short walk inside, and now he was asking her to stand again! Reluctantly, she let her mom shoo her over to stand against the wall and be measured. The paint was cool against her back as Dr. Turnbull checked her height.<br>\r\n\"3'5.\" He muttered to himself. \"That's... that's normal. Now, ah, could you please stand on the... on the scale just here. We need to find out how much you weigh.\" <br>\r\nGrumbling to herself, Mia-Lin waddled to the scale and stepped on. She leaned over, trying to see the number - but her bulging midriff was far too large to see around. Dr. Turnbull had sat back down in his chair, dismayed.<br>\r\n\"That's... 210lbs.\" He spoke softly to himself. \"Not... not normal. Not at all.\" He punched a couple of numbers into his computer, then turned to Ahn-Lin. \"Ah, your child - are you aware she's... overweight?\" He asked Mia-Lin's mother tentatively.</span></div></div>",

And she was feeling it now, at the ridiculous notion that her daughter- her perfect, beautiful, lovely Mia-Lin- was <i>overweight</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you suggest that?\" she cried, staring daggers into the doctor's eyes. \"How dare you say that my amazing little girl is overweight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I didn't mean anything, it's just-\" stammered Dr. Turnbull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't mean anything?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mia-Lin hadn't been paying much attention to her mother's increasingly raised voice, or to the doctor's frustrated protestations. Instead, she had been (as usual) thinking about food - or rather, about how she hadn't had any in nearly half an hour, and how she was beginning to feel rather empty. She thrust a hand into the pocket of her shorts, thick little fingers rooting around until they came across a wrapped chocolate, which she pulled out and examined. It was sticky and very squashed, mostly melted from the heat of her body - but that didn't faze her in the slightest. She tore off the foil wrapper and shoved it into her mouth, barely even chewing before swallowing, sending the candy to join the mass of food she'd already eaten that day in her oversized stomach. Delicious! But it didn't even put a dent in her appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped her chocolate-stained fingers on her shorts, adding a fresh smear to the assortment of sweat and food stains they had already acquired, then thrust them back into her pockets. However, after rooting around for a while she found... nothing. She pouted. Mia-Lin wasn't used to this feeling - even at school they let her eat snacks, but now a deep, hungry rumble emitted from her bloated body. She looked over at her mother, who was shouting something about Chairman Mao - normal behaviour for when she was drunk, but rare when she was sober - and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm hungry.\" She whined, cutting Ahn-Lin off before she could launch herself into anything too brutal. \"Can we stop at a McDonald's before we go clothes shopping?\" Ridiculous as it might seem, the top and shorts Mia-Lin was wearing right then were actually the best-fitting she owned, so a shopping trip had been overdue now for some time. To avoid unnecessary exercise, her mom had decided to do it on the same day as Mia-Lin's appointment.<br>\r\nAhn-Lin immediately forgot about Dr. Turnbull and instead rushed over to her daughter, pulling a bag of candies from her handbag and thrusting them into her daughter's sticky hands before she could say another word.<br>\r\n\"Oh, of course we can darling.\" She gushed, smiling happily as the pampered girl stuffed candies into her mouth at record pace. \"Although I was planning to get takeaway this evening anyway. Never mind, we'll just do both!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Dr. Turnbull tried to take back the initiative.<br>\r\n\"Miss, I think junk food is the <i>last</i> thing your daughter needs any more of. Her BMI is literally off the charts, she's-\" at this, Ahn-Lin turned to face him, fire flashing in her eyes, and the doctor lost his nerve, \"-ah, very healthy-looking. Can we just... can we just finish the examination?\" He almost begged her.<br>\r\n\"Hmmph. Fine.\" Ahn-Lin deigned to agree, giving Mia-Lin's belly a last gentle pat before gesturing for him to continue with the check-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Dr. Turnbull proceeded with the most depressing pediatric examination of his career - and given he'd been in the medical profession for approaching 40 years, that was no mean feat. To begin, he rather resignedly asked Ahn-Lin whether her daughter was getting the recommended hour minimum of exercise a day. The look on her face dissuaded him from continuing on that track, and so he hastily skipped the dietary and other lifestyle questions and moved on at once to the physical examination. After her mom helped Mia-Lin shed her tank top, he pressed the thermometer to the young girl's flabby chest and listened, intently, to her breathing. Strained, wheezing, still out of breath from having to stand upright on the scales - it was a mess. But the look Ahn-Lin shot him dissuaded him from making comment. He listened to her heartbeat - again, far too fast, far too irregular, and not a word slipped from his lips about it. He was a professional - but this woman, a full foot shorter than him though she was, had rattled him to his core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking the five year old's blood pressure (the pressure cuff barely fitting around her meaty upper arm) and finding it higher than his own and still making no remark, he was beginning to question his own professional integrity. He had to try and intervene - but what could he do? This woman was obviously going to ignore every word he said against her daughter, but he couldn't just stand by and do nothing. He looked at Mia-Lin, watching as the last of the candies disappeared into her distended stomach. He stared at the great bulge of flab that was her belly resting between her spread thighs, at the flabby folds of her chest heaving as she gasped for breath between mouthfuls of sugar, at her thick arm jiggling as she scratched beneath a sweaty fold on her side.<br>\r\nAnd he decided to...</span></div></div>",

A bag of half-melted chocolates, while enough to make any normal-sized girl sick to her stomach, was barely anything for the massive Mia-Lin. And Ahn-Lin knew it, which was why she was driving eighty in a sixty-mile-an-hour zone looking for any kind of fast food to stuff into her insatiable daughter. Unfortunately for the both of them, though, Mia-Lin's doctor was dead-center in the industrial district. The high factory chimneys, though awe-inspiring, did not produce any food, and it was quite a <i>large</i> industrial district. Propane- and plumbing supply stores flew by, mere streaks out the window of the speeding sedan. Not fast enough, though- Mia-Lin was starving, and she was not about to be quiet about it.

Her whole life she'd been allowed another serving of food if she asked nicely for it, never denied a snack or new toy she took a fancy to - however, the last six weeks of non-stop pampering had turned her from being a generally well-mannered (if slightly self-centred) young girl, into a full on brat. The slightest provocation would result in an ear-splitting tantrum, which would continue until either her screeching mouth was filled with food or she screamed herself hoarse. Even just being denied a snack could set her off - and so now, the gaping feeling of hunger wrenching at her belly, she was throwing the worst tantrum of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed, she cried, she flailed her thick limbs in every direction - but they were already driving considerably past the speed limit, and the little car just couldn't go any faster. That didn't matter to Mia-Lin though. She didn't care her mom was already driving as fast as she could, or that she'd already eaten two meals that day and it wasn't even 10 o'clock. She just knew that she wanted food - and what she wanted, she got. Soon, the noise was driving Ahn-Lin mad, the pervasive wail only faltering when Mia-Lin had to pause to gasp for breath. Terrifically unfit, even just kicking the back of the seat in front of her and waving her arms was tiring for the massive little girl and soon she was exhausted, wheezing loudly between every wail as sweat mixed with tears poured down her red face. This sound was even worse for Ahn-Lin, and the car soon broke 90 miles an hour as she searched desperately for any fast food place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she spotted a McDonald's the sound of sirens blared behind her, and Ahn-Lin's stomach lurched as she saw flashing blue lights in the rear mirror. Dismayed - not for herself, but for the added delay to getting food for Mia-Lin - she pulled over, and watched as a smartly uniformed police officer climbed from his patrol car and strode nonchalantly towards her window. <br>\r\nBefore he arrived, she glanced back at Mia-Lin in the back seat,  Fortunately the young girl had quietened down somewhat, apparently too out of breath to continue her tantrum - but Ahn-Lin knew she'd be back in full force in no time. Her poor little belly was half-empty, growling loudly even from beneath the thick inches of flab that clung to her midsection. She needed to deal with this quickly.<br>\r\nThe officer reached the car window, and she wound it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am.\" He began. \"Do you know how fast you were going?\"<br>\r\nAhn-Lin did her very best to look innocent.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not, officer. Not over the speed limit I hope?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm afraid we have you clocked going 90. In a 60 zone.\" He looked at her reprovingly. \"That's very dangerous you know. Breaking the speed limit is...\" before he could go any further, however, he glanced into the back of the car and spotted the heap of heaving flesh that was Mia-Lin, and he trailed off. Ahn-Lin seized the advantage.<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong, officer?\" She asked, looking at him enquiringly. He turned back to face her, eyes wide.<br>\r\n\"The girl - is she... is she alright?\" His tone was hushed, and suddenly Ahn-Lin had an idea.<br>\r\n\"Ah - no officer, I'm afraid she's not. That's why I was speeding actually - she's very ill, and I'm afraid if I don't get to the hospital soon she might not- well, she might not make it.\" She dabbed at her eyes with a napkin, looking as melancholy as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe policeman was young, and too inexperienced to catch the trick. It helped that Mia-Lin did look very convincingly ill, her wheezing breathing and tears not yet dry on her cheeks fooling him completely. He stepped back.<br>\r\n\"I see, ma'am. Well, I suppose I can make an exception just this once - but remember, speeding is dangerous and-\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you so much, officer.\" Ahn-Lin cried, winding the window back up before he'd even finished talking. Not even waiting for him to walk away, she started the ignition and sped away in a screech of burnt rubber. Time to get some food!</span></div></div>",

Even in a district this large, everybody knew somebody and somebody knew everybody, so talk was cheap- just like the food. As the only restaurant for miles, business politics stayed away- and competitors and comrades shared fries at the same table. Thus it was very rarely quiet and nearly always loud. But, as the door swung open, the restaurant, as one, fell silent. And it was not hard to see why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to enter the restaurant was Mia-Lin's quivering mass of belly, followed by the rest of the skimpily clad, loudly wailing, four-year-old Chinese girl, jiggling wildly with each ponderous step. None of the workers had seen anybody like her. Following her was Ahn-Lin, fumbling for her wallet in her cavernous purse. Unperturbed by the roving eyes of the riveters, she marched (really waddled) her morbidly obese charge up to the dumbfounded cashier. She stared him down, and, with a quick pat on her exhausted daughter's sweaty head, she said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of everything, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cashier's jaw dropped. A rapid buzz of whispers flew through the assembled workers like flies through a meadow. Mia-Lin, hearing some talk of food, immediately quieted down. As the shocked cashier shakily attempted to total that number, Ahn-Lin, pleased with the crowd's reaction, said: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make that two of everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, with a smug smile on her face, she guided her enormous girl to an unoccupied table, leaving the workers to whisper and gossip. </span></div></div>",

It eventually became her just shoving food into her mouth rapidly, only breaking to drink from one of her many shakes or drinks.<br>\r\nIt caused a few people to even up and leave in disgust, but Ahn-lin and Mia-lin didn't care. They enjoyed the attention they raised, even if it was contraversial. Who were they to tell them how to live their lives?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, hearty meal, Mia-lin had eaten all of the food. She laid down, patting her engorged belly which had rode her shirt up far past the breaking point, but was still managing to hold on by threads. Her short shorts hid barely anything, her bloated butt on full display for anyone who dared look.<br>\r\nShe belched, and patted her belly, \"That was delicious, Mommy, can we have more?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, honey, I think we've spent enough time here. But don't worry, when we get home, I have a big cake waiting there, just for you.\" Ahn-lin stated.<br>\r\nThe Employees took a collective sigh of relief, as they watched Mia-lin waddle her big gut out the door. She came out managing to be even fatter than she was when she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhn-lin kept true to that promise, and when they opened the door a giant cake was waiting for Mia-lin on the table. She smiled, and went up and began to devour it whole. She ripped out chunks of icing-covered cake, chowing down on it from the outside-in.<br>\r\n\"Heheh, that's my girl. Eat up!\" Ahn-lin stated, as she prepared tomorrow's next big meal.</span></div></div>",

This was by far the most food the young Chinese girl had ever eaten in a single day, and it showed. Her overstretched shirt and tightly-packed shorts had both succumbed to her flab, and were now little more than bright-colored scraps adorning the enormous girl's vast expanse. And vast it was. Her belly, normally an apron of flab cascading over the waistband of whatever poor pair of pants she happened to be wearing and flopping about by her chubby thighs, was now a taut sphere, poking far out from her body and pressing deeply into the table. A trail of crumbs and chocolate led from the tip where it pressed into the table upwards, over her chins, and into her mouth, where all the cake had eventually ended up. Stuffed as she was, she could do little more than huff in place and moan from the pain of being stuffed to her absolute maximum. Ahn-Lin, meanwhile, was enjoying this immensely. She had filled her daughter with calories beyond count, and it showed for sure. As she helped her massive daughter to bed, she realized, quite happily, that though this was the biggest meal Mia-Lin had ever eaten, it would probably also be smaller than anything she'd eat in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was contained within a glass bowl of the kind normally used for salads, and was made of the richest flavors four gallons of ice cream could offer, laden with sprinkles, chocolate sauce, and extra sugar to sweeten the deal. Mia-Lin let out a squeal of joy and reached her flabby arms towards it, a rare display of effort from the enormous four-year old. She'd rocketed through the 300s mostly because she had done little for the past six weeks except eat, and that constantly. Such a rapid gain of weight on such a tiny figure meant that Mia-Lin was covered with stretch marks. She'd given up on clothes since she broke her final set of crop top and short shorts, thus leaving her fat with plenty of room to expand. Her double chin went up to four, her double belly extended down past her knees, and her wide thighs were just about to start dangling off her twin bed. She was still mobile, albeit barely- she needed help to stand, could barely walk fifteen steps alone, and that only went up to about fifty with her mother's help. Any exertion left her panting and sweaty, even something as easy as feeding herself- which meant that Ahn-Lin often needed to help her finish her food. This sundae was no exception. Mia-Lin was far too flabby to hold the enormous bowl and eat from it at the same time, so Ahn-Lin did both, spooning great gobs of ice cream into her daughter's hungry mouth. Though most of the sweet dessert made it into Mia-Lin's gaping maw, ice cream is notoriously imprecise, so her many chins and folds of fat ended up coated with melted ice cream, sprinkles, sauce and sweat. Though the sundae was enormous, after many, many spoonfuls the entirety of the bowl ended up inside of Mia-Lin. The obese Chinese girl, satisfied with her efforts, licked her lips and fell right to sleep against her pile of pillows. </span></div></div>",

First of these was the simple fact that Mia-Lin had not been in the car in nearly two months, and she had no idea how or even if she would be able to fit inside. She also had nothing to wear- Mia-Lin had actually gone without clothes for those nearly two months, preferring that over (however skimpy) crop-tops and shorts. Now she was so large Ahn-Lin doubted there was a single thing in the house to keep her decent with. Second was the problem of keeping her fed; Mia-Lin needed quite a lot of help to eat, and though she could manage well enough at feeding herself in short bursts there was not a lot she could do to keep sated over a long period of time, which two hours certainly was. Coupled with the fact that Mia-Lin also needed fairly frequent bathroom breaks, and Ahn-Lin had what looked like a recipe for perhaps the worst road trip of all time. It was only two hours, sure, but it was two hours of driving with a spoiled-rotten-and-morbidly-obese little girl. Ahn-Lin loved her little Mia-Lin to death, of course, but she really wasn't sure if she was ready to love her to death <i>that</i> much. So she thought, and Mia-Lin ate. </span></div></div>",

She continued eating and growing fatter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food finally arrived, and the entire kitchen was full of Pizza Hut, Burger King, and tons of McDonalds. Mia-lin was overwhealmed with how much food there was, there was even more food than there was last night!<br>\r\n\"Eat up, buttercup~!\" Ahn-lin smiled, and Mia didn't need to be told twice. She got right to work on devouring all the food within her reach, her body growing fatter with each bite. The chair she was sitting on, which already was holding on by a thread, was obviously crushed under her growing rump.<br>\r\n\"Hehehe...\" Mia giggled as her butt hit the cold ground. It tickled her, and felt very good against her skin.<br>\r\nAhn-lin kept moving food closer to her daughter's ever expanding mass, once again forgetting all about the McDonalds Deal. She caressed her daughters flab, happily watching as her fat blob of a daughter growing gleefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Mia had devoured all the food in the kitchen. Her immense belly flooded in front of her, her belly stuffed, taught and round. <br>\r\n\"I'm so full... I haven't eaten like that since... Well, yesterday!\" Mia stated.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't have room for dessert?\" Ahn-lin tempted, opening a pantry door to a ton of desserts and sweets.<br>\r\nMia felt instantly hungry and felt like she hadn't eaten in forever, the food looked so good Mia just HAD to have it. She made grabby arms towards the food, and Ahn smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just then, Ahn got a phone call, and it was from McDonalds. They called to tell her...</span></div></div>",

She looked around, monumentally confused, and was about to cry until Ahn-Lin, thinking quickly, shoved a few fries into her mouth and said, \"We're here!\" Mia-Lin's expression immediately changed to one of pure joy, a wide smile spreading across her flabby face. \"Yay! Even more food!\" Her stomach, in total defiance of all the food she had just eaten, let out an enormous growl, causing the enormous girl to wince. Ahn-Lin put a few more fries close to her mouth and marveled at her huge daughter. During the two-hour ride, she had managed to consume nearly twenty of the largest meals the truck's system had to offer- four hundred hundred burgers total at a rate of three per minute, not including fries, shakes, and everything else the machine spit at her massive daughter. The feeding had been more than enough to totally shred the skimpy and overwrought clothes Ahn-Lin had tossed onto her this morning, and she honestly didn't mind all that much; the two workers had been totally professional and helpful. At this moment they were busy heaving the nude, food-covered body of Mia-Lin onto a very large cart, but they weren't having an easy time of it. Mia-Lin was too large, too soft, and too ungainly to make any movement-related job easy. However, after a few minutes of effort, they managed to heave Mia-Lin's flabby expanse onto the big cart, upon which they found that she was too big for it- her flab hung off on all sides and brushed against the floor. Ahn-Lin, appreciating their efforts, waved them on anyway, and soon they were rolling down the ramp and into the building, Mia-Lin's fat brushing the ground as they went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon passing through the double-doors in the front of the building, they were greeted by a security guard, who appeared to be very flustered at the morbidly obese, nude, and now extremely hungry and angry girl sitting on a cart in front of him. \"You, uh, you can't, uh...who are you, trying to come in all...inappropriate like that?\" \"Huff...HUNGRY!\" shouted Mia-Lin, her enormous paunch growling in tandem with her announcement. Despite all the food she'd eaten, all she could think about was more. Her many folds broke out into a sweat with the effort of shouting and sitting. The guard bristled. \"Now listen here, little lady-\" \"Lenny, it's fine, she's supposed to look like that,\" interrupted a strident female voice. \"Buzz them in.\" The guard jumped. \"But, Miss Kozikowski, are you-\" \"Of course I'm sure, Lenny, I invited these people!\" Begrudgingly, the guard waved the group through, and soon Mia-Lin was treated to her first glimpse of the corporate world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhn-Lin had barely walked through the door before her hand was enveloped in an extremely powerful handshake. \"Ahn-Lin? It's a pleasure, a real pleasure.\" The hand belonged to a short, powerfully built blonde in glasses, a bun, and a brown suit. \"Linda Kozikowski. I'm so glad you're here.\" \"I-\" said Ahn-Lin, but by then Linda had already moved on Mia-Lin, who was currently flapping a useless hand at a picture of a hamburger. \"And you must be Mia-Lin! Oh, you're so adorable!\" Linda cooed, pinching one of Mia-Lin's enormous cheeks. Mia-Lin burped- very sweetly, thought Ahn-Lin- and shouted \"HUNGRY!\" again. Linda let out a squee fairly unbecoming of her businesslike look. \"She's so cy-<i>oot!</i> You must be hungry from the car ride, huh?\" Mia-Lin nodded as much as her four chins would let her. \"Brilliant! Bring her to some more food.\" The two workers, impassive as always, wheeled the enormous girl off to something to eat. \"Wait, I-\" cried Ahn-Lin, but Linda was already steering her in a different direction. \"Right this way, Miss Xi- I have the forms all ready and waiting for you to sign.\"</span></div></div>",

A goal to live up to. However, she did have her fair share of concerns.<br>\r\n\"So you're going to be fattening America?\" Ahn-lin asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, we've always been doing that, Ahn. Now we'll be doing it much more publicly, and if all goes well, our profits will skyrocket from gluttonous blobs who love to eat!\" Linda explained.<br>\r\n\"It does sound nice...

I love being this size, an' I wanna get bigger, but people wan' me to lose it.\" Mia recited from a teleprompter.<br>\r\nThe Camera panned down to a man in a suit, who patted Mia's belly, and chuckled, \"What a big ball of fun, huh? People think that being overweight is a problem, but recent studies have showed at kids, and even adults, who are overweight show more signs of happiness than those of a healthy weight. Join us in the campaign to promote and accept the gaining of people globally.\" The man recited, in a more serious tone.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and help kids like me get even bigger than this!\" Mia added, \"I'm not even 5, and if I can handle this amount of weight, so can you and your kids!\"<br>\r\n\"Cut, that's a wrap!\" The director called out.<br>\r\nMia Lin exhaled, \"That's hard work, readin' all those words.\"<br>\r\n\"But you did such a good job!\" Linda stated, clapping from in front of a door next to Ahn-lin.<br>\r\n\"Mommy! You're here!\" Mia cried, grasping out her arms to reach for her mother. But her arms were far too chubby to be of any use.<br>\r\nAhn and Linda laughed, finding the attempt adorable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What're you sayin', mom?\" Mia asked, after being told about the Contract.<br>\r\n\"I'm saying Mommy's gonna have to leave you here with McDonalds until you're done with your advertisement work, sweetie.\" Ahn-lin stated in the simplest terms possible.<br>\r\n\"But... But I want you to stay!\" Mia pouted.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but they'll make you fatter. You wanna be fatter, right?\" Ahn tried to reason.<br>\r\n\"...Yeah...\" Mia admitted, \"But... When'll you be back?\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it.\" She gave a wink, knowing Mia didn't know a thing about time yet.<br>\r\nLinda tapped her wrist, indicating it was time for her to leave.<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll see you soon, Sweetheart. I love you...\" She gave one final, long embrace before lowering herself to the ground and walking out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mia Lin, now that she's gone, we can finally get started with...\"</span></div></div>",

As it was she settled for clapping her vast belly. \"I am pretty hungry...\"<br>\r\n\"And a good thing too!\" said the director, giving her flabby expanse a soft pat. \"You're plenty big, but you're gonna need to be a lot bigger to get these ads done!\"<br>\r\nMia-Lin's eyes widened to the size of dinner plates. \"B...Bigger?\" <br>\r\n\"Yep!\" said the director whimsically. \"More'n double!\"<br>\r\nBefore Mia-Lin could answer, he strode away, and she was whisked away to another room labeled, in colorful crayon letters, FEEDING ROOM. But that was just to welcome Mia-Lin. Underneath the cheery paper sign was, in stark industrial letters, was the word REJECT PROCESSING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in this room that food items that did not pass inspection were processed. Hamburger patties that were perfectly safe but violated some piddling FDA regulation, slightly overcooked McNuggets, excess \"pink slime\", that sort of thing. Proper garbage was sorted elsewhere and properly disposed of, but this perfectly edible food was costing the company quite a lot of money to get rid of when it really didn't need to go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnter Mia-Lin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor this was the second reason McDonalds needed the enormous girl. Not only was she to be used in advertising, she was to help dispose of their excess-and serve as a rather unorthodox scientific experiment to boot. Of course she, being four years old, was entirely unaware of this, but even she was slightly nervous when she saw the feeding apparatus she was to use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to eat from THAT?\" she said, pointing a fat finger at the conveyor belt-large tube combo gleaming ominously in the corner. The man pushing her said nothing, simply positioned the cart in front of the machine and turned it on. Immediately all kinds of things flew into Mia-Lin's shocked mouth, and soon after that she was too busy eating to think any longer.</span></div></div>",

Although she truly wished, for the first time in her life, that she would stop being fed soon.<br>\r\nObviously, the people keeping an eye on Mia had no idea where or not she was enjoying it until the feeding was concluded.

The world around her had changed too. The walls, ceiling, and floor were made of Hershey's chocolate. She hopped out of bed, stopping a moment to stuff her face with the huge marshmallows that made up her bed. Stifling a belch, she went to the kitchen. Looking in the pantry, she found that there was nothing but the most delicious candy of her life: chocolate, caramel, M&amp;M's, marshmallows, cotton candy, and countless other delicacies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gorged on several of the pantry's contents, then went to the refridgerator. She opened it, revealing plate after plate of pieces chocolate cake. She greedily stuffed 10 pieces into her mouth, then looked in the freezer. No sooner had she opened the door then hundreds of dozens of gallons of chocolate milkshake flooded into her open mouth. She swallowed the entire freezer's delicious surprise, then grabbed 5 more pieces of cake, 7 king-size Snickers bars, several handfuls of the wall (which was also made of Hershey's), and 15 massive marshmallows as she hauled her huge frame back to her room. Her parents were waiting for her, sitting on her bed, watching her sluggishly move toward them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello, sweetie,' her mother said cheekily, 'Did you have a nice snack?'<br>\r\nRobin could simply nod as her mouth was nearly spilling over with sweets.<br>\r\n'Are you still hungry, Robin?' her father asked,<br>\r\nRobin nodded again.<br>\r\n'Would you like us to feed you, dear?' her mother asked as she and her father helped her sit down.<br>\r\n'Yes please, mommy,' Robin said, finally swallowing. 'feed me till I gotta roll to move!'<br>\r\n'OK, here comes the airplane, carrying nothing but chocolate brownie cake,' her mother said, making airplane noises.<br>\r\nRobin opened her mouth, and her mother stuck the entire piece into her mouth.<br>\r\n'Yummy,' Robin said, licking her lips to get any frosting that had smeared onto her chunky face, 'more, please.'<br>\r\n'Here comes the marshmallow train, now boarding at the Robin Station,' said her father, stuffing several marshmallows into Robin's waiting mouth.</span></div></div>",

Taking it one step at a time, she slowly descended the steps, making her breath as soft as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she made it downstairs, and took a few minutes to lean against the wall and get her breath back. She never enjoyed using the stairs, not a bit. They always made her tired and sweaty, plus her legs always got rather sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping her brow, she continued to the kitchen and made straight for the pantry, giggling rather greedily as she opened the door and eyed up the plethora of candy inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gluttonous rub of her jiggly dome, she began happily stuffing her face, right there and then!</span></div></div>",

It's stretched anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin put her shirt back on. Her sister was always teasing her. But she knew that sooner or later her sister would get what she deserved. She looked forward to that but she was patient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you both. Let's go home. There is waiting some chocolate ice cream and sauce.\" Lisa said to get Robin also with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked to the car and Robin struggled to get in her car seat what was getting too small for her. <br>\r\nHer mother was having trouble closing her belt. It was cutting in her soft belly flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fat piggy is getting too fat for the car seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin now really had more then enough from her sister and kicked right in her belly very hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auw!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Their mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin kicked me in my belly.\" Christie said with tears in her eyes from pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That serves you right. I told you not to make fun of Robin. Now stop fighting you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home Robin went straight to the freezer to get the chocolate ice cream. and also the chocolate sauce.<br>\r\nRobin poured all the ice cream in a bowl and covered it with chocolate sauce and started to stuff her face when she was done her whole face and her shirt were part covered in chocolate sauce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister walked in and said: \"I would also like some ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad all gone.\" Robin said with a grin while she rubbed her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All gone! I that fat Belly of you! You fat, fat pig. You alway's eat everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy Christie is making fun of me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother walked in and sighed when she saw Robins face and shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin Now i need to was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sister looked angry when her mother took Robin upstairs.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin's sister was still tickling Robin's soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piggy, want some food? I bet you can't wait to get your greedy little fingers on all the food in the house.\" Robin's sister said. \"Well let's see how much you can eat.\" Robin sat up the best she could, excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she cried. \"I want food!\" Robin giggled and rubbed her hands across her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sat out packages of cookies, bags of chips, a cheesecake left over from a party, and a gallon of ice cream. \"Bet you can't eat all of that.\" said Robin's sister, putting her hands on her hips.

Robin's sister rubbed Robin's tummy while she gorged. Finally, Robin sat back, smiling. Her tiny shirt was pushed up and exposed her stuffed belly, the button of her pants looking strained. Robin still had most of the cheesecake left but everything else was gone. Robin's sister took two quarts of milk out of the fridge and put them on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin picked up one of the quarts and chugged it. Robin's sister could literally see Robin's huge belly expanding and hiding Robin's plump thighs. Robin swung her legs back and forth as she began to eat the cheesecake with her fingers, licking the pan when she finished. She gulped the last quart of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's sister smiled to herself. \"Good girl,\" she said, rubbing Robin's belly. She helped Robin waddle to the sofa. Robin started to get sleepy after eating so much food, and Robin's sister put a pillow behind Robin's head, pulled up her shirt, and massaged her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Robin woke up...</span></div></div>",

Robin ate everything Christie gave her. Potato chips, microwave popcorn, an entire box of cereal, ice cream, ham slices; all of it ended up inside Robin's growing paunch even after it started to hurt. \"I need... a break\" Robin said, out of breath. Eating had made her physically tired.<br>\r\n\"Oh ok,\" Christie said, \"I'm gonna call mom and dad and tell them to buy a little extra of everything.\" She smile an rubbed Robin's belly. \"After all, we need to keep this growing.\" Robin smiled. She was happy that Christie was now encouraging her to grow instead of making fun of her for her size. Though it seemed that Christie was ore focused on Robin's belly than anything else. Robin's belly let out a loud groan interrupting her thoughts. Man I at a lot of food; she thought to herself. Robin then drifted into another food coma.</span></div></div>",

I will get it for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie returned with two boxes of cookies, two bags of pretzels, a gallon of ice cream, five bars of chocolate, a pie and two two litre's bottles of cola. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin eat it!\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin started on her first bar of chocolate but something in her told her this was strange. Not too long ago Christie teased her telling she was getting fat. Short after that and now she was very nice to her feeding her. It did seem a bit strange. It was't Christie's style to do something from the kindness of her hart. <br>\r\nRobin must admit Christie and she often fight with each other. That was normal for sisters. However Christie mostly won since she was older and stronger then Robin. It was of course also a bit of a problem with a difference of five years between the two girls.<br>\r\nWhen Christie was young she did't have to share anything. Not her toys, parents or candy. But when Robin was born everything changed. She did't liked that. suddenly she needed to share her toys and her parents, and if she built a tower with blocks Robin pushed over her parents told her then that Robin was just a little kid that did't know better. But what also happened many times was that she was't allowed to watch T.V  because  Robin also watched with her and some cartoons were a bit scary for her and then she ended up with a cartoon for babies. There was also the problem with playing. When Christie had a new game she tried to play it with Robin but it was always the same. With a difference of five years Robin was too young to understand the rules of the game or was distracted from it. So doing something together was always a bit hard. So that they were fighting with each other happened very often. <br>\r\nSo Robin found it strange her sister suddenly acted so nice. <br>\r\nWhile thinking this she already finished two bars of chocolate and was halfway her first box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good little sister eat and fill your belly.\"Christie said friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was sure her sister was planning something. She could't find out what. Did she put something in her food? Very unlikely. Then she did't have to put so much food on table. One cupcake was more then enough. She knew she would wolf that down without a second thought. So why did she do this. Perhaps she tried to be a nice sister for once. She did't knew but she doubted it, but with all this good food she could't resist taking it. So she did kept eating but watched her sister carefully. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

All of the food, chicken, pizza, jello, hot pockets, coke, all of ended up in Robin's belly.Robin was on the floor leaning against the kitchens island. She stared at her belly and smiled. She couldn't wait to see where all this food would show up on her body. Christie was standing by the kitchen entrance and had watched the whole thing.<br>\r\n\"Good job sis!\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I don't think I can eat anymore.\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry little piggy, I'll help you\" Christie said. She went over to the cabinets and pulled out a box of twinkies and began stuffing Robin. Robin was rubbing her belly as she felt it expand with every bite. It took some effort but soon the whole box was inside Robins stomach. Then Christie pulled out a bag of chocolate chips and some icing. Eventually all of the edible things in the cabinets were inside Robins tight tummy. Christie helped Robin over to the couch then cleaned up. Robin rubbed overstuffed belly in the hopes of freeing up some space for dinner.<br>\r\n\"We should stuff you like this all the time,\"Christie said while throwing away rappers. She imagined just how fat Robin would get if the did.<br>\r\n\"Sure -urp just as long -hic as I can take a nap afterwards,\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"Of course you can,\" Christie said as she walked over to Robin on the couch, \"You're going to need that rest after the stuffings to free up more room in your belly.\" She started rubbing Robin's belly that felt drum tight. \"You better rest up now, mom and dad will be home soon from the grocery store. And you'll be eating a bit more than usual\" Christie said while staring at Robins belly. The look Christie had in her eyes worried Robin a little</span></div></div>",

Suddenly she saw some food her sister had placed on the table. Two cakes, five bars of chocolate, a box of cookies, a liter of chocolate ice cream (Robins favorite) and a two liter bottle of coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Christie what do you want to do with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See how much you can eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

The next moment she broke of lumps of the cake and pushed them in Robins mouth. Robin chewed the cake and swallowed it. Her tummy started to feel stuffed again after the first cake. But Christie just kept feeding her. Lump by lump the second cake also disappeared in Robins mouth. Robin looked a little dizzy but her sister did't notice and opened the bottle of coke and poured some coke in her sisters mouth. Robin needed to swallow or she would choke. After that her sister put one by one the chocolate bars in Robins mouth. She pushed the almost in her throat. Robin did't get a chance to say anything. When she opened her mouth her sister pushed some chocolate or poured coke in her mouth. After the chocolate Robin felt sick. Her sister pushed one cookie after another in Robins mouth. Robin felt to full to move, talk or trying to stop Christie. Besides Christie was older, bigger and stronger then her. And She knew Christie would continue so she swallowed the cookies. It would't prevent her stomach from hurting but it was better then getting it pushed in her throat. And finally the chocolate ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Open up sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin did't knew what else to do. Besides she loved Chocolate ice cream. Even while it hurt with each bite she loved to eat the chocolate ice cream. Her belly was making noises in protest. But Christie kept feeding Robin and Robin did't knew what else to do then swallow. after the ice cream was gone Christie poured the last of the coke in Robins mouth. after the bottle of coke was empty Robin let out a large belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i don't... feel so... well. I feel... sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you're fine. Your stomach is like a water balloon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't... they... explode?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin felt to full to even move a muscle and passed out. Christie fast cleaned up making sure her mom would't find any things of the two stuffing moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this so fun. Fattening up my little sister. I wonder how fat can she become and how much can i feed her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got an evil smile and took her mother grocery list and wrote some extra fattening treats on it and placed it back on the refrigerator. Just a few minutes later her mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is Robin. It's her bed time.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n Christie pointed at the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah is't that sweet she is sleeping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie also cleaned Robins face and brushed the crumbs away so their mother would suspect anything. Their mother lifted Robin. However she noticed Robin was getting very heavy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put her in bed. And you better also get ready for bed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" Christie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled when she looked at her bloated sister. Tomorrow was Saturday. So she was free.

She fast ran downstairs and walked to the kitchen. No one was there. She suddenly remembered that her parents told her that they would be out Saturday morning. Christie was still asleep. She stayed long in bed if she could. Robin was really hungry and waddled to the cupboard and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so hungry i need food!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a bag of chips and stuffed them so fast in her mouth she barley had time to chew them. She grabbed two boxes of cookies and stuffed them by handfuls in her mouth. And her hunger was still big. She ripped open every bag and box she could find and stuffed the food in her mouth as fast if she could. She even emptied the jars of peanut butter and jelly.<br>\r\nAfter the entire cupboard was empty she walked over to the refrigerator and looked in side. She found a big box of weenies. She took some bread and covered each bread with weenies and after that almost drowned the weenies with mayonnaise an ketchup and after that stuffing them in her mouth. After the bread was gone she just pushed the last weenies in her mouth pouring some mayonnaise and ketchup right in her mouth. She also found a bowl leftover greasy gravy and poured it right in her mouth. But she was still hungry. Suddenly she did't cared anymore and stuffed everything she could find in her mouth. She did't even noticed what she was eating or drinking as long if she could get something in her belly. <br>\r\nShe threw the empty package just over her shoulder. But even when the refrigerator was empty she was't full. Robin shoved her chair to the refrigerator and climbed on it so she was able to reach the freezer and opened it. She found two gallons of ice cream and two pizza's. She put one of the pizza's in the microwave and started to eat ice cream while the microwave was running. When the first one was done she started to eat them after putting the second one in the microwave. After she also finished the second one she continued with the ice cream until both gallons were completely clean. After that she used the chair to climb on the sink and crawled to the fruit bowl and started to eat all the fruit and after she spit out the last seed she started to think clear again. She looked around. There was't a crumb of food left in the house. She felt her belly that felt ready to pop. However she liked the feeling. he looked at the mess in the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow did i eat all that? Men i was really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Christie appeared in the doorway.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin did you eat everything?\" She looked at the refrigerator and saw the grocery list was gone so that mend her mother would also do some grocery shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Christie. I was just really hungry. But i feel full now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait until mom comes back with those groceries. Then i will make you feel full.

Or would it not be able to cover such a large belly.<br>\r\nChristie was then brought out of her imagination when she noticed her mother putting down an exceptionally large bowl of nachos. \"Eat up sis,\" Christie said as she pushed the bowl towards Robin and began rubbing her belly. \"We have to keep this belly growing.\" Robin didn't quite understand why Christie suddenly wanted her stomach to grow but she didn't let it bother her. Robin, though still very full, thought she could fit a few more bites in her belly, plus Christie's hand felt somewhat soothing so she began eating.

Robin thought maybe if she rubbed her stomach while she ate then she'd be able to eat it all. <br>\r\n\"Mom, Robin has been hungry all day, you should give her extra,\" Christie said. Robin clutched her belly out of fear, how could she eat a large dinner plus extra?</span></div></div>",

She left the dinner table cradling her belly and waddle over to the couch where she fell into a food induced coma. Christie walks over to Robin and gazes upon her belly in awe. It looked like she swallowed a beach ball that had the weight of a bowling ball. Christie placed her hand upon Robin's belly and was amazed at how tight it felt. She then carefully placed her head on Robin's belly the listen to what went on inside. Her belly sounded of chaos and she could hear the little burps Robin made as she slept. Christie then got an idea. If Robin was kept full like this all the time then she'd surely get fatter faster. But Christie had to plan the binges carefully so Robin wouldn't get hurt, but she would also be too full to fight Christie off. Plus Robin would need the occasional nap since the binge eating would surely tire her out. Christie decided in would work if Robin binged for a good two hours then took three hour naps. The fat would pile on in no time</span></div></div>",

Sugary cereals, chips, a huge amount of leftovers, and few quick to cook things filled the house. Christy thought there would be enough for the first day at least. She got a few foods ready and eagerly waited for Robin to wake up. <br>\r\nRobin awakened to a plumper body that her pajamas were fighting against. She sleepily wandered to the kitchen as was routine and grabbed a big bowl of cereal then headed to the couch. Christie happily prepared a few other things for Robin to eat. As Robin finished up the cereal, Christie slid in a bowl of chips.<br>\r\n\"Gotta keep you growing,\" she said to her overweight sister.<br>\r\nRobin smiled and started eating the chips. After that it was an omlet, then a second bowl of cereal. The girls then heard their parents coming from their bedroom. Christie scrambled to hide the evidence. <br>\r\n\"Hey mom, Robin and I we're hungry for some pancakes and bacon, and eggs\" Christie said.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I guess I could do that for you guys; I mean breakfast is the most important meal of the day,\" she replied. Christie smiled and turned to Robin. <br>\r\n\"You're gonna get so fat,\" she said. <br>\r\n\"Can't wait!\" Robin replied as she patted her semi full belly.<br>\r\nWhen the food was food was done, Christie again pointed out how Robin was a \"growing\" girl and doubled her food amount. Eight pancakes, a separate plate of eggs and nine strips of Bacon. Robin eagerly ate every bite on her plate even when her stomach started to hurt. She liked the pain and the thought that her belly was going to grow fatter because of the food inside it. <br>\r\nChristie guided Robin to the couch where she planned to feed her more. She started off with leftover pancakes. Robin forced herself to eat them despite her aching tummy's protests. <br>\r\n\"Christie I'm so full...\" Robin moaned while rubbing her stuffed paunch. <br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll help you,\" Christie said. She went and grabbed a pack of cookies and a tall glass of milk. Slowly, Christie eased the cookies into Robins stomach until the pack was empty. The fat girl's shirt couldn't go the length needed to cover her belly. <br>\r\n\"Just a little more?\" Robin asked, to Christie's surprise. <br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" <br>\r\nRobin patted her heavy paunch. \"Belly needs more!\" Robin said. Her belly was aching but she was feeling greedy. She wanted her belly to hurt a little more, but her eyes widened when she saw Christie come back with a large bowl of pasta.<br>\r\n\"This is half the pasta, the rest is going to be your  pre dinner.\" Christie said, \"Besides, we both knew this would end up in that belly of yours eventually.\" Christie towered over Robin and started feeding her. Robins belly grew with every large, forced bite. She could feel the food stretching her gut and she rubbed it to try to soothe the pain. When Christie was finally done, Robin closed her eyes and focused on breathing. She knew this was all for her to get fatter. She actually felt physically tired from eating so much and fell asleep on the couch. Christie was amazed by how much Robin ate. She couldn't wait to stuff her again.</span></div></div>",

But why bother if you could get a whole bowl of nachos.<br>\r\nRobin leaned too the bowl and grabbed two handful of nachos and pushed them in her greedy mouth. They tasted so good. Robin did't cared anymore about her doubts. The only thing she cared about now was eating nachos.<br>\r\nChristie smiled when she saw Robins shirt ride up a little and her pants becoming tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl Robin. You need to get fatter. Much fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was happy that she got to eat all those nachos but her belly started to hurt. Christie looked at her and Robin remembered last night and forced her mouth open for another few bites. Christie seemed satisfied. Robin looked at the last nachos. Her hair was hanging around her face. She grabbed the last nachos stuffed them in her mouth and swallowed them and burped loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job my dear sister, can you eat more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No Christie please i can't eat more! I feel like i'm gonna pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on i know you want more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin started to become a little scared now. Her sister seemed possessed to let her eat more and her belly was hurting now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin slowly rolled her bloated body of the couch. Waddling a little like she was dizzy.  She did't felt so good after all those nachos and her morning binge. She walked over to her mother and hold tight too her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Robin. Say Robin do you know what happened to the food we had?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i sort of eat it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of it? Robin how do you feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so good. My tummy hurts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor girl. Come on i help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother took her upstairs and took her too her bedroom. Now just rest on your bed. Robin did't complain and did like she was told. Her mother started to rub her belly. It felt good. Her stuffed feeling started to get less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. This feels good mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's something my grandmother, your great grandmother thought me. She was a good cook and sometimes we kept eating there and well... since the food was so good i sometimes did't know when to stop. If my tummy hurt she rubbed it like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin slowly got up. She still felt full but not longer like she would pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i don't get it how you were able to eat all that food and after that still some nacho's with Christie. Robin You should't continue eating when your full. When your full just stop eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got up on her feet and hugged her mother and they both got downstairs. Robin looked in the play room. Christie was't there. Robin walked in and turned on the T.V too watch some cartoons. <br>\r\nBut still she wondered why Christie was feeding her so much. She liked it to be fed but not till over her limited. But Christie kept feeding her even when she was full. <br>\r\nRobin did't knew that Christie was watching her. Christie was very good at walking without making a noise and hiding. She knew she could better wait fattening Robin until her Robin got hungry again. That would't take too long.

Well almost. except when she was sleeping. She liked the idea of snacking the whole time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Au? what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down and saw their pet kitten. She was only a few months old and while she tried to climb up the bench she accidentally put her nails in Robin's leg. <br>\r\nRobin looked at her kitten and helped her on the couch. Robin liked animals and stroke her kitten with one hand eating chocolate with the other while watching cartoons.<br>\r\nChristie returned some time later. Robin was still sitting on the couch watching cartoons and just being lazy. The bag of candy bars was empty. Some empty wrappers were lying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah what a good girl you are. You finished the whole bag. Still hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a little hungry.\" Robin said careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are two bags of chips. You can finish them while watching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's gonna be a problem. The cartoon is over.\" Robin said with a smile. \"Besides mom does't like it when i watch to much T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned of the T.V and continued to stroke her kitten. But at the same time she was almost drooling while looking at the chips. It were here favorite tastes. Robin still felt to lazy to get up.<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"What do you want to do then?\" Christie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Something that does't cost to much energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie snapped her fingers and pulled out some CD's. When Christie was younger and could't read yet their mother bough books told on CD. Christie knew most stories out of her head by now but Robin still liked them and of course she did't know them all so well like Christie did. Christie looked careful that the story would't be to difficult or to scary for Robin and pulled out some CD's with nice stories put them in the stereo and pushed the play button. Robin lay back to listen the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robin shall i feed you while you listen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had doubt for a few seconds but Christie promised not to over stuff her anymore. She lifted her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't over stuff you promise. I just slowly will feed you. If you ask me to stop i will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRobin closed her eyes and went lying on the bench listening to the story and opened her mouth so Christie could slowly feed her. This was so perfect.<br>\r\nRobin loved the next hour and a half. Just being lazy while you got fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All gone sis. Nice two bags of chips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin went sitting an noticed that her shirt rode up a little and tried to pull it down without success. Her belly poked out between her shirt and pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that looks so good that belly of yours. Think about it when this one will be so much bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to image how she would look if her belly would be so big. She liked the idea of being so big and fat. Just the she noticed how stuffed she felt. While listening to stories and being fed she had so much fun that she did't notice how stuffed she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie. Can i take some time off? I feel stuffed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked at her sister. She wanted to fatten her up more but she promised Robin she would't overfed her so she nodded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but not too long. You remember we said all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin already had eaten a lot more then normal and Christie knew that when Robin would eat a bit more each day her stomach would stretch out slowly so she could hold more food until her stomach was big enough to get food a whole day.<br>\r\nChristie smiled while she looked forward to how fat her sister was going to become.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Robin lifted up her shirt enough to show Christie her big stomach. Christie put her hands on Robin's tummy and squeezed it. Then she tested how big her thighs were. \"Hold out your arms,\" she said. Robin held her arms out -- they were getting more and more plump due to her overeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright girls, dinner time!\" their mom said as she came into the room. Quickly Christie pulled down Robin's shirt and stood up. As they walked to the dining room, the delicious smell of fettucini pasta with cheese sauce hit Robin's nostrils. It smelled so good! But she was so full already -- she had literally been eating and eating all afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie smiled. The more and more food Robin stuffed into herself, the bigger her tummy would get, and the more it would take to make her full. Robin would grow faster and faster and get postively huge!

Some of it was dangling, so she used her other plump hand to push it all the way in.

Fortunately, the food court was right in the middle of the mall, meaning that they would likely be passing it several times that day. If they managed to stop for a little snack each time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie's stomach rumbled, breaking into her thoughts. She realized that, sadly, the three girls had not had breakfast yet today! She soon cheered up, though, for she saw a most convenient sign: 'IHOP, Straight Ahead!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, can we stop at IHOP for breakfast, please?\" she asked sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why of course, honey! That's a great idea!\" The girls' mother agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay, pancakes!\" cheered Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the trio had arrived at IHOP and climbed out of the car. Christie looked at the sign and smiled to herself: 'All-You-Can-Eat Pancake Special!' it exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, this will be a very good start to the day...' Christie thought gleefully, resisting the urge to rub her hands together like the villain in an old movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls hurried inside and sat down at a booth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they perused the menu, Robin licked her lips. \"I can't decide what to have,\" she said to Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie took this opportunity to say \"You know, they DO have the 'All-You-Can-Eat' special... And that's whatever kind of pancakes you want! So you could try them all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, that sounds great! Thanks, Christie!\" Robin said. She set her menu on the table and waited hungrily, swinging her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie decided on the chocolate chip pancakes, and their mother settled for blueberry pancakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the waitress came to take their orders, everyone except Christie was shocked when Robin said, in her sweetest voice, \"And I'll have the 'All-You-Can-Eat' special, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, don't you think that's a little much?\" Her mother said. \"Maybe just one plate would be best, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin adamantly shook her head. \"Nope, that's what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo their mother's surprise, Christie stood up for Robin. \"If she thinks she can handle it, Mom, you should let her try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother sighed and gave up. \"All right, Robin, but is you eat yourself sick, don't say I didn't warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what kind of pancakes would you like to start out with, dear?\" The waitress inquired of Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll start out with the chocolate-chip, thank you,\" Robin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress smiled and took their menus. \"All right, then! Those'll be out soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls waited, steadily getting hungrier, Robin most of all. It didn't help any that Christie kept talking about food as they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn about 15 minutes, the pancakes had arrived. Each was about the size of a small plate, and each girl had three on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy!\" the waitress said before moving off to serve someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hastily poured syrup over her pancakes and dug in. She cut the pancakes up into pieces small enough to fit into her mouth before stuffing them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had finished her plate even before Christie and her mother had finished their first pancakes. She signaled to the waitress, who cam over and said \"Yes? How can I help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin pointed to her plate and said \"I'd like the blueberry pancakes next, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away, dear.\" The waitress said, returning to the kitchen. Soon, she came back with a plate of blueberry pancakes and set it in front of Robin. Robin thanked her and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done with that, Christie and her mother had barely finished their second pancakes. Robin was starting to get full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good job, Robin,\" whispered Christie when their mother wasn't looking. \"Keep up the good work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled and ordered a plate of apple-cinnamon pancakes. The waitress merely nodded and placed the order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was up, she grabbed it and set it in front of Robin, noting that the other two were nearly finished with their meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Robin continued to eat her 3rd plate, Christie and the girls' mom finished their meals and relaxed, waiting for Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I'm full,\" said Christie. \"How about you, Robin? Getting full yet? Or do you still have room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin thought this may have been a veiled threat, and so said \"I think I could eat another plate, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, her stomach had become full, and was now starting to protrude from her clothes a little. But if she was going to get stuffed again, anyway, Robin thought she may as well do it herself this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie took the liberty of ordering another plate of pancakes for Robin before she was even finished; just plain ones, this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the new pancakes had come, Robin had just barely finished her third plate, but she started immediately in on her 4th.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mom excused herself to the washroom to clean up, and Christie started to give Robin some encouragement. She began to rub Robin's stuffed stomach, which was now round enough to be only 3/4 covered by her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Robin. You can do it,\" Christie whispered. \"Just remember how good it feels to be stuffed. How good it feels to get fatter. Remember: The fatter you are, the better. It's good to be fat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin paused in between mouthfuls of syrup-drenched pancake to say \"Christie, if it's so good to get fat... Shouldn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie closed her mouth. This was something she hadn't thought of. Before she could say anything, her and Robin's mother came back and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly, Robin had finished, absolutely stuffed. She leaned back and said \"Thanks, Mom! That was good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, sweetie. But that was quite a few pancakes you ate; are you sure you're alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin nodded. I feel fine, Mommy.\" 'Fine' was an understatement; in truth, she felt great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls' mother signaled the waitress for the check, and once they had received it, they got up to pay, leaving behind a nice tip for the waitress. Robin's pants creaked dangerously as the full weight of her stuffed belly came to rest on them, straining the button. Robin didn't attract too much attention as the trio paid and left, as there weren't too many people seated around the door area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got back in the car and Robin attempted to buckle up, she found it somewhat more difficult than before, due to her stuffed belly taking up so much space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was still silent as they continued onwards to the mall.</span></div></div>",

Her mother looked at her and saw how tight her pants were cutting in Robin' soft belly. Christie thought that one more bite would blow the button of Robin's pants off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Good thing we went eating first. Now her belly is at it's maximum size. Else the button would pop off during the morning.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''All right the mall. Everybody out.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was glad she could finally get out off her small car seat. The trio walked in the mall. Christie looked at the fast food court but saw that Robin and her mother both walking to the clothing store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Lets see. Kids clothes are on the second floor.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked upstairs. Robin and her other looked in Robin's age section for some clothes. <br>\r\nChristie knew whit one look that those clothes were all too small. Slowly she walked further too the older size section and looked for some nice clothes. Maybe she could find here some nice clothes for Robin. She did't looked at the dresses since she knew Robin would never were a dress except at a special occasion like a wedding feast or birthday from some family members, and even then only too please them.<br>\r\nShe picked some T-shirts and sweaters with drawings from Winx club, and Disney characters. Robin loved Disney movies and Winx club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look Robin. I found some nice shirts for you.'' Christie said when she came back with some nice T-shirts and sweaters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at the T-hirts and sweaters and immediately wanted too try them. <br>\r\nOf course Christie did't tell them they came from an older kids section and she took T-shirts and sweaters with short sleeves and Robin growing frame was right for the sizes. <br>\r\nWhile Robin tried the T-Shirts on Christie looked for some pants. This was gonna be hard. If she would took them from the older kids section they would fit but would be too long. But she did't think any normal pants would fit Robin. Then she got an idea and just went one year older section and took some elastic clothing and put three of them on a pile next too her mother and Robin who was just done trying T-hirts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n''I like them mommy, and they fit. Look this one comes from Lilo and Stitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Look Robin i found some elastic pants for you. Go try them on.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at the pants. She did't liked elastic pants. She thought hey did't looked cool. But at the other hand elastic pants were comfortable and did't leave marks around her tummy. <br>\r\nShe looked at Christie who smiled at a strange way. Thinking about all the eating the past days she thought that it was maybe wise too take the elastic pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''These will look great on you Robin.'' Their mother said some time later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie bend over too Robin and whispered in her ear: ''Are you hungry? There is a fast food court in the hall. Come on. Eat like you're in heaven, eat, eat, eat twenty four seven.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked in the face of her older sibling. She still felt full but she promised Christie to keep eating. What should she do?    </span></div></div>",

Well, you can have just a snack,\" Lisa said. She pulled out her debit card and gave it to Christie. \"Now no more than twenty dollars ok?\" Lisa said. <br>\r\n\"Ok mom,\" Christie said. The girls went to the food court and picked out a table. Robin sat down and rubbed her still full belly. \"You better eat all this food Im gonna give you\" Christie said. She got Robin mostly desserts and a few nachos and fries. Robin started eating but her belly began to protest. It gurgled and sloshed begging Robin to stop eating. Robin was only half way done with the food when she couldn't eat anymore. <br>\r\n\"I can't finish it Christie...\" Robin said as she cradled her gorged gut. <br>\r\n\"You're going to regret that Robin, we had a deal. Now I guess it's time to make a new one.\" Christie said. She grabbed Robins wrists and force fed her the rest of the food. Robin's had to rub her belly for the rest of the time at the mall. Once they got home, Christie had already started to plan how Robin was going to out grow the newly bought clothes. She had and idea and decided to use it that night after their parents went to sleep. </span></div></div>",

Robin saw a car sandwich and bit off the headlight. It tasted delicious and she started to nibble on the rest of the car and soon the whole car was inside her belly but in her dream she did't felt full and even with a whole car in her belly that made it bugle it out forward she still felt herself skinny.<br>\r\nShe walked over to a house made of pie and nibbled at the corner of a house. Delicious. She took a few bricks and pushed them in her mouth one by one and after that she could't control herself and started devouring the house very fast the walls disappeared so fast she almost had't time to chew them. <br>\r\nNow the whole outside wall was in her belly but now she started on the wall of the inside of the house. Furniture that she found on her way got in her belly as well. After not too long the whole house was gone. Robin was now a huge ball of fat<br>\r\nShe drained the pool that was filled with Cola and walked through the street (since this is a dream she can still walk) eating every sandwich car making her fatter but still too skinny for her. <br>\r\nAfter another teen cars in her belly she decide too also eat other houses and she devoured all houses in the street but it was still not enough even with her being the fattest girl you've ever seen. Her head was on top of blubber. a huge mass of fat almost not able too see the limbs any more. She suddenly saw a boulder at the foot of a mountain and swallowed it. It was chocolate. The whole mountain was made of chocolate and at the top. The snow was chocolate ice cream. She started to chew at the feet of the mountain. Robin liked chocolate more then anything else and the whole mountain went down Robins belly.<br>\r\nBur Robin wanted to get much fatter and she was still hungry. She diced to just munch on the next mountain ans another three mountains went down in the bottomless stomach of the girl making her growing fatter with each bite. All what was left of her was a growing mass of blubber.<br>\r\nFor Robin this felt like heaven. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What she didn't know was that by her side, next to the bed, Christie was awake and gently whispering suggestions to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it Robin, dream of getting bigger and eating everything... eat... eat...\" Christie said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled and moaned slightly as she slept. She unconsciously began to rub her belly, already fatter from today's binging. \"M..more...\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, just like that Christie... good girl... have some more chocolate and pies and milkshakes and hamburgers..... eat and grow huuuuge...\" Christie said. She was getting more and more into fattening up her little sister. It was really fun, and for some reason it made her feel excited. She didn't want to stop, and she didn't want Robin to stop either. So she would do anything to coerce Robin into becoming her willing feedee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was working. In Robin's dream, though she sensed she had grown so extremely fat and huge that she dwarfed mountains, could think of nothing better than to find more and more things to stuff herself with. Every bite of the cartoonish fantasy land seemed to make her swell slightly, and every time that happened, her limbs felt more pillowy and constricted, her body felt larger, her mind felt more carefree, and her stomach felt more greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she saw the parade. At the center of the city nearby, there was a giant parade filled with all sorts of delicious things. Rank after rank of frosty gingerbread soldiers marched dutifully. Ice-cream smothered parade floats glistened in the sun. Giant translucent blimps filled with milkshake hovered along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin, slowly but surely, lifted her right leg, from her massively turgid thigh all the way to her plumping toes, and stepped forward. As she got a rhythm going, she began to slowly waddle toward the parade, each step causing the earth to shake. Robin hoped she wouldn't trip on anything -- with how fat she was, she couldn't see her own belly button, let alone the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me how much you want to get fatter Robin,\" a voice said softly. Robin didn't know where it was coming from as she made her way to the musical parade of endless desserts, but she responded enthusiastically, \"I want to get fatter more than anything in the world.\"</span></div></div>",

The first car was going towards her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n At the same moment the car went into her mouth Christie pushed a muffin in her sisters mouth. Normally when you eat something in your dream and you wake up later you remember that you only taste a bit of it. But now Robin tasted it for real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe parade did't try to run away. In fact they were walking calm just into Robins mouth who was just chewing and swallowing every single piece of the parade while Christie fed her muffins, cupcakes, chips, cookies, licorice, candy and all the other stuff she carried to Robins room. This continued until Robin swallowed the last crumb of all the food. Christie smiled when she saw how bloated Robins belly was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right it was fun but i think i should stop now. If i continue there won't be any food left tomorrow for her to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shove closer to Robins belly and pulled of her blanket and pulled up her pajama shirt to see her belly in all its glory. Christie could't control she just need to touch it. She slowly stroke it and rubbed it a little. Robin was making sounds of pleasure. Christie stopped afraid Robin would wake up. But Robin was far away in dreamland where she was still eating everything in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the entire parade was inside her belly she looked around for what else to eat. The first thing she saw was a building and she just break of a piece of it and started to eat it. Tasted like a chocolate bonbon. Robin loved bonbons (except for the ones with alcohol inside like kirsch). A tasty chocolate outside and a sweet mostly soft tasty stuff inside. She looked around and noticed all the city buildings were bonbons. She ran forward and started to eat every building . She did't cared about anything else except eating those delicious buildings. <br>\r\nRobin finally had devoured the whole city and still she did't felt full. She walked further looking for food eating trees, roads. hills, farms, woods and drained ponds, swimming pools and even lakes. She ate everything. City's and villages also went down her belly. She just kept eating and growing fatter and fatter and fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie pulled back Robin's pajama shirt and her blanket. <br>\r\nAfter that she cleaned up all the empty boxes and bags of the food she fed Robin and decided too throw it away on her room. If Robin or her parents would find it there it would be difficult too explain and she could throw out the garbage first thing tomorrow morning. <br>\r\nShe also brushed away the crumbs on Robins bed and floor and finally she was done cleaning. She slowly walked too her room and fell down on her bed. She felt exhausted from feeding Robin and cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men. I really need some sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her pillow and put her head on it and crawled under her blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have some help with fattening her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes flew open and she felt awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some help. I could really use a helping hand feeding that fat little sister of mine. Well she won't be little for long anymore. But just a little help from a friend would't be such a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed her book with school photo's from her classmates and looked through the photos for someone who maybe would like to fatten up Robin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm. Hate her. Don't like her. Fashion doll. Is fat herself and hates it. Athlete. Outsider. Nerd. Ah Saskia. One of my best friends. Of course. Why did't i think of her before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaskia was light tanned. A color like coffee with milk. She had black hair and could look like a bad girl. Saskia also had a cell phone and  took pictures of everyone who was fat. Christie asked her once why and she said just she liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie put her head back on her pillow <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"I wonder or Robin has devoured the earth by now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

When Christie answered the phone she noticed it was Saskia's little sister Julie. Julie  was an extremely adorable 6 year old. Julie had black hair down to the middle of her back, big emerald green eyes, and tanned skin just like her big sister's. She is a nice energetic girl that hate's dresses. One of the main reasons Christie was worried about Saskia's reaction was that Julie was a very skinny girl, not to say she was fed very little, on the contrary Julie practically is always munching on something and eating the most at dinner. When Julie crys she sounds like a whimpering dog, Saskia loves it when Julie crys because it makes her even more adorable.(Julie for some reason enjoys crying and pain, Julie would never hurt herself on purpose though...strange girl, strrrange girl)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie was on the phone asking if Christie would come over. Christie was about to ask why when Julie said that Saskia was acting strange and her stomach is making alot of noises. Christie said she would be there in a few minutes. Christie washed up and got dressed, but before she left out she went to check on Robin. Robin was still asleep and she looked a little bigger, she even had a smile on her face. Christie was tempted to go and touch Robin's belly but had too hurry and check on Julie. Saskia and Julie always felt like family to Christie and Robin so Christie knew that if something was wrong with them she had to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey only lived two blocks away from Christie's house so it was'nt really that much of a walk. When Christie arrived she knocked two times before Saskia opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie, what are you doing here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your little sister called me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie said you were acting strange so I came to check up on you guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be 2 years yonger than you Christie but I can take care of my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll just check on Julie.\" said Christie before she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is'nt your parents on their week long anniversary vacation, you should be home watching Robin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is'nt til next week.\" said Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie, Julie's sick and she's pretty contagious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saskia, you seem like your trying to keep me from seeing Julie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! I'm not trying too keep you from seeing Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Julie where are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the kitchen.\" said Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was about to enter the kitchen when Saskia stoped her and said: \"Julie please do'nt think I'm a freak but I kinda been feeding Julie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie started too walk again while saying: \"Why would I think your a fre...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Christie could finish speaking she saw an extremely stuffed Julie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean feed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Christie thought of her idea. She also remembered when she promised Robin that she would'nt over stuff her....Christie did'nt say anything about Saskia! Christie could'nt believe her eyes, Julie was so stuffed her stomach was half way  to the middle of her thighs! But why was it so shiny? When Christie looked at Julie's face she somehow had a look of pain and happyness. Christie was wondering how is she this lucky!

Really surprising Saskia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W..w..what! I thought you would think I'm a freak and would stop being my friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I stop being your friend when I've been doing the same thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait you've been fatening up Robin? So that's why she is so fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's Robins own doing, I've just recently started fatening her up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels so great telling someone else about this.\" Said Saskia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know does'nt it! but I want to ask you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Asked Saskia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to know if you would help me faten up Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so great! She was the reason I've got the idea to faten Julie up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saskia, why is Julie's stomach so shiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's just the stuff I put on it so Julie would'nt get any strechmarks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they told each other about their plans to faten up their sisters and made a decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So you two can stay with us. But won't your parents mind that you two are with us for a whole week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Not really. You know they're both working so they only come home late. As long if i keep good grades they don't mind if i we stay over at your place for a whole week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if YOU keep good grades?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Julie is still in kindergarten. She does't get grades. Besides, what grades can you get for painting a dog that looks like a brown spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie heard a schrapping sound and looked up. Jullie slowly crawled over. Her belly was hanging towards the ground. Jullie did't wore a shirt so Christie could clearly see her bare belly. She opened the buttons of her pants and her zipper was forced all the way down so her belly had more room. <br>\r\nShe crawled over too the T.V too watch some cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's settled. See you then. Now i need to go home or else Robin will be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's settled?\" Jullie asked Saskia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We stay over at their place next week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked home. She fellt very happy. Now she could stuff Robin together with a friend and she could talk with her friend about it. This was perfect. She looked forward too next week. Her parents were away and there would probably be someone too watch them. Well someone who would clean, shopping, cook and make sure they would't be in bed too late and won't end up in any trouble but who did't mind if she would feed her sister.<br>\r\nShe got home and opened the door and walked inside. She walked without making a sound. Christie was an expert in walking without making a sound and hiding. Some kids at school said she would be a great ninja and should go too a ninja school. She was sometimes thinking about it but that's another story. <br>\r\nShe could hear the sound of the T.V. She saw the cartoon Juniper Lee was on. She also heard someone munching on something. She walked inside and saw Robin eating  coockies out of a big box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Christie. You weren't here when i woke up so i took some cookies by myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie smiled. This was even going better the she expected. She was't the only one who was fattening Robin. Robin was also busy herself fattening her up but did't know she was doing it. Al least Christie did't think Robin knew. The truth was that Robin did't really thought about that while her belly was again poking out from under her shirt. Robin tried again to pulling it down and again it failed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid shirt.\" She mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled of her shirt and rolled it up till a ball and threw it in a corner of the room.Christie looked at Robin and loved it seeing Robin's bare belly. Slowly her eyes slid up to Robins chest. Even some of her fat gatherd there.<br>\r\nRobin continued watching T.V and stuffing herself with cookies. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n Christie walked too the kitchen and saw her mother already made a grocery list. She took a pencil and wrote on the most fattening snacks on it she could think of and placed the note back on the refrigerator and went sitting at the kitchen table looking through some magazines like nothing had happened.<br>\r\nSuddenly Robin walked in<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Eh Christie i finished the box of cookies. I was wondering could you put on some more of those CD's?  I like them.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChristie grinned. \"Sure. You get some food and something too drink and i will put on a nice story too listen while you eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do i really still need too eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made a deal. You would eat twenty four seven and i would't stuff you. Remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides next week Saskia and Julie come over here for the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked up. She and Jullie could get along pretty well. They were about the same age and liked the same things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now go get some food and i will look for a nice story.\"</span></div></div>",

They were calling each other talking about things they could do to fatten up their sisters faster.<br>\r\nBoth were also feeding their sister when ever they could.<br>\r\nChristie also got the same stuff Saskia had taken to prevent Jullie for having stretchmarks. She did't want to let Robin's belly be one hill full of stretchmarks.<br>\r\nRobin was also slowly gaining each day. The day before they went on vacation Christie advised her mother too do some clothing shopping for Robin since all Robins clothes were lately getting too small. Their mother also noticed and the two of them bought some new elastic clothes.<br>\r\nWhen Christie went that day too bed she almost could't wait for tomorrow.When she finally fell asleep it was past midnight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie! Christie! Christie!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what? What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and saw Saskia standing before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up Goldilocks. I would stay here a few days so we could fatten up our sisters. Remember? You're not suddenly want too stop do you?\" Saskia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't worry. I really looked forward too this. It was just late asleep last evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad that's only that.Jullie is in the living room with Robin. Besides nice job you did with your little sister. She has really grown the past days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'll be down in a sec. Just give me a few minutes to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I can wait here. It's not like i've never seen a girl naked bef...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be down in a sec!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaskia walked downstairs. Robin and Jullie were both still were she left them. In front of the T.V watching cartoons while eating the most fattening snacks she could find. Her older cousin Jeff bought them over the Internet. He did't know where she was using them for but did't really cared. She still had some boxes of them left in her backpack with some other stuff he bought.<br>\r\nA few minutes later Christie came down in some fire red clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i'm ready. What shall we do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them just eat those snacks. They have more calories then a entire chocolate pie. But further we must be sure they don't burn any calories by exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that won't be too hard. Robin never was the sportive kid.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i know but i want that the only exercise they have is from the sleeping room to the living room. From the living room to the dining room and from there back to the living room and then back too the sleeping room. Anything they need we get it for them. This way they will gain even faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what are you mean!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the best. Do you know a way to keep them there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you say it yes. I have some of those CD's were people read a book for kids who can't read yet. Robin likes them and she just lies and eats while listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea. I think Jullie likes that too. Else we can always read some books for them. I also took some movies for them too watch and this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw a few little bags on the table filled with white powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that. Icing sugar. Wait it is't coke right or drugs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't worry. It's totally legal. I think. Anyway it's weight gain powder that slow's metabolism increases the hunger and turns all what they eat in 100% pure fat. No side effects just for fattening up our little sisters. We just need too mix it in their food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing dong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's the doorbell. Must be the babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Babysitter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think our parents leave us one weak all one our own right. There is just someone to cook, clean and shop but i don't think we will have any trouble from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Christie if she needs to shop your mom also left some money right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh right so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if it's enough we could wrote some extra fattening snacks on the grocery list.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Great. Do that. I'm sure my mom left about double as much money if needed. Now i need to answer the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie opened the door for...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My parents come from Switzerland. They called me after a girl from a famous Switser's tale: Heidi. Ever heard from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so.

Bye now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie almost pushed Heidi upstairs. After Heidi walked to her room Christie walked back too the living room. Jullie and Robin were still busy stuffing themselves with the fattening snacks. Saskia pushed the weight gain powder deep in her backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this will be all right. She looks nice and a bit chubby. Her parents come from Switzerland.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Saskia asked interesting. \"Do you know they have one of the most fattening candy? Chocolate!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she knows some fattening recipes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. When she comes down we just need to ask her to make fattening food. Then we need to make sure Julie and Robin get the powder in their food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm maybe we can get that girl so far they can eat in front of the T.V. They burn even less calories then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I wrote up the most fattening snacks on the grocery list. Now all we have too do is make sure our two little piggies of sisters stay on the couch and keep being fed. I have a lot of cartoons with me they can watch. I can't wait to see how they'll look at the end of the week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at Jullie whilel taking another snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have gotten a bit fatter since i saw you last time.\" Robin said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too you know.\" Jullie said pushing her big belly against Robin's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(giggle) That feels funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls continued to listen at stories stuffing themselves with the fattening treats adding more fat to their bodies.     <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I have some questions. You gonna cook here right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do you cook with a lot of fat in it or do you cook low fat or do you just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cook normally with fat in my food. You can see that.\" She said and patted her round potbelly. \"But if you two have problems with that and want to contain your figure, and especially your sisters could use some low fat food then i could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no. Our sisters like fatty food. It's no problem if they get a lot of fatty food. But right we try to keep our figure. So if could try too cook some food for our sister as fat if you like and for us with less fat. Oh We like it to eat in front of the T.V so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry. I also eat always in front for the T.V so i don't mind if we eat in front of the T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and further you don't have to really worry about us. We can take good care of ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two sisters of you have a good appetite. Are't you worried the're maybe a bit... fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No not really. I know they are fat but we're not worried about it. Besides if my parents were worried about Robin's weight they would have told you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's true. She can be so happy that her parents don't care about her weight. My parents did when i was young and i hated it. But at the other hand, if they did't forced me to diet i would't even fit through the door now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie rolled with her eyes. She looked at Robin and Jullie and saw they were almost out of food. She gave Saskia a soft kick under the table to get her attention and nodded into the direction of their sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know i will let you show our house. Then you know where you can find everything.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks that's very nice.\" Heidi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie pulled her out of the kitchen and Saskia walked over to the cupboard and took out two extra large bags of chips. She also took two bottles of Coca cola. She smiled one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if anyone would notice if the wrote instead Coca Cola, Caco Calo. Hm! Probably not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the chips and Cola to Robin and Julie who were both rubbing their bellies. Saskia reached in her bag and took the lotion and rubbed their bellies in with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two still hungry?\" She softly pinched in their bellies. \"Oh come on you two are't even half vol. Here have some chips, and of course something to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave them both a bag of chips and a bottle of Cola. Robin opened her bottle took greedy a few big sips and let out a huge loud belch. Saskia an Jullie giggled. Jullie took a few big sips from her cola but could't let out more then a small belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on you two eat those chips before they get cold. Wait that makes no sense. Eh... eat those chips anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Jullie both lifted their shoulders and ripped open her bag of chips<br>\r\nSaskia smiled seeing how the two girls were stuffing themselves with the fatty food adding even more fat to their bodies. She almost could't wait until dinner when she was able to use the weight gain powder. She was looking forward too  how they would look like at the end of the week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Everyone would think that except me.

Millions and millions. I don't think we're the only ones. Even if we are... so what? Besides i don't think they mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we're gonna use those week to fatten them up good.

So you're gonna eat the pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Julie both looked at their bloated guts that pushed their shirts up and their shirts were stretched too the maximum.

Julie fast started to rub her belly hoping she could find some more room. When Robin saw it she did the same.<br>\r\nIn ten minutes they heard the microwave. PING!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the Pizza is done. Now i hope you two are hungry. You both need to eat the half of it. I cut in in six slices so three for each one of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed both girls a plate with three slices. Robin slowly opened her mouth and bite by bite the slice disappeared in her mouth. The next moment she heard a ripping sound when her shirt ripped in half. Robin did't deem to notice and slowly pushed another slice in her mouth. After it was gone Her pants suddenly split at both sides. But Robin kept eating. For some reason now she wanted to finish it too show she could.<br>\r\nJulie was halfway the first slice but really did't feel like she could eat another bite. Julie fold what was left of her first slice  and pushed it in one time in her mouth and chewed it but now came the hard part, swallow it. I took her a lot of trouble but she managed it to keep the first slice down. Meanwhile Robin ate slowly but surly the entire last slice of pizza but it did't looked like Julie could do that. She seemed like she almost need to throw up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heidi i really don't think Julie can do this!\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they told me too make sure you two ate it all.\" She looked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin fast took a slice from Julie when Heidi did't looked and pushed it in her mouth. Julie looked thankful at her and started too eat the last one. Halfway with a loud RIIIIIIIIIIIIIP! her pants split and her shirt ripped in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i feel a lot better now!\" Julie said and ate the remains of the latest slice.\" Oh i think i need too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opened her mouth. Robin prepared herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!!! Wow i feel a lot better now.\"        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See i know you two could do it. Oh i also got some lotion i needed to rub that on your bellies to prevent stretchmarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls wore nothing except for their underwear and were both too full too move.

How does that sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Robin said too young too notice Christie just moved the problem instead of solving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked over too Heidi and a they went too the car. Robin could't help herself she kept thinking she forget something. But what. Christie and Heidi got dinner. For her and... Then it hit her. Christie never asked her what she wanted. In fact she could order a lot of food and Robin would be kind of forced to eat it.<br>\r\nRobin fast started too rub her belly. Hoping she would get more room in her tummy. At the same time she liked rubbing the ball of fat that was her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're back!\" She heard from the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie and Heidi walked in with bags from the snack bar. Christie put a family sized bag of fries in front of her. But Christie went even further. She also ordered five croquette's and also five minced meat hot dogs. Robin's eyes got big. She ate so much during the day and now also this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie is really turning me into a circus fat lady.\" She whispered too herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered about a half year ago the went too a fair. It was very funny but Christie also wanted to see a freak show. Some of them were fake like the girl with no head. but the girl with no legs was real. Just like to boys who were attached to each other or the boy with three arms. However he could't really move the third one. Between others there was also a really fat lady only wearing a super sized bikini that was eating. Robin remembered her very good since she thought it looked so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin you're not eating.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin decided that she could't say no. Christie promised not to stuff her if she would eat all the time. She remembered the deal. There was also that Heidi girl that wanted her too eat enough. Well the reason was because else their parents thought she did't take good care of them alt lease she had an excuse. But if this continued she would be a circus fat girl when her parents got back.<br>\r\nShe grabbed the bag of fries and slowly started eating them. Not too fast or else her tummy would be full before she was done eating.<br>\r\nChristie put on the movie: Mary Poppins. Even while Robin and Christie did't always got along both loved the Mary Poppins movie. Especially when she unpacked her bags. Christie was too busy watching the movie to notice how slowly she ate. She now and then looked at Robin but as long if she saw her eating it was fine.<br>\r\nRobin also focused on the movie so she hardly noticed how full she got until the bag was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!\" Robin let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow now that was a big one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel so well.\" Robin mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not you're still hungry.\" Christie said with an evil grin. Should i help you?\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nRobin looked at Christie even while her tummy hurt she mumbled: \"All right.\"  <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe knew Christie would force her too eat it but now she could just lay back and only needed to chew. In the meantime she rubbed her belly. After the were busy with the fourth croquette she heard a small ripping noise and noticed even her underwear was ripped. Not that it minded. He big thighs and huge belly covered her private parts. Christie did't mind and fed Robin further after the last bite of minced meat hot dog went past her lips and in her belly Robin fell asleep on the couch. Her belly sticking out forward. Hard and tight like a drum. Christie smiled seeing her big, fat, bloated, sister.   </span></div></div>",

She waddled to the T.V to watch some cartoons. <br>\r\nThere was one thing she did't liked of cartoons. The girls were all terribly skinny. At school there were skinny, slender, normal, chubby, fat and obese kids. A nice mix of different sized kids. There was no way that every girl was so slender like in the cartoons. Not only the head characters since that would be logical but also the slutty cheerleaders, what also would be logical, but also the bitches, the background characters. Except for their chests and thighs not one had any fat on them. There's no way all kids were that size. But why were't there any fat heroes in cartoons? Even when the heroes stuffed themselves fat after a few minutes they were back too their regular sizes. Sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If i'm gonna make cartoons it's gonna be about fat girls!\" Robin said loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hated adventures were the girls got captured and could't do anything but sit on their butt until a handsome man saved them. No the girls need to be able too save themselves but they would be fat just like she was. She grinned while thinking about it. <br>\r\nShe suddenly heard a door upstairs and ran too the kitchen and took a box of cookies from the cupboard and ran back too the T.V. She ripped the box open and pushed the first cookie in her mouth. She was smart enough to make sure Christie could't see how empty or how full the box was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Robin.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up. You could see that because the red lines in her eyes. and her face was still red and a bit puffy. She still wore her nightie that was kind of wide at Christie's slender body, and her hair looked like a exploded mattress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see you're eating. Good. Did you by any chance saw those dough nuts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I saw them.\" Robin said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really were are they?\" She asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh in here.\" She said and patter her fat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you ate them.

She does everything for her without complaining and it seems like she likes it. I don't mind they don't fight or bicker anymore but I think it's strange since from one on the other day they stop. I don't think it's normal. I think there must be something going on. I don't know what, and that's bothering me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... Sometime there's something going on between two kids that only they understand. I would't worry about it. Be happy there nice for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa played a bit with her hair. She always did that wen she worried or where nervous or did't knew a answer. She did that since kindergarten and never stopped doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just worry a bit.

She never worried about Robin's weight and saw now reason in starting now. After all Robin always used to have a big appetite. That was perfectly normal.

Christie saw Robins shirt struggling to hold in her belly and that made her feed Robin faster. Robin only stopped to drink the fattening milkshakes Christie made for her. Robin managed to eat the whole pot of spaghetti and a gallons worth of milkshakes. Robins shirt had ripped and her belly was shone in all its glory.

Christie managed to hide any evidence of the days earlier stuffing and even got Robin a new shirt. She sneaked away a box of cereal and a pack of cookies. Robin smiled and rubbed her gurgling belly preparing for her next feeding session. Christie stuffed Robin throughout the rest of the day, making sure to keep her belly drum tight with food as much as she could. At dinner, Robin felt fairly stuffed but dove into lasagna as though she hadn't eaten all day. She needed to have that overstuffed feeling like she was going to pop. Christie smiled as she watched her pig of sister gorge herself. Robin had a total of four helpings of lasagna and her belly was the biggest that it had ever been. She was too stuffed to leave the dinner table and Christie was very happy about that. She rubbed and petted her sisters exposed belly whose shirt just couldn't cover it anymore. She laid her head on Robin's belly and smiled as she heard it gurgling monstrously in an effort to digest its large load. Christie pulled out one of the many gallons of ice cream from the freezer and opened it up. Robin smiled and rubbed her belly. Christie started feeding Robin who moaned as she took each bite. Each bite made her belly hurt more and gurgle louder. Half way through the ice cream Robin started hiccuping and feeling dizzy. Christie decided to stop before Robin got sick. The food needed to stay inside of Robin in order for her to grow</span></div></div>",

Robin sat up on her bed eagerly and placed her hands on her still full belly. Christie poured the bottled down Robin's throat and watched happily as her sister's stomach grew.

She belched and groaned feeling the food and carbonated liquid battle inside her.<br>\r\n\"Time for the ice cream,\"Christie said with a smile. She opened the 2 gallon container and began to feed her fat sister the frozen treat. Robin's belly ached more and more with each bite; she rubbed her belly happily. It took a little longer but all of the ice cream ended up inside Robin. Her belly was enormous and some how the buttons on her pajamas hadn't popped. Christie grabbed the last bottle of soda and forced it down Robin's throat. The buttons flew off, unable to take the strain any longer. Robin belched loudly and groaned from the amount of pain she was in, but it felt so good. She wanted to feel like this all the time and Christie was more than happy to help.

Christie and Lisa made sure Robin always had some food. Robin could eat a lot more now then before. Robin ate until she felt the nice hurt. The only problem Robin was that she woke up every morning hungry. Her belly was used to have food all the time. When Robin went to bed she need to spend several hours without food. However when she woke up there was always a big breakfast for her.<br>\r\nRobins dad did't really minded this at all. Sure he noticed Robin was gaining a bit and eating more but his wife was with her and Robin's mother would't do anything to hurt her sweet, little, fat daughter. She would know best. Christie also turned out fine. So why would that be different with Robin. He also must admit that there was less bickering between the two sisters. Christie and Robin could bicker for hours. But lately they had't done it for some time. That was nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin woke up one morning with a belly howling for food. Robin wanted to be fed. She rubbed her belly. It was all soft and squishy. Robin liked it when her belly felt that way but that mend that it was empty. She waddled downstairs to were the food was. But when she entered the kitchen there was no food. Robin could't believe it. She saw her mother and sister sitting at the table. But they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry!\" Robin said. \"I'm hungry can I have some food? I want food now! My belly is empty! Get me some FOOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake it easy there little eating machine. We have a surprise for you. But for that you need to get dressed first.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I have something to eat first. Or at least something to nibble on?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Lisa said loudly. \"Come on Robin. I help you get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin let her mother pull her to her room. Lisa got Robin out of her pajamas and dressed her however it was hard to find fitting clothes. Finally she got Robin in some cut of jeans and a fire red sweater. Still you could still see sliver of white flesh but it would need to do for now. Robin was just staring did't really noticed what happened. The only thing she knew was that she was hungry and wanted food. Her belly needed to be filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa pulled Robin in the car on the backseat. She had gotten to fat for the kid seat. Robin was wondering what was happening. She had been pretty long without food. Especially if you noticed how much food she was consuming daily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this Robin. This is the surprise.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Robin asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did't even noticed her mother took her in a restaurant. She looked around and smiled. So she would soon get some nice food. But Lisa shove the menu under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See this Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't have a clue what it says. Because I can't read. They did't teach us that in kindergarten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It's called a super menu. You will get a huge amount of food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled and suddenly saw the prize by the super menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's pretty expansive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Robin I'm not planning to pay a penny for it.\" Lisa said with a smile. \"Did you those writing below the prize?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What does it says?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That If you're able to eat all the food, on your own, It's free! That's why I did't want you to eat because you need enough room in your tummy for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will it be miss?\" A waiter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two breakfasts and one sure menu?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For who of you two is the super menu?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's for her.\" Lisa said and pointed at Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waiter seemed surprised. Not many people had been  able to eat a entire super lunch. And now this kindergartner thought she was able to. True she never saw a kid so fat. A huge belly in her lap, a butt that was hanging over the edge of the chair. A head with two puffy pink cheeks that looked like she stuffed a jawbreaker in each of them and no neck. Her head that was melted to her chest, a chest with boobs that most teenage girls would look at with envy. Rubbing thighs and pillow like arms. Perhaps this girl would be able to eat it all. She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right away mam.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRobin was looking at the paintings at the wall and playing a bit with her knife and fork. Then the food arrived and her mouth started to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat to fast honey. Remember there's more coming.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin started eating.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let her rest and digest and I'll get started on some more food.\" Christie did as she was told without hesitation. Robin was a little confused about what just happened but was exhausted from eating so much. She got on the couch and rubbed her mountain of a belly.

She liked this kind of pain. She wanted to feel it more often and made moaning sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right with the piggy. Or did the fat piggy eat to much?\" Christie asked on a sweet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie softly patted Robin's belly. It was as hard if a rock and as stretched like a drum. Christie thought a moment to start drumming on her sisters belly but decided not to. Perhaps that made her throw up and that way Robin would't gain. Christie was happy with this result but she was amazed how much food Robin was able to eat. Robin would become so fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was also surprised. Sill if she was stuffed Christie forced more food down her throat and until now she always had been able to hold it down. She also noticed how full her belly was but thought about the fact eating so much stretched her stomach so in the future she would be able to eat more. Besides what would't kill you makes you stronger.<br>\r\nBut anyway she was so full she was't able to move. At least not for some time.<br>\r\nChristie enjoyed Rubbing and patting Robins tight belly but fast stopped when her mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Robin is tired but I doubt she can walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at Robin and how big and stretched her belly was. She looked doubtful at Christie<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie is something going with you Robin and her eating?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No. Why?  What could possibly be going on?\" Christie lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well not too long ago we were at Mc Donalds and you did't seem to fond or Robins eating. You thought she ate too much and now you seem to feed her instead of wanting her to eat less. Besides I saw you almost the entire day with Robin and Robin seemed all the time busy chewing on something. You and Robin are't the best friends, so what is going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing mom. What could go on?\" Christie lied again sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa knew exactly when her children lied but decided to leave it for this time. It was time to put Robin in bed.

She could usually hack it, but Lisa's hands sunk into her daughter's flesh under her arms. Flesh Linda was sure Robin didn't have before. Hrm. She didn't have any illusions about Robin being a thin girl so the mom pulled hard. Lisa's well developed arms, especially her biceps, contracted and precious little had happened by the time she completed the lift. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis came as a shock to everyone, even Christie, who normally admired her mother's athleticism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh,\" chortled Christie. \"I guess she put on a few, <i>again</i>.\" Sneering, she stuck a finger in her sister's belly button and dug in. It caused the softer parts where fat collected on her belly to cave in. It was incredibly deep. Robin giggled from her sister's prodding. When Christie relaxed the slightest bit, her tummy forced her finger out. Christie was surprised, holding that finger in front of her face in awe and smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Robin looked at her mom. \"Mommy I want up!\" the heavy child demanded obstinately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt her daughter's prompting, she tried harder, putting herself closer to the ground and lifting farther. She groaned loudly with effort but was, once more, unsuccessful. She only succeeded in pushing more of her daughter's belly out. The titanic tummy sprouted, surrendering more flesh to the open air, before Christie's eyes, as the inadequate shirt dragged up. The attempt also caused a weak pants button to croak loudly, and then give up under pressure. It collided with Christie's hard ab muscles with a surprising amount of force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Linda spoke: \"I'm trying honey, but you gained weight.\" Then she peered over her daughter's form from where she stood behind her. That spare tire that sagged and looked especially bloated in the front attracted a lot of attention. What an incredibly wide, gentle curve. She was almost spherical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you expect, mom?\" Christie quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! Mom can't carry me anymore!!\" Robin celebrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you like walking then,\" Christie reminded, slowly patting her unbelievable Buddha belly. Robin looked down, dejected. That shut her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're gonna help me get her upstairs if we have to,\" Linda ordered, which caused Christie to protest against inequity. She had it up to here with all of Robin's coddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this, while Linda tried for the third time to lift her enormous daughter. Her mom's struggle caused her rubbery skin to stretch and her fat rolled around her bones like pudding. But no matter what, no actual lifting. She ordered Christie over, and together they tried a fireman's carry. With the fat five year old draped awkwardly across their collective shoulders, they trudged up the stairs. The amount of pressure Robin exerted upon them was big. Christie could swear she felt her spine compressing. She and her mother groaned and grunted their way to the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's bed was in sight! Linda unloaded her burdensome daughter. Standing on the floor, Robin climbed up into bed, somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She looked at the other side of the bad and noticed it was empty. Seemed like Robin was already awake. Christie stretched herself once. She looked at herself in the mirror. She thought she looked pretty good with her slender body. In each case better then her fat ass sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is that fat pig?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie was still angry about what happened last night. Not that Robin broke her bed. But that her mother let Robin sleep in her bed, saying that there was enough room there. Fine there was enough room there, but still why did she need to share her bed with her fat sister just because she was so fat she broke her bed. That she was responsible for those extra pounds on Robin that were too much for the bed was something she did't cared about. Besides her mom could't know what she was doing. Could she?<br>\r\nChristie jumped out of bed and got dressed, and after brushing her hair a bit she walked downstairs.<br>\r\nRobin was in her pajamas watching a cartoon while eating a family sized bag of pretzels. Her fat tummy poked out between her pajama pants and shirt. Robin looked kind of happy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll pay for this.\" Christie whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over too the cupboard and got different kind of jars and cans and walked over to Robin and dropped everything on the couch. Robin looked up at her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat it! All of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin's pudgy hands tried to open the first jar. After three failed attempts to open the jar Christie snatched it away and opened it for her. Gave it her and Robin fast started to eat while Christie opened jars and cans. <br>\r\nChristie smiled. Those things would be kind of heavy on the stomach of a five tear old. She planned to get all of this in her sisters tummy. See what her parents thought of their precious fat daughter is she had eaten all of the cans and jars.<br>\r\nRobin ate it all without a second thought. She even drank the juice that were in the cans with fruit. <br>\r\nChristie looked in the refrigerator and saw a pie her mother made for a baking contest and placed in next to Robin. It was a chocolate pie and Robin loved everything that was entirely, partly or tasted like chocolate.<br>\r\nRobin smiled. Stuffing her belly each day made her stomach cape able of holding more food each day. After she emptied all the cans and jars she started on the chocolate cake wolfing it down like a starved animal. She rested on the couch and Christie walked back to her room. Now she just needed to wait. She knew her parents would be furious at Robin. She careful brought on some make-up while she waited for her parents to wake up. Finally she heard her parents wake up up and walking downstairs. She waited a minute and walked after them wondering how angry they would be at Robin for eating that all.. But when she got down stairs she saw how her mother rubbed the belly of a hiccuping Robin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my sweet little pumpkin. Did you eat a bit too much? Does your belly hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*hiccup* \"Yes mommy. I was hungry *hiccup* and ate a bit too *hiccup* too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my poor baby. I will get some sprite for you. That always helps a upset stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie could't believe this. her mother still pampered Robin. Did she even noticed Robin ate her chocolate cake? Why was her mother so proud at her fat daughter. She was the oldest, the first born. She should have to come on the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa returned with some sprite for Robin and sat down next to Robin and rubbed her belly while Christie grind one's teeth from anger.    <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Lisa fastened the seat belt over her daughter's swollen midsection with some difficulty, and then they were off. <br>\r\nThey soon arrived at the furniture shop, and they both got out the car and entered. Inside were chairs  and tables and beds and all other sorts of furniture. Robin waddled over to the beds and sat down on the closest one to catch her breath. It had been a short walk from the car to inside the shop, but the young girl was worn out.<br>\r\nBeneath her, the wooden bed supports groaned ominously, and Lisa quickly pulled her daughter back to her feet before she destroyed any more furbiture. Nearby, a shopping assistant spotted them and hurried over.<br>\r\n\"Hello, can I help you with anything?\" He asked politely.<br>\r\n\"Erm, yes. We're looking to buy a new children's bed.\"<br>\r\n\"Right. Follow me; we have an extensive range of junior beds just over here...\"<br>\r\nThe shopping assistant led them round the corner, revealing a large selection to choose from.<br>\r\n\"Is the bed for the young madam?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Yes, it is.\" She looked around. \"Which of these would you suggest?\"<br>\r\n\"How about this one?\"<br>\r\nHowever, when Robin heaved herself onto it, the entire frame bent inwards. It was the same with the next they tried, and the next was too high for Robin to climb onto, even with her mothers help. Another was too narrow. Finally, the assistant shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Fine. There's only one thing for it; I'll have to show you... The Steel Sleeper.\"<br>\r\nHe led then through to a back room. By thus point, Robin was exhausted from walking round the shop,  reaching heavily and irregularly as she waddled after the two adults. However, when she reached the back room, she knew she had found the bed for her. It was low and wide, with six legs, three along each side. The entire frame, including the legs, was made of reenforced stainless steel. It was horrendously ugly, but at that moment, to Robin it was as beautiful as Heaven itself.<br>\r\nShe pushed past her mother and scrambled onto the bed, and almost instantly her eyes were shut and she was asleep.<br>\r\nLater, Lisa found out that not only was the bed unattractive, unmanoeuvrable and awkward, it was also put seq break in fly expensive.<br>\r\nStill...

That was worth it. <br>\r\nLisa needed some help to get the sleeping Robin out of the bed and into her car. She was in such a deep sleep she did't woke up. Lisa took the bed. It took some time before they got the bed home and in her room but finally it was there. Robin slept the whole time.

Robin happy took the box from her mother and stuffed her mouth full with cookies and smiled at her mother.<br>\r\nLisa smiled at her and saw suddenly how her pants button popped of to the other end of the kitchen and Robins belly poked out. Robin did't noticed or else did't care.<br>\r\nLisa was't too worried about it.

Robin froze where she stood and tool a look around at the counters. There wan't just breakfast food out in the kitchen. It looked as though half the food in the fridge was out.<br>\r\n\"I-I'm not full yet\" Robin said cautiously.<br>\r\n\"Well looks I cam just in time,\" Christie said. She grabbed a bowl of chicken fingers and pinned Robin in a corner. \"Look, you know <i>where</i> this food is going to end up one way or another.\" <br>\r\nRobin sighed in defeat and waddled to a chair. She tried to prepare herself for the tummy pain she was about feel. One by one the chicken fingers disappeared into Robin's stomach. Next came granola bars, then lasagna, cookies. Her belly was swollen and her shirt refused to cover it. <br>\r\n\"I'm sure the parents won't notice a missing box of cereal\" Christie said with an evil smile. But to her surprise, Robin smiled back. <br>\r\n\"I like it when my belly hurts from food\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"Well that'll make things easier for me and I'm positive you'll start growing faster.\" Christie said. She walked over to Robin with the first bowl of cereal. When the box was empty Robin's stomach was drum tight. \"Does it hurt?\" Christie asked \"Because we won't be done until it hurts\"<br>\r\nRobin's belly was stuffed but it wasn't hurting the way Christie usually made it. She shook her head no and Christie went to the freezer. She pulled out an unopened gallon box of ice cream and Robin's eyes lit up. Scoop by scoop the ice cream disappeared into Robin's stuffed paunch. Christie didn't stop until the box was empty. At the end Robin looked like she swallowed a balloon and her belly definitely hurt. She let out a belch and rubbed her aching belly happily</span></div></div>",

I... like... it.\" Robin said rubbing her swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie smiled and looked round on the kitchen and started cleaning up the kitchen. She threw away the empty packages, boxes and stuffed them in the thrash can. She cleaned the table and the entire kitchen while Robin rubbed her gut. Finally she cleaned everything. No one could see that a some time ago two girls had a feeding session. Except perhaps for the swollen belly of a five year old girl.<br>\r\nRobin got out of her chair and waddled over to the couch. She was in pain but a good pain.<br>\r\nShe remembered she was once stung by a bee. She also tripped and scrapped her knee. Scratched by a angry cat. All those times it hurt. It also had't been much fun. It did't feel good But now... this time... She enjoyed the pain. Before Christie started feeding her she never thought she could like pain but now she did. She could't explain, not even to herself why she liked the pain so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting so fat.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe always wanted to be fat. She sometimes saw those commercials where people told them how much weight they lost and how they liked it. Robin would have hated it if she would lose weight. She did't understand about those girls who counted calories. Well perhaps too know which thing contained the most calories so you could get fat, but they picked the stuff with hardly any calories. Mostly they only picked a salad.<br>\r\nRobin would pick what she liked and hoped it was fattening. Just eat what you like. That was a much more fun diet if you asked her. At lest she liked it more. Way more. Why did so much other people wanted to lose weight. She did't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!!! Oops. Excuse me. My belly is just full of food. BUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRP!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is my little piggy doing?\" Christie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the couch and put her hands on her hips and looked smiling at her fat sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you like that? You fat ass! You fatty! You fatso!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Robin said with a smile. \"I did like it. The pain feels good. By the way Christie... I wanna be a fat ass. Also a fatty, and a fatso!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked surprised but suddenly both heard their parents coming down. Christie smiled just like she and Robin had done nothing strange. Robin did her best to smile but the pain in her belly made it hard. The next moment their parents walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning family. How are my two beautiful girls?\"John asked with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two girls? Don't you mean three girls? Those two and this one?\" Lisa asked with a teasing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a girl any more sweetie. You're a woman. Besides I already saw you when I woke up.<br>\r\n        </span></div></div>",

We can't have that tummy aching until <i>after</i> dinner\" Christy emphasized. She fed another piece of pie to the bloated toddler. For the past half hour, they've gone through two packs of cookies, a two liter bottle of pepsi and one fruit pie and were finishing up second one. Robin's abdomen was already rather bloated. Christie fed Robin the last piece of pie and quickly discarded the evidence of the stuffing session. Robin happily rubbed her stuffed paunch eager to feel the pain dinner was going to bring and the pounds that were sure to follow.<br>\r\n\"I wish I could be stuffed silly all the time\" Robin said.<br>\r\n\"Like in pain all the time?\" Christie asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I love the way my belly looks and feels after you feed me. And it always looks bigger afterwards\" Robin replied.<br>\r\n\"Well I can make that happen.

Robin was more waddling inside. But she could wait. She knew Christie would stuff her. She looked at the table. There were potatoes, greasy gravy, some broccoli and some sausages. Lisa always made a lot of food since she knew Robin could eat a lot and if there were leftovers she could always put them in the fridge for later. Besides Robin always to liked it eat some leftovers during lunchtime. So it was never a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does't daddy eat with us?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No he needed to work.\" Lisa said and frowned. \"Or perhaps he's looking football with some of his friends.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nRobin lifted her shoulders. She did't understand too much from football and could't understand why people liked it so much. But she knew it was very popular. But if you thought about it, it was kind of strange. You ran after a ball and when you finally have it you kick it away again. She was more focused at the food on the table. <br>\r\nHer mother put a big portion on her plate and a smaller one for Christie. Robin started to stuff her face. Christie on the other hand was thinking. Stuffing Robin silly was gonna be a lot easier if their mother was out of the room. <br>\r\nBut after Robin ate her second course Lisa stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I still have some sewing to do. Could you two be so kind to clean the table when you're done eating? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mom. No problem.\" Christie said. \"Can we also have some dessert after wards?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't see a reason why not.\" Lisa said while she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at Christie with sparkling eyes. She looked forward to this all day. he opened her mouth wide and the next moment Christie stuffed a spoon full of potatoes in her mouth. Robin liked this. She did't need to do much. Except open her mouth, chew and swallow. Robin liked this but she was't in pain yet. But she liked eating. <br>\r\nSome of other kids had hobbies like sporting or dancing and most did't understood how you could have eating food as a hobby. She also remembered she once saw a girl that was stick thin who did't want to eat. She was afraid she was becoming fat. She wanted to become a model. Robin personally thought she looked ugly. Just like a bag of bones. But she did told her that of course.<br>\r\nChristie in the meantime fed Robin everything on the table. All of the potatoes , and  broccoli, and sausages. She even poured all the gravy in Robin's mouth. Robin ate it all without a second thought. Until it suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you stop Christie?\" Robin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've eaten anything for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really already I though we had more.\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we do still have dessert.\" Christie said and smiled at Robin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked over to the freezer. She opened it and take out several gallons of ice cream. Robin looked surprised but also excited at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You said you wanted to be stuffed silly and that is what I'm gonna do. So open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin obeyed and opened her mouth wide.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Her belly was swollen, bloated and hard as a rock. It looked like if you touched it with something sharp it would explode like a balloon. She felt like there was a war going on in her belly. A war with a lot of bombs. Perhaps even a atom bomb. She belched loudly and moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin are you feeling all right?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I feel kind of sick.\" Robin moaned. \"I don't feel so *hiccup* feel so good.

If you eat more then you can handle you don't feel right and perhaps you barf it all out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had been sick once. Around that time she barfed a lot. It had been the most miserable time of her entire short life. She did't want that too happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy it really hurts. I'm in serious pain.\" Robin said with tears in her eyes. It were't fake tears. She was really crying because of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa rushed over to her and put a hand on her forehead. She felt really hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor thing.

She looked over and her eyes suddenly grew wide to find Christie.<br>\r\nChristie walked over to Robin and lifted up the blanket and Robins night top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmm, mom didn't lie when she said your belly packed tight\" Christie said as she examined Robin's belly, \"Looks like I did a good job\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you making me eat so much?\" Robin asked, distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you look your best when you're stuffed silly,\" Christie answered as she rubbed her belly, \"And it's a lot of fun for me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not for me!\" Robin whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you get eat whatever you like; don't you like that?\" Christie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

Then she took a better look at herself. She then saw why she could't get up. She was fat. Not just fat but morbidly obese. Immobile. She was way too fat too stand. Now most people would be perhaps terrified or at least a bit worried, but Robin was't one of them. She always liked being fat and wanted to get fatter. <br>\r\nShe tried to get a better look at herself. Left and right she could see two huge pillows. Or at least that what she thought first. But she then noticed that it were her arms. At least her upper arms. Her underarms were partly swallowed up by them. Even her hands and fingers were chubby.  She tried to look further but could move enough. Before her she just saw a giant hill. <br>\r\nShe noticed she still had bit mobility. She could still move her fingers. She suddenly touched something that felt like a small remote. Curious she pushed a button and suddenly the upper side of the bed suddenly went upwards.  Finally she was in a sitting position and looked further at her body.<br>\r\nShe remembered how bad Christie wanted boobs. Well she would be really jealous now cause her were huge. Bigger then DD's. They rested on a huge belly. It was without a doubt the biggest belly she had ever seen. She could't even wrap her arms around it. She could't even move her arms let alone bend them but even if she could it would't have been possible It stretched out further the her feet. She saw left and right her legs. It looked like somebody put some tires on her legs. Her legs were just rolls of fat with some chubby feet attached to it who were almost totally disappeared in her fat calves.<br>\r\n She felt great. She felt fantastic. She was almost a shapeless blob of fat. This was what she wanted. Barely being able too move.

Is that all for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is all for you. For who else would it be?\"Christie said. \"Don't worry. This is just a appetizer.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBoth of them suddenly heard a bonk.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin opened her eyes for real this time. She was in her room. She was fat but not even near how fat she had been in her dream. She was just a fat girl. She felt kind of sad. She liked being so fat. She felt so tiny now. Like a toothpick girl. The she saw what caused the: 'bonk!' sound. Her father put the T.V set in her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh sorry Robin. I did't want to wake you. But since you're sick I decided to put the T.V on your room. Then you at least can watch some T.V. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you daddy.\" Robin mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still look a bit sick.\" Her father said.\"Better stay in bed. You mommy will come later to take your temperature and give you some chicken soup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Robin smiled. She felt very weak. She knew she still was sick. But the pain in her tummy was gone. She was't stuffed and she liked chicken soup. But a other part of her thought of her dream. Could she really become that size. Why not? She could try it. She smiled. She would try it.     <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Then they had some extra fat to live on.\" She looked at Christie and smiled. \"I will tell you a little secret. I'm also an inverter. I have done some study and found out.... Well you would't understand that. However I invented some stuff that would be able to let people easy gain a lot of weight in a short amount of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked up.

The last one even made her sick. She looked again at her sister. She knew Christie her entire life. She also knew exactly when Christie faked something. Like when she faked to be crying, or faked to be sorry. She mostly knew exact what her sister did for real, and she knew her sister would't just give her some candy out of the kindness of her hart. Something else was going on. She dared to bet everything she had that it had to do something with the stuffing of her. At the other hand... she liked eating and becoming fat, so why should't she try the pills? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Lardo. I'm sure those pills are good for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at her sister one more time. She knew for sure there was something about those pills and her sister really wanted  that she ate them. But Christie did't took any other food. Probably those pills would help her. This took away her fear. She threw the pills in her mouth and swallowed them without even chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Burp! All gone. Did't taste that good.\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked to her own room and looked at the package of the pills. It might take some time before they started working. More likely tomorrow. But since Robin still was a bit sick she would't eat so much at all. But tomorrow the pills would start working. Then she would stuff Robin with the super fattening stuff.<br>\r\nRobin would probably stay home tomorrow. Lisa always let her stay home one day after she had been sick just to be sure.

Found it by a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the box on Robins bed and opened it. Inside was a pink, doughy stuff. It did look kind of good. Robin bend over it. She had't a clue what it was. But it was food and she was very hungry. She took a small piece and ate it. Robins eyes got wide. The next moment she buried her head in the stuff and was almost inhaling it. Christie did't had anything to do. Robin seemed to like it. But she doubted if it was good if Robin ate all of it at once. She could better gave every day some of it. She decided she could also better take it away now because Robin was eating so fast it would't take long before it was all gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee give that back!\" Robin yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie looked in the box and there still was about three quarter in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No lard ball.

She wondered if it was because of those pills from Christie, or because of how her mother took care of her. Anyway her mother told her she could stay home today. The T.V still stood in her room.

But why would she like it, and why her sister.<br>\r\nRobin still wolfed down every piece of food Christie gave to her. Christie hardly noticed what she gave to Robin. It did't matter. Robin ate it all. She was eating so fast Christie doubted she even tasted what she was eating. She reached for more but only touched wood. Confused she turned her head and found out why.

It took some time before Christie realized what happened. She took the box away from her little, fat sister and looked at it. She wolfed down another quarter of the stuff. She smiled. That was enough for now.<br>\r\nRobin belched loudly and after that let out a small girlie burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you just have to wait some time.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw Robin's belly.

On the bed was the fattest girl Robin had ever seen With a weight of over 300 pounds she knew she was very fat but the kid on the bed was even fatter. She was about her age but so much fatter that she could't walk what was probably the reason why she was on a bed. <br>\r\nRobin gulped. She knew that this eating contest was gonna be a competition. She knew there would be some other fat kids. but she did't expect this. At the other hand, the past two weeks she had been eating twenty-four-seven, and she still was hungry. She was eating every moment she was at home except when she was sleeping. Lisa needed to go shopping every few days. Lisa before never cared so much about Robins weight or Christies weight as long if they were happy. <br>\r\nHowever Christies weight never had been something to worry about. When she went to first class she had lost her baby fat. She also went on some activity groups and became a slender kid, and stayed a slender kid until this day.<br>\r\nHowever Lisa was a bit worried how Robins weight sky rocketed the last two weeks but she had't done anything about it. At the other hand Robin seemed happy. That was the most important for her. Also the past time there was less bickering, and fighting, and teasing between Robin an Christie. That was a good thing. She liked that her two daughter finally seemed to get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry we're late.\" The woman who pushed the bed said. \"We had trouble winding a way to get in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked at the girl. She seemed kind of cute. Had a cute face that almost drowned between her big, bowl, puffy, pink cheeks. She had orange hair in two pigtails, left and right. her belly was a mountain of fat with left and right two fat loaded boobs. Her legs looked like several tires. Pushed away left and right to make room for her giant belly. Even her arms were covered in rolls of fat. Christie wondered if this girl would be able to feed herself.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. It's still a competition. This is Kimmie Doyle. I'm sure some people remember her from last year. However she has grown since last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet I did.\" Kimmie mumbled and then she saw Robin. \"So you're my opponent toothpick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin smiled. She was extremely hungry. She had't eaten all day. Except for a few pills Christie gave her. The past two weeks she was always very hungry and with further nothing in her stomach today she was starving. But it was obvious that Kimmie also ate a lot. It could become kind of interesting. Christie saw some people made a few bets while Kimmie was wheeled to a place next to Robin. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wanted Robin to win. The prize would really help her getting Robin fatter. There was also something else. When Kimmie was wheeled in some people started to bet. She also did. Of course she put her money in on Robin. But she used most of her allowance. If Robin would't win she lost that too. Thanks to that fat Kimmie and her robotic hands. If it was't for the robotic hands Robin could easily eat faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There must be a way to stop those hands.\" She whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin had been able to keep up but Christie knew that it would be only temporary. Robin would get tired soon. She then looked better at the robotic hands.Suddenly Christie realized something. Those robotic hands were machines. Machines needed to get power from something. If you did something to the power source the machines would stop. She noticed a metal box at the end of Kimmie's bed. That would be most likely were the power source was. But how did she need to get rid of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How to stop machines from working.\" She softly whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw someone taking a sip from a drink and then she knew it. Liquids were a enemy of most electronic things. Sure some were waterproof but not all. Most likely this box was't. Now how to get some liquid on it. She then got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can I get something to drink?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can honey.\" Her mother said and gave Christie some money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie fast bought a super sized milkshake and walked closely to the bed of Kimmie. Christie grinned. She was a born actress. She did like if she was just a innocent, ordinary ten year old. She walked closer She softly poured a bit of her milkshake on the floor. Everyone was too busy watching the eating contest too notice. She did one step right on the milkshake and slipped. It worked better the she expected. She really slipped. <br>\r\nHer milkshake flew out of her hand. It landed on the box at the end. There were some: 'Bzzzzzzt!' sounds. Then a: 'Bang!' and the robotic arms stopped. <br>\r\nChristie looked up from the floor. She planned to act like if she slipped and then let the milkshake fall on the box. But she really slipped but at the other hand she reached her goal. She scraped her knees so most people would think she really fell and accidentally dropped her milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimmie at the other hand got furious when the robotic hands suddenly stopped. Robin used this opportunity too grab the lead. Kimmie tried to get the food but the fat girl hardly used her limbs the past years, that made her muscles weak while her limbs got very heavy. She was barely able to lift them at all. Leave alone get the food.<br>\r\nIn the meantime a few friendly people helped Christie up. <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" She said polite and looked at her sister </span></div></div>",

Perhaps I can have some of that leftover pie from round one after wards.\" Robin said, not noticing Christie's smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took a look at her opponent. She seemed in a bad mood. Perhaps for losing the first round. She won the second round by just a few seconds. She probably was't used to have some real competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right people.

Now she thought about it, she did't had much contact with her friends since she started feeding Robin. She also was't sure how they would react if she told them about what she was doing with Robin. Perhaps they thought she was a total freak. She must admit that fattening up your fat little sister sounded weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie are you coming?

We bought this clothes just a few days ago.\" Lisa said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past weeks with Christies feeding, and the pills, and the super fattening stuff Robin had outgrown several clothes and Lisa went about three times to the town to a clothing store for big sizes. She also did't minded she need to shop at a store for big sizes but she disliked it that she outgrew clothes that she just bought a couple of days ago. If this went on she would become poor of  buying clothes for Robin. Buying clothes and food for Robin. No matter how much food she bough it all disappeared. Most of it in Robin's huge gut. She never cared about the weight of her daughters but this was getting a bit out of hand. At the other hand.. she of course had trained for the eating contest. So perhaps the weight gain would stop now. At least she hoped it would. She decided to wait and see what happened before she started to worry. Maybe it all worked out fine.<br>\r\nOn the way home Christie rubbed Robin's belly. When they arrived home and helped Robin over to the couch Christie went sitting next too her and rubbed her belly some more. Robin made moaning sounds of pleasure.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Those. I found them in a drug store. They increase appetite. I just thought... You like eating so much. You want to gain, and how more you eat, how more you gain. Besides you ate so much you became sick. I did't want that to happen again. So I gave you some pills. Now I think about it, perhaps I should have give you just one pill at a time and save some for the contest. Oh well... what been done, has been done. Besides you won anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I was Lucky they had chocolate. Else I'm not sure if I had been able to win. Say Christie, are you able to get some more of that pink, doughy stuff. I really liked it. It was tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasty and fattening.\" Christie said, thinking she might as well tell everything. \"I got that stuff from someone who worked in third countries. You know, were some people die of starvation. because they can't afford food. Don't feel bad, that's not your fault. Not even if you eat more in a day then they have in a week. You can't do anything about it. Any way it's made for the kids there. So they easily gain some extra weight. So they have something to live on during hard times. I could have some of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why I suddenly gained so much weight. That explains a lot.\" Robin said and looked at her sister. \"But why do you do it Christie? Why?

She stayed calm and put her hands on her sisters belly. She softly pushed and pulled at it. Kneading it. This felt fantastic. She almost understood why her sister wanted to be fat. This was a terrific toy. And like some people said: The bigger the better. She had so much fun she lost track of time. I might have been hours or minutes but suddenly their mother called them for dinner.

The thought that she would be used like a guinea pig felt a bit wrong to her. She needed to test something. But at the other hand then she needed to gain. She did't have to worry about health risks.

She was't nervous but perhaps a bit excited. She threw her covers of and looked in her closet for clothes that would fit what was getting very hard. Almost all her clothes were too small. Thanks too all the weight she gained from Christie's feeding sessions. Also the training sessions for the eating contest. Also that super fattening pink doughy stuff. But she liked being this fat. She wanted to be bigger. She wanted to be huge! But that her clothes were getting too small was one of the things that she did't liked about gaining weight.<br>\r\nSuddenly the door to her bedroom opened and Lisa walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. You're up. I talked to your father and he said yes. Put on some clothes then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I don't have anything that fits.\" Robin complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess we can go clothes shopping after wards. If we need to fatten you up we might need bigger clothes anyway. But lets see. Hee I think this fits. Don't you think?\" She said holding up a pink, white dress with flowers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin stuck her tongue out and pointing with a finger in her throat. She hated dresses anyway an especially this one. But at the other hand it probably would fit. It was elastic and dresses fitted easily on people with big bellies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess you have to wear this or go naked.\" Lisa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pick naked!\" Robin said stubborn looking in disgust at the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Robin you also wore it on grandma's birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was only to do her a favor. She's old and could die any day. I don't like it to wear dresses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well do it just this one time. I'm not taking you naked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Robin was in her dress and they were both in the car on their way. Lisa stopped by a big building. Robin was a bit surprised at how it looked and let her mother took her by the wrist. They walked inside. Robin saw a woman behind a desk with a computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" Lisa said. \"I'm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I know who you are. You have a appointment. Second floor room 25.\" She said flatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Robin took the elevator too the second floor and walked too room 25 and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in!\" A voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and her mother walked in and Robin saw a big but friendly looking man. He smiled warmly at her and Robin got the idea she could trust this man completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Lisa and that little butterball must be Robin. I explain it one more time to be sure you understand what we are going to do. We give Robin a serum that would make it possible for a person to become way past morbidly obese without suffering from any health problems. After that we want Robin to gain weight. Every now and then we will do some tests to see how she is doing. If everything goes well we can bring it on the market!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand.\" Lisa said while she and Nikki signed the contract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. First we you need to see the doctor. Don't worry he's not going to give you a injection. He's just going to do some tests to see how healthy you are now. After  that you get the serum.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She then pinned Robin down and started feeding her all the leftovers from the past few nights. First to go was the spaghetti from the night before. Half of the pot was left until Christie forced it into Robin's gut. Next went a steak and half of a cherry pie. Robin's already upset stomach started to gurgle even more and she began to feel the strain of the food. Next was some chinese take out from two days ago and half a liter of soda. Christie smiled as she how Robin's belly was struggling. It looked so tight and stuffed and she could hear every gurgle and every groan it made. Finally was the jello that no one had bothered to touch. She stuffed huge chunks into Robin's overstuffed tummy until it was all gone. Christie then got off of Robin and examined her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drum tight, that's good\" she said as she traced her hands on Robin's belly. Then put her ear up to Robin's stomach. \"Sound's like total chaos in there\" Christie said with an malicious tone, \"On top of that you'll be getting fatter? There isn't a down side to this.\" Robin opened her mouth to protest but a huge belch came out instead. Christie smiled evil again. \"Get ready Robin, we're meeting up with some special people at the mall tomorrow\"</span></div></div>",

Not that Robin mind it so much. Christie and her friends liked it to buy CD's and DVD's, but not the one Robin liked. They did't went in any toy store while Robin liked it to look in them, and they spend hours in clothing and shoe store trying on clothing, shoes and boots they could't afford. Robin also often went clothing shopping with her mom but that was only because her old clothes did't fit her any more. But of course Robin also liked the fast food places. She always asked her mother if they could eat something there, and her mother normally agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good. We're almost there.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin in the meantime rubbed her belly trying to speed up it's digestion.<br>\r\nChristie took her tight by her wrist and took her outside.

Can I ask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything will become clear soon squirt.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin did't liked it if anyone called her squirt. She hated it she was short.

She honestly tried not to count during the sessions; just eat until it was over. The cinnamon roll disappeared into her already over fed gut. This was her third session with Christie's friends who worked at the mall and Robin's weight gain was all but subtle. She had put on more pounds in just 3 months; her mom had to take her clothes shopping twice. Christie brought Robin to the mall in a newer shirt that could only cover half her jiggly midsection. She always made sure Robin was already stuffed before the feedings. Robin belched before biting into the first of many burgers. She focused on eating all the food instead how uncomfortably full she was. Christie told Robin that her belly was most important. She told Robin it was her job to eat and make it fatter even if it hurt. Christie made Robin a slave to her belly which became Christie's prized possession. Each pound gained was an accomplishment as well as every shirt out grown and every button popped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin finished her second burger and groaned. Her belly was gurgling immensely from the greasy fattening food already inside it. But she had a job to do and readily took a big bite out of the next burger. Her stomach let out a disapproving groan for the incoming contents. <i>Just gotta eat it all... Then it's over</i>. But Robin knew that would only last for so long; the breaks between her work. She would often be in pain from eating so much while her stomach protested loudly. Christie made sure Robin's stomach was always noisy so their parents thought she was always hungry. She had to be full before every meal and would nap after each one because being so stuffed drained her of energy. Her life now was about keeping her belly full of food and growing. It was best to keep the peace between her and Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the burgers finally disappeared into Robin's mouth and was washed down with soda. Robin belched a few times which relieved some of the pressure but not much. Her shirt could only cover half her stomach but just barely<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys. This is doing wonders for her belly\" Christie said.<br>\r\n\"Oh we know. It's blowing up pretty well\" said Melony who wore glasses.<br>\r\n\"Got your leftovers\" the boy, Tony, said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\" Christie cheered as she was handed several grocery bags. Then came the hard part: walking. Robin slowly got out of the recliner and began waddling behind Christie toward the exit where their mother, Lisa, was parked. Her stomach, though stuffed to the brim, jiggled slightly with each step and she burped the entire way. They finally made it to the care after what felt like forever and Christie told their mother she got Robin a \"snack to hold her until dinner. Robin was thankful that she had a few hours to let the food settle before she'd be stuffed with 2 more meals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home Robin went to her room. She pretended everything was fine like how she'd become accustomed to doing when her fat paunch had enough food in it for 3 adults. She laid on her bed and rubbed her swollen gut try to settle it's contents. The soda and grease really did a number on her this time. The burps were hard and non stop and Robin could feel them coming from deep within her gut. Christie then came in with one of the bags she got from the mall and Robin groaned. She knew her Christie was probably going to feed her to make her belly even noisier so she could pass as hungry. Christie started rubbing Robin's fat midsection and was happy to hear the gurgling it made as well as Robin's burps. She laid her head on Robin's stomach to hear it better and was amazed by the chaos inside as Robin continued to burp. <br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" she said happily, \"Your belly needs to sound like this all the time. This is our new goal\" Robin let out a loud belch in response. <br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" Christie said, \"Very productive tummy. That's how we know it'll get fatter. Dinner will be ready soon so we'll start the tummy tightening soon.\" she said as she left. Tummy tightening; what Christie called the pre-meal meals. Robin's stomach would always feel a little tight from being filled with the first of 2 meals. The second one is always bigger than the first and leftovers on top of that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple hours later Robin had fallen asleep but was awaken by Christie to be fed. First came soda for stretching and Robin gulped down as much as she could. Then came half a pizza and bread sticks followed by 6 tacos and more soda to top it all off. The end result was a full, but not quite stuffed belly. The girls were called down for dinner and to the table they went. By now their mother Lisa knew to give Robin about twice as much than before because she is a \"growing\" girl as Christie pointed out. They were having steak and potatoes; one of Robin's (and Christie's) favorites. 2 steaks and 2 potatoes sat upon the plate in front of Robin and with a sigh she began eating at quick but steady pace. </span></div></div>",

Steak always sat heavily inside of Robin's belly and made her feel full quickly. Her appetite hadn't grown as much as she wanted since she became responsible for fattening up her belly. Half way through her first steak, Robin's stomach let out a violent groan.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, she's pretty hungry,\" Christie said with a smug grin.<br>\r\n\"That she is.\" Lisa replied. She got up from the table and pulled out lasagna from the night before and put a huge slice in front of Robin on the table \"Your appetite is getting out of control but we can definitely keep up.\" Lisa said playfully before kissing Robin in the cheek and patting her stuffed belly. Christie stared the second plate in disbelief. She looked at Christie with pleading eyes only to find Christie giving her an evil smile. The pasta was going to end up in the same place as the steaks: Robin's stomach. Robin continued to eating but at a slower pace. Her belly's protests were getting harder to disregard. Finally the steaks and potatoes were in Robin's growing paunch but the lasagna remained. Her family finished eating before she did and she knew what was coming next. Christie appeared from the shadows with a fork in hand and began shoveling the lasagna down Robins throat. Robin clenched her stomach and tried to keep up with Christie's super speed feeding. Each bite was more painful than the last and made her belly churn and groan louder and louder. The last bite disappeared and Robin was in tears from the pain. Christie had her hands all over Robins tight midsection making sure there was no room left. She rubbed and poked and slapped Robin's belly. It was packed tight and gurgling violently. <br>\r\n\"It's good but you're not burping. We need to get food that's going to keep you noisy in both the belly and mouth\" Christie said.<br>\r\n\"Please no more.... it can't hold anymore food, it needs to digest\" Robin pleaded.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, I'm aware that we can't restock your tummy yet,\" Christie said, \"But you will have to go to bed very soon. This food will turn directly into fat and sleep will make that happen faster\"<br>\r\nRobin felt a wave of relief wash over her. She went to bed soon after cradling her aching paunch knowing Chirstie would be in her room in a few hours to \"restock\" her growing gut</span></div></div>",

This was only her second breakfast (first as far as her parents were concerned) and she could already start to feel her belly protesting. With Christie keeping her belly drum tight round the clock, the weight gain has been rappid. Robin is able to feel exactly where the fat is going on her body; thankfully most of it is going to her belly. She finished up what looked like a breakfast buffet for four as quickly as her sore, stuffed belly would. When she swallowed the last bite, she let out a huge belch followed by a quiet moan. Robin had become accustomed to the routine; any second Christie would be in there to feed her even more to make her stomach as loud as possible. She had both hands on her belly rubbing it in big circles. Christie walked into the kitchen to meet Robin; who noticed she had a pizza box in her hands. Her huge, taught belly let out a loud groan in anticipation. <br>\r\n\"Well today is going to be another mall day, but a little different.\" Christie said as she grabbed the first slices of a loaded pizza. Robin tried to not to think about what that could mean; she just focused on eating for Christie. \"The mall is only the first stop, and you know what's going to happen there. Then we're going to show off that belly of yours.\" Christie said. <br>\r\nRoin was already on the third slice of what appeared to be a large pizza. The grease had already started a war in her stomach, but she had gotten use to the feeling of food sloshing around in her stomach. \"What's that mean?\" She managed to get through clearly between bites. <br>\r\n\"It means we're gonna find others like... Us.\" Christie said. Robin had mixed feelings about the idea but she knew she had no say. \"And you already know belly stocking will be involved.\" Christie said <br>\r\nOf course, Robin thought. Her stomach's protests were getting harder to ignore, even for Christie. She felt her obese sister's stomach to make sure there was room for the entire pizza. Christie was amazed at her work in fattening her sister. Of course Robin's appetite increased which only helped the pounds pile on. Robin started to moan and burp and her stomach became was violently gurgling as the final slices entered her mouth. Christie was pleased to see that a little more than a large pizza will be needed to stuff Robin to borderline immobility. She raced to get dressed for the mall despite the fact it would take Robin almost 3 times as long. To Christie's dismay, Robin lets her stomach settle when she's fed at home. It also helps to convince their parents that Robin is hungry when she's actually stuffed like a Turkey. When Robin was finally ready, Christie nearly dragged her to the car. She couldn't wait to meet up with others who worship fat kid bellies</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The journey to the food court was a long one. Robin doesn't have any shirts that will cover more than half her belly; the one she was wearing today was struggling to cover even half. Robin held her belly the entire time as it's contents refused to get along still and strangers stared the entire walk. Just reminders that her life is about her fat belly and how she's supposed keep it full and make it grow. <br>\r\nThey get to the area where the feeding takes place, a little break area in one of the restaurants. Robin was out of breath by the time they got their. <br>\r\n\"She's getting really big\" a girl said with a smile on her face. Robin didn't bother to pay attention to names; she usually just tries to prepare for the insane amount of food that her belly is about to get. With some group effort, she was put in her usual chair and her work began. It started with more pizza, at least a dozen slices, then the same amount of burgers. She only stopped to chug soda, which was used for its carbonation to make more room in her stomach. When all the food was gone, Robin felt ten pounds heavier. The burps were non stop and there was no way her shirt could cover her belly. Someone then pulled out a scale and told Robin to get on it. She weighed 180 lbs. <br>\r\n\"And that's with 10lbs of food in that belly,\" a guy said, \"thought we would've broken 200.\"<br>\r\n\"Christie you might want to feed her twice at night.\" A girl said.<br>\r\n\"Was planning on starting that tonight,\" Christie said. Robin's belly groaned at that moment, as if it knew more food was to come. Christie and her friends loaded up Robin into a mysterious car and took off. Robin rubbed her belly for what felt like hours. <br>\r\nAs her stomach settled she realized it felt kinda strange. She and her body had normalized Christie's fattening process. She had become accustomed to treating eating like a work out. Having so much food in her that it restricts her breathing; being filled with gasses and grease and feeling the food fight inside her. And the burps.<br>\r\nRobin was interrupted by the car stopping. Everyone got out and Robin saw they were in a city place. The walk wasn't too far thankfully; they arrived at this secluded building with an old black door. Robin rubbed her belly anxiously. She missed her bellyache and Christie noticed. <br>\r\n\"I figured you might want a snack when we got here,\" Christie said with a malicious grin. They were let in by a security guard and what Robin saw looked like the state fair and an all you can eat buffet combined. There were so many kids with huge bellies like Robin's but hers was, by far, one of the roundest.<br>\r\n\"I'll go look for a specialist\" the guy voice said.<br>\r\n\"OK, we'll get some food ready,\" Christie said. <br>\r\n\"Remember not to feed her until he measures and weighs her\" the guy said as he ran off. Christie and her friends took Robin to an empty lunch table with a chair next to it before leaving to get food. Robin noticed a lot of lunch tables with chairs next to them and a lot of the tables had a mountain of food on them. The fat children sat in the chairs while someone older fed them. Then Christies guy friend a long with Christie came back with man following behind him. <br>\r\n\"This is the belly?\" The man asked. <br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Christie's girl friend responded, \"Christie keeps it packed almost all the time. It should still be pretty loaded\"<br>\r\nThe man measured Robin's belly, listened to it, then weighed her. \"This is one of the best bellies I've come across; especially how you care for it. I noticed the child has a look of hunger on her face; so you might want to refill that tank\" the man said as he patted Robin's belly which made her belch. Christie looked all too happy to hear those word's and immediately put Robin in the chair. <br>\r\nRobin eagerly opened her mouth for the first of many triple Bacon cheese burgers. Her stomach started to to get louder and the louder it got the more enthusiastic Robin got. Christie fed Robin nothing but sugar, grease and fatty foods trying to bloat and upset her belly as much as possible as well as making it grow. Robin with each bite Robin was getting more tired. Her belly gurgled violently and the belches almost prevented her swallowing incoming bites. Half of the table disapeared inside Robin's every growing gargantuan gut. Robin was in paid, a lot of pain. She moaned as rubbed her upset stomach which felt like it's contents were fighting her body. </span></div></div>",

She's not a piggy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She pushed one of her fingers deep in Robin's soft belly flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Auw!

The point is... i was really embarrassed that my little sister made a complete pig out of herself and don't tell me you did't mind.\" Christie said to her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was't happy that her pants ripped but those things just happen. We just had need to buy bigger pants for her. It's our fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you blind not seeing what for a fat and greedy pig she is?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was too much for Robin. She started too cry. Her mother rushed over too her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There there Robin, It's all right. You're not fat or greedy. You're just a girl that's a bit big for her age and that just likes good food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is...\" Christie started but was cut off by her mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christie go to your room. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But she...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if i hear one more bad word from you you're grounded for a week without T.V or Internet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine i go. I still need to do some things on my room anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Christie was gone mother looked back at Robin.

What do you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some Cola please.\"    <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhile her mother took some Cola for her Robin focused on her belly. It was big and round and she thought it was all right. She liked that her belly was big so it could hold more food and Robin loved food. Especially chocolate. That why her mother sometimes called her: 'A chocolaty filled blond' or 'Chocoholic'.<br>\r\nBut she was also smart enough too know that how more you eat how fatter you get and if she need to be honest she liked that being fat sort of and even if she did't, she liked eating so much that if she needed to gain weight with it so be it.<br>\r\nBut she liked having a big round belly. It felt nice.  <br>\r\nBut then why Christie could't see it that way?  <br>\r\nRobin was also still angry that Christie teased her so much it made her cry.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Robin rested her rump on the couch again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Phew! Maybe I\u2019ll just wait a few minutes,\u2019 she thought. \u2018I guess I\u2019m a little full, still.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, for the next 20 minutes, Robin sat and watched television while she rubbed her belly, trying to make herself digest faster so she could fit in more food before bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked into the kitchen, the door of the cupboard, slightly ajar, caught her eye. She wandered over to it, wondering what could possibly be too big for the cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the door and looked in, she saw a small chocolate cake. Written upon a note set upon it was \u201cDo Not Touch! Need for School. Signed, Christie.\u201d Robin grinned deviously and took out the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What better way to embarrass to embarrass Christie than to eat her homework?\u2019 Robin thought, giggling to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin snuck to her room with the cake. She set it on the bed, closed her door behind her, and crawled onto her bed. She propped herself up against her headboard, pulled the cake over to her, and began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cake was heavenly. It was intensely chocolatey; very delicious and moist. Robin sighed with pleasure as she ate slice after slice, her belly swelling bigger and rounder every few bites. It was doubly delicious because she knew Christie would be embarrassed at school the day after tomorrow when she didn\u2019t have her assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was on her last slice when her mother knocked on the door. \u201cRobin? It\u2019s time to get your pajamas on,\u201d she called through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin swallowed her mouthful and called back \u201cOkay, Mommy! I\u2019ll be ready in a few minutes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin hurriedly threw the last few bites of cake into her mouth and slid off her bed. As she chewed, she changed into her pajamas, her round belly poking out of her shirt and pushing her waistband down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing footsteps in the hallway, Robin threw the cake tray under her bed and jumped into bed. She pulled the covers over herself and lay down. A moment later, her door creaked open, and her mother entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoodnight, Robin,\u201d she said as she walked over to the bed. \u201cI\u2019ll see you tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, Mommy!\u201d Robin smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two exchanged kisses on their cheeks, and Lisa left the room, leaving a very happy, quite stuffed Robin alone in the dark.</span></div></div>",

She settled on a chocolate-colored t-shirt and some blue jeans. Her outfit hugged her every curve and bulge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin brushed her hair and teeth and hurried out to the foyer, where she put on her shoes and coat, hungry and impatient. A few minutes of foot-tapping later, Christie and Lisa appeared, dressed and ready. Christie looked reluctant to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey said their goodbyes and climbed into the car, Robin leading the way. They pulled out of the driveway, and were soon on their way downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we having?\u201d Robin asked, bouncing in her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot McDonald\u2019s, I hope\u2026\u201d sighed Christie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we just had McDonald\u2019s last night.

Robin hoped there was enough food to let some of her clothes rip. She struggled a bit since her clothes where very tight already.

In such tight clothes that you could clearly see how fat she was and that little butterball seemed to enjoy it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i don't want you two fighting. Understood. Not about anything! Understood Christie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you mean about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About yesterday. You made you little sister cry.

But i... never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin closed one eye half  like a very mean wink. She knew her parents never really cared about her weight or eating. Now thinking about it, it could be that her parents would care if she became very fat. But not for some time. If her parents would start too care she would deal about it then. By that time she would already have embarrassed Christie several times.<br>\r\nSince she did't had breakfast Robin was really starving and her clothes felt so tight that she did't thought it would be a problem to get too the point of ripping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived at The Breakfast House.<br>\r\nRobin must admit that it looked pretty nice. Kind of cosy. It also was a nice place. Near a forest at one side and a field and lake at the other side. If Robin would have been older she would have start thinking about how much money such a house could make. <br>\r\nWhen they were inside it seemed it was pretty good. There where a lot of people But lucky enough Lisa reserved a place near the window.<br>\r\nRobin looked around. A nice wooden floor and wall. Little windows with curtains and at some shelf's high on the wall were some plates, cups and other stuff. There were also some of that old paintings. Robin must admit she liked the homey feeling. She hate canteens. Not the food but the feeling. Big windows and walls without anything on it and everywhere boring chairs and tables. This was a lot better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there. Nice to meet you.\" A friendly woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed each of them a menu card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i already take you drinks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes one tea for me and you Christie? Robin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also want tea.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chocolate milk!\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So two tea and one chocolate milk. I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked curious at the menu. The card had pictures so she could also choose herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Robin. What do you want?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I want this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed the picture. Her mother looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin that's a big lunch for at least five adult people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy i'm really hungry. If you pay for it it's fine right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i could ask if they could...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie opened her mouth to say something but decided that she better could't or else her mother would become angry again and she said that she would take them right back home. Christie knew her mother said that she mend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right i think i take a fish breakfast. Do you know what you take Christie?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... the breakfast lunch.\" Christie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA waitress walked to their table and asked: \"Did you made a decision?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. One fish breakfast and one breakfast lunch and is it possible to get one super lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well miss normally a super lunch is for five people. If there are more people we can always make the super lunch bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make it for ten people!\" Robin screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want a super lunch for ten persons for one little girl?\" The waitress asked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin... are you sure you're able to finish that... I mean it's...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can please mommy. Christie already got a place she liked to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda sighed turned to the waitress and said. \"Yes. A super lunch for ten people for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress said up big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think it's a bit too big for her but if you want too pay for it it's fine by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they wait Robin took a book and Christie and her mother talked. After some time they got their breakfast Robin got a plate wit different kinds of fish, one plate with different kinds of cheese and one with different kinds of meat. She also got a basket with different kinds of jelly some peanut butter and sprinkles and normal butter and two bowls of lettuce a small bowl of tuna salad and a big basket with different breads.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer mother wondered if Robin could eat it all. Robin had a huge appetite but this was much. But she did't had anything to eat today and yesterday she also eat enough burgers for several persons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin started to eat. She cut open breads and covered them with some of the food and pushed them in her mouth. She was eating loudly. Eating then some fish then cheese then meat. <br>\r\nSome people started to whisper when seeing how a five year old was eating enough for several adults. It did't take long for Robin fell how tight her clothes got. Suddenly she felt relieved and heard a ripping sound. She felt a cold breeze on her belly and knew her t-shirt ripped right through the middle showing her big belly.<br>\r\nChristie did her best not to say something.<br>\r\n Robin acted like if she did't cared and continued eating even faster and it did't take long before the button popped of her jeans and forced her zipper all the way down. This gave Robins stomach even more room and even later even her pants split.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie forced her jaws to stay closed. She could't believe how her mother did't saw that her youngest daughter just eat herself out some clothes. he tried to focus on her own plate.<br>\r\nLisa saw that Robin's clothes ripped but her pants were under table and she still wore her shirt thanks to her sleeves. Besides she still needed to pay. If she did need to pay the full prize she could better  make sure Robin ate as much if she could.<br>\r\nRobin finally cleaned all the plates, baskets and bowls. She even ate all the butter. Robin leaned back and rubbed her stuffed belly. She looked at Christie. <br>\r\nA lot people were watching at them. At the little girl who had eaten enough for a group of ten and ate so much her clothes ripped. Christie felt very embarrassed. Especially since she liked this place. Now she felt like she could't return anytime soon. Her little sister had done it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same waitress give her the bill and said: \"I did't thought she could do it. Congratulations. We hope we see you back soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa and Christie stood up. Robin felt too full to get up until Lisa took her by the hand and pulled her up and took her too the car while trying to keep the split pants on their place. When she got robin in the car she could finally let go of the pants.<br>\r\nRobin felt so good. She had eaten herself almost to bursting and she had liked the feeling from being so stuffed and she had embarrassed Christie. She also liked her big belly even more then yesterday. She started to like this very much. taking revenge at Christie and get a big belly.    </span></div></div>",

Robin just had a silly grin. Christie walked angry too her room but Lisa took  Robin by the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin we can't have this happen every time we go somewhere too eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin got a bit scared. Her parents never cared about her weight. But now it seemed Lisa did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you and i go clothes shopping. Today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin sighed relieved. She did't liked it too walk so much but maybe she would get some junk food while they were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But first go upstairs and get dressed. Something that fits!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easier said then done.\" Robin mumbled while she walked too her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked it to grow out of her clothes near Christie but just with her mother in the mall was't such a good idea. So she tried to take some of her biggest clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No too small. Also too small. Too small. Way too small!. Eh why did my mother bought this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at a pink dress with bows and things attached too it. She hated dresses and the color pink. The only time she wore it was at her grandmothers birthday party. Even then only to do her mother and grandmother a pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather go naked too the mall then go like that!\" She mumbled. \"Maybe i need too since all those clothes are too small.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she saw something. Some stretchy sport clothing. Robin never wanted to sport but her parents bought it for her anyway. Hoping she might use it when she would do some exercise.<br>\r\nShe started to pull on the sport clothing since it was kind of stretchy it fit just over her fat belly.<br>\r\nLisa walked inside and looked at her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you know. You finally were those sport clothes. We hoped you would were it when you would do dome exercise but... Well it does't matter. Let's go too the mall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin slowly followed her mother and stepped in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy when we are at the mall... can we get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin you can't be hungry again. You just ate enough to feed 10 people. You can't still be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe not really hungry but i could eat somethi...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, we look after we done shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin rubbed her big belly. She looked forward too it and leaned back.<br>\r\nLisa did't decided to go too a normal clothing store or one for bigger sizes. Robin was pretty big but she thought the clothes would fit. She thought for another moment and turned too the big sizes store. At least then she was sure the clothes would fit and this way Robin had some room too grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee this is another store!\" Robin said surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah come on Robin\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked around and noticed all people her were chubby or fat or even obese. </span></div></div>",

She smiled relieved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Robin. For kids like you. Now let's look for some nice clothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nice looking chubby woman walked over too them too take Robin's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a pretty big girl are't you.

Look if you like some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin looked and pointed at every T-shirt with a nice print on it  of a cartoon she knew but not one dress. She also took some pants that looked nice with some of the T-shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin don't you want any dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom i hate dresses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Lisa took three T-shirts and two pants hoping Robin would be able too were them for some time. <br>\r\nWhen the walked out the store Robin looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy can we go get some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin i can't believe you're still hungry after that super menu.That was for several adults i really think you had enough for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin went angry in her car seat sulking. Lisa sighed knowing Robin could keep this up for a long time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Robin wait here for a sec.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin even refused to look at her and waited and started softly too sing. She always liked it too sing if she was alone. Even sometimes in bed.<br>\r\nsuddenly the door opened and Lisa stepped in handed Robin a big mac. Robin happily started eating it. Soon there was sauce dripping from her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Robin but i don't want to hear you whining for food until dinner. Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*chew, chew* yes *chew, chew* mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived home they even heard Christie screaming outside. She seemed really angry. Lisa wondered why. Fast she opened the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then where is it?!\" Christie yelled. \"I need too have it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Lisa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I put a chocolate cake here i needed for school with a note to don't eat it and now it's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin could't help it and let out a small giggle. Christie looked at her and she understand who ate her cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You. It was you. You ate my cake did't you. Don't try to deny it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin tried to run away. But Christie grabbed and started to strangle Robin. Robin made coughing sounds and their parents fast separated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She ate that cake and i needed that cake for school tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if she did that's no reason to strangle your sister! She's just five years old! You're the oldest you should know better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin still made some coughing sounds. Christie pressed pretty hard when she tried to strangle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts young lady you go straight too your room now and i don't wanna see until dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. You're joking right? Since i need to go out too buy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No your stay on your room and don't even try to sneak out since i will check on you and if i notice you tried to sneak out Then you're in really big trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie angry walked to her room. Robin got a tall glass of cola and she went sitting on the couch to watch some cartoons. Her parents did't even asked Robin if she did or did't ate the cake.<br>\r\nRobin herself was only wondered what would be for dinner.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was really spaghetti for 8 as Robin loved spaghetti about as much as anything else. Robin took her helping, a very huge helping; as much as her parents and Christine combined. Robin wasted no time chowing down on her meal and Christine just looked at her sister in disgust. Before Christine had even looked down at her meal, Robin was done and rubbed her belly in satisfaction. Christine was far from pleased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God...I think I lost my appetite.\" Christine said as she put her hand over her mouth. Robin didn't miss a beat with her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I can have yours then!\" And with that without hesitation, Robin took Christine's plate from her and starting eating all of her sister's spaghetti too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you pig! That was mine!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you lost your appetite, so I ate the rest for you.\" Robin said patting her ever growing belly that now huge well over the top of her pants and then let out a huge belch. \"Excuse me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're excused dear.\" Robin's mom said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I'm not staying here for this!\" Christine with take walked off to her room totally embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mind her dear. You eat as much as you like.\" Robin's mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Robin did, the other 2 helpings and Robin walks up to her room juggling her belly and laughing away as she totally embarrassed her older sister again. But it wasn't enough, she wanted to completely rub it in her face. Robin remembered her mother say to Christine that if she was mean to her sister she would be grounded. Robin decided to take advantage of that, Robin's parents would believe her before they believed Christine. Robin thought of the humiliation she could bestow upon her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anything, so what do you want my little, big sister.\" Christine said with a sour face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I ate a lot of food, and my belly hurts really bad, and I think only the rub of a big sister of mine can make it go away.\" Robin said laughing at almost every word as Christine winced at the proposal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying Robin?\" Christine asked Robin just to make sure heard what she knew she heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RUB MY FAT!\" Robin said flat out and Christine almost gagged at the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay, lay...down on the bed.\" Robin's sister told her with her closed as shut as she possibly could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was more than willing to do so and Robin pulled her skin tight shirt up that was to the point of ripping anyway. Christine started to rub Robin's belly in circular motions and Robin noticed was just glancing down saw another chance to get her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can you tell if you're doing a good job if you don't look at my belly and see.\" Robin said as Christine gag coughs again. \"And rub it up and down, it feels better that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristine reluctantly did so and rubbed Robin's belly up and down so it jiggled every time Christine moved it and to Christine it did feel very usual.

Unless you wanted to be grounded. But i own you now. You're my personal slave. Now go get me some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristie walked down and could't believe what just happened. Her live just turned from worst day ever in well even worse. Just a few minutes ago she did't think her live could become any worse but now it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much evil and so much fat in such a little girl.\" Christie mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was't really little anymore. She was still pretty small in height but all her fat made her pretty big. <br>\r\nTheir parents were watching T.V that was a good thing. She took two big bags of chips, a big box of cookies, five bars of chocolate and a two liter bottle of cola and took it upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally you're back. Do you know how hungry i was up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I nearly left you alone for two minutes. Stop whining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two entire minutes without food.

Come on feed me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin opened her mouth wide and Christie slowly pushed chips in it. She hated this.

She would be considered a pretty fast eater. It's because she eats so fast why she eats so much, and it's because she eats so much why she had a big fat belly, and she should be happy she isn't old enough for school yet because of her fat, because her clothes are skin tight (because of her fat) and her shirt isn't even big enough to cover her body; you could see a small portion of her belly under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby girl was stuffing herself silly with cookies at her computer, watching youtube videos with cartoon characters being stuffed, or bloating.

She tore her gaze away from the screen to confirm with her eyes what her hand had already told her. With a sigh, she accepted the sad fact that all the cookies were gone. She paused the video she was watching and looked down at her bulging belly, as if to better hear what it might be saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those cookies might be gone, but I'm sure not full yet,\" Jessica said, unmindful of what effect more cookies might very well have on her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica did not have to go far to find another couple boxes of cookies. A whole section of her closet was stacked with boxes of all different types of cookies. Her parents spoiled their daughter, as was plain to see, and could not love her any less. They often showed their love by getting Jessica just about anything she asked for. Jessica was a girl of simple tastes, and since her discovery of the wondrous world of cookies, that was almost all she ever asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what kind of cookies should I have now?\" Jessica said to herself, browsing her broad selection. She pulled out a package of Chips Ahoy!, original style, and a package of Fudge Shoppe Chocolate-striped cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These will be tasty,\" she thinks to herself as she returns to the computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she sits down, Jessica dumps out a box of cookies onto each tray, and sets one tray near each hand. With this done, she tosses the empty packages into the trash bin and sits back down in the chair. She puts the headphones she had been wearing back on, clicks the 'Play' button on her video playlist, and starts eating cookies, alternating hands, her mouth receiving a cookie constantly. Jessica felt totally at ease...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica's belly grew larger and rounder as she stuffed herself with cookies, and her shirt covered less and less of her belly. Her shorts seemed to grow even tighter, too, as her belly began to encroach upon her lap.

She took another box and another and ripped the all open and filled the play pen with it. Sand cookies, chocolate cookies, cookie with nuts on them. All kinds of different cookies went in the play pen.<br>\r\nShe also dumped her cookies in front of the computer in the play pen. It was now for the half filled wit cookies. The sides were bending.<br>\r\nJessica walked one time back too the computer and looked the video one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right it's almost the same.

Looking at the playpen filled with cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too bad no one else can see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she fell for over  right in all the cookies. She could feel them all over her body and she liked the feeling from hundreds of cookies who all would be in her belly soon and she start eating. All different kinds of cookies filled her mouth and she chewed and swallowed .<br>\r\nChew, chew, chew swallow, chew, chew, chew, swallow.<br>\r\nThis was all she cared about. She felt like the girl on the video who ate thousands of cookies just like she now. It looked of she was inhaling the cookies. So fast she was eating them.<br>\r\nShe was laying in the cookies buried until her neck like in a jacuzzi filled with cookies instead of water. With both of her fat arms she shoved cookies into her moth and hardly chewed before swallowing them. Her bikini got very tight with each bite of cookies and she kept eating and did't seem to slow down. There was for her one thing in mind: Eat this all.<br>\r\nShe felt great. cookies all around her. All for her to eat. She led slide herself deeper in the sea of cookie's that fell in her mouth. Her cheeks were filled with cookies and she kept eating while she almost choke in the cookies.<br>\r\nYou could see there were less and less cookies in the playpen.

See I saw... eh a clip.\" She turned to her computer and found the clip and showed it to her mother. \"See and I wanted to do that too. So that's why I used the play pen and all the cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jessica you are so greedy. Do you only think about your self? Just look at that gut of you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica looked at her gut and liked how big it was, but did't said anything about it because she knew she would make her mother angry.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mommy.

Can't you be a bit active with other kids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica pulled at her tails. Something she often did when she was thinking.

The only thing she did was sitting in front of the computer while stuffing her face with cookies. She did't think this was healthy, but at the same time she loved her little girl and did't wanna deny her anything. Besides it was't like she did anyone any harm. And she knew how much Jessica liked the computer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would just wish she would be a bit more active.\" She mumbled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked to the kitchen and wrote cookies on the grocery list. <br>\r\nShe saw her husband working in the garden. Cutting the hedges. That was his hobby and his talent. He could cut hedges in beautiful shapes. Like animals or people or buildings. He did make a lot of money with it. They had also a big yard that most kids would use to play in and run around. But not Jessica<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Darling. How are the hedges?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh they behave very well,\" He said and smiled. \"I just like it to cut shapes in them. Just like other like making sculptures. However sculptures last longer but they are... well not alive. Unlike my hedges. They're also alive. Breath, consume, grow, breed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Our daughter is also growing. Just not in the right way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I don't know if we need to worry about that. Don't you think it's just baby fat. Does't that go away when they become older.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm worried about her. Suppose she get bullied at school because of her weight. They also say a lot of fat kids become fat adults.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if she does get bullied that maybe force her to lose weight. And they say fat kids become fat adults. Not fat toddlers. I think you worry too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want her to be happy. But I would want her to be a bit more active. Would it be a good idea to put her on a activity group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. I don't think she serious needs to lose weight but a activity group is't a bad idea. But just wait a few weeks. Jessica first needs to do something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I guess we should tell her. After a few weeks school starts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's five years old. Old enough to go to kindergarten. Besides in a few weeks the new school year starts. So it's new for her but also for a lot of other kids. Then she gets P.E and most likely make some more friends who perhaps convince her to exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. She must admit Jessica was lazy but she liked talking with other kids and was a real giggle girl. Probably she would easily make contact and get some more friends.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Her mother said this more then once and yet she was always able to clean her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took two pieces of break and covered one of them with peanut butter and the other with jelly and put them on another and stuffed them in her mouth. She took again two pieces of bread and did this again. The fifth  piece of bread was heavily covered with chocolate spread. She also took a sixth piece of bread also with chocolate spread and when she reached for her seventh her mother grabbed her risk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you had enough Jessica?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica remembered that She still had some cookies upstairs and she slowly started to become full and decided too use the last space in her tummy for some cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing anyway Jessica?\" Her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh watching videos at you tube.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you never get enough from that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head and took her glass with juice and started to drink it.

But i would like it if you were a bit more active. Just like i was.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed on some pictures of herself. on the first she was about four year an on the last about sixteen. All pictures of her mother doing sport. She looked at her mother muscled body and her flat belly that she always showed since the age of nine by wearing short shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see your belly.\" Jessica said while pointing at some of the pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can also see you belly but in another way and i'm not so glad with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica patted the big ball of fat that was her belly.

It would be nice if you would do some sports then you could also lose some of that extra fat.\" Her mother said and pushed a finger in her daughters belly. \"Do you come down soon. We have lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat cheered Jessica up and she walked back to the computer wondering what to look now and slowly pulled at on of her tails. She liked her tails. She thought it looked cute and to be honest it did. She was planning to let her hair grow to her middle if her parents would allow that. She thought they would as long if she took care of her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a few more clips and stopped then and walked downstairs.

She looked at herself: her fat belly strained her clothes, with her pants forming a good sized muffin top, whilst her shirt, which stopped just above her cute navel, had large gaps between the buttons where even more of her belly could be seen. She giggled at this, finding it funny that her clothes were so much too small. She didn't care how big she was though, as long as she could eat til her belly was ready to burst, any time she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mama!\" Riley grinned as she walked into the kitchen. \"Oh, there you are Riley,\" replied Helena. \"Lunch is almost ready, we're having fried chicken,\" she smiled, blushing as her own stomach grumbled.

Riley didn't need her to repeat, within seconds she was already in her chair and reaching for the chicken. She took a bite...and squealed happily. \"So good!\" she squeaked, and then began to gorge herself. Her mother shook  her head and ate at a slower pace, whilst Riley was cramming as much down her throat as her hands could hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>POP!</b> Riley and her mother looked up at the same time. \"What was that, Mama?\" she asked. \"I don't know...\" said Helena, before looking at Riley's belly. \"...Oh -w-;\" Riley made a confused face. \"What, Mama?\" Helena shook her head. \"You popped a button off your shirt!\" Riley looked down and blushed a bit...and then continued eating, causing her whole shirt to pop open, her belly pushing out. Suddenly, there was a <b>POP...PING!</b> as her jeans burst open, popping the button with incredible force: it was imbedded in the table! Her zipper could not go down fast enough, so it snapped off too. Riley blushed for a moment, but only kept eating, while her mother shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley belched, setting down the plate. \"I'm stuffed, Mama,\" she sighed, patting her bloated tummy, which was a few inches bigger than before. Her Mom sighed. \"I wish you would eat less sometimes...I can't go buying you new clothes every week. Riley giggled and blushed, getting out of the chair with a groan. She sighed happily.\"I think I might pop...\" Riley then waddled down the hall and back to the fireplace, to take another nap...</span></div></div>",

She used the chair to climb on it and was able to reach for some boxes of chocolate cookies. She threw the three boxes down and jumped on the ground and happy ripped open the first box and stuffed the cookies in her mouth and started to wolf then down. Just too stop the hunger in her tummy. <br>\r\nSoon all the three boxes were emptied in Riley's big belly. She burped.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning sun was shining in Riley's room. After dinner yesterday she got some ice cream and after that she was really stuffed. <br>\r\nShe curled herself up in her blanket and closed her eyes. Ready to fall back asleep again. The next moment her mother walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine. The sun is up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i noticed that.\" Riley said and let out a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother took her out her bed, grabbed some clothes and started to dress Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for breakfast?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you may choose. Waffles or pancakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley licked her lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i have both mommy? Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i suppose. since you asked so nicely. But you're sure that's not too much for you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mommy i can eat that all. I really can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe first pressed Riley's chubby body in a red sweater, white tights and some blue jeans. It was still very cold but There was a good chance Riley would stay inside but just to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's go downstairs. Lissy is also hungry for breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lissy is't at school?\" Riley asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Saturday honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley hated Saturday. Her sister was mostly home then the whole day and probably invited some friends. And she mostly need to stay out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do some of her friends come over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one. Her boyfriend.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Lissy have a boyfriend?\" Riley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For a few days. Is't that nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley fast climbed in her high chair for her breakfast. Her mother baked some waffles for her and Lissy and after that some pancakes for Riley.<br>\r\nLissy let out a sound of disgust when she heard her mother baked some more pancakes for Riley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still want some more pancakes. If you keep eating like that you'll look like miss piggy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley ignored her sister and dove in her pancakes but rubbed with one of her hands over her potbelly. So what if she was a little chubby. She did't mind. Besides the pancakes tasted so good that it would be waste not to eat them. <br>\r\nRiley then reminded what her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heard you got a boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom do you really need to tell that brat that i have a boyfriend?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley will find out soon enough and she is not a brat. Be a little nicer to your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no reason for that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley swallowed the last of her pancakes that she finished of very quick then she heard the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's him.\" Her sister said and ran too the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley was so curious so she walked to the door to see her sisters boyfriend. The boy who came in looked really nice. he had dark blond hair, a perfect skin, a nice smile and he also seemed to have some muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i must admit my sister has a good taste at looks.\" Riley mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy kissed Lissy and said that he would like to met the rest of th family. Riley quick ran back to the living room. A few seconds later the boy and Lissy walked in. The boy was very polite to the parents and said his name was John. After that he noticed Riley who was sitting in front of the fire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who is that little girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's so cute.\"  <br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"She's not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley shook the hand of John an said with a smile: \"I'm Riley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Riley sniffed and looked at Johns bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell donuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i bought two boxes of donuts. I would help Lissy a little studying for a test and i thought to take some donuts to eat while studying. But you can take a box. I have two any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley started to like John and hugged his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That means she likes you.\" Riley's father said not wanting John would to get the wrong idea. </span></div></div>",

She happy start eating a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley that are the last donuts. After those we don't have more. Not until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He had two boxes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One for you and one for them. You may be happy he gave you one box. Most boyfriends i know are't so nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley lifted her shoulders. She grabbed a second donut and decided to save the rest for later. She kept the box between her arms and laid her head back and fell asleep on the couch. Her father smiled and stroke her. Riley made soft pleasant sounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one and half hour she woke up. She stretched herself and got up on her feet. Riley noticed that she was hungry again. She ate two of the donuts in her box. She was wondering how Lissy's boyfriend was. Her parents were out the room. She slowly stood up and waddled to the stairs and walked up. Finally she saw her sisters room and opened the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLissy looked up from her math book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley Beat it. Now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whyyyyyyyyyy?\" Riley asked with an annoying tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're busy studying! Now beat it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley looked hopefully at Lissy's new boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey listen up kid if you leave us alone for the next two hours you get two donuts. One for each hour. Is that a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley nodded happy. John gave her the two donuts and Riley happy eat them while walking downstairs. Her jeans started to feel tight around her big belly. She walked back in the living room. Her mom was sitting next to the fire place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley were have you bin. You did't go upstairs to your sister did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ...i did.\" Riley said. Faking like she felt guilty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riley i don't want you teasing your older sister and especially not when her boyfriend is over. Besides he 's a nice kid. You don't him to break up with Lissy.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"No!\" Riley said telling the truth this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another donut but this was just too much for the pants and the button popped off. Her zipper was forced all the way down letting her belly out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh You need new clothes too. You know what, when we buy donuts tomorrow we also buy new clothes. Now lets go upstairs to find some pants that fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe and Riley walked upstairs.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Susie was a fat kid. She always was since she started to drink from the bottle. Her mother was the one who is responsible for her daughters weight. Susie was born in the USA but her mother was't. She came from a far land. Susie never found out why she leaved or wich country she came from. Every time when she asked her mother about it Her mother stuffed some food in her mouth so she would be quiet And did't answer her question. But one of the things Susie did know about the country her mother lived before was this: Women in that country need to be fat. If you were fat that means you came from a rich family. How fatter you were how better. And that was one of the things her mother still believed in. Or at least for her own daughter. She herself wasn't so fat. Susie some times thought that was the reason why her mother leaved. Susie's mother always fed Susie great amounts of food with a lot of fat in it. This was the reason why Susie became so fat. Because her mother wanted her to become fat. And if Susie gained another pound her mother told her how proud she was.<br>\r\nBut i guess you wonder how Susie felt about this right. Well Susie was always been told by her mother (before she even understood her) that girls need to be fat. That she would get a nice man when she was older and that she would make her proud when she would gain some more. Hearing this her whole life made her believe that girls need to be fat. And she liked it that she could eat every thing anytime because she liked to eat. And with how much she gained they bough many times new clothes. and Susie liked to try on clothes. And get some junk food when they were in town.<br>\r\nSusie also ha a little brother named Ronnie. He was only three years old. Susie loved her only brother. Ronnie was't fat like Susie more skinny. Girls needed to fat but boy's did't. They need to be strong.<br>\r\nAnd i suppose i need to tell about Susie's father now. Need to do it sooner or later. Her father left them when Susie was three and her mother was pregnant from Ronnie. However she did't knew she was pregnant by then. Susie of course did't really understand what happened by then but she knew something was missing and tried to fill it by eating what made her mother happy that made her happy. Susie did't see her father since he left and he probably does't even know he also has a son. Why her father left is also a question she doesn't know the answer. <br>\r\nHer mother is kind of rich. Her parents were and when they died in an accident a few years ago she earned all their money since she was their only child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll right i understand that Susie's live sounds a little complex short version Susie lives together with her mother and her brother Ronnie. Her dad left her mother is rich and she fattens up Susie because She believes girls need to be fat and Susie is okay with that. <br>\r\nNow you know everything we can start the story. Susie was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... home. It was 23 December. Almost Christmas. And for one time it was snowing. Finally a white Christmas. Susie was playing with Ronnie. Or she tried to play a card game but with only three years old Ronnie did't really understood the rules of the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ronnie. Put a little attention to the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie smiled a friendly toddler smile that showed his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not paying any attention to what i say. Ah forget it. I think card games are a little to hard for you. But it's almost Christmas. I like Christmas. The whole family together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy also?\" Ronnie asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Daddy not! Daddy does't come now not ever. He did't even send me a letter or birthday present in more then three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie looked kind of sad. He never had he chance to even met his father. Susie shook her head causing her ponytail to wave also. Susie was fat. Her whole body was covered in a layer of fat. She had bowl cheeks, Round legs and arms and also pudgy fingers. But the most fat went to her belly and thighs that rubbed together when she walked. Susie was convinced that when she would be older her boobs would also have a lot of fat in then causing them to be big also.<br>\r\nRobbie pushed his tiny hands in Susie soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Ronnie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play! Wanna play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always wanna play. Some times i wished i was an only child. All right we can go dancing but i choose the music!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie nodded. He could't put music on at his own anyway. Susie took one of her CD's and put them in the stereo. After that she pushed in: play. Some kids music sounded through the room. Ronnie started to dance wild. Susie had some more trouble while her body was heavy and because she did't do much exercise she was fast out of breath.Susie only wore a small Shirt that rode so far up that it looked more like a bra keeping in the fat that gathered on her chest. <br>\r\nafter two songs Susie was out of breath already and went sitting on the couch. With snowing outside her mother kept the fire burning the whole day and it was warm in the room. Susie shoved closer to the fire let it warming her bare big belly. Ronnie was still dancing. He had a lot of energy.  <br>\r\n     <br>\r\n Suddenly her mother walked in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"We're fine mom. How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also fine honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do grandma and grandpa come over with Christmas?\"<br>\r\nGrandma and grandpa were not really her grand parents but it were very good friends of her real grandparents when her grandparents died they took care of her mother and where a huge support for her and they visit so often and were so nice to them that they felt almost like family. And since Susie never had seen her real grandparents she believed then when she was a baby those people where her grandparents. When she was older her mother told her the truth but Susie still called them grandma and grandpa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They come over tomorrow. And then we have a big Christmas dinner. And Susie don't eat yourself so sick you need to throw up like two years ago okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But my tummy can hold a lot more food now then two years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that dear. I make some extra food for you. You need to become a big strong girl right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie smiled </span></div></div>",

Do you want some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie looked over her shoulder and saw Ronnie was catching a breath also but when the next song started he started to dance the same way again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll stop when he really get's tired.\" Susie said. \"But that could take a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go sweetie.\" Her mom said and gave her a big bowl of chips and a big glass cola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie walked to the stereo and stopped the music. Ronnie who was still making wild dancing moves suddenly stopped and looked asking at his older sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Ronnie we can watch some T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Susie was eating she always wanted to watch T.V. But mostly she kept watching even when the food was gone. With just sitting in front of the T.V Susie burned even less calories. This way she gained even faster. Susie flicked through some channels and stopped it at Cartoon Network. <br>\r\nShe started to eat the chips. Ronnie looked at the chips. Susie saw him watching and put the bowl between them so he could also get some chips. Susie could be very nice for a big sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let Ronnie eat to much chips. He does't need to become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mom. Ronnie is't such a big eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonnie was kind of skinny and there were't really much muscles on his body but he had a lot of energy and Susie believed that her brother could if he wanted become kind of strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he is older i'll put him on a training club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie took a few big sips from her cola and belched loudly <br>\r\n <br>\r\nHer mother ignored it. Ronnie was still three. She did't want to give Susie a lesson in table manners while her little brother could still do things she could't . Maybe next year. Then Ronnie could also understand it.</span></div></div>",

She was the only one in class apart from the teacher, Ms. Waxford. Susie was trying to finish her fourth lunch while her classmates played outside during recess. Her belly felt so full and stuffed and gurgled in an effort to get her to stop eating. Susie Forced herself to eat until the entire sub was gone. She moaned as she layed down on the cot that was barley supporting her weight. Her mother had told the school about their culture and were very willing to help. Susie eats all day during school and the cafeteria staff often used Susie to dispose of any leftover food. With all this eating, Susie was putting on about a pound and a half a day. She was quickly out growing her wardrobe and her mother couldn't be happier. <br>\r\nSusie was laying on the cot rubbing her loud, overstuffed tummy. It looked as though she had swallowed a bowling ball. She then heard the classroom door open and the sound of pots and pans. Susie dreaded what was about to happen next. The school cooks walked over to Susie with the leftover food and began to feed her. She had no choice but to eat because she knew she would never hear the end of it from her mother. Susie rubbed her belly continuously in an effort to soothe it while being fed. she could feel her belly growing with each bite fhe forced down her throat. By the time it was finally over, Susie's belly was weighing her down  and she couldn't leave the cot. Her belly was the size of a basket ball and gurgled miserably and louder than ever before. Susie's class returned and noticed how she had significantly grown. They were amazed by how big her belly was and the sounds that it made.<br>\r\n\"This is so cool! Your belly is like a pet!\" one girl said.<br>\r\n\"Hey your belly should be our class pet!\"  a boy said. <br>\r\n\"Who else thinks Susie's belly should be the class pet?\" Ms. Waxford asked and everyone cheered. \"Alright then, from now on, Susie's elly is our class pet. Everyone is going to feed it and watch it get even fatter. We're going to keep track of how big it gets. Are you okay with that Susie?\" <br>\r\nSusie nodded. She had no idea what to expect from this but thought it might be fun. Plus the entire class was going to help her pile on the pounds which would only help her in the long run. Out oh her entire body Susie favored her large jiggly belly the most and was very excited to see how this would play out</span></div></div>",

She knew some kids rode their bike too school but her mother did't want Susie to do any kind of exercise. Except perhaps sumo wrestling since she knew that was the only sport where during your training you gained about two, three, four- hundred pounds or even more. If she wanted to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi honey. How was school, today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it was fine. I ate a lot.\" She started knowing that it would make her mother proud. \"But well... I'm not sure if your fine with it. The other kids saw my big belly was and said it was like a pet. So my belly became our class pet. They gonna feed it every day and see it getting fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Susie that's wonderful. Why do you think I would't like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was't sure you were okay with it. I know you wanted me to get fatter so I become beautiful and can get a nice man and all, I also thought that they feeding me would help me gain weight but... well... I was't sure what you would think of it.\" Susie said with a guilty look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did't have to worry. I think it's good for you. You need to eat enough and become fat and beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother told her this since she was born, and hearing this since her birth convinced her that fat was a good thing and that fat girls were beautiful. At school when ever she saw a fat girl she got a bit jealous. But she was the fattest girl in her class what made her proud, and she planned to become the fattest girl ever. Anyway she liked eating and being fat. She only wished she had a bigger stomach so it could easier hold more food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ms. Waxford also measured my belly. She's gonna do that every day so we can see how much it grows. What do you think of that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that sounds like kind of fun.\" She answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happy that her class mates liked her big belly. She was always a bit scared people started teasing her about her weight and that she wanted to lose weight. But since the other s wanted to fatten her even more that made her feel very relieved.<br>\r\nSusie stretched herself and saw another button popping of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy... perhaps we need also...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New clothes. Am I right.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

We'll continue your feeding afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie groaned as she threw her head back relief. The weight of her belly was holding her down in the bean bag chair.

She no longer did school work, or homework, or was involved in classroom discussions. She no longer sat at a desk, instead being permanently seated on a big beanbag chair in a front corner of the room where she was in view of everyone. Behind her the walls were covered in student artwork, and teacher-made graphs of her growth. Both in pounds and size, the line graphs were more than 45 degree angles as they measured her rapid gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a gain it was. Months of ever-increasing force feedings by both her teacher and fellow students had buried the young girl in fat. The 6 year old was stuffed into her chair, her belly massive and all encompassing as it's double tiered rolls stretched down to her outstretched knees as her illsized shirt rode high. Her overinflated arms were forced into 45 degree angles out of her sides, unused as she did nothing but be hand fed by others. Her tiny head was framed by fat, 3 chins piled up in front of her as her mouth area was caked in layers and layers of messy food fed to her by messy children. Groggily, she moaned and burped, as side effect of her last stuffing as the class worked up their multiplication tables and the number of cupcakes grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Class! It's time for everyone's favorite part of the day\" Miss Waxford called out, standing in front of the class beside Susie. The children of the class buzzed eagerly as Susie laid in her chair, letting out a small burp and fart. \"Time to weigh Susie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly but surely, with a great amount of physical effort on the teacher's part, Susie was slowly pulled up off her chair and into a standing position. Even though they recorded her weight daily, Susie still struggled as she inflated with fat to get up off her butt and waddle towards the heavy duty scale. Eventually the deed was done, and Susie stood shaking on the wide scale in front of everyone as her stomach grumbled and moaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"426!\" Miss Waxford called out, \"Can anyone tell me how much more that is since yesterday?\" she asked, motioning to Susie's recorded weight from the day before. Several kids raised their hands as they jumped in their seats, many holding out fingers and yelling out the answer out of turn. \"Yes, Andrew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four! It's four!\" the kindergartener called out, eager to show off his addition and subtraction skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right! It's four pounds since yesterday.\" she finished.  Satisfied, she waddled Susie back over to her beanbag chair as the massively obese 6 year old plopped heavily into her seat. Writing the new weight on the board, and updating Susie's weight chart, Miss Waxford got the attention of the class. \"Okay class, since today's almost over I'm allowing you to have a free period till class ends so have fun!\" With that, every student jumped up as they ran over to Susie, heavily petting her belly as they took turns stuffing her face with food till the evening bell rang.</span></div></div>",

Eventually the kindergartener's arms gave out completely, a defeated blob of fat her mother ran over and continued her pace. Susie's eyes went from joyful, to pleased, to almost panic'd as her mother continued to feed more and more and more to her. Even when they got to deserts, her mom continued, placing a large funnel directly into Susie's mouth as she poured shakes and melted icecream down her throat, It was 10pm by the time they were finished, Susie's stomach was massive and red as it throbbed in her hands. Unable to lift her stuffed daughter for bed, her mom let her sleep in the kitchen for the night.

Her enormous stomach-distending meal of the night before had digested, leaving her belly to flabbily flop out of her totally inadequate shirt and over the waistband of her triple-XL (but still far too small) stretch pants and hang heavily past her swollen knees. She'd barely taken ten steps before her heart started to pound. She paused for a moment, took a deep breath, and pressed on. Five more steps, halfway to the school door. She paused again, sweat streaming from her brow, and lifted a heavy arm to wipe her forehead. This simple movement led to her waves of upper arm fat leaving their rest on her fat side and hanging freely- almost causing her to lose her balance! She righted herself carefully and kept going. One step, two steps. Her stomach slapped against her legs. Three steps, four steps. Her shirt rode up and her pants rode down, exposing for all the school that she wore neither bra nor panties. Five steps, six. Sweat dripped off her forehead and collected in her chins. Seven, eight. She was nearly at the door! Nine, ten... Almost there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEleven...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final burst of energy, she stuck out a jiggly arm and heaved open the front door. She waddled inside and flopped triumphantly against the wall, collapsing to the floor. She sat there, panting with the exertion of her twenty-six steps...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...until she realized she still had to get to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah...Haff...Help...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now she was down, she knew there was no chance of getting up again without help \u2013 hopefully the others would come by soon. But\u2026 wait, surely they\u2019d already be in class? They\u2019d been running late because she\u2019d had such a massive breakfast, so chances were all her friends were in roll call right now. How long would she have to wait here? Until recess? Until lunch? Forever?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a deep breath (which was quite an effort, with the sheer amount of flab weighing on her chest) and tried to calm down. Someone would surely be along soon, and then they could help her up, and she could get to lessons. Then she remembered how much food she\u2019d probably be fed once she was there, and groaned. At this point in the morning she was at her emptiest, and her stomach was <i>still</i> straining uncomfortably to contain her vast breakfast. She couldn\u2019t remember the last time she didn\u2019t have chronic stomach ache, or when her skin didn\u2019t feel stretched to breaking point over her overstuffed midsection. The red marks that showed even against the dark skin of her belly were a testament to its repeated abuse. Perhaps she didn\u2019t mind sitting here a while longer, digesting what she\u2019d already eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted into a more comfortable position, legs spread wide to allow her massive stomach room to sit without putting any unnecessary pressure on it, and it grumbled happily at her. Her mom had always told her that gaining weight was a good thing \u2013 and her classmates certainly seemed to agree \u2013 but Susie was getting a little bit scared. She could barely even walk anymore, and she couldn\u2019t even stand up on her own. Not being able to move at all was getting awfully close, and though she loved the food and attention she got from her classmates the idea frightened her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, she could ask Miss Waxford if perhaps they should slow down a bit. She wasn\u2019t sure at all her teacher would listen, but did kinda miss playing outside with her friends. She remembered how she\u2019d used to do dancing lessons, and wondered naively if her leotard would still fit. Maybe she could try doing them again some time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could think anymore though, a round face appeared at the end of the corridor. It was Allysa!<br>\r\n\u201cSusie! We\u2019ve been looking all over for you. Miss Waxford was worried.\u201d The far smaller girl said happily. \u201cC\u2019mon, I\u2019ll help you up. I baked you a quadruple chocolate cake, come and eat it!\u201d<br>\r\nDespite Susie\u2019s thoughts only seconds before, the moment her friend mentioned chocolate cake her stomach began rumbling loudly. Perhaps she didn\u2019t need to have that word with Miss Waxford today\u2026 maybe she could put it off a while longer. After all \u2013 she did love chocolate cake. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a soft <i>plop</i>, she fell back onto the floor, sending ripples throughout her flabby form. \"Oof,\" said the bigger girl, her worries flooding back all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllysa was not one to give up, though. She pushed, pulled, shoved, lifted, heaved, and squeezed, for quite a while. The only thing she really succeeded in doing was further disheveling all of her friend's already disheveled clothing, revealing even more of her fat body. Allysa stood stymied, hands on her hips, then her expression changed to one of pure joy. She flopped with a <i>platch</i> onto her huge friend's belly (causing Susie to involuntarily groan in discomfort), pinched her fat cheeks, and squealed, \"You're so CUTE! I'll get the others!\" She jumped up and raced down the hallway, barely able to contain her joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was left alone for a few minutes more.

Soon after the cake Miss Waxford had given up all pretense of teaching and simply allowed the class to go to town. Not a moment went by in which Susie wasn't eating something. So energetic were they that they ran out of home-bought food in two hours. Not to worry, though: Miss Waxford seized the moment to teach about improvisational skills. Within minutes, the rambunctious kindergartners had raided the school's kitchen. First to go was the actual prepared lunch- overcooked green beans and terrible pizza- which even Susie didn't like (but still ate). Then came the true improvisation. Sticks of butter, bags of sugar, and gallons of vegetable oil wound up in the mildly disgusted Susie. This bought them until lunch. Susie hoped for a break. No such luck. A few of the more industrious members of her class rounded up a few of the bigger kids and convinced them to give their lunches over to the \"poor, starving\" Susie. Sandwiches, cups of yogurt, and generally wimpy bags of chips were the next casualties in the war on Susie's belly. <i><b>Now</b> will they stop?</i> thought Susie. Nope! Miss Waxford had called out for pizza. And lots of it. The class at large sampled a few slices, and then the greater part of five large pizzas went to Susie. And, at last, the end of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie had previously thought her stuffing from last night was a lot of food. That was nothing compared today. Her stomach was stretched to a ludicrous size. It was so high up as to impede her vision, so long as to reach her feet, and so taught as to be nearly transparent. It hurt, but in the best way possible. Susie was ridiculously full. She rubbed what little of her stomach she could reach, every movement sending painful reminders of how stuffed she really was. However, the day was not quite over for her...</span></div></div>",

Her mouth, nearly hidden by her fat laden cheeks and three chins was absolutely covered in food debris. Layers of white powder, oil, and grease were smeared over her face as the young girl gently touched and rubbed her stomach whining to herself. Miss Waxford knelt down beside her and firmly pressed her hand into her stomach, testing its give to see if the poor kindergartner had any room left in her gut. Fortunately for Susie, her stomach was rock hard, Miss Waxford's fingers barely making a dent in it allowing Susie a small reprieve from her force feedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class, it's time to weigh the class pet!\" Miss Waxford called out, the class getting up and crowding around their prized hippo of a classmate. It took the entire class to move the poor girl, as the teacher stood behind her to lift Susie and her classmates lifted her belly up from the floor so she could walk without tripping over it. Poor Susie groaned and whined the entire move, her body yelling at her as her stomach felt like exploding and her young bones crushed under her massive weight for such a young girl. Finally, after what seemed like a brutal eternity for the almost immobile 6 year old they made it to the scale, her classmates dropping her belly onto her legs as her entire body jiggled and swayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaannnd, it's 510!\" Miss Waxford announced, petting Susie's belly, which groaned and shook against her hand. \"We're so proud of you Susie!\" All Susie could do was stare back in a feeding obscured haze, food dripping down her chins and onto her chest as she let out a small burp and fart.</span></div></div>",

And, with all of her insulation, she sweated quite a lot- so much that whatever clothes she happened to be wearing were usually soaked through by the end of another day of stuffing. Her mother, as well, was so proud of her daughter's gain that she kept dressing her in clothes that fit hundreds of pounds ago, so there was usually quite a lot of Susie on display.

She heard her mother rattling pots and slamming the fridge, but didn't devote much thought to it. After all, the thinking was interfering with her food. She opened the shrink-wrap on a packet of cookies and stuffed her face, unaware of what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie's mother was steaming. \"The nerve of that teacher!

Susie's normal dinner was a fridge-buster, but she just kept cooking, and cooking, and cooking. The vast stockpiles of food in the basement were cooked, as was everything in the shed out back.

Evening turned to night, and still there seemed no end to the waves and waves of food. Pots of pudding, tiramisu, sticks of butter, entire pies, sheets of cookies, pans of Jell-O, and gallons upon gallons of ice cream fought for room in the obese girl's belly. By the end of \"dinner,\" it was one in the morning. Susie's stomach was so full she had to lean forward on the couch to let it rest on the floor. Every slight shift in position caused her to moan in pain. Her fat face and enormous yet tiny T-Shirt were smeared with the detritus of her feast. Even her hair was matted with sticky cream and a few grains of rice. As she moaned and groaned her way to sleep, her mother could only stand, breathe heavily, and smile even wider. What beautiful pounds this would make.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day at school...</span></div></div>",

There was the usual smell of food and the class was just as excited to see her, but still, something was off. Her friends guided her towards her beanbag...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only the beanbag was gone, replaced with a vaguely sinister hospital bed with a hole in the center. Next to it stood an ominous-looking crane and a double-sized wheelchair, as well as a comically oversized blender-y thing with a thick rubber hose snaking out of it. Susie couldn't make sense of it. \"Wh-whu...\" she wheezed, through fattened cheeks, \"who's bed is this?\" The class only laughed. \"Susie, you big silly,\" giggled Alyssa, poking her nose, \"it's yours!\" <i>Oh no,</i> the ludicrously fat kindergartner thought just before her classmates lifted her on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was a day unlike any other. Miss Waxford began the day by demonstrating the use of the blender-y thing, revealed to the enormous Susie to be a feeding machine, before rather suddenly sticking the end in Susie's mouth and turning it on. Now, rather than the usual group of people needed to stuff food into Susie, they could simply drop various items of snack into the machine, thereby allowing the class to both grow their pet and focus on the lessons. Plus, the pure\u00e9 allowed Susie to eat faster than she ever had before, leading to even more calories- and even more food. However, the new purchases were prepared for that too- when Susie first felt the urge to go to the restroom, Miss Waxford merely walked over, took off Susie's (ludicrously overstretched) pants, gave her a look and said, \"You go there, honey- what did you think the hole was for?\" The heavily embarrassed Susie, too large to do otherwise, went. The holding tank was luckily anti-odorous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the day wore on and Susie got even larger, the final pieces of her machinery got their demonstrations. The bell rang, and Miss Waxford showed the class the use of the crane. The class placed a number of canvas straps under Susie's enormity and with a few deft button presses and activation of levers Susie was lowered into the six-foot-wide wheelchair (which still pinched the girl's growing butt.) As her friends wheeled her out to the car, talking, laughing, and pushing cookies into her mouth, Susie wondered if this was all she'd ever be.  </span></div></div>",

On a liquid diet and no need to get up to go to the bathroom anymore, Susie was nearly constantly letting out long strings of farts and burps as she went to the bathroom whenever she pleased.

Susie had grown exponentially under its influence, now well into the six hundreds (663, according to the bed scale) and only getting larger. This was making her very nervous. The crane needed to lift her into bed was making more and more ominous noises every day, and the wheelchair seemed to grow tighter and tighter. She hadn't worn pants for quite a while, and she suspected her shirts would soon go as well. Even at 6XL they did little more than hide her chest- her belly, now near her calves, was far too large to be contained. In short, Susie was <b>fat</b>- and she didn't like it. Sure, it was nice being pampered to the extreme, but she was too large to do, well, anything, which was very scary. <i>What if there's a fire and I can't leave?</i> she thought to herself one sunny Friday morning. <i>What if everybody starts ignoring me? What then?</i> These thoughts were, of course, very silly- a more devoted group of friends there never was- but sounded quite logical to the enormous six-year-old. <i>But what'll I do?</i>  she wondered then. <i>I'm getting fed so much...</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the answer would be obvious to anybody else, Susie was never exactly the sharpest of people, and months of nothing but food had dulled her already dull wits even further. However, it did eventually make its way into her fat-clogged brain, and upon realizing it's obviousness she would have smacked herself on the head if she'd not been so lazy. <i>I've just gotta take that tube out! Then I'll slim down!</i> This was an absolutely terrible plan. Ignoring the obvious fact that that was not how fat worked, she'd not factored in the level of devotion from her friends. But Susie was not about to be deterred by logic. She instead took several deep breaths, summoned up her tiny reserves of energy, and set about moving her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an arduous task. To reach her flabby arms to the tube not only required her to move her lower arms, a difficult task in itself, but also her upper arms, which she hadn't moved unassisted in quite a while. Nevertheless, after straining herself for ten minutes, she was able to shift her arm into position and take the thick hose out of her mouth. She rested, with the tube spraying liquid pizza all over her shirt, then took another deep breath and wheezed out, \"want...stop...eating...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis move completely disrupted the class. As one, each of the kids abandoned their times tables and ran to their pet's side, ignoring Miss Waxford's futile attempt to corral them. They rubbed her bloated stomach comfortingly, murmuring kind words and hugging as much of her as they could. Susie was ecstatic! They understood! Then, Alyssa leaped onto the bed and...</span></div></div>",

She didn't let go she wanted to stop eating! Moaning and whining through her tube, Alyssa shimmied down to her colossal stomach and started rubbing large circles into it. It was tight, Susie's stomach absolutely packed to the brim with food as it inflated up and above her. The weeks of constant feeding made it difficult for Susie to even see the class anymore, the crest of her stomach rising above her vision as she laid flat on her back sucking down food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now class,\" Ms. Waxford called out, walking over to the crowd of children, \"It's not Susie-time yet. You will all have to wait till the end of class. There's plenty of food in there already.\" Stepping beside the six year old beached whale, she gave her stomach a quick jiggle to test it's fullness. Stopping for a moment, she stepped over to the feeding machine and turned it up another notch. This was horrible! Susie's plan couldn't have backfired in a worse way, as now the food pump was working overtime! Susie groaned, her eyes watering as she broke out in a cold sweat. Her usual dull ache of being over-fed turned into a throbbing pain as she was force-fed more liquid for than ever. Letting out a deep long fart, she watched as the class went back to their seats, unaware of her struggle and pleas.</span></div></div>",

However, the fact that she could even go places meant that she was <i>technically</i> still mobile, though it didn't feel much like it to the poor girl herself. But even those days had to come to an end, and come they did on one rainy April day. In the months since the introduction of the machine, Susie's weight gain had been off the charts, and her personal habits had only gotten worse- she'd gotten so lazy and used to using the bathroom as she pleased that she often wasn't able to make it all the way home without having to go. Her enormous stomach was now brushing the tops of her feet, and some of her rolls were beginning to hang off the sides of the bed. This had previously not been a big deal, but today was the day that everything gave out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Susie! Time to go!\" cooed Alyssa as she removed Susie's feeding tube and slid the crane's straps under the massive girl. She then stepped up to the control panel, flipped some switches...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and nothing happened. The crane gave a great WHRRR, but Susie didn't move an inch. The crane had become incapable of dealing with the overfed kindergartner. Alyssa cheered internally, but realizing the scope of the task at hand suppressed it. She rallied the class and told them that they'd have to get Susie going the old-fashioned way. Immediately the big girl was surrounded by a swarm of smaller kids pushing and pulling on various outcroppings of fat, slowly and surely rotating her to the side. As she turned, her fat cascaded in a slow and very jiggly waterfall, pouring over the side and hanging towards the floor. And even that was making Susie tired. Everything made Susie tired these days. Finally, though, the class turned her properly, and managed to set her down somewhat gently on her swollen feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright! Now just a few steps to the wheelchair!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive Susie took several deep breaths, and then proceeded to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... do nothing. She was so fat that she simply couldn't lift her feet off the floor or shuffle them, and her class, though determined, was not strong enough to move her in such a fashion. Alyssa still did not lose hope. She had half the class stand by her and sent a few more to grab the chair. They maneuvered it somewhat dexterously behind the swollen girl, and lowered her fat butt down into the seat. Well, most of it anyway-- a large portion of her flab overflowed the armrests and jiggled uselessly by the wheels. Finally, it seemed they had succeeded. She'd soon be on her way. Alyssa released the brakes, gave a solid push...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and the wheels bent, the frame collapsed, and Susie was unceremoniously dumped onto the ground. She lay there on her too-large stomach, a useless flabby lump barely able to draw breath, while behind her Alyssa finally gave the cheer she'd been holding on to. </span></div></div>",

For Susie, the reality had truly set itself in- she was really and totally incapable of doing anything. It made her very, very nervous, especially since the end of kindergarten was fast approaching. The question of what to do after was on the minds of the kids and adults, as well- was Susie the class's pet, meaning that she would accompany this group to first grade, or was she Miss Waxford's, meaning that she would stay for another group of kindergartners to fuss over? There was also the matter that she had not, technically speaking, passed kindergarten- but did her cultural status exempt her? No other question in the history of the school had been so mulled over. Meetings, PowerPoints, and puppy-dog eyes all failed to solve the problem, so one fateful May day the school board called it to a vote. It was eventually decided...</span></div></div>",

However, this designation was only ceremonial at best, for even if Susie was capable of grabbing a pencil and moving her arm enough to write, she certainly wouldn't do well on any sort of test- the months of doing nothing but eating had not exactly worked wonders for her already dull wits. All that would result from the change was her moving across the hall to Miss Wellspring's room- a task daunting in itself, for though her bed had wheels, it was wider than the door, which meant that it would have to be dismantled to move it across the hallway. Susie was also wider than the door, so she would therefore have to get off the bed. A task that hadn't been done in months, months in which Susie had had plenty of time to get fatter and flabbier. And then, once they finished with the bed, they would have to move Susie across the hallway as well- which would be even harder, seeing as Susie was rather hard to grab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various adults deliberated, discussed, and dissembled for nearly an hour before they realized they'd forgotten a fairly salient point- nobody had actually gotten around to telling the bedbound girl herself the results of the vote. Unable to reach a consensus on what to do, they decided to simply ask her, and trekked down to her classroom to do so. When they arrived, Susie was merely doing what she always did, which was eating, but she perked up slightly when she noticed the crowd of staff. She immediately wished she was wearing something- she had foresworn shirts long ago, which was no problem for her friends and classmates but rather a shock to anybody else. Luckily, none of the administrators seemed fazed. They immediately launched into a lengthy diatribe on her options and the plan, which of course bored poor Susie to tears.

She would love to have some new scenery; her months-long imprisonment within the classroom had left her bored to tears by her surroundings, having stared around at the same displays and pieces of artwork until there were all but burnt into her eyes. <br>\r\nIt was alright when everyone was there, in the day - then, at least, she could look around at her classmates faces and sometimes join in with their conversations - but later in the evening when even Mrs Waxford had gone home, she was left immobile in her bed with nothing to do and only the whirring of her feeding machine to listen to. She slept a lot, but being unable even to turn around to look at the other side of the classroom without help she felt more bored by the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she couldn't shake a niggling doubt that if she went with her friends to Miss Wellspring's classroom, she'd never leave it. She hadn't even stood on her own two feet in months, and with her gain only increasing in rapidity she was scared she'd never walk on her own again if this kept up. It all felt surreal and dreamlike, days blurring into weeks into months as she lay on her bed, barely thinking, barely moving. She hadn't felt the sun since she was rendered bedbound, and her dark skin - once smooth and unblemished - was now strained and blotchy, vicious purple stretch marks streaked across her vast body. Although her friends did their best to clean her with wet sponges and scrubbing brushes, her washes had become less frequent as she had ballooned in size; whereas once they had been every day, that had soon dropped to every week, then every fortnight. Now the process was hurried if it happened at all, even her friends losing interest as it became more and more of a chore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were uncomfortable. As Susie's hygiene deteriorated, she developed a series of itchy rashes and bedsores between her rolls, the constantly moist conditions taking their toll on her already strained skin. Miss Waxford had taken to wedging the classroom windows open to get an airflow, but even so a pungent smell of sweat and other, fouler things was obvious to any visitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her arms all but useless, forced out to her sides by the obscene bulk of her midsection, she wasn't even able to scratch her numerous itches, leaving her in a constant state of discomfort. Combined with the throbbing, splitting pain of her constantly stuffed gut and the tightness of her chest whenever she so much as stirred, her existence had become wretched indeed, and each day she felt more and more unhappy as she was submerged beneath a mountain of flabby pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo ultimately, what was her choice to be? Neither option looked good, and her head was starting to hurt from trying to think for the first time in several months. In any case, it sounded like the administrators had made up their minds already...<br>\r\n\"I'll-\" she managed to gasp, and everyone fell silent as they waited on her next word. After taking a few moments to gasp for air, the massive weight clinging to her chest making her breaths shallow and difficult, she spoke again. \"I'll... go.\" The words took all her strength, and the moment she choked them out she slumped back against her pillows, head spinning as she began to feel rather faint. <br>\r\nMiss Waxford laid a hand on the great expanse of Susie's chest, smiling tearily down at the enormous girl. <br>\r\n\"You be good for Miss Wellspring now,\" she said, looking proud, \"I'll come and visit you every lunchtime, don't worry!\" <br>\r\nSusie could barely hear her teacher's words over the sound of her pulse, loud and irregular, throbbing in her ears, but she got the gist. She smiled back up at her (one of the few things she could still manage alone), before slumping heavily backwards into an exhausted sleep. They'd have to move her later - for now, she had to rest. </span></div></div>",

So, with a few cursory handshakes, the issue was put to rest, and the administrators left Susie to sleep in peace. The year would end in about two weeks, and once the rest of the school was out they could truly focus on moving the blubbery girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat next week was one of the hottest on record. The school's vintage 1950s air conditioning broke on Monday, bringing an air of general stickiness to the building.

As she neared half-a-ton, simply existing took effort- and with effort comes sweat. Normally, this was bearable, but the rise in temperature only exacerbated the problem. Susie was practically dripping. Day in and day out, sweat flowed off her vast expanse, dampening the floor and bed she laid on. This, in turn, only made her itchiness worse. And with that came pungency. On Wednesday, as the temperature climbed to a whopping 102 degrees, one could almost see a haze over Susie's corner, as the dampness condensed into a vague cloud. Something had to change, and change it did. </span></div></div>",

Though they all loved Susie, the smell was really unbearable, and today especially there was a constant and very distracting <i>drip, drip</i>. Unfortunately, Susie was not a faucet, and there was really no way to stop the dripping other than a bath- and nobody wanted to give her one of <i>those</i>. So they read on- to their detriment, as ignoring a small problem always turns it into a large one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie was not at all enjoying herself. It was altogether too hot. There was an itch very close to her arm, but she couldn't move her hand enough to reach it- and of course couldn't move her arm in the slightest. She didn't have a book to read, the wall in front of her was just the same as it had always been, and the dripping of her own body was starting to bother her too, muffled though her ears were by facial flab. She attempted to take solace in the fact that it really couldn't get any worse when, of course, it did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was a loud pop and a quiet fizzle, along with an acrid smoky smell. As she could barely turn her head, at first she couldn't figure out what it was. But soon enough the lack of food from her feeding tube clued her in to the problem. The rain of her own sweat had soaked the floor to the point of ruining the extension cord of the machine.  Her body, so used by now to constant eating, was now thrown into a complete panic. Barely fifteen seconds after the change her belly was sending warning signals to her brain- HUNGRY, they cried. After thirty, the pain of not consuming was becoming unbearable. Susie screwed up her face and tried to cry for help, but the now useless tube only let her whimper. She flopped her hands and kicked her feet, uselessly attempting to attract some attention to her plight, but the surrounding fat deadened what little noise would have been made. Her belly growled in hunger, but it was so flabby that the fat worked against itself- although it shuddered from her middle all the way down to its end far past her toes, the groan was reduced to little more than a low moan. One minute had gone by, and Susie was getting desperate...</span></div></div>",

It had fed her, for unceasing months on end, the absolute perfect amount to fatten her at the fastest rate possible. Day in, day out, it pumped a sickly mix of nutrients and liquid lard down the vast girl\u2019s throat and into her titanic stomach, matching her rate of digestion to keep her in a permanent state of \u2018torturously overstuffed\u2019 no matter how fast she converted the incoming paste into fat. Indeed, it actually outpaced her digestion to a minute degree - just enough to ensure that her gut was constantly being stretched out larger and larger by her ridiculously excessive diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, when it stopped, there was a panic. Susie had grown to need food like a patient on life support \u2013 it was vital to her. Although her stomach was in constant pain from being overstuffed, it was now so wrenched out of shape, so stretched out beyond what it should be for a girl her age, that it could never return to its former self. And so, despite her resentment for it, she needed the feeding machine \u2013 now and forever. But her sweat had shorted it out, and now her oversized body was preventing her from attracting anyone\u2019s attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effort of shifting her arm slightly had left her gasping for air, and the panic was only making things worse \u2013 darkness was moving in around the edges of her vision as the desperate complaints from her midsection grew cripplingly worse, her stomach beginning to feel a slight hint of emptiness for the first time in longer than it could remember. But completely disabled as she was, what could she do? Her hands and feet flopped around uselessly, pathetic as a fish out of water \u2013 and with the vast weight of her flab weighing down on her body, she could barely even breath \u2013 never mind cry out for help. She could only roll her eyes in her head, trapped uselessly inside her immense form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUltimately though, her body came to the rescue in a way she could never have imagined. Her movements as she tried to attract attention shifted one of the great flab rolls hanging from her side, and a gasp of air escaped. It had been trapped there for nearly a day, festering and growing foul in its stagnation, and now it was released to drift slowly across the class. Some of her classmates retched, but didn\u2019t bother turning around \u2013 others glanced back, but saw nothing amiss. Then, the eye-watering fug of air made it to Miss Waxford, and the teacher looked over \u2013 in time to see a rising column of smoke drifting from the feeding machine. She deduced what had happened in an instant.</span></div></div>",

A fire starting was nothing new to her. So, with well-practiced authority, she gathered the class, pulled the fire alarm, and marched her students two-by-two out to the safe area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept, of course, for Susie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Waxford had years of fire drills under her belt. In every single one, the procedure was the same- line up the class, turn of the lights, lock the door, head out of the school. So, as was natural, she followed this procedure to the letter- and half-ton kindergartners were nowhere in this procedure. So out they went, leaving Susie alone and afraid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo few things in Susie's enormous body worked properly anymore. Her limbs were useless, her lungs couldn't breathe without the support of an oxygen tank, her digestive system was broken to the point of overtaxing the bed's holding tank, and she got chest pains from just thinking. Fight-or-flight, however, remained untouched- and that kicked in full force. Susie's small mind was overwhelmed with fear. Sweat, even more than before, broke out all over her enormous body. She flapped her pointless flabby limbs, stirring up her flab like waves in a gale and exhausting her still further. Through all of this, her hunger remained strong, intensifying the situation still further. Folds of fat shifted for the first time in months, sending out yet more gasps of moist, ancient air. Susie, convinced of the fire, gripped by the cold claws of biting hunger, and sure she was going to die, started to cry, salty tears flowing down her puffy cheeks and disappearing among her vast chins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was when the bed gave out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie's rather sudden, if pitiful, movements were the, to make it more accurate, lead blocks that broke the camel's back. Unbeknownst to anybody, the pin holding the back right wheel onto the leg was faulty, and this cracked it. The wheel went, the leg bent, and before long, the bed was dumping its surprised and terrified occupant unceremoniously onto the floor. And, to make matters even worse for the poor girl, the holding tank ruptured as well, and the smell in that classroom reached entirely new heights of disgusting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie wasn't capable of coherent thought at the best of times. Her entire worldview having been literally upended didn't help matters. After seeing only the door for months, the back wall was totally incomprehensible. Overwhelmed with new stimulus, Susie finally passed out, and soon was snoring gently despite the sirens outside. </span></div></div>",

Several girls were in hysterics, and one of the new teachers too. The arrival of the firemen, grim-faced and serious, didn't much help the situation, as that only convinced the children that something serious was happening. Through all of this, despite her devotedness, Miss Waxford had no time to think of Susie. Her hands were full with her out-of-control students and her clipboard blowing away, so though the class kept crying \"Susie!\" it all just went in one ear and out the other. And so it was that Susie got her first bath in six months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flabby girl was awoken by the stinging sensation of cold water on her massive, warm body. She gasped and moaned slightly in pain from the chill and the strength of the streams of water. She was not being directly targeted, luckily, but even just the spray felt terrible to her warm, weak skin. The water flew over her fat, trickling down into all her little nooks and crannies and flushing out months of stale sweat and filthy air. Her backside and legs were getting some of the freshest air they'd felt in months. It was one of the best things to happen to Susie in quite some time, but she didn't know it, dim as she was. All she knew was that it stung, that it was hard to breathe (her face was smushed into her breasts, and the many folds of her chin and neck had shifted enough to vastly restrict her breathing tube) and that she was, above all else, still ravenous. It had now been upwards of thirty minutes without food for the exhausted girl, and though she had slept for most of these minutes every single waking one was an exercise in starvation. She never <i>would</i> starve, of course- thousand-pound kindergartners rarely do- but it certainly felt like it. She was still totally immobile, though, so all she could do was lie there, facedown in her own rank-smelling fat, and pray for something to eat. </span></div></div>",

She put her hands on her stomach and the size from her last feeding still talked to her through her pudgy hands.

She wasn\u2019t too far behind the other kids so she could still follow them. <br>\r\nThere was a small walkway over the lawn in front of the kindy and many parents were there in cars and the staff were keeping an eye on the children\u2019s safety.

She wandered what she liked the most.<br>\r\nThe Horse standing with its head held high, the dog playing in the park or the pig who spent all day munching in its pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mum came in and saw what she had done.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I was wondering where that colouring in stuff was.

The children all began to congregate around the mat and the desks. Susie could not see Natalie anywhere <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoami and Susie sat down and Mrs Waxford began going through the routine with them of the coming day. There would be an art class with finger paints and paper followed by a Physical Education and a maths game.<br>\r\nSusie sat quietly. Her shirt felt a little constricting as she shifted her weight.  She looked at her fingers.<br>\r\nThey still had ink from the pens from last night. There was also smears of Nutella from her breakfast this morning. <br>\r\nThe movement of another impatient sitter from the corner of her eye turned and she saw Natalie.<br>\r\nShe looked like she was keen for painting on big sheets of paper as well.<br>\r\n\u201c...and so without further ado, I would like you all to find yourself an art smock and walk, do not run, to the aisles and I want you to paint something that you like the best.\u201d<br>\r\nAll the children got up and went to the racks where the art smocks were kept. <br>\r\nSusie pulled herself up and Noami was by her side and they wondered over.<br>\r\nMost of the painting smocks were one-size-fits-all as oversized old adult T-Shirts, so Susie did not need to have trouble finding something that fit her.<br>\r\nAll the other kids moved around and one of them put a chocolate cookie into Susies hand.<br>\r\n\u201cOh Susie\u201d Mrs Waxford scurried over. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. There are some snacks by the bean bag that you can get stuck into\u201d. <br>\r\nSusie looked up. She saw a few different boxes of chips and cookies around it. She went towards it. <br>\r\nNaomi looked up with a questioning look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie returned with a packet for herself and a packet for Noami.<br>\r\nShe and Naomi grazed on some crackers while they got paint on their fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe packets were forgotten as they began to indulge themselves in their painting.<br>\r\nNaomi finally stepped back with a painting that looked like a Wiggles Stage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie made a rainbow with several birds flying over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey washed their hands and recess was about to begin.<br>\r\nSusie got out her heavy lunchbox and sat next to Naomi.<br>\r\nThey began to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cMy mommy says that girls need to eat and be big to be beautiful. Funnily enough the rest of the kids want to help out.\u201d<br>\r\nTwo other girls passed her a candy bar.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you can see what I need to do\u201d<br>\r\nNaomi considered the candy bars.<br>\r\n\u201cYou could still play and draw\u201d she smiled \u201c I know I would like to play with you\u201d<br>\r\nThey both finished their food. Susie ate some candy bars but did not take much from her lunch box.<br>\r\nMrs Waxford rang the bell to show that the time was come to play.<br>\r\nThey all got up. Susie included and they sat down together in the sand pit.<br>\r\nNaomi found some toy animals in the container.<br>\r\n\u201cHello!\u201d She chirped \u201cI\u2019m Raymond the dog!\u201d<br>\r\nSusie pull out another <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Cuddles the koala!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Natalie!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls jump when they realised who was sitting with them in the sand pit.<br>\r\nThe Natalie blushed. Clearly she had not thought what to do after the surprise part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quietly picked up a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cT-Toby the Bull?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls looked at each other and giggled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see you earlier today. Where have you been?\u201d said Susie<br>\r\nNatalie\u2019s smiled wavered.<br>\r\n\u201cI had to see the Doctors. He was friendly, but he asked me a lot of questions about how I was. He said I was good, so I guess that\u2019s okay.\u201d<br>\r\nSusie frowned. She never thought about Doctors before.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey all played pretend for the rest of recess time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe PE lesson came around and most of the stuff that Susie had to do was more exercise than she had to in her life.<br>\r\nShe sat down and had a drink and a few of her snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusie also got into Maths and she found that the biscuits could work very well as counters and measuring for time and place.<br>\r\nAt the end of the day, Noami, Natalie and Susie spent so much time together, they each talked to their parents about going home and catching up.<br>\r\nNatalie had to go home, but he said she would ask her Mom next time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, she carried it back to the table and began eating. Her favorite color was green, but now her green shorts felt tight. She unbuttoned her shorts under the table and continued eating. She swallowed the last of her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh had only eaten half of his plate. \u201cYou want the rest, squirt?\u201d Josh was a nice big brother, and didn\u2019t mind his sister\u2019s eating habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d Becky said as Josh scooted the plate over. She fixed her glasses, which were always sliding around her face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll just be going to the bathroom,\u201d their mom said. \u201cTell the staff they can take my plate.\u201d She left. There was a sizable amount of food left on her plate. Becky looked to make sure her mother was gone, and then dumped her mother\u2019s food onto her plate. Josh didn\u2019t notice, as he was busy playing his gameboy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was just finishing the food when their mom came back. \u201cYou guys ready to go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Josh. Becky finished the last morsel of ham on her plate and remembered that she needed to button her shorts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll have to buy some new clothes for you today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping Josh at a friend\u2019s house, Jo took her daughter to the department store. \u201cWant some ice cream, Becky? You never had dessert back at the buffet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah!\u201d said Becky. Jo drove the drive-thru of a nearby Dairy Queen, letting her daughter order a large cookie dough blizzard. Becky had finished most of it when they parked at the department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went into the kids section, and Jo looked through the girls clothing. \u201cSomething a size or two bigger, so we can grow into it. See anything you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky pointed to a pair of green shorts just like the ones she was too big for. Unfortunately, they were the exact same size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don\u2019t have much here for a girl of Becky\u2019s physique, Jo thought. Kids grow in strange ways in these years. She led Becky to another part of kids clothing, which happened to be husky sizes. Becky didn\u2019t notice the difference. Finally, Jo found a few pairs of pants that would fit Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove away Jo glanced at the clock. \u201cJosh has his baseball game at three o\u2019clock. Did you want to go see it? Or I could leave at home for a few hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky pondered. She had seen plenty of her brother\u2019s baseball games, but they did serve great hot dogs at the community park's concession stand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They made their way to the seats and sat down quickly, cheering as they spotted Josh and his team. The game began and Becky watched for a while, not really understanding much of what was going on. Baseball didn't interest her much, even if her brother was one of the players, and she was soon bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at the new pants they'd bought at the department store. They were much more comfortable than her other clothes - recently, all her clothes seemed to be a little too small for her, the waistbands digging into her tummy when she sat down and stuff like that; these pants though were nice and loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing around, she caught sight of the concession stand, and suddenly remembered the great hot dogs they served there. She was still feeling quite stuffed from everything else she'd eaten today, but she reckoned she had enough room for a little more. She grabbed her mom's sleeve and tugged on it.<br>\r\n\"Mommy, can I have a hot dog from the stand?\" Jo looked down at her, uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, you've already eaten quite a lot today. How about you wait until we get home?\" Jo suggested. She wasn't really concerned about her daughter's weight at all - in fact, it hadn't even crossed her mind that Becky might be anything but average. However, even she thought a buffet, ice cream AND a hot dog in a single afternoon was excessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeease, I'm really hungry,\" Becky lied, clutching her tummy with one hand as she tugged irritatingly at her mom's sleeve with the other. Jo rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but this is your last snack until dinner.\" She got up and went to buy a hot dog for her hungry daughter, wondering where this newfound appetite had come from. Maybe she was going through a growth spurt?</span></div></div>",

It was large - more like a meal than a snack - but the smell reignited Becky's hunger.<br>\r\n\"Gimme!\" she said, snatching at it. Jo held it out of reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manners!\" Jo exclaimed. \"What do you say?\" <br>\r\nNow it was Becky's turn to roll her eyes. Her tummy was rumbling again, the scent of sausage making her completely forget how much she'd already eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" she said grudgingly, and Jo passed her the hot dog. She tore into it immediately, tomato ketchup dripping onto her shirt in her haste. Jo grumbled to herself as she watched her daughter eat - that was just yet more washing she'd have to do later. Forgetting about it, she turned back to watch the baseball game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time half the hot dog was gone, Becky was running out of energy. She'd already eaten a lot that day, and she was beginning to feel a bit sick - beneath her tight shirt her belly was swollen and bulging, packed to bursting with unhealthy junk food. She'd always had a fairly big appetite, and was no stranger to overeating - that much was obvious from her pudgy body - but she'd never eaten this much in a single afternoon before and it was taking its toll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo glanced down at her.<br>\r\n\"You alright, darling? Can't finish it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky frowned.<br>\r\n\"I'm - I'm fine.\" She said stubbornly, biting off another big mouthful of the hot dog. \"I'm gonna finish it.\" More determined than ever, she choked down the rest of the greasy snack, swallowing down the last bite as the game was almost finished. She leaned back in her chair, groaning unhappily; her belly was aching sharply, filled to its absolute limits. Her new pants, so loose only half an hour ago, now felt tight against her swollen tummy - but still she was filled with a sense of victory. She'd managed to finish the hot dog, even if she felt awful now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could revel in her success too much though, her mom was standing up.<br>\r\n\"Come on Bec, the game's over. Let's pick up Josh and head back to the car.\"</span></div></div>",

As they pulled out of the parking lot and headed from home, Josh looked over at his little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright, Bec? You look kinda... stuffed,\" he said, gazing incredulously at her swollen midsection. He knew his little sis had an appetite but this just seemed excessive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I ate a hot dog while you were playing. It was pretty big, but I finished it all,\" she announced proudly. Josh raised his eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even after everything you had earlier? Sheesh. You won't be my little sister for long if you keep eating like that!\" he laughed, giving her exposed belly a little poke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooo!\" Becky squealed, batting his hand away, \"Don't!\" Josh chuckled, considering for a second tickling his younger sister - but from the look on her face she'd probably just be sick on him. Obligingly, he withdrew his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that reminds me,\" he said a moment later, \"have you heard of that new juice drink that they're selling now? Lotus, I think they call it. We had some before the game, it's fantastic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe peaked Becky's interest. She wasn't allowed more than one soda a day, but juice was fair game.<br>\r\n\"What's it taste like?\" she asked, licking her lips despite herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno. Lotuses?\" Josh shrugged. Becky already wasn't listening to him though - she was leaning forward, trying to get her mom's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy? Mommy? Can we buy some Lotus? Pleease?\" she whined, \"Josh had some, I wanna try it. Pleeease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo rolled her eyes. She hadn't been planning to stop off at the shops on the way home, but she just knew Becky would pester her until she did. Without a word, she pulled into the parking lot of the nearest supermarket.

Her aching stomach forgotten entirely, she rushed inside the house the moment her mom unstrapped her from her car seat and got a glass ready in the kitchen. A moment later her mom came in after her, carrying the shopping under one arm. She rolled her eyes, half amused, half exasperated at Becky's behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get too excited Bec, you might not even like it,\" she warned as she poured some of the vibrant green liquid into her daughter's glass. Her prejudice was ultimately unjustified, however, as Becky immediately gulped it down and held the glass out again for more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fantastic!\" she almost moaned, eyes wide. It tasted incredibly sweet, like liquid candy to her little mouth, along with some fruity flavour she couldn't identify, \"More please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, Jo poured her daughter another glass, then put the bottle on the table.<br>\r\n\"Have as much as you like darling, it's just fruit juice,\" she said, before heading out of the room, leaving Becky alone as she swallowed down her second glass of Lotus. The toxic-green liquid felt sticky on her lips and in her mouth, but it tasted incredibly, unbelievably good. Her second glass was gone in seconds, followed quickly by a third.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point though, her abused stomach made itself known once again. Stuffed with several plates of buffet food, ice cream, a hot dog and now three glasses of hyper-sugary juice, it was gurgling and aching to no end. Reluctantly, she put the Lotus bottle in the fridge and made her way through to the sitting room, where she collapsed onto the couch to watch some cartoons and nurse her absurdly bloated gut. Normally, Becky could be described as pudgy - but right now, her belly was so swollen that she looked downright fat, shirt pulled up to expose the taught skin of her overstuffed tummy.</span></div></div>",

She rolled off the couch, belly now rumbling hungrily - it seemed all the food she'd eaten that day had finally been digested, leaving room for more. Before she even had time to realise how hungry she felt, the aroma of frying sausages send her hurrying towards the kitchen to see what was for dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo turned to smile at her as she stumbled blearily into the kitchen, rubbing sleep out of her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Oh, good, I was just about to wake you. Dinner's ready. Go sit at the table, I'll serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky went and hopped onto a chair, and before she knew it there before her was a great plate of buttery mashed potatoes, sausages and baked beans - and even another glass of Lotus. Without a moment's hesitation Becky tucked in, swallowing down great bites of the meal so quickly she could barely even taste them. She felt incredibly hungry - much more so than usual - and before long the entire plate was clear, the adult-size portion of food vanished into the starving five year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo was impressed - her daughter always had a big appetite, but today was exceptional even for her. <br>\r\n\"Do you want more, darling?\" she asked, still on her first portion herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky let out a little burp - her belly felt full, but somehow she was still hungry. She quickly slurped down the last of her Lotus, then smiled messily at her mom, chin stained with baked beans.<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah <i>please</i>.\" Jo corrected halfheartedly as she spooned more potato onto her daughter's plate, \"Remember your manners, dear.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecky was too busy with her second portion to listen to her mother's rebuke though, mouth and mind already full of delicious food. <br>\r\nHer hunger seemed insatiable - and as happened earlier, the only thing that eventually managed to stop her was the increasing discomfort from her mistreated stomach. Even as she swallowed down the last of her second portion, belly aching fiercely, she still somehow felt as hungry as when she had first begun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe whined in piteously frustration; she was desperate to eat some more to sate the rumbling hunger deep in her gut, but at the same time that very same gut was desperately pleading with her to not be fed any more, the poor organ stretched to its very limits. Irritated, she threw down her fork and leaned back in her chair, massaging her belly to relieve some of the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, darling? You sure ate a lot there,\" Jo asked, looking concerned, \"How about you get an early night and sleep it off?\"<br>\r\nBecky nodded, eyes watering. An early night sure sounded appealing just about then. Without a word, she let her mom help her from her chair and up the stairs to bed, falling into a deep sleep the very second her head touched the pillow.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Over the next two weeks, Becky settled into some rather unhealthy habits. She quickly took to drinking two or three litres of Lotus a day - she had it alongside everything, from meals and snacks, to just drinking it down on its own whenever she could. Her mom didn't care - it was just fruit juice, right? What could possibly be harmful in <i>juice</i> of all things?<br>\r\nHer appetite also suddenly increased. If she'd been a big eater before, now she was a massive one, swallowing down as much as her beleaguered stomach could bear at every meal. Ever since that day they'd gone to watch Josh's baseball game, it seemed that her appetite was quite literally insatiable, much to her frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer perpetually full stomach contributed to another unhealthy habit - inactivity. Her belly was typically so full at any one time that even the slightest nudge would make it ache for minutes, so the running-about and general games of a typical child her age quickly ground to a halt as she attempted to avoid jostling her poor tummy at any cost. She spent most of her time now splayed out across the couch or asleep in her bed, whittling away at her holiday one wasted day after another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effects of these bad habits soon manifested as changes in the young girl's body. Though subtle, for now, an attentive observer would notice a softening of her features, a plump roundness to her form that hadn't quite been there before. Her belly became softer and rounder, a thickening layer of flab obvious even when she was (as was such a regular occurrence now) stuffed fit to burst. Her upper arms and thighs lost what little muscle they had, and even her little butt became chunkier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a single member of Becky's family noticed these changes, though. They were busy with other things, and as the youngest member of the household became more and more of a couch potato, appearing outside of mealtimes only to grab more Lotus or a snack (usually both at once), none of them noticed a thing.</span></div></div>",

She was no longer a chubby child but downright fat. She also became pretty lazy but no one noticed this. Not even Becky. She just liked eating and drinking while watching T.V like other kids liked swimming and going to the playground. <br>\r\nBecky's mother still did't thought anything was wrong with fruit juice. But there was something with the name Lotus. She was sure she heard it before somewhere. But she could't remember where that was. It kept nagging her when she went to bed and while she was doing normal house hold things. She just knew there was something with the name Lotus. But even while she could't remember where she heard the name before. She kept buying it. With how much Becky drank of that stuff it was important that she bought a lot of it. She rather had Becky drinking fruit juice then soft drinks.<br>\r\nBut it was almost time to go back to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was watching T.V in her pajamas. Since they were elastic they still fit her growing body. That and Becky was most of the days to lazy to get dressed. But this day her mother walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky it's almost time to go back to school.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky moaned. She did't liked school. She rather stayed home. But if she should believe Josh it would only get worse. Especially in first grade. Well at least she had still one easy year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky I know you don't like school... and to be honest, I hated school too when I was young. However... you need to go. You can't stay home unless your sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about school sick?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few days a year. Not more. But can you try on your uniform? See if it still fits. You're a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Becky moaned and rolled of the couch like a beached whale, and slowly waddled upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother sighed and cleaned up some of the packages of stuff Becky used for breakfast and walked too Becky's room and was a bit surprised How Becky was squeezed in her mini school uniform. She had't been able to pull her pants up all the way. Her shirt was only able to cover about half of her torso. Her belly was bare for all to see. However her mother was still blind to her daughters gaining weight and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it shrunk in the wash. I have to buy a new one. Perhaps a few sizes bigger since you probably have grown of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky surely had grown. But not in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what you need to get some new clothes anyway. Get dressed and then we go clothes shopping and take your size. Then I can ask school for a uniform the right size. Now go get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was easier said then done. Becky's waistline grew, but her clothes did't. Becky Tried clothes but most pants had trouble going up. Even if the did she was't able to button them. It was just as difficult if finding a shirt that covered her bellybutton.<br>\r\nIn the meantime her mother looked at some titles of the books in Becky's bookcase.</span></div></div>",

Eventually though, she did find an outfit that was just about sufficient - one of Josh's old shirts with a baseball team logo on the front and some shorts with an elasticated waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither fit her particularly well. The shirt was stretched tight over her belly but hung loose elsewhere, and the shorts were so tight that her plump thighs looked like badly stuffed sausages - but at least she was covered. <br>\r\nBecky looked down at herself, feeling miserable.<br>\r\n\"Mommy, why do none of my clothes fit?\" she asked, tugging at the shorts disconsolately, \"All my favourite dresses are too small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's mom gave her daughter a reassuring hug.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, you're a growing girl!\" she reassured her, \"And we're about to go out and buy you a load more favourite dresses right now!\"<br>\r\nBecky pouted, but didn't say anything as her mom lead her out of her room and outside to the car.

Just as she was finishing her drink, they arrived at the mall and Becky's mom helped her out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky followed a couple of steps behind her mom as they entered the shop, grunting slightly as every step jostled her aching stomach. Even this very short walk was now tiring for her - her thigh muscles were burning and she was out of breath, face flushed as they made their way through the aisles towards the kids section. The moment they got there Becky sat down heavily on the floor, breathing ragged and wheezy. She was sweating profusely, dark stains appearing on the shirt under her arms. Her mom looked at her with worry - this didn't seem right even to her - but before she could think too hard about it a young shop assistant appeared beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, ma'am?\" the girl asked, smiling brightly at her. Becky's mom nodded hurriedly.<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, I'm looking to buy some new clothes for my daughter. She's growing so fast at the moment, you know, and she's about to go back to school.\"<br>\r\nThe shop assistant nodded amicably, before glancing over at Becky. She looked the overweight five year old up and down, then turned back to Becky's mom.<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't think our standard range is going to accommodate a child of your daughter's... proportions. Our husky range, however, is right over here...\" she led mother and daughter through to the next aisle over, where the plus-sized clothes hung from the shelves.<br>\r\nBecky's mom looked around for a moment, bemused, then she laughed loudly.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Becky's not husky, this stuff will be far too big for her,\" she said, thoroughly ignorant of her daughter's exponentially increasing size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the customer is always right...\" the shop assistant said, rolling her eyes, \"What size is she, then?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, she was normal size for her age last time we were here, so I suppose she probably still is,\" Becky's mom said, \"If you could measure her to check exactly though, that'd be great.\"</span></div></div>",

The shop assistant looked at the numbers and then again at Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well according to her measurements... she... still needs clothes in... the husky range.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo gave her an angry look but  decided to look in the husky range anyway. Becky after all was a growing girl. Becky was growing. Not in the right size but she surely was growing. Even while Becky's sizes were a lot bigger then they used to be still her mother did't realized her daughter's size. She looked through the clothes. She knew exactly what Becky liked. clothes with pictures of Fairy tales and cartoons she watched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand why Becky's sizes are in the husky range. Do all kids here suffer from anorexia or something?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecky sat down. There was a T.V showing a movie for kids. So the little kids had something to do while their mother picked clothes for them. <br>\r\nBecky normally did't do any kind of exercise. But in the past month she gained more weight and became very lazy that made her weak muscles even weaker. She rubbed her belly. She hoped mom would take her to the food court after wards. She felt hungry even while she ate a short while ago. She also just wanted to eat. She liked eating just as much if some other kids liked their teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky I found some nice clothes for you. A few dresses and some nice shirts and pants. Lets try them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky sighed and stood up and walked with her mother to a dressing room. Jo helped Becky try on the new clothes. To her surprise they fitted perfectly. However she was still in denial about Becky's growing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. After we're done... can we get some food at the food court?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Becky. You can't be hungry already. You just ate an hour ago.\" Jo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... but... the food here taste so good.\" Becky said using her puppy dog eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe puppy dog eyes were Becky's biggest weapon. She could look so sad you hart would break. Becky normally used it to get what she wanted and to get out of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess since you have't been complaining, you deserve a treat. So fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky felt a lot happier. But she suddenly got a frown on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy my pants are kind of tight.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo lifted her shirt and saw the pants were cutting a bit in Becky's soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm maybe I should buy those one or two sizes bigger. so then you have some room to grow. Wait here. I'll be right back.\" Jo said and walked out with the pants and returned with some bigger ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah those fit way better.\" Becky said after she tried the new pants. \"More room for my belly.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo paid for the clothes and walked to the food court. She looked over her shoulder to look for Becky. Becky was waddling. Her weak muscles and laziness from the past time made her slow and she got easily tired from even the distance from the clothing store to the food court what really was't such a long distance.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her new clothes were much more comfortable to walk in, sure - the pants didn't dig in under her belly any more at least - but her useless muscles and newly flabby body hadn't changed. She collapsed into a chair the moment she could, sweating dripping off her nose onto the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo watched her, looking faintly worried again.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, sweety?\" she asked, hovering anxiously beside her struggling little girl. After a few seconds though, Becky was feeling well enough to sit up and decide what she wanted to order, and Jo's worries were sated.<br>\r\n\"Can I have a, um, a Big Mac, and fries, and a big bottle of Lotus please mommy,\" she managed to say, and Jo nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Becky darling,\" she said, hurrying away to order the meal. It didn't sound like an awful lot, but it was more than a girl Becky's age should be expected to eat in a day, never mind a single sitting - not that Jo knew that of course. She approached the McDonald's and ordered at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one Big Mac, a large fries and a bottle of Lotus for my daughter, and just a salad for me, please.\"<br>\r\nThe cashier nodded and began ringing up the order.<br>\r\n\"Lotus, huh?\" he said as he worked, \"Weird stuff that. I don't trust it. Like, what kind of proper drink is that colour?\"<br>\r\nJo shrugged, surprised.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's better than soda, I guess,\" she said, \"My daughter drinks loads of it, she loves it.\"<br>\r\n\"That does seem to be the way,\" the cashier said, \"Once you start drinking it, you don't seem to stop. And that'll be nine dollars, please.\"<br>\r\nJo pulled out her purse and handed over a note.<br>\r\n\"I guess. Still, it can't be too bad; it's fruit flavour, I think.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" the cashier said, passing her meal over the counter to her, \"It just seems to do weird things to your appetite. Have a nice day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo smiled once more at the friendly cashier, then took the food and returned to the table. Becky reached out to snatch at it the moment it came within reach.<br>\r\n\"Gimme!\" The omnipresent hunger that had plagued Becky recently seemed worse than ever today, her belly growling audibly as she ripped open the bag and began gorging on its fatty contents. Grease dripped down her face, already staining the top that she'd only bought a few minutes ago. Once the burger was gone she moved on to the Lotus, gulping down the entire bottle in one long chug. Finally she grabbed handfuls of fries and pushed them forcibly into her mouth, barely able to swallow fast enough. In no time at all the entire meal was gone - and Jo had barely even started her salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo wondered if maybe the cashier was right. Becky's appetite had seemed a little odd recently, she supposed... no, no, it was probably nothing. Promptly forgetting about it, she returned to her own meal.</span></div></div>",

For dessert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are't you full sweet hart?\" Jo asked, but already pulled her wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still have enough room for a shake.\" Becky said trying to sound as sweet if she could. A way she used often to get what she wanted. It mostly worked, and it did now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo got up to get a shake for Becky. Becky in the meantime stretched herself once and her belly poked out between her shirt and pants. Becky blushed ca bit and pulled her shirt down. However Becky suddenly realized that she perhaps gained more then she or her family realized. She enjoyed just lying on the couch watching T.V, eating food and drinking lotus. She always used to be a bit fat. Her sister often teased her with it. But now she looked at herself she realized she was a lot bigger them she was before. However she forget this all when her mother gave her a shake.<br>\r\nJo finished her salad while Becky was still busy  drinking her shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Becky. You can drink that shake on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo took Becky by her wrist of one hand while Becky hold the shake in her other hand. Becky had trouble to keep up with her mother. She felt all the food slosh around inside her. Her thighs were rubbing her belly jiggling and her butt wobbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! (pant) Can you (pant, pant) slow down (pant) a bit? (pant pant) I have (pant) short legs. (pant, pant).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo did slow down but looked a bit worried at Becky. The just walked a short distance and Becky already seemed  tired. Beck never had been an active kid. She never showed any interest in sport. But still could she be already tired from such a short walk. However she started to walk slower so Becky could keep up. But when they finally reached the car Becky seemed exhausted. panting heavy. But still Jo did't realized that it was because of her daughters huge weight, just like she still did't realized how fat Becky really was. In her eyes Becky was just like any other 5 year old. <br>\r\nWhen they came home Becky took a tall glass of lotus and some cookies and went sitting on the couch again watching T.V.<br>\r\nJo called school to ask for a new uniform for Becky using the measurement she got in the store still not seeing how fat her daughter was.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shirt was tight, and large gaps between the buttons showed her soft belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, once she had finally arrived at school, it seemed she wasn't the only one on a Lotus kick.

Becky grinned, happy to see she wasn't the only one getting in on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she <i>hadn't</i> noticed, however, was that these kids were also quite rounded, either just tubby or rather large like herself.

Both really gained. Becky hugged her friend Gwenda. She was wide with brown hair in a ponytail. Gwenda always had been a chubby girl but now she was fat. But Becky still was fatter. Both liked it sinking a bit in the fat of the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so good to see you again. But I rarely saw you in the vacation. We had sleepovers and went swimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I was busy.\" Becky said, not telling that being busy was lying on the couch snacking, drinking lotus and watching T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now it's time for school again! hi hi hi\" Oona said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOona was a typical happy girl. Always giggling. With pink hair and mostly a bright smile showing her perfect white teeth. Wat before the vacation had been a nice jelly belly was now a round potbelly with a lot of extra fat on her body, especially her butt and thighs had grown a lot giving her a pear shape.   <br>\r\nThere was a third girl with them. She had very long black hair, was kind of short and was very fat but still Becky was fatter. She looked at her feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Becky asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you forget who I am?\" The girl asked, raising her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pandora? Is that you? Wow I did't recognize you.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because Pandora was a thin girl before vacation. She was also the smallest girl in class. She tried to make that up by having the longest hair that had grown past her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. we all gained. Just like you.\" Pandora said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I did't gained. Perhaps a few pounds but not too much.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi hi hi, You did gain Becky. And more the just a few pounds. You gained a lot of pounds. But that's not bad. Almost every kid in school gained. A few exceptions but most kids did. Besides I think it looks good at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky suddenly started to think. All the clothes that were too small. All the snacking and drinking while lying lazy on the couch. Not burning a single calorie while she was constant getting more calories inside her. How harder it was to move and walk and how snug her uniform was. Slowly she noticed she was fat. Very fat. Her friends were fat and she was the fattest. However she did't saw this like a bad thing. She noticed how big her belly had become butt she liked how round and fat her belly had become. She liked her love handles. She realized she was fat and loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look there's our teacher.\" Pandora said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky and her friends waddled over too school<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They all looked so- so different! And not in the normal growing up, aging kind of way either. It seemed that over the summer break, at least half of the students had become significantly heavier. There were a fair few that seemed unaffected, certainly, but of those who had changed the difference was stunning - several had gone from skinny to chunky, or from chunky to straight up fat, in only a couple of months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Hassan was used to children coming back from break chubbier - it was just a fact of life. What she wasn't used to though was it being this widespread, this drastic, and this unexpected; and from the look of the playground it wasn't an issue confined just to her classroom. Swallowing dryly, she began roll call. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked her way down the list of names, she noticed something; almost every kid who had gained over the summer was drinking the same liquid. Whether it was from a little carton, can or bottle, all were guzzling the same thing. Squinting at the label, she could just make out the name... Lotus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mrs Hassan was trying to work out what on earth had happened to America's youth over the summer break, Becky, Pandora, Oona and Gwenda were getting reacquainted. The four were at a table by themselves, sipping Lotus and chatting about what they'd been up to. It seemed that all of them had spent rather a lot of time lying around and snacking over the break, but Oona had been on a vacation out of state on top of that, and was very eager to tell them about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oona talked, Becky shuffled in her chair. The classroom felt a lot smaller and more claustrophobic than she remembered from last year - her chair was set a bit to close to the table, but she couldn't move it back even a little because there wasn't enough room behind her. As a result, her belly was pressed right up against the table, and due to it being as thoroughly stuffed as ever it was getting quite uncomfortable. She took a sip of Lotus to make herself feel better, already wondering how long it was until they were allowed to go and eat their snacks.</span></div></div>",

She went directly to the school nurse and knocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" The school nurse (Mrs. McCoy) said, and Mrs. Hassan entered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mrs. Hassan. Already here on your first day. School hardly started. Not such a good start. Too bad. Is it a student or is something wrong with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... there's nothing wrong at the moment. It's just that... well... I noticed that most kids... seem well... to have gained a lot. Not just a bit. A lot of kids gain some pounds during the vacation. But they have gained more then a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's not just me.\" Mrs. McCoy said. \"I also noticed a lot of kids seemed to have gained a lot of weight. I thought I was maybe seeing things. But It seemed I was't. So the kids are gaining. But why did you came to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can't tell parents that their kids are fat. But you can. If kids are overweight you can send a letter to his or her parents right?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well... I can do that. I can also give them perhaps a full check up. Height, sight, reflex and weight too. If I would only check the weight it would seem a bit weird. Well I will ask the principal if I can give all kids a check up. You can better go back to your class. It's not smart to leave those kids alone for too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky an all others were looking around in the class. They were new toys and games they could play with. Mrs. Hassan seemed like a nice teacher. It seemed like this would become a great year. <br>\r\nBecky went to a spot in the reading corner and looked again a her belly. It was big. She always used to be a bit fat but this was way more then a bit. How was it possible she did't noticed. Not even her family noticed. No one. She touched her belly and smiled. She liked it. It was soft and squishy. Like a nice pillow. She liked it. She liked it a lot. She liked being fat and now... she wanted to get fatter.     </span></div></div>",

She went upstairs to sort through clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral pairs of her shorts were getting tight. All of these either had buttons or zippers on them. Her elastic shorts and pants still fit fine. She changed into one pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer t-shirts were still okay, but her button-up shirts were taunt. She changed into a green shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky sat reading until she heard the door open and the noise of Josh\u2019s baseball team mingling downstairs. It would be time to eat. Becky licked her lips and envisioned the food she saw on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky, you want to come down and eat?\u201d her mother called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky grabbed a plate and sat between Josh and a beefy kid named Kyle. She took a section of the party sub and some chips, and listened to the baseball team as they ate and talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet you I could eat eight slices of pizza,\u201d a boy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s nothing, I could eat ten,\u201d said Bobby, another player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could eat way more than that,\u201d said Kyle. His less active position as catcher made him a bit thicker than the other team members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre those fightin\u2019 words, Kyle? I\u2019ll challenge you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even beat me on a good day. I once ate fourteen slices in a sittin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\nBecky spoke up. \u201cI could eat more than that.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked down at her. \u201cYou\u2019re just a girl. Besides, you\u2019re five years old and you just ate some of that sub. There\u2019s no way you could bet me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna bet?\u201d she said, trying to do an intimidating stare at Kyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, hold on.\u201d The first kid shifted an uneaten pizza over to the other side of the table. \u201cWe\u2019ll do this fair. The three of you start with a piece, and we see who can eat the most pieces in five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Bobby, Kyle, and Becky agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll start the timer\u2026 and go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three competitors grabbed a slice and ate. They chewed them down almost simultaneously, and then reached for another. Within a minute, Bobby showed signs of slowing, and stopped after his sixth slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle and Becky are still going at it!\u201d exclaimed the kid moderating. \u201cSomeone get them another pizza!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they started the new pizza, Kyle got slower and slower in his eating, but Becky actually sped up now that she had a rhythm going. Kyle plopped a half eaten piece of pizza out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle\u2019s out at twelve! Becky\u2019s still going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky ate rapidly, and the other kid called time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs she still eating?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky, you can stop now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, over already?\u201d she asked, mouth full of pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c24 freakin\u2019 slices!

The loved it when they came to visit. Her grandpa always liked it to play a little baseball with his grandson and son in law.

Becky was too busy eating to hear her. \"Here sweetheart, let me put some more on.\" Grandma began to spray more and more whipped cream as Becky ate. Becky was so close to the plate that it was like Becky was just shoveling in all the whipped cream grandma was spraying out. Her grandma slowly moved next to her and moved the nozzle closer to Becky's lips. Eventually, Becky's grandma was spraying whipped cream directly into Becky's mouth. Becky hardly noticed this transition, and just closed her eyes and moaned as the sticky, sugary cream filled her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked the feeling of grandma's hand on her belly as she allowed herself to be fed more and more fattening cream. The canister ran out and sputtered, and Becky slowly came to her senses. \"Oh, there's still more pie!\" she said happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandma laughed, \"You better hurry and eat it all up!\" she said.

Besides it's Sunday tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mommy?\" Becky asked with her puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mom. Then i can train a little more on my splitter. I really need to learn that so we have a chance to win!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can all stay. Becky and Josh can sleep in the kids room and Jo can sleep in the guest room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids room was the name for the room they had for their grandchildren to stay when they went to them for a sleepover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then i guess they can stay. But i still have some things i need to do. I go get their clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hooray!\" Becky yelled happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Jo drove away Josh and his grandfather tried to perfection his splitter while Becky and her grandmother choose dinner and most important dessert and in the meantime Becky ate the remaining pie while her grandmother rubbed her belly with her hand.<br>\r\nA few hours later Josh and his grandfather walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh throws perfect splitters!\" Grandpa said with a smile. \"But we need a new window for the garage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma turned her head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Josh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh that window was my mistake.\" Grandpa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky and her grandmother who were busy cooking both shook their head and mumbled: \"boys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky noticed how much her grandmother and she looked alike. The hair of her grandmother was turning grey but when she was young her hair was just as red as Becky and she was also a big eater and was still a  little plump. Her dad sometimes said that grandmothers genes missed one generation and went directly too Becky. Becky said that she liked it to look like her grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater they all went sitting for dinner with lots of fries, salad with some feta cheese and burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Becky picked out the dinner.\" Josh said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Something wrong with it?\" Becky asked who piled her plate with two burgers and a huge pile of fries and almost drowned them in mayonnaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! It's just that lately you developed a taste for fatty food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky turned her head and concentrated on her food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh don't tease your sister. Becky is just a growing girl. She needs good food.\" Her grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Josh. There is nothing wrong with like good food at Becky's age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying it is bad but i'm just saying she developed a taste for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's for dessert?\" Grandpa asked loud so they would forget this talk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For dessert some chocolate pie.\" said grandma. \"Becky helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh rolled with his eyes knowing that Becky loved anything that was baked but nobody noticed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dessert Becky's grandmother gave her some cake. <br>\r\nAnd after dinner Grandma took Becky upstairs to wash her and take her too bed.<br>\r\nBecky always liked it to go in bath. <br>\r\nGrandma looked for some shampoo while Becky was laying in the bad tub. Her belly was sticking out of the water like an island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh is't that belly cute?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandma pushed it underwater and it immediately jumped out of the water like a whale gasping for air.<br>\r\nBecky and her grandma both giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma tucked Becky in and read the story of Hansel and Gretel. Well reading was't the right word. Mostly grandma started the story normal but halfway she changed the story a little and made it her own one. Like now where instead of Hansel Gretel ended up in a cage and was fattened up. Of course the story ended with the witch in the oven and Hansel and a lot fatter Gretel returned home and lived happily ever after. <br>\r\nAfter the story was finished Becky fell in deep sleep that she not even heard Josh when he also went to bed.    <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Becky dreamed that she was sitting on the couch between Jo, her mother, and Josh, her brother. She and Josh were dressed in strange clothing like from Hansel and Gretel. They were all watching TV. Everything looked a bit strange, especially bright and with bold colors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the news came on. Her grandma was the news anchor! \"This just in,\" her grandma said. \"Every time sweet little girls think about getting bigger, they grow! This strange phenomenon is because of global warming. We now return you to your regularly scheduled program.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they say, Hansel?\" Jo said absent-mindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was surprised. Would it really work? Would she get bigger just by thinking about it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes, concentrating, and thought to herself, \"Bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt herself swell up a bit. She rose an inch off of the couch because of her bigger behind. Her tummy became fuller and rounder. She felt softer and more cushiony all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made her feel really, really good. She was feeling very excited. Again, she thought the words..\"Bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swelled up even more. Her body was widening. Her arms were getting pudgier. Her legs were getting fatter. Her tummy was even bigger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her sides bump up next to Josh... and next to her mom. \"Hey, scoot over Gretel,\" Josh said. \"Why are you so close to me.\" She turned her chubbier face to her mom. She didn't have any room to scoot over. She struggled and tried to shift her big bottom over, and successfully moved a few inches. Her soft fat was pressing against her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom didn't seem to even notice. She was lazily watching the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky started fidgeting. If she made herself any bigger she would irritate Josh. But it felt so good every time she grew. By now she was a very fat girl... but \"very fat\" wasn't fat enough. And it was so easy to think about getting...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body swelled again. Her fingers were becoming more plump. Her arms became a little harder to move. Her tummy became even rounder and larger. The seems of her German dress started to split. Her hips again bumped into Josh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gretel, you have gotten too fat,\" Josh said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatter...\" Becky thought and grew even more. \"Fatter and fatter...\" she thought again. \"Bigger, and bigger, and bigger..\" she kept thinking about it and thinking about it. Her body slowly and steadily expanded. She felt herself rising as her bottom ballooned outward and upword. Her tummy started making her lean backward. Her arms fattened and plumped, becoming less and less able to bend easily. \"And bigger... and fatter... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gretel, you're out of control!\" Josh said as Becky's body began to slowly encroach over him. He pushed against her expanding fat. Her mom kept staring at the TV as Becky's body expanded over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And bigger... and bigger..\" Becky thought. She felt herself rise and rise, and spread out further and further. She wasn't stopping. She couldn't stop. Her mom was so small. Her brother was even smaller. He heard Josh yelling at her, but the sound was muffled. It seemed to be coming from so far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe seams of her dress kept tearing and splitting. Buttons popped off one after the other. She looked at her hands -- they were so fat! Her tummy blocked her view of anything below her waist. She felt her face with her fingers -- her cheeks were big and soft. She grinned. She put her hands on her tummy and began to rub it. She could feel it getting bigger between her fingers, like an inflating balloon. But instead of air, she was being expanded with soft, pillowy fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was lost in euphoria. She could feel Josh pushing her expanding fat away from him. But her bloated body was relentless as it grew slowly and surely. She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could hardly move. All she could do was rub her increasingly massive tummy with her outrageously pudgy hands. She giggled again. It was funny. Josh was so mad and her mom didn't even notice. And it was so comfortable being stuck inside her soft body. This is what she wanted in life. She wanted to get huge and round and cute just like Gretel did. But she wanted to get bigger than Gretel. Much bigger. Twice as big. Ten times as big. Huge. Round. Growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More... more... more...\" Her fat was billowing over the back of the couch. Touching the ground in front of her. Covering most of her mom and Josh. Her dress was tearing. The couch was breaking. \"More... more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get up!!\" Josh yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Becky realized that it was a dream, and her real life brother was calling to her to wake up. Becky looked down at her body as she awoke. She felt small and tiny. Not big enough. Not hardly big enough. She didn't even notice that yesterday's binging at grandma's had made her visibly fatter.</span></div></div>",

I need more sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're up now anyway. You might as well get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky slowly got up and got dressed. Her clothes felt a bit tighter. But she still felt small and tiny and now also very hungry. She would gave anything for some good food and then remembered that grandma always made something good for breakfast. At least when they were there for a sleep over. In a few minutes Becky was dressed in a fire red sleeveless T-shirt and a some cut off jeans. The sun was shining. It seemed to be nice weather today.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I bet Josh wanted to get up early so he could practice a little more with grandpa. I hope grandma has something to eat for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hurried down to the kitchen and oped the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma i'm hungry and... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped and noticed she did't need to say anything more. The table in the kitchen was filled with food. Waffles with icing sugar, some leftover pie, some boiled eggs, some apple turnovers, chicken legs and some pancakes with icing sugar and syrup next too it and also two bottles of soda too wash it all down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your hungry. That's good since your brother seems to find it more important to train with his granddad the enjoy a good breakfast that your grand ma made. Well at least this way my husband still does some exercise. Some of our friends can't walk on their own any more so i'm kind of glad your grandfather is still in such good shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But since Josh doesn't want to eat breakfast can i eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure honey eat all you want and if you brother is hungry when he later get's in i can always make some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky fast started to stuff the food in her mouth still feeling herself small and tiny. She grabbed the waffles and pushed so much in her mouth she almost could't close it but she managed to swallow the waffles inside without chewing or choking. She pealed the eggs and after she covered them with salt she pushed them in her mouth one by one. She then wolfed down the apple turnovers.<br>\r\nGrandma smiled seeing her little grand daughter stuff all the food in her belly. Her belly was pushing against her pants and Becky unbuttoned them. <br>\r\nThen she focused at the chicken legs. First she covered them highly with mayonnaise an ketchup and ripped the meat of them like a wild animal. She licked the bones totally clean and belched loud. She blushed for a moment but fast got her attention back at her food. She first covered her pancakes highly with syrup and icing sugar and after that rolled them up and stuffed them in her mouth. After that she looked at the left over pie. She saved this for the last because it was the most delicious thing of the whole breakfast. She pulled the plate to her and buried her face in it so fast she started to eat it. She devoured the entire pie in less the a minute and belched again loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it grandma. I finished it all. *hiccup*\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked at all the empty plates and wondered how she could have eaten so much and suddenly noticed how full she felt but she also felt kind of proud at herself. She looked at her belly that was very bloated and round sticking out a bit forward making her shirt ride up and her pants were unable to be buttoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Did i eat *hiccup* all that. That's a lot of *hiccup* a lot of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's best for you if you rest out a bit and watch some T.V and let that food digest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! That seems like a *hiccup* good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma took Becky to the T.V and put on cartoon network. Becky laid back in her chair smiling she watched cartoons while her belly digest it's huge meal. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She started struggling to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, stay right there! You keep still, I'll bring them to you,\" her Grandma said. Becky relaxed and stayed put. She then saw her Grandma come around the couch holding a big pan of brownies. \"Here dear, tell me how these taste,\" Grandma said, taking one of the brownies out from the rest. \"Open wide!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky opened her mouth wide, and her grandmother placed the warm and gooey brownie on her tongue. She closed her mouth and chewed. A few chocolate crumbs escaped. \"MMmm, Grandma these are GOOD!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wonderful!\" Grandma said. \"I'm glad they turned out alright. Do you want one more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I have two more Grandma?\" Becky said innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you may sweetie.\" Grandma fed her another brownie, and then another. Then Becky saw another one coming her way, and accepted it greedily. Then another one. Grandma wasn't stopping. \"What about this one?\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That one's good too,\" Becky replied before opening her mouth for another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm so goood,\" Becky moaned while chewing, before swallowing and opening her mouth again. Her plump hands, slightly more chubby than from the day before, slowly rubbed her tummy. She wasn't the taste-tester. Becky was the sole recipient of a giant batch of fattening, calorie-laden brownies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the final brownie was consumed, Becky licked her chocolatey lips. Grandma knelt down and whispered, \"What a good girl you are, eating so much.\" Then she kissed Becky on her soft, plump cheek and returned to the kitchen to wash up, as if nothing had happened. Becky burped and giggled, causing her tummy to shake slightly. She was so comfortable, she wished she never had to leave.</span></div></div>",

Anytime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandma looked in the refrigerator and pulled out a chocolate pie and a can of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was saving this for Tuesday when some friends came over but you need it more now and beside i can always make a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put the plate on Becky's lap and gave her the can of whipped cream. Becky start too spray until the entire pie was covered with whipped cream and Becky started to stuff the pie in her mouth with her chubby hands. She opened her mouth as far if was possible and then stuffed in as much if was possible. Soon her hands and risks were covered with chocolate and whipped cream just like her face. Becky sure did't use any manners at this point and her grandma did't cared. She just smiled in a funny way. Becky still stuffed pieces of pie in her mouth and spray whipped cream right out the can into her mouth. She swallowed and burped loud and a few bites later most of the pie was in her belly. Becky looked surprised at her sticky chocolate covered hands and put them in her mouth licking them clean. She also whipped the chocolate and whipped cream of her face and licked her hands clean again. Her clothes were now awfully tight and Becky felt way too full too even move a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full Becky?\" Her grandmother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Grandma.\" Becky mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky continued watching T.V Sometimes burping and her stomach was making sounds of digesting her big meal.<br>\r\nLater Josh and his grandfather walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a good workout and a good training for both of us. If you lose that next game then it would't be your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh saw Becky and her clothes at the point of ripping. He was a bit worried but decided to ignore it. What could have happened, and besides grandma was here to keep an eye on Becky.<br>\r\nThe next moment they saw lightning and a few seconds later they heard thunder in less then five minutes the weather outside changed from nice into a true storm. Trees were bending under the great pressure of the wind rain was splashing so hard against the window you could hardly see anything. They saw and heard lightning and thunder at the same time. But inside it was nice and warm. <br>\r\nSuddenly the phone rang and grandma picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.... What?..... No No of course not i'll be happy too..... No of course it's no problem... Yeah see you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was your mother. Thanks too the weather there is no traffic possible. Too bad but you have to stay with us. Two boring old people.\" Grandma said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yahoo.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow morning we'll drive you two too school and then your mother picks you up. I better can look what i have left for dinner.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky slide deeper in her chair. This was so perfect. She thanked the storm that she could stay longer.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When they started to eat it was not the usual kind of dinner, the storm was still raging outside and the noise it made casted a near silence over the room. Thunder and lightning were going down outside in a rapid fashion and even tho Beckys grandma had made food for so many it was questionable that with weather like that any of Joshs friends would come over. Not that Becky's grandmother was worried about that at all, after all it meant she had more food to spoil her little granddaughter with and how she liked to spoil her, she did not even try to keep it a secret as she started to fill Becky's plate for the beginning with half a bucket of fries and 2 burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You spoil her Louise!\" , Becky's grandfather said to his wife and gave her a critical look, tho then he just smiled and shook his head, \"Aww, so typical of you... I know why I married you...\", he said, obviously not minding much for what she did, whereas Josh however looked pouty. \"You never give me so much food Grandma!\", he called out, making Louise blink, before she spoke, \"Aww Josh, your sister is still growing she has to eat more than you, but tell you what if you are a good boy and help grandpa getting some groceries later, then I give you some icecream...\", Louise smiled friendly to Josh, before she began to fill her own plate with food, by the time she was finished most of the food that had been on Becky's plate already was gone, the little girl had just kept eating, while the others had been talking and she never ate slow, so it was no wonder her food was nearly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one Becky kept shoving handfuls of fries down into her maw washing them down with milk then taking a bite from one of the burgers, then she continued starting anew from the beginning, fries, milk, burger, fries, milk, burger. In just a few moments her plate was empty and she would hold it out to her grandmother, demanding: \"More!\", and More was what she would get her grandma filling the plate once again with fries and burgers, before she put the plate down infront of Becky, who went back to her routine. Like that it would continue for a while about half an hour, Grandpa and Josh had already stood up and left the table and grandma had finished her food, as Becky finally ate the very last of the burgers, by now feeling pretty full and having a large and round belly poking out from under her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was huffing and puffing but her grandma took a quarter piece of cheesecake from the buffet and put it on a new plate overfilling it with whipped cream she put it down infront of Becky, she knew her granddaughter would eat it because she had no selfcontrol and never was able to stop eating when there was any food infront of her on the table. And she would be right as despite being full Becky would start to one by one shove fork after fork of calorie-laden cake down her throat. Whenever the plate would be empty Grandma would fill the plate again and watch her granddaughter all curiously, she just wondered how much she could eat...</span></div></div>",

Thanks to her huge appetite she always had been able to clean her plate. Her parents where proud at her that she always cleaned her plate but Beck had never eaten so much if this. She did't really noticed what her grandma was doing. But a girl always need to clean her plate.<br>\r\nHalfway her last piece her belly button was blown of but neither of them noticed or else did't cared. <br>\r\nFinally the last fork full went past her lips. Becky saw she had eaten everything. There was't a crumb left. She looked at her round, full, bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl Becky. You cleaned your plate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked at her grandmother. She was sure that if she took one more bite she would explode. She could't remember eating so much ever before. Her belly was hard and round. She felt a bit like she swallowed a boulder. Normally she could always think about food but now she could't stand thinking about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky are you all right.\" Her grandma asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my belly hurt. I think I ate a bit too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my poor girl. Come let's go to the living room so you can watch some T.V.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some help of her grandmother Becky was able to stand and slowly waddled over too the living room. Josh and his grandfather were still talking about baseball. His grandfather had some papers with different place's were the players were standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must have said anything there's to say about baseball.\" Becky mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky baseball is very important for your brother and your grandfather. I saw almost every game of your grandfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't knew you liked baseball so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't. I just watched it to do him a favor. Since it was very important for him. If you love somebody really you'll do things for him even if you don't really like them yourself. So I went to your grandfathers baseball games just like he went to my performance of Elisabeth. Princess Sisi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I have a boyfriend I need to do things I don't like. Maybe I stay single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Becky. Once you will find the right guy. It can hit you if a lightning bolt. Then you want to do those things for him. Besides I think you're a very attractive girl. When you're older I'm sure many boys will like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think I become beautiful grandma?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. I was beautiful when I was younger. You have 25% of my genes. Now let's put on a nice cartoon so you forget that pain in your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma put on the movie the princess and the frog. Becky always had been a great fan of Disney movies. Her grandma stayed next to her and start rubbing her belly.<br>\r\nLater Becky did't know or it was because of the rubbing or the attention she was putting to the movie or both but her belly did feel better. But it was still round and big. <br>\r\nAfter the movie grandma took her upstairs and after showering and brushing her teeth and putting on a nightie grandma tugged her in in a special room she had for when her grandchildren came over to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Josh will also soon be send to bed. Now sleep tight Becky. Nice dreams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her grandma left Becky was staring at the sealing for some time. She pulled her nightie up and felt her big belly. A few minutes later she was in a deep sleep still with her hands on her belly and a smile on her face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But she also knew if she ate a bit more then she normally could, it would stretch her stomach so it could hold more food in the future. <br>\r\nBut if she ate too much she would probably vomit. Then she would lose the calories from the cake and most of the baked goods and candy. That would be a waste. But she really wanted that cake in her belly. She decided too take the risk, but wanted help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandma, can you feed me the cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweetie. Why would't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up a knife and a fork and cut of a small piece and started to feed it to Becky. Becky must admit she liked being fed. This was so much more easy. She closed her eyes and just opened her mouth and swallowed whatever her grandma fed to her. <br>\r\nGrandma liked this too. She was feeding Becky with one hand while the other rubbed her belly speeding up the digesting process. It did help. Becky did't realized how full she was getting.<br>\r\nBut at a sudden moment she noticed there was't any more food going to her mouth. Disturbed she opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you stop grandma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you ate the entire pie sweet hart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked surprised at the empty plate. But she just started eating. Or had it been a few minutes. She enjoyed it so much she did't notice how long it was. It might has well have been a few seconds or a few hours. <br>\r\nShe then noticed how stuffed her belly was. It hurt but in a good way. A nice way of pain was going on in her belly. She wondered or that was the stretching of her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're sleepy, right? It's pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky yawned and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help me get up?\" Becky asked, and reached out with her arms to her grandmother.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grandmother pulled Becky on her feet and helped her upstairs and put her in bed, and tucked her in.

It was an extra large, extra cheese. She grabbed two pieces, folded them over calzone style, and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished a whole pizza this way, and then reached over for something to drink. Her stomach was getting bloated again. She grabbed a bottle of Mountain Dew and began chugging it. Becky had a large stomach capacity, and the fizzy soda stretched it even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved on to a pepperoni pizza, eating it in the similar folded over calzone style. Her stomach was becoming stuffed to the max, and still she continued to eat pizza. For the next hour she manage to finish the pepperoni, a sausage, was just halfway through another cheese pizza when she got sleepy. The humongous mass of pizza in her poor stomach tried to digest and she got very sleepy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026There was the bang of a front door opening and the sound of rowdy boys, cheering about here victory at the baseball. Becky lifted her head from where it lay resting, and suddenly her knowledge of her situation returned to her. She put her glasses on and struggled to button her green shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baseball team stopped in the doorway to the livening room when they saw Becky. Her distended belly hung out over her shorts, which couldn\u2019t be closed. After an initial shock the boys started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecky?\u201d Jo called out, working through the mass of little leaguers. \u201cDid you eat all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky turned crimson, almost as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo helped her daughter up. Becky\u2019s small shorts started to slip, but her mother held them up. \u201cWe\u2019ll just get you upstairs, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky heard the boys shout in the dinning room as she walked up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice, bro. Your sister totally pigged out on pizza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe ate four freaking pizzas!

She sat and read, massaging her swollen belly. Her book improved her mood, and soon she was back to her normal confident self.

She tugged her shirt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo gave her a stack of three large pancakes. Becky added syrup, and began to eat. She reached over for her glass of milk, and her shirt rose up behind her back. She tugged it back and then drank her milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery time Becky leaned to reach for something, her shirt rose up to reveal some of her flabby belly. Her new larger belly was a bit too big for some of her shirts.

She walked into the kindergarten room, which was wide and full of different activities. Becky climbed up some stairs to a balcony were the reading corner was. She looked at her other classmates bellow her, and then selected a book to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat on a beanbag chair and her shirt rose up to reveal her fat belly.

When Nicole saw how Becky drooled when she had talked about the extra treats she knew they were going to be the best of friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had talked they started to play together. While they were playing Nicole was looking at every curve Becky's body made. Nicole saw Becky's plump cheeks and arms. Nicole saw Becky's big round belly jiggle with every movement she made as they played. Nicole nearly drooled at the sight of Becky's big butt and legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was geting close to the time to leave Nicole and Becky was resting in a spot out of sight. As they started to talk again Nicole finally got the courage to ask Becky if she could touch her stomach. Becky was suprised at what she said but Becky decided she did not have a problem with it. When Nicole touched Becky's belly she was surprised at how soft and squishy it was. Nicole poked and proded and even shoke it a little. When Nicole was done Becky asked her what she thought about her tummy and Nicole said it felt like the perfect pillow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kindergarten was over Nicole asked if she could come over to Becky's house. Becky said that would be awsome but what if our moms say no? Just then both of their moms walked in and Nicole and Becky asked their moms. Jo talked it over with Nicole's mom and they agreed but Nicole's mom asked if Jo could take care of Nicole until tomorrow and Jo said yes. As Jo was driving them both home Becky and Nicole were talking about things to do. Becky thought they should play hide and seek and Nicole thought they should play doctor (Nicole's little attempt at touching Becky's plump belly again).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the drive to Becky's house Nicole was thinking up ways she could get Becky's body fatter. She asked if Becky wanted to come over her house for the whole weekend after Kindergarten Becky thought that was a great idea and Jo said she would have to check with Nicole's mom. Necole was so happy that she finally found a girl to fatten up without getting in trouble. Necole was also thinking about how soft Becky's belly was when she started to think about if she should gain to since her mom always told her she should never worry about her weight since she watches alot of T.V. and she also talked about how she should eat more.</span></div></div>",

Your parents sure have taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo walked to the front door and opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole come in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly walked inside and looked around and whistled again. Becky waddled fast after Nicole inside. Jo followed and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice house you have Miss.\" Nicole said polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a polite girl you are. Well you girls go play i need to do some laundry.\" With those words she went upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nicole? At daycare when you fought against Demi... could you teach me that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i don't think so. Not that i don't want too... it's just i'm not such a great teacher. I'm myself just a student and my parents trained me already for a long time. I'm afraid i would hurt you instead of learning you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's too bad. I would really like it to stand up if they want to tease me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you don't have too worry again. From now on we're friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky smiled. She got a warm nice feeling in her body. It was pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about that playing doctor. I think it's fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky liked it more to play hide and seek but it would't be too fair against Nicole. Nicole did't knew the house and would't have a clue Becky could be hiding and besides that she wanted Nicole too also have fun and playing doctor was't that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. So who is the doctor and who is the patient?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im the doctor you the patient. I'm gonna give you a check up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took a little plastic hammer and did lie if she tested Becky's reflexes. After that she took a fake stethoscope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you remove your shirt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was't really sure but decided too do it. After all what could happen?<br>\r\nNicole did like if she did some tests but she was enjoying every look at Becky's pounds and every single chance to touch it. She was careful enough not too let Becky notice what she was really doing. Suddenly Becky saw the time. Well she could't really tell what time it was but she knew totally spies would start any second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know totally spies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Cool cartoon. I like Sam the most. She is so smart and  can fight like the best. She has brains, muscle ad looks. She is just perfect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna watch. It's gonna be on T.V any second now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two little girls waddled to the T.V and watched totally spies. When Jo came down she gave both girls a big bowl of chips an one big bowl of candy. Becky and Jo did't notice that Nicole poured most of her chips in Becky's bowl and only ate just a few pieces of candy While Becky ate all the rest. <br>\r\nThe two girls spent the rest of the afternoon watching T.V and drawing until it was time for dinner. For dinner was mashed potatoes with greasy gravy, salad and sausages. Becky ate her sausages with a lot of mayonnaise and ketchup. Nicole hardly noticed what or how much she was eating but was more focused on Becky.<br>\r\nAfter dinner there was a piece of pie for dessert. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allright.\" Jo said after dinner. \"Now i think it's time for two girls too go in bath and then straight too bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's eyes started to sparkle. Go in bath with Becky was perfect. She hurried upstairs what she did't need too do of course since Becky just slowly waddled upstairs. When they arrived in the bath room Nicole was already busy pulling of her pants.<br>\r\nJo started to fill the bat tub an the two tots climbed in. It was easily big enough for the both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Becky want to soap in each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple. I soap you in and you do the same with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Sure why not.\" Becky thinking it was just an innocent game. It was for her while Nicole enjoyed every touch of the fat of Becky's arms, legs, thighs, butt and of course her belly. <br>\r\nAfter that they washed themselves brushed their teeth got in their nightie(Nicole borrowed one from Becky that looked like a tent on her)and went straight to bed. Nicole in a sleeping bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The only thing she did't liked was that she needed to still think of a new way to touch Becky's belly. She would like it to just tell Becky how much she liked her fat belly and how she wanted to make her fatter and fatter but she was afraid that if she would do that she would lose a good friend and more. The only one who knew about her secret and accepted it was her mom. For now she could only touch Becky's belly while playing a game or when she was asleep. She looked forward to when Becky would spent a night at her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you two, Becky go put on some clothes and get ready for daycare.\"  <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

But Demi planned to use it on somebody else.

Six sandwiches. Three bologna and three turkey. Two pieces of chocolate pie, a stack of 10 chocolate chip cookies and two pudding cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she gets a lunch like this everyday it's no wonder Becky is so overweight. Nicol thought.

Demi had too stop and tie her boots when she was half way there. While she was tieing them she was listening too what her friends where talking about. They had their backs turned toward her so they did'nt realize she was behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate hanging around Demi, she's so mean\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sucks hanging around her but if we do'nt be her friends she'll just beat us up like everyone here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She acts like such a huge loser\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, if she was'nt so strong I would'nt be even be her friend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet her mom can't stand being around her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think her dad died too get away from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose last two sentences had really hurt Demi. She started to tear up so she ran to a spot where no one would see her, this spot was also near Becky and Nicole's table but it would be hard too see anyone even if you tried. Demi began to cry quietly so no one would think she was soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought they were my friends\" said Demi whimpering (until the next paragraph)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it that all of my friends hate me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do'nt want too be this way but I have too be tough for mommy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi was'nt always bad like she is now. Two years ago before her dad died she was the nicest girl at the day care but when her dad had died she decided to be tough so no one would hurt her mommy. Demi thought you had too be feared too be tough but she never acted that way around her mom. But the black clothes and boots was there before for some reason she liked the color but no one could figure out why she like it so much. She loved her mom and did'nt want her too worry about her. Demi begin to watch what Becky and Nicole where doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean small appetite\" said Nicole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I may not be able to beat you in fight but I know I can beat you in an eating contest!\" said Becky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I bet you I can eat all this food\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Nicole started too eat a turkey sandwich. Nicole had eaten two turkey sandwiches and one bologna sandwich. While Nicole was attempting this Becky had gotten through over half of her lunch and was feeling full when Nicole had ate one pie and three cookies before she was stuffed. After another four minutes Becky had finished her lunch and was also feeling full. Nicole's stomach was really hurting from all the food she had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You win...that's the most I can...eat\" said Nicole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you Nicole, eating's my skill\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok..I bet you...can't..eat the rest of my lunch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah Nicole you can barely talk but I think I can\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prove...it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing was, Becky had forgotten that she was full herself. She started out with the sandwiches barely chewing them before she swallowed them saveing the cookies and pie too eat last. Once Becky had finished the sandwiches she started on the pudding, scooping as much as she could and swallowing as much as she could before she started on the cookies. Becky had gotten through half of the cookies before she started to feel really full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole I don't think I can finish the rest\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I know you can Becky, how about I feed the rest to you!\" said Nicole feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay but I don't think I'll be able to eat all of it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does'nt mean we can't try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now open up Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole had started grabbing cookie by cookie stuffing them in Becky's mouth as fast as she could without causing harm to Becky and in between each cookie she let Becky drink a little pop before she gave her another. These were pretty big cookies that after Becky had finished all of them her belly was noticably bigger. Nicole was about to start on the pie when Becky said something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole I'm too stuffed I...I can't eat anymore food!\" said Becky<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's just the one piece of pie left, I know you can handle\" said Nicole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can Nicole, I might pop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just this small piece of pie Becky, pppiiieee\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll...try\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe piece of pie wasnt exactly small it was pretty big for something for a five yr old too eat. But Becky did her best and ate it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See I knew you would be able to eat the pie without poping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi was still watching and was really surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole's so nice and Becky is'nt all that bad either...why can't I have friends like them?\"said Demi<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I think if i eat one more bite i will pop for sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look a bit bloated.\" Nicole said smiling in her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi slowly walked to their table. When Nicole noticed her she got up ready to fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... i don't want to fight. I was wondering if i could sit here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole lifted her shoulders and looked at Becky. Becky looked back a little wondered. This was't the though girl Demi she normally knew. This girl looked more like a scared little mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky what do you say?\" Asked Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess she can. No one else is sitting here anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Demi said with a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi slowly took her lunch and started to eat it wiyh small bites. looking at tha table. Her black hair was hanging like a curtain around her face.<br>\r\nBecky looked speechless at Demi. She had never seen Demi this way. She seemed to have turned from 100% bad girl to 100% shy and scared girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Demi is that you?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course it's me.\" Demi said. It did't even sounded mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look totally different from about when i saw you at the toilets. Did something happened to you? Did someone died?\" Nicole asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi slowly started to cry again. Becky suddenly remembered that when she was new at daycare and Demi teased her for the first time a teacher told her that Demi used to be a sweet girl until her father died. She forget this but now she remembered it.<br>\r\nShe pulled Nicole at her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole. Demi's father died two years ago.\" She whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Sorry Demi! I did't mean too... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It... it's all right. You did't know. But my... Eh some other kids said that my father died to get away from me and that my mother most hate me.\" After the last word Demi started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky di'd't knew what to do. The mean girl that was always teasing her was suddenly crying in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her tears she managed to say: A... and they said... they're not really my friends... The think im mean.... They only hang... out with me... because i'm strong... and they think i... would beat them up... If they don't hang out with me!\" Demi started to cry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole and Becky took Demi to their secret spot. They did't want the whole daycare too know that Demi was crying. After five minutes Demi slowly started to calm down. Her face was still red and wet from all her crying but she seemed to have herself under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. You two are so nice. I wish i could have friends like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole climed up a bit so she could see the kids that used to be Demi's friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they said your father eh... died to get away from you?\" She asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y... yes. Demi said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky saw anger burning in the eyes of her friend. Nicole had lost her grandparents from her father's side of the family. She was very close with them and remembered the pain she felt when they died. If she  tried to imagen how terrible it must feel to lose your father she shivered. No one deserved it to hear that your father died to get away from you. Especially from your friends. Not even Demi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just forget about them. If it's true what they said then they're not really your friends. If you would act a bit nicer you could get real friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you two. Would you two want to be my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just become someone's friend. You need to like the other and he or she needs to like you. I'm not trying to say we don't like you but we hardly know this side of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can i hang out with you now then?

After their lunch time had ended they got up and started to play together. They started playing with the blocks, then they started to play with the balls, and eventually they started to read a book. That was when Demi's old friends walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you playing with these two, I thought you said they were losers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you said Becky was a loser and Nicole was a loser for hanging out with her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was wrong, they aren't losers  you two are, the only reason you were hanging-out with me was because you were scared of me so I think I'll do what I've been doing for a while and beat up some losers!\" said Demi angrily making the two girls run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Opps, sorry I broke my promise Becky\" said Demi a little sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let it slide!\" said Becky before she started to laugh with Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Nicole thought of something when she stopped laughing, with Demi hanging around them how will she be able to fatten up Becky without someone finding out! Nicole was also starting to worry that Demi might even get Becky to exercise alot and end up making Becky skinny. Oh why did she agree with Becky!

Demi slowly leaned against Becky's belly slowly sank a bit into her fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this feels soft. Guess that feels nice.\" She slowly kneaded Becky's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole was bit jealous but knew how to hide it. But now it seemed Demi also liked Becky fat. A smile fast as a lizard slide over her face. No one of the others saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like fat girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe i do. I never really thought about what i like. I only thought about ways to tease.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Demi felt like she was before. A sweet, pretty and nice girlie girl that just liked black clothes. What did she liked back then.

Then you could use it like a mattress! We could fatten you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole stopped for a moment. wondering what would happen. If Becky liked the idea of getting a bigger belly then that would be perfect. She and Demi could fatten her up together and Becky would like to get fatter, that way everyone would win. If She did't liked it she could get angry at Demi and maybe stop hanging out with Demi. Maybe. Nicole must admit she liked the first choice better. <br>\r\nBut after all she still had one weekend with Becky and she was't sure her mother would like it if she suddenly invited another girl. Besides she did't really knew Demi that well yet and she and Becky talked about things to do with just the two of them.

She was one of the fattest kids in her age group maybe the fattest. <br>\r\nHow fat could she become. So fat that she could't fit through the door? So fat that she would look like a over inflated beach ball? So fat she would take up a whole room? She liked the idea.<br>\r\nBeing so fat that you would be immobile or would die was't something Becky know that could happen. Demi also did't know. Nicole knew about becoming immobile but also she did't know that Becky could die thanks too being overweight. She did't want Becky dead. She just wanted her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you like to eat right? You can eat then all day long.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like fun.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your in? We gonna fatten your up?\" Demi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thinking. How would it feel and how would it look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took some pillows and stuffed them under Becky's shirt while she said: \"Like this Taa-daa! Becky with twenty extra pounds. I think you will look like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky smiled while the pillows stretched out her shirt a bit. She tried to move a bit with the pillows still stuffed in her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This feel kind of nice. I like it!\" She said and let herself fall down on her fat behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole still acted like it was just a fun game. Not like she really wanted too do it (of course she did but she did't want to let the others know). To be honest she was happy Demi liked the idea. Now if Becky just would say yes that would make her day so perfect that almost nothing would be able to ruin it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right sure. Why not. But i think we can better start tomorrow. I'm still a bit stuffed from lunch.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's fine. besides it's almost...\" Nicole started but was cut off when the teacher ringed a bell and shouted \"All right! It's time! Day care is over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well almost time i wanted to say but i think you already noticed.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls slowly walked towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can start tomorrow at my place!\" Nicole said excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a lot of food at your place?\" Demi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Demi. Our parents  already decided would stay at Nicole's place tomorrow.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and i'm not sure my mother is fine with a second friend coming over. Sorry Demi.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's all right. Besides i wanted to do something this weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change my room and becoming nice again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky saw a chubby tall woman walking over to them and Demi ran over to her screaming: \"Mommy! Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi's mother hugged her daughter. Nicole looked from a distance and saw two of Demi's former friends whisper to each other. She wanted to hit their heads against each other after what they said about Demi's father but decided too let them go. Now Demi was't mean anymore maybe they became nicer also and if they staid mean she would get another chance too hit them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there is my mother! See you tomorrow Nicole! Then we can start!\" Becky said and ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked smiling when Becky ran off letting her big belly jiggle the whole time. She leaned against the wall. She knew her mother would be later today. Thursday was her bridge club. Her mother would pick her up after about 15 minutes. <br>\r\nShe decided to train a bit. Her parents always trained her since she was little. Her father learned Karate from a karate master and he became so good he could even cut a brick in two pieces with his bare hands. Nicole's Mother was a talent with practise gymnastics. This way she was also very lithe. Some of the reasons her parents trained her was that she was a girl and her parents were worried that when she would be older a boy from school or  someone else could try too rape her. Another reason was that her parent thought it was good if you could defend yourself and Nicole got pretty good in defending herself, and of course it was a good workout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She shoved over too Nicole. <br>\r\nNicole fast covered her drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you drawing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... eh nothing special.\" Nicole said sweating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's nothing special you can show us.\" Becky said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also curious at what her friend had been drawing that seemed to take her full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on show us. You can also see what we've drawn. Look. I draw a pretty bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I draw the power puff girls.

Becky and Demi looked interested at the drawing. Demi whistled. They both looked with open eyes and they smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't know you were so good at drawing Nicole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You're very good. You should become an artist.\" Demi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Nicole said a bit sad and softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Becky right. Only even fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does look a lot like me. But much fatter. I like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked up wondered. She looked at Becky and Demi and saw they told the truth and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i thought about yesterday you know... were we talked about... I thought to draw you how you would look if we would fatten you up enough. If you of course still want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. This looks so good. I will gain so much this will become as good as a self portrait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Nicole said (and smiled at the inside from joy).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And after that i will become even fatter!\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here finish it.\" Demi said and gave her her drawing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends kept drawing and later they read some books and after that they build a tower with Blocks. It was a lot higher then most other towers of blocks what was thanks too Nicole since she was able to climb in everything and put more blocks on it. They build the tower right next too the bridge. Finally Nicole even hang upside down from the bridge too put some blocks on top of the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything all right Nicole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah no trouble at all... so done.\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"I think that's the highest tower ever build here.\" Demi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should ask the teacher.

But i never build one as high as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch time!\" The teacher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good thing too i'm starving.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so.\" Nicole said. \"How hungrier you are how more you can eat how fatter you can become!.

But at the other hand she was yesterday able too also finish what Nicole did't eat.<br>\r\nNicole took two sandwiches from her lunchbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are for me and the rest is for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thank you.\" Becky said while she took a bite from her own sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took a look at what Becky got from her mother. It was no wonder she was overweight. Her own lunch together with what she gave her would fatten up Becky really good. She put some high fat sauce on the sandwiches she made for Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You took extra food for her?\" Demi asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah why? I thought you agreed with the plan too fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. That's why i also took some extra food for Becky!\" Demi said and took a roll of cookies and a bag of chips out of her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you two really go for this.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but it's no use if we two go for it and you don't. So come on get snacking.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three girls put all the food for Becky. Becky started on her own six sandwiches first and then at the sandwiches Nicole made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. You know Nicole those taste pretty *munch munch* good.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the sauce was dripping from Becky's chin. She worked her way fast through the rest of Nicole's sandwiches. Nicole smiled. She did felt a bit bad that Becky did't even knew how many calories she consumed but she said she was fine by fattening her up so she thought it was all right.<br>\r\nBecky first eat her own roll of cookies and the took Demi's cookies. She must admit Demi had pretty good taste. The cookies taste pretty good. Two cookies with between some soft creamy filling. After the cookies she felt her belly. She felt a bit bloated. <br>\r\nNicole held up the two pieces of pie Becky's mother gave her every day for lunch. She loved pie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Becky. Delicious pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Becky slowly took her first piece and started eating it. After it she felt full but knew there was a second piece. With difficulty she opened her jaws and took another bite of pie. Becky's hands fell down.<br>\r\nNicole took the piece of pie and hold it in front of Becky's face. Becky opened her mouth and Nicole shoved The pie inside. Becky slowly ate her pie this way. She was glad when she had swallowed the last piece of pie. She belched and looked at her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's still a bag of chips.\" Demi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. No really you two. I feel like popping.I already eat more then i could. I can't eat another bite Please no more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better don't Demi. If you feed her too much she might throw up and lose all that food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then.\" Demi said disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry we can use it later if Becky is hungry again. Right Becky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky rubbed her bloated Belly and nodded. Nicole placed friendly a hand on Becky's tummy and rubbed it.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a nice tummy you have gotten.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three walked back to their tower and the let Becky lay on the floor. Her belly stuck up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here Becky. We gonna get the teacher to show her our tower.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDemi and Nicole walked away and returned a few minutes later with a teacher who looked with big eyes at their tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think that's the biggest tower i've ever seen.\" Their teacher said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe called another teacher and together they measured  the tower and took a picture of it and this gave Becky, Nicole and Demi a record at daycare. <br>\r\nThe three kids went to the reading corner and start reading. After about one and half hour Demi asked: \"Becky. Hungry now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she is.\" Nicole said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemi opened her bag and took out the chips. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You just lay back Becky. We feed it to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky did like she was told. She went lying and opened her mouth wide. The next moment Nicole and Demi let fell chips in her mouth. Becky fast started to chew and swallow.<br>\r\nNicole and Demi found it very funny and so did Becky. They had so much fun the bag was empty before they knew it. Becky smacked on some pieces of the chips that were left between her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Becky, When we get home we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky closed her eyes and fell asleep while digesting her food.<br>\r\nNicole lifted her shoulders. Some others also took sometimes a nap on a nice place at daycare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let her sleep. All that eating made her very tired.\" Nicole whispered too Demi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two did't want too bother Becky so they took a book and went back too reading.    </span></div></div>",

You would come over to my place remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! But i just woke up.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nNicole giggled and pulled Becky with her too her mother. Nicole's mother smiled when she saw her daughter. She also took the time now too take a better look at Becky since she only had seen her for a few seconds the day before yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Becky. I heard a lot about you. Nicole really likes you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i... i like her too a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Becky! Bye Nicole! See you Monday!\" Demi said while she got home with her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" Nicole's mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's Demi! We played with her today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said that Demi was't nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah well she was't nice the first time we met. But she's fine when you get too know her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl. Sometimes first impressions can be totally wrong. Eh Nicole did you did't do anything wrong at school today? Did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole sweat a bit but stayed calm and said on a normal tone: \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should she have done then?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well you see Becky had some small problems were she lived first. Fighting at school and... eh some other things. That's on of the reasons we moved. I hope she does it better then last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't use the fire hose again to climb on the roof of the school.\" Nicole said bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did that?\" Becky asked with big eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just once... or twice. The school was't too happy about it and i once broke open a door... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Nicole.\" Her mother said cutting her of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was afraid Nicole could also tell she fattened up other kids. That was another reason why they moved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you had a bakery.\" Becky said seeing that Nicole's mother did't liked it to talk about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky an Nicole got in the car of Nicole's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's right. We just opened. If you like you can help make some cookies. Nicole likes it sometimes to help make some cookies. The only problem is she still eats from the dough.\" And she gave her daughter a teasing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if i sometimes take a small bite.\" Nicole whispered. \"And i don't have much more too do! Every game you bought is for two or more people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i'm here now. That's two right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole hugged Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but before i met you i did't really had someone to play the games with.\" She looked at her mother.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides Becky do you like baked goods. Since we just opened we did't had many costumers yet. So we have a lot of stuff left and if no one eats it it's going to waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVE BAKED GOODS!\" Becky shouted. \"THAT'S MY FAVORITE FOOD IN THE WHOLE WORLD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So don't worry mom. Those things won't go too waste.\" Nicole said smiling looking at Becky's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole.\" Her mother said warning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaaaat?\" Nicole said like if she did't knew her mother was talking about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater they stopped for a small but nice house. </span></div></div>",

It does remind her about it. We also go on vacation too those places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there is a lake nearby and some mountains so you can swim in the summer, ski in the winter and and long walks in the spring. Maybe you can come once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On vacation. Could i come on vacation with you?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your parents are all right with it. My parents are fine with it. They would like it if i take a playmate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there enough room for me in the car?\" Becky asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More then enough. That's one of thew things about being only child. Wanna see my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole pulled Becky upstairs too her room. Her room was kind of small. But Becky did't mind. There was one bed that was about two yards above the ground. You could reach it with a small ladder. There was also a couch and a bookcase full of books and a small table with a chair full of papers, pencils and other stuff. There were also a lot of drawings and posters on the walls. Nicole was very good at drawing. However Becky noticed most drawing were of fat girls. No wonder Nicole made such a good drawing about her being even fatter. She did a lot of practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what do you think? It's a bit small. Not like your room and sometimes you hear strange noises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty cool. I wish i could make such good drawings. But i'm lousy at making drawings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you your drawing at daycare. It's not that bad. I know that cartoon powerpuff girls. I have the movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do! I want to see it. I've never seen it. Can i watch it please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure. come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole walked with Becky to a big living room with a fire place some big chairs and a huge couch wit a big flat screen T.V way bigger then Becky had. There was also a big stereo and a computer on a small table.. Probably for Nicole since the chair and table were way to small for adults.<br>\r\nNicole put on the DVD.<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes Nicole's mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Would you girls like some goodies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love some!\" Becky shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole could you help me carry them?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom i'm just watching the movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've seen that movie about a hundred times! You know it out of you head by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine i help.\" Nicole said grumpy while she got up from the couch. When they were in the hallway were the boxes with cookies were she took from her bakery she closed the door and looked at Nicole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole what did you do with that girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing mom. I... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole i know you longer the today. You stuffed all those girls were we lived before and we were in big trouble when all parents found out that their kids gained ten pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was already fat. Besides i could't have fattened her up in a few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But please be careful. I don't want to move again besides she's really nice. So try too don't stuff her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole picked up some of the boxes while she thought: \"But i can help her. Right. Also helping to let her gain weight.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We have a scale in the bathroom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky heaved herself up from the couch and waddled upstairs with her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they walked upstairs Nicole suddenly asked: \"Eh Becky I was wondering. About this weight gain thing would you mother mind it if you eh... get fatter? I mean suppose you gain a lot of weight... would you mother mind it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. My mother is pretty cool. She hardly get's angry and let us be what we wanna be... but at the other hand I don't think she would encourage it either. But  she never made a big deal about this.\" Becky said and grabbed her belly and shook it.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe walked in the bathroom and Nicole took the scale. I was an electronic one. Nicole put her feet on it and it read: 8888. A few seconds later it read 00:0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you can get up now.\" Nicole said while her pretty face turned a bit red from excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole slowly stepped on the scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Nicole it's bit hard for me to read he number.\" Becky said trying to look past her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole got on hands and knees and looked at he number.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I see it. Stop moving then it changes. All right that is it. Come on to my room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's room was't very big. It had a bed, a desk with chair and a clothing closet. Also a shelf with some books. There was just enough room for her mattress and sleeping bag. <br>\r\nNicole looked through the drawers in her desk and finally found a notebook. She wrote up the date and the weight. After that she wrote on the cover: Becky's weight gain progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm You know just the weight is a bit boring. Hey how about we also measure your belly, thighs, and arms? Suddenly a good idea, also make pictures from it. That would be cool. Would't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I agree but for that we need a camera.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole looked through her drawers and showed a measuring tape and a camera. She grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men I can't believe that your parents gave you a photo camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Nicole's mother found out her daughter had such thing for fat or gaining people she decided to give her daughter a camera. Then she could photograph fat people since there was no harm or crime in that. Nicole also did use it for that, but she still liked fattening others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Becky. Let's take two pictures. One from the front and one from the side. Then we can see how much you gained from two sides. Now say cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like cheese.\" Becky said while she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole took the photo. Becky turned and Nicole took he second photo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic. I made a lot of pictures but these are my real masterpieces. Not only because of me but also you Becky. The camera loves you. You look terrific. Say did you ever thought about becoming a model?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A model? Me? Come on. Models are toothpick girls. I can't become a model like that. Besides I thought we were trying to let me gain weigh not lose it.\" Becky said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not such a model silly. A plus size model!\" Nicole says. \"Those are models who are fat and show clothes for bigger girls. So they can also look good. Especially here in America were a lot of people are overweight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole grabbed the measuring tape and wrapped it around Becky's belly, thighs and arms and careful wrote the sizes up in the notebook. Becky looks over her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if five pounds are that noticeable.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not... but after five comes ten, then five-teen, then twenty and then twenty-five and that is noticeable. Besides Becky your kind of short so the fat has less room to spread on. That way it's more noticeable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if I get a growth spurt?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're a bit young for that. That's more something for a teenager and by he time you are that age you will have gained so much weight... no one will notice. Let's go I need to print those photo's out on my computer.\"  Nicole said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were downstairs Nicole careful printed the photo's out and glued them in the notebook and after that hide it in a big book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right and now comes one of the fun parts. The stuffing!\" Nicole said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky grinned widely and opened her mouth wide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

She did't knew why. She sometimes wondered if maybe something was wrong with her. But her grandmother told her that they were all god's children and that he has made any  person in a way with a good reason.

But hose are made to sell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well with he amount of costumers we have we're lucky if we sell half of those goodies.\" Nicole sneered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. We're a new store. People first need to know us.\" Nicole said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if you don't sell much then you maybe need to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. It's always hard opening a store. I'm sure we get more costumers. But maybe you can ask your parents and some of their friends to buy at our bakery. That would help. But if your hungry go upstairs. I will make you some sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNicole's mother did't want to fatten kids up but if Becky was hungry there was no harm in feeding her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much sandwiches do you like? One, two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh I like five. (giggle) I have a big appetite.\" Becky said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky's mother was't sure if she was now doing the right thing but any way she made five sandwiches for the fat girl.<br>\r\nShe put them on a plate in front of Becky. Becky took one bit and chewed surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those taste delicious. How did you made them?\" Becky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the bread you taste. It's especially made by hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if you made bread by hand it taste so delicious?\" Becky asked with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. That's just a minor detail. The real reason is a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Becky asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't tell you.\" Nicole said. \"It's a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I can make an exception.\" Nicole's mother said when she saw how sad Becky looked. \"But remember. It's  secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make the bread by hand but now... You need to bake it in a old oven. Really old. Like people did before there was electricity. You need to bake it just the old fashioned way. My grandfather told me this and he got it from his grandfather. They owned such a place to bake bread and after they died it became mine. It's were I bake my bread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway it taste's delicious.\" Becky said, and took a big bite.    </span></div></div>",

What did she liked to do besides eating and watching T.V. She liked drawing and reading however she could't really read yet. She could't wait until she would finally be able too do it. While she was thinking she suddenly felt two hands on her belly who started to rub it. Becky just wanted Nicole to ask what she was doing but the suddenly must admit she liked the rubbing. She liked the rubbing very much. She closed her eyes and let Nicole rub. Both girls liked this very much.<br>\r\nNicole was happy. She hoped she would be able to do this but she was't sure how Becky would react. But Beck seemed to like the feeling. That was lucky for her. She loved the feeling of the fat and knowing that Becky only would become fatter made her excited.<br>\r\nShe knew she needed to be careful with this. She did't want to move again. Especially not now she made two good friends here and she also liked her new house and the neighborhood. But at her old place she already felt attracted to fat kids and liked it to feed them and rubbed their fat and fatten them up and then always came the problem. Parents who got angry because their kids were suddenly overweight. She still did't understood why the parents got so angry while she thought that the kids looked way better. She could't be to only one who was thinking this way. Or was she. There were millions and millions of people over the entire world. Then she could't  be the only who thought the little kids looked better fatter.<br>\r\nShe kept thinking about this while she kept rubbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nicole what are you doing?\" Her mother asked who suddenly walked over to the two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls woke up from what hey were doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh nothing mom.

What she saw them doing seemed too be pretty innocent. Just rubbing her friends fat belly. There was no harm in that. But it was't something what kids did normally. Perhaps she did worry a bit too much but she knew her daughter. She shook her head and walked over too the kitchen.  <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

When day was mostly filled with building skyscrapers with blocks, drawing and playing with toys it was't so bad if she would miss one day. <br>\r\nJo walked out the kitchen to do the laundry. Becky grabbed a chair and shoved it to the door of the freezer. She climbed on the chair and opened it and found two gallons of ice cream. She carried them one by one in front of the T.V and put it on. <br>\r\nShe took off her uniform since she had all ready outgrown it anyway. She only wore her socks and undies. She decided to took them off too and went sitting naked in front of the T.V and grabbed the first gallon of ice cream. opened it and started shoving it in her mouth with her hands.<br>\r\nAfter the first gallon was all in her tummy She started to eat the second gallon while watching invader Zim.<br>\r\nBecky was glad that this time she could eat without her clothes were getting tight on her. She finally managed to also eat the entire second gallon of ice cream. She leaned back letting her belly stick up a little in the air. Her face, hands and body covered with ice cream. And even with two gallons of ice cream in her belly she did't felt quite full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm i can better wait until we go shopping. Then i can maybe get some Mc Donald's or Burger king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother walked in seeing her daughter messy, sticky and naked totally full (or so it seemed) in front of the T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Becky. Look at you. You're a mess. Good thing you did't were any clothes or else the would be dirty also. Come on. I need to put you in bath and get some clothes for you. I can't take you out shopping naked and dirty right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe filled a tub with hot water. Becky slowly got in it. She liked the hot water and let herself slide down in it.

Even after all that ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped on the floor with her chubby feet while wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I can better eat something now. At least now I don't wear clothes that constrict my body. I should use that advantage. Besides after I eat I probably weigh more. That sounds logical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky waddled over to the cupboard and looked inside. Soon she found a box of cookies, two boxes of oreo's and three bags of chips. She also found two two liter bottles of coke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm. Will I be able to eat all of this? Ah what. I start and I guess I see how far I come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky carried all her snacks over to the T.V and flicked through the channels until she found some nice cartoons. Becky ripped open the first bag of pretzels and stuffed them in her mouth with both hands. Chewing loudly. <br>\r\nBecky soon found out that eating without clothes constricting her body felt pretty good to her. No one could see her. Else it would be a bit weird. Eating in the nude. She tossed the first empty bags of chips away. She already drank a half liter of the coke. She took another big sip and Let out a huge belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. I bet my brother or any of his friends can't belch that loud!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped open the bags or oreo's and stuffed them in her mouth three at a time. Surprised how fast they were gone. She took a few sips of coke and started at the cookies. After the cookies were gone Becky emptied the bottle of coke in her huge paunch. Becky must admit that she was't hungry anymore but... she was't full either. So she ripped ope the second box of oreo's and started stuffing them in her greedy mouth. After the were gone she opened the second bottle of coke and took some sips. She loved expanding her belly with the fizzy drink. But she still wanted more food and opened the second bag of chips. She finished them of pretty fast with another liter of coke and even the third bag disappeared in her mouth. She also drank the last of the coke until the last drop. After that she opened her mouth and\u2026 \"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow now that was a big one. I bet even the neighbors heard that one. Ah well. So what if they did. So I'm the burping champion. Well I guess I'm full now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky leaned back rubbing her swollen, bloated belly. She could't deny she liked this. Eating so much, gaining weight, rubbing your belly and become fatter. She always liked that and Lucky for her her mother saw no problem with it and thanks to that she could become as fat if she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I wanted to weigh myself but to be honest I feel to stuffed to walk. But at the other hand I wonder how much I weigh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she heard something else that made her stand up. The doorbell.

So, rather than the wonderful home-cooked meals ahe wanted her and her daughter to enjoy, the table was currently laden with three or four bags of McDonalds, holding within an assortment of burgers, fries, chicken nuggets, and even a salad. This salad was the closest Tara's mother could get to healthy eating- whatever restaurant they picked up from (it wasn't always McDonalds- sometimes she could splurge on Chinese takeout) she would always order a salad with the hopes that Tara would eat it. However, she never would, and it would languish for a day or two in the refrigerator until her mother would take it for breakfast. That was life, and though she did not like it, it worked well- and Tara clearly loved it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing the McDonalds, Tara made an immediate beeline for a chair and began to pull various things out of the bag. \"Thank you, Mommy!\" she said gleefully, furiously unwrapping a hamburger.

Lollipop trees stuck out of Jell-O hills, and butter-stick birds flew over high piles of rock candy. In short, Tara was in heaven. And she wasn't about to let this opportunity go to waste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeal of pure joy, she flopped onto the ground and started stuffing great handfuls of the French Fry grass into her hungry mouth. Below that, she discovered what would be dirt was hamburger, and before long she had ate herself a hole four feet deep. Not satisfied with just that, though, she ate her way back up to the surface, and somehow raised her massively engorged body up on her stubby legs to conquer some other kind of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sine she found out she was pregnant she wanted to fatten her child up. But such a child first needed to drink milk and after that learning to eat solid food. That all took some time and she forget about her plan.<br>\r\nHer husband wanted to buy an old house and to be honest she liked that too. She just never really found the time to fatten up her daughter. But now they were moved and she planned that it was now time to fatten Asami up into a cute, adorable, obese, soft, Japanese girl. She also knew Asami was great fan of Jack in the box and Mc Donalds and she planned to use that. She knew two of those fast food places were not far from heir new home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I want to see my new room!\" Asami yelled.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course honey. I'll show it to you. You new room is way bigger then your old room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami followed her mom up the stairs and her mom opened the door. Asami's eyes got wide open and she yelled from happiness. True she was't very fond of the idea of moving but this made it all up. Her new room was way bigger then her old room. She had a new bed and also a T.V with DVD player. Something she wanted for years. Also two instead of one beanbag chairs. Her old desk was there just like her bookcase, dollhouse and box of toys. Also a big closet for her clothes. Also  new big old chair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee is't that one from Mr. Henry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Henry was an old friend from the family. Also the one who found this house for them. He was already 83 but still knew very well what was going on. But he started to needed help in cleaning the house, cooking so a few years ago he went to a home for the elderly. Asami loved him since he had a lot of toys but what she liked most were the stories he told. He knew hundreds of stories. He had read many books and had a lot of imagination to made up his own stories. Sometimes he also mixed  a story he read with some of his own imagination. Asami loved sitting on his lap in his great old chair listening to his voice taking her to great fantasy worlds, and now that chair was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it is. He could't take it to the elderly home, but he said her knew for sure you wanted to have it. So here it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll together Asami was very happy with her new room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also heard there live a lot of kids in the neighborhood around your age. I'm sure you get a lot of new friends. Tomorrow we go visit some neighbors. Now do you...\"   </span></div></div>",

Double cheeseburgers and fries!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That was where you were going to eat anyway,\" chuckled the beautiful woman as both woman and child started down the stairs... Oh, how Asami hated climbing stairs! Lazier than most children, Asami preferred to ride in elevators and possibly escalators at every given chance. The chance to satisfy her sweet tooth with a double chocolate shake, however, suppressed Asami's resentment toward this <i>inferior</i> just long enough before Asami stepped down from the stairwell slightly winded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't make it!\" Asami gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so silly!\" Goaded the woman as she lifted her scrawny daughter into her arms. <i>She is so light...

So... Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami replied as she closed her eyes whilst in her mother's grasp: Asami had always been too lazy to walk to the car, but as of late her mother made less and less of any effort to encourage her daughter to move. One step in the right direction, but it also gave Asami's mother her last many times to prepare for the inevitable:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>If you gain 80 pounds and grow a golden Buddha belly with big bowl cheeks, tree-trunk thighs which run against one another, and flabby arms useless at exercise- my dear child, I won't be able to hold you anymore.</i></span></div></div>",

Her mother could't wait until she would outgrow it. Just like her clothes. She also wondered how Asami would react when she would gain weight. Perhaps she even would't care. Asami hated moving and she liked it to watch T.V, Jack in the box and napping. That's a very good combination to gain weight and that was just what her mother wanted. Perhaps she even liked gaining weight. She sure hoped so but she did't tell her daughter since she was afraid there was a little chance she would't like it. So she kept it a secret for now. If she would like it she would tell her anyway. Sooner or later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on mommy! I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungryyyyyyy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko smiled. She really hoped she could now finally do what she always wanted. Fattening up her daughter. Perhaps she could even get pregnant again and get another daughter. Or a son. Did't really matter much to her. She would love the child anyway. She thought about this while she drove to Jack in the box. She knew Asami loved that food the most. But Mc Donalds was a good second choice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go through the drive-through mommy?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko knew very well why. Asami was just to lazy to walk inside and after the food outside. Most parents would find this kind of disturbing and motivate their kid to do some sport's but Yoko was a exception on this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure honey. What do you want?\" Yoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want double cheeseburgers with fries. Oh, and a chocolate milkshake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all? Don't you think you should eat a bit more. You're a growing girl after all.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yeah... perhaps.\" Asami said on a doubting tone. \"But I thought I should't eat to much or else I don't eat anymore at dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're right that's true.\" Yoko said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut when they asked her order she still asked for three double cheeseburgers, fries and a chocolate milkshake and asked to super size it. Asami also found it a bit strange. When she was with one of her friends their parents never wanted that they would eat before dinner or it would spoil their appetite. She found it a bit strange that her mother was't like other mothers but when she saw her order she thought: Who cares I can eat Jack in the box. While she licked her lips.<br>\r\nYoko enjoyed seeing her daughter eat while most people would't like it. Asami showed totally no manners. She also never put much effort in teaching them and normally ate like a pig. Pushing as much food in her mouth as she could and chew loudly with wide open mouth. Slurping loudly from her milkshake and let out a belch so loud she was sure people in the house they drove by could hear it. But Yoko liked her daughters messy eating. Even while she knew she would need new clothes tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slurp. I love Jack in the box mommy!\" Asami yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00cf know you do honey but I want that you eat it all up. It's expansive and I hate thrown out money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami nodded an looked at her food wondering if she could eat all of it, and dinner after that. But she would surely try it.  </span></div></div>",

Chocolate, ketchup and mayonnaise stains streaked Asami's cheeks as the petite child suckled more of her chocolate shake: To her right sat one crumb-laden burger wrapper whilst a half eaten Double Whopper glistened under the sun, begging to join millions of other fat cells to expand over Asami's lap. It too became a victim of this child's binge as Asami suddenly reached over and took another several bites of her burger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm. Delicious, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko only smiled as she heard her daughter clamp down upon what seemed to be an eternal feast. \"Indeed. Keep eating like this for four weeks, my beautiful little child, and you will become even more beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you, mommy,\" began Asami as she thrusted some more fries into her mouth, her grin accented by fries sticking out of her mouth. This only made Yoko smile as she turned onto the main road. The plan was working: Asami did not seem to notice the deluge of food, nor did she complain about anything. By the dawn of summer, Yoko hoped, Asami would be sun-bathing and slurping up fattening, sugary soft drinks in a nice two-piece bikini showing majestic folds of golden, Asian blubber...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh- Ssssh...\" Yoko grunted as she felt the full impact of a speed bump pass beneath the car's chassis . \"Thank you, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami sucked up the last chocolate goodness of her shake and burped: She had finished her whole meal save for three fries in the bottom of the bag, and she was <i>very</i> stuffed. Being the only little girl sure had its perks of delicious, healthy food, but gosh did it hurt her stomach. Asami, slowly, closed her eyes as she dozed off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Looking around she must admit she liked her new room. She opened her curtains a bit and looked outside. It was dark outside. The shadows of the forest seemed even darker and kind of scary. She knew for sure she saw a few scary monsters in the forest. She fast closed the curtains and hide under the covers and waited. After a few minutes nothing happened she crawled under the covers. <br>\r\nThere came a loud rumble from her belly. No wonder. She fell asleep after that food it appeared that she missed dinner. She was hungry.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I'm hungry. Hmm perhaps there's some food left in the refrigerator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl fast put on some slipper's so her feet would't get cold and slowly walked downstairs. She hated climbing stairs and wished her mother would have taken a house with a elevator. Or else a bedroom and bathroom on the first floor. That would have made life a bit easier. She listened carefully. Like most kids she was afraid in the dark. She also was't sure there were't any monsters in the forest. Her mother said: No but people make mistakes. So why would't there be monsters in there, or witches, or something else. But her hunger was bigger then her fear. Slowly she walked into the kitchen and froze a moment when she saw someone sitting at the table. But then she saw that it was her mother and sighed relieved<br>\r\nYoko looked up from her book and saw her daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asami what are you doing out of bed?\" Yoko asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry mommy but I got hungry. It seems I slept through dinner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you did. I wanted to wake you but you dad thought I could better let you sleep. He's of to bed. He need to get up early tomorrow. For work of course but then we have time to visit our neighbors. I heard they also have some young kids. Perhaps you make some friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was a bit doubtful about this. She was't really good at making friends but she also understood she would have to come anyway and maybe it was't so bad. Again her belly let out a loud rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds you could use some food.\" Yoko said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. I'm really hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm afraid Jack in the box and Mc Donalds are closed but perhaps I can make some hamburgers myself. I have some in the freezer. How does that sound?\" Yoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious mommy!\" Asami yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked the hamburgers her mother made. Perhaps not so much as the burgers from Jack in the box or Mc Donalds but they were still delicious. Her mother got very good at making hamburgers. Asami waited patient looking through one of her books. She wished she would be able to read. She knew for sure then books would be a lot more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go Asami.\" Yoko said and handed her daughter a plate with four big burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was a bit surprised at this. Not that she got food her mother never made a problem about that but she was surprised how much she got. just two or maybe even one would have been enough to fill her tummy but now her mother gave her four. But still she was't the girl to turn down food. She grabbed the first burger and started to eat.<br>\r\nYoko smiled. She was happy her daughter had come back for a midnight snack. She made sure the burgers were dripping from the grease. She smiled seeing how Asami started to eat. Her pyjama's were a bit wide but that would soon change. At least she hoped.<br>\r\nAsami  finished her first burger. The area around her mouth was covered in grease but she did't cared. Fast the second burger found it's way to her tummy. She knew it was enough but the two left over burgers looked so tempting. It was or they shouted: Eat us Asami. Eat us. we taste so delicious. and eating she did. Halfway her third burger she started to feel the familiar pain from earlier that day. She thought about stopping but the burgers just tasted to good. She saw her mother watching her. She was smiling.<br>\r\nShe was able to finish her third burger and now looked at the last burger on her plate. She grabbed it and took a bite even while her tummy made a sound of protest. She kept chewing even while every bite made her tummy hurt more. But finally the last bite went past her lips. She even licked of the grease around her mouth and lifted he shirt a bit to massaged her poor stuffed tummy. Yoko saw it and liked what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right and now it's time for you to go to bed. It's way past your bedtime, and your still young. you need your sleep. You can't be hungry anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\" Asami added to herself. But she looked sadly at her mommy. \"Carry me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh fine. Why not.\" Her mother said and lifted her stuffed daughter up a bit disappointed how light and bony she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Asami too bed tugged her in and wished her tonight. Asami still felt the burgers in her tummy pressing against the sides for some time. Soon after that she fell asleep.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From beneath Asami's bedroom door rose a savory, meaty aroma of eggs, milk and cheese sizzling in lard as this morning's breakfast spread throughout Asami's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... Is that delicious smell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice mumbled from Asami's bed as the petite child opened her eyes and sat up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout changing into her day clothes, Asami leaped down from her bed onto the redwood floor and ran out of her hallway before she met the top of the stairs. Again, Asami hated climbing stairs THAT much...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't mommy buy a one floor house?\" Asami grumbled as she held onto the handrail before descending into the foyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo bags of six Egg McMuffins, eight hashbrowns and four chocolate milk bottles sat on the dining table behind Yoko as the mother continued to fry four eggs along eight bacon strips: She herself would eat a bowl of salad whilst Asami would fatten herself up on the McGarbage which would only continue Asami's weight gain journey into a jiggling, quivering butterball. Shortly after her husband left at 4:30 to consult with some engineering firm in dire need of advice, Yoko drove up to McDonalds to purchase Asami's breakfast: Oh, if only Asami saw the looks of surprise on that worker's mortified face! And thus Asami was set up for the first part of the meal when she walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" began Asami with big eyes before she caught an overwhelming glimpse of today's breakfast. Frowning slightly, Asami scratched her tummy as she slowly walked to her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention to the table, Yoko silently panicked when she saw the frown on her face. <i>What if she finds out about my plan... Is it too late?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy... I need help getting into my seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving herself a mental sigh of relief, Yoko only smiled as she went to and lifted her daughter into the seat. The cute Japanese girl giggled as she dove her greedy fingers down one of the bags to retrieve the first hashbrown. \"Thank you, mommy! These are delicious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Thank goodness...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are welcome, sweetheart,\" Yoko grinned slyly as she returned to the deep fryers. Asami, meanwhile, chewed like a rabid beast on her dwindling hashbrowns as the crispy-gold potato cakes went down her gullet. Reaching for a bottle of chocolate milk, Asami gave little notice before she tore off the cap of the chocolate milk bottle and started to chug those sweet, zingy calories which would pay her back later; chocolate stains began to spread around Asami's mouth as they intermingled with crumbs of hashbrowns which glistened like grease.</span></div></div>",

The question why her mommy fed her so much and gave her this for breakfast maybe came up a second in her head but she did't thought that it was very important. <br>\r\nNow she laid back with a bloated belly. Softly rubbing it. She let out a loud belch.<br>\r\nYoko happy looked at the bloated belly of her daughter. Her fattening plan worked perfect. It also seemed that her daughter was a born gainer. Her midnight snack did't spoiled her appetite for breakfast.<br>\r\nAsami still rubbed her belly hoping to relief the pain she felt. The pain from being so full. But for some strange reason she even did't understand herself she also liked the pain. She wondered why that was. Was there something wrong with her.<br>\r\nYoko was also happy Asami was still in her pajama. It was very dirty thanks to her messy eating. If she would have been dressed she needed to dress her again. She cleaned Asami's face and picked her up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get you dressed. Like I told you we gonna meet some neighbors. You wanna look nice to them don't you. It's important to make a good first impression. You can only do that once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami smiled since her mother carried her. She did't really cared so much about meeting new neighbors but she knew she would need to go anyway and who know. perhaps it was't so bad. So she let her mother clean her and dress her. Yoko even did a pink bow in her hair. Not that Asami really cared about bows but  Yoko thought it looked adorable at her and since she did't cared why not wear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you look so cute sweet hart.\" Yoko said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile dressing Asami she needed to remember to buy the same clothes only a few sizes bigger so that when Asami would start to gain she would't notice.<br>\r\nShe decided she might as well Carry Asami  over the house of their neighbors and rang the doorbell. A woman in her thirties opened the door. She was normal sized with dark blond hair nice C cups boobs and a friendly smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello... Eh Yoko right. So nice to meet you.\" The she looked at Asami. \"And who is this cute  little girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asami she's my first... and only child. It's also nice to meet you.\"She said and stuck out her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami also slowly stuck out her hand.

I have tea and cookies and would you daughter perhaps like some juice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes she would like that.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lead them to a nice living room where the two took place the woman returned with a cup and some juice. She filled the cup with juice. Asami hold the cup tight with two hands and took small zips while her mother and the woman started to talk to each other. Suddenly she saw something moving and heard a sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that are my kids.\" She said. \"Jamie, Danny can you two come over here please and say hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo kids both with black shiny hair around Asami's age came out.

We need four triple-layer Whoppers, Supersized fries, loans lots of ketchup for a party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko smiled as she looked back to Asami, who grinned at her mother in reply: By \"party,\" Yoko meant letting Asami feast on more calories than what a family of three should eat in four days. Yoko was still concerned, though: How fat would Asami allow herself to become before the little girl- Oh! That was nonsense with Yoko's plan to implant fat-positive beliefs into Asami's head. As Yoko pulled into the second window, the receptionist only glanced at its two occupants and widened her eyes in horror, though not long enough to disrupt the transfer of food into the vehicle. Asami received the bag which threatened to burst only after Yoko pulled out of the McDonalds drive-thru and onto the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips again, Asami began her lunch by tearing open the Big Mac box before two little hands formed around the girl's burger as Asami bit into the burger. Greasy oils spilled down Asami's jawline along with ketchup and mayonnaise which stuck to her cheeks. Yoko smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my girl. Eat it all up: I pay too much for wasted food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami merely nodded between two bites before she stuffed her face with the Big Mac as gulps of food went down into Asami's stomach. Okay. So her mother thought she looked adorable with some extra weight... But was she <i>really</i> trying to fatten her up intentionally? A handful of fries passed through Asami's mouth as the little girl pondered: What would she <i>look like</i> down to the smallest fat roll on her waist? Asami saw very few chubby kids in her old country, but could she tolerate having more than a baby bump?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami continued to stuff herself with fries at an unrelenting speed, though, as her greedy senses experienced euphoria: So what if she would bloat up to the size of a beach bal?. The greasy, explosive flavors of fries, burger and milkshakes appeased Asami's internal debate for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, may I drink the last milkshake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked through the rear-view mirror with surprise: Asami was rubbing her bloated tummy in a pile of burger wrappers, French fry holders and two empty chocolate shake cups. Yoko could only muster a sweet, devious smile, howevver, as she held out the extra large bottle of chocolate ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy!\" Asami cried before she sucked through the bending straw to suck up the delicious, fattening treat. Her beautiful dark eyes twinkled as they closed in nirvana: The to-be-obese plumper knew that this was the first of many feasts which would put her in a state of bliss; Yoko, on the other hand, longed for the day when she could squeeze, pinch and caress Asami's golden love handles of pure blubber.</span></div></div>",

Even if she did't liked it that Asami was so light she must admit that it was easier to carry her. Especially when she would be really obese it would be hard to carry her. Asami did't seemed to excited to meet the old lady. Yoko wondered how far in the forest the old woman lived. <br>\r\nThe she saw the house and smiled when she saw it. It looked like a fairytale house. Like the grandma of little red riding hood, or the house of the three bears, the house of the seven little goats, or the house of the seven dwarfs. in the front of the house was a veranda and in front of that a garden with also some flowers at the edge and even a vegetable garden. But of course there did't grow much vegetables now.<br>\r\nThe woman herself was in a chair reading. She had long straight gray hair. Yoko could clearly see the big potbelly the woman had. She wore a black dress and seemed really friendly. On a small table next to her was a big jug with a yellow liquid. <br>\r\nWhen Yoko and Asami entered the garden the woman looked up from her book. She placed a finger between the pages she was reading and looked at them and frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have we met?\" She asked. \"Because if we do I can't remember you. But of course I also am getting old. So maybe I forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you did't. We just moved here a few days ago. We live at number nine.\"Yoko said. \"We wanted to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good. It was about someone would live there. Well welcome in the neighborhood. Would you like some lemonade?\" She asked and took two cups from under the table. \"I made it myself from real lemons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami found it kind of strange to make something from lemons. She thought they tasted much to sour. But she took a sip from her cup anyway and must admit it tasted sweet. She liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you liked young kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I like young kids. I like it to play with them or tell them stories. In my life I've heard so many stories. Some of them I made up myself. I hope they remember them and write them down for later generations. They mostly also enjoy my cooking and I babysit many times some kids. If you ever need a babysitter just call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko smiled. That would be very handy since Asami's old babysitter lived a bit far away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do you like, little girl?\" The woman asked friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack in the box.\" She mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I remembered that. I used  to work there for a long time. Of course that was some years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You worked there?\" Asami asked suddenly very interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did young girl.\" She said friendly. \"Next time you come tell me and I will make some of their food for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Eh can I use your bath room?\" Asami asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. It's in the hall first door left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Asami went to the bathroom the old woman said:  \"What a cute girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she is.\" Yoko said. \"But I would like it more if she was fat.\" As soon as the words left her mouth she knew she made a mistake but the old woman stayed pretty calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. Kids are way cuter when they are fat. If you want to fatten your daughter up a bit. I can help doing that. Just call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That  would be great.

Yoko beamed with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Miss... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patricia,\" winked the woman as she watched Asami indulge upon her latest craving: Fattening up this one was going to be an easy task.

Asami started to get some fat on her belly. Yoko Always wondered where her daughter would gain. She knew some people gained more in their lower half getting a pear shape well other gained more around their belly getting a apple shape. She also knew some teenager gained in their tits but it was obvious Asami  gained all over her body but a bit more in the belly. <br>\r\nYoko had been very careful. She bought clothes for Asami. Exactly the same clothes like before only a few sizes bigger so Asami would't notice something about her gain.<br>\r\nAsami of course noticed her huge amount in Junk food but since she liked the food so much she did't cared that she got it so much. She also noticed that she slowly started to eat more then some time ago. Yoko told her that was because she was a growing girl and she accepted that.<br>\r\nNow after four weeks Asami was now really chubby. It was Saturday morning and Asami slurped the last part of her Jack in the box breakfast her mother bought for her. Yoko enjoyed seeing how her daughter ate gaining more weight with each bite. She noticed how the belly of her daughter was starting to get rounder. Asami was't slender any more. She was without a doubt chubby. The little girl herself did't noticed much of her gain or did't cared. Yoko was partly happy about that. She did't want Asami to know she was fattening her up in case she did't liked it or did't want to.<br>\r\nA loud belch of her daughter interrupted her thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done mommy!\" Asami yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko walked to her daughter and took away her empty platter with a smile seeing how her daughters belly raised with each breath.<br>\r\nBut of course those few pounds Asami gained were't enough for Yoko. See wanted Asami way fatter. Like a sumo wrestler. Or even fatter. With Asami's appetite, love for junk food and lack of exercise that would't be any problem.<br>\r\nSuddenly Asami's father walked in kissed his daughter on the cheek and walked over to his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning my darling wife. listen up. I'm free today. So I planned a romantic day for just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the two of us?\" Yoko asked confused. \"But what do we do with Asami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a babysitter. I mean Cherri...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right? Cerri does't live just a few houses away from us like she used to do. I admit that was easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah I did't thought about that. We can't take her. Did you perhaps saw something about a babysitter club?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yoko smiled. This was the perfect chance to call Patricia She know she wrote her number down somewhere. She started to look in her purse. After looking for a minute she found what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I found the number.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From a babysitter's club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. From a lovely old woman named Particia. She lives in the forest here. Did't you know that? Anyway I and Asami visit her some time ago. She said she could always babysit. I just needed to call her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then call her. I planned some special things and I can't cancel them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko dialed the number. Patricia picked up after the first ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Patricia. This is Yoko. Do you remember. I visit you some time ago with my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. You wanted to... fatten her up a bit. Why are you calling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my husband planned something for me and him but we have no babysitter for Asami. Could you please babysit her?\" Yoko asked begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course. It would be my pleasure. She can even sleep here if you like so you two can stay up late.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's great you're a life saver Patricia.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anytime dear.\" Patricia said.  </span></div></div>",

Asami was like a newborn baby all over again, with layers of baby fat rounding off every joint, limb and cheek.

As Yoko withdrew the two articles from the closet, Asami dutifully removed her elastic pajama top and bottom, revealing every square inch of growing blubber which was suggestive of what others would call a weight problem, but what Yoko would describe as a \"regal blessing.\" Asami crawled onto her stomach and felt... Fuller, for a moment. However, her thoughts were interrupted when Yoko tossed the cami and shorts onto her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try those on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami nodded. \"Yes, mommy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Asami pulled her head through the top of the shirt and tried to pull it down over her stomach. The spaghetti-strap top fit, though the bottom rode up to the base of Asami's deepening navel. The shorts, too, felt somewhat tight on Asami's chicken thighs and helped to form a slight muffin top that jiggled and gracefully protruded over the cut-off's waistband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" Asami called. \"These are tight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. They shrank in the wash, didn't they?\" Yoko replied with her sly grin as she saw Asami shift in her new weight: A nice sliver of golden blubber jiggled when Asami twisted to her left to reach for her Capris Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess, mommy,\" Asami replied as she squeezed an entire mouthful of sugary fruit punch into her mouth. This made Yoko smile when she saw the drink spray down onto Asami's clothes, making her even cuter by providing further evidence of this girl's needed appetite on her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, carry me,\" Asami wailed with her beautiful, shiny brown eyes squinting in happiness as she held out her arms: It was harder for her to walk, but Asami figured it was just one small trade off for being warmed by her thick, leathery blanket of fat. Truth be told, but Asami actually liked the feeling of her mattress-like fluff: She could sit in Henry's chair for as long as possible and never complain of soreness what with her fuller rump cushioning her weight. Which brought her back to an old question: Could she tolerate being obese?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami fell asleep in Yoko's arms by the time the woman adjusted her hold to support Asami's soft rear: It was harder than usual to carry even just her chubby child, but at least Asami was fluffy enough for Yoko to enjoy massaging what layers of fat Asami had. The feeling of her shallow fold of blubber being stroked and poked made Asami smile in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yoko's husband, Akio, stayed behind to make last-minute preparations for the trip: There had been an accident with one of his colleagues many years back resulting from leaving one penny too few back at home... Yoko sighed as she heaved Asami higher up when the little girl slipped an inch. She loved her husband, and she did not want him to panic like that one time when he forgot to turn off the lights...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami murmured as she sleeped through the walk. Until recently, Asami preferred to rest her head directly on Yoko's shoulders. Now that her underarms were softened up with baby fat, Asami made a habit of resting her head between her now-bulkier arms as a means of getting comfortable. When Yoko turned onto Patricia's road, Asami was still sound asleep as her mother rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko? Is that you?\" A muffled voice called from behind the door. Yoko could hear footsteps moments before the portly woman opened before the mother and her chubby child. Patricia smiled and spoke in a low voice while her eyes followed the deepening curves of Asami's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's growing beautifully- my, your girl's already sporting a cute tummy! I will be glad to feed and take care of her for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko nodded. \"Her favorite meals include the triple-stack Ultimate Cheeseburger with fries and a large chocolate shake; lots and lots of chocolate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a sweet-tooth. I'll take good care of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly came a little grunt from Asami as the chunky Japanese girl woke up from her nap. With a look of apprehension at first, Asami was about to scream when she realized that this was the lady's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the little one awake and alert, Patricia grinned happily. \"Hello, little girl. Call me Granny Pattie. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...\" Asami rumbled just as Yoko transferred her plump body to Granny's extended arms. Patricia smiled as she felt her hands sink ever so slightly into Asami's puppy fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take good care of her, worry not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you will,\" Yoko replied with a smile before she looked down. \"Is there anything I can do-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Patricia waved her free hand as she grinned. \"Feeding this young one will be rewarding enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then. Bye, Asami: I'll see you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's eyes widened in awe as an aroma of sizzling burgers, fries, and ice cream wafted through her nostrils upon being plopped down on a plush violet sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... Feel hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia smiled on hearing this as she worked from the kitchen behind a mini-bar counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, cause dinner will be ready in thirty minutes! Don't you move too much, now; you need lots of rest to get big and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that Asami was planning to go outside anyway. Already, the Japanese child fumbled through the remote as she changed to one channel showcasing an episode of Pok\u00e9mon. Patricia, meanwhile, continued to fry and bake Asami's first, second and final helpings of two-pound burgers, pitcher quantity chocolate ice cream and tens of hundreds of calories worth of fries.</span></div></div>",

Interrupted only by her growling stomach, Asami looked down and poked her stomach through the cloak. Her finger sank a good inch into her pudge and felt so squishy... Asami smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Getting fat isn't so hard after all! I am like a pillow, with squishiness and warmth!

Five or so half-pound burgers sat on a platter fresh from the oven, and surrounding the five burgers were grease-dripping French fries soaked in cheddar cheese. Granny Patricia had set a plush pillow in Asami's chair to reach the table, and a stool was set up to facilitate Asami's access into the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Granny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny Patricia smiled as she saw Asami burrow into her seat before the tan-fleshed child stuffed her face with cheese-soaked fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you enjoy it: The cheese is homemade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that it mattered: Asami's eyes were only focused on emptying the burger platter of all cheese fries between sips of chocolate ice cream. Explosions of rich, savory flavor overwhelmed the Japanese girl's limits as she finished off the fries before sinking her teeth into the first of five burgers. Sauces and cheese rolled down Asami's body and stained her white cami as the binge sprayed the grease to and fro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was in near-heaven with this fattening, steaming food: She felt like she was at a joyous carnival, with the aromas of food reinvigorating her psyche as she stuffed her face with calorific treats. This made Asami's caregiver smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you aren't too full, 'cause dessert is coming up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Asami did not know whether or not she could finish her platter: Her stomach already hurt from the binge, and it seemed as though Asami was slowing down her binge as she took smaller bites.</span></div></div>",

A moment she wondered about the thought of getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if I get fat.\" She thought. \"I even kind of like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continued stuffing her face. She must admit this stuff tasted just as good or maybe even better then the normally Jack in the box. Well Patricia said she used to work there. It seemed like she was still able to make the food. She saw Patricia looking at her with a smile.<br>\r\nWhat Asami did't knew was that the delicious food was made with a lot of extra fat what was perhaps the reason it tasted so good. She made sure all the food on the table contained more fat so it would surely made some nice fat on the little girls frame.<br>\r\nAsami did notice that her shorts got tighter with each bite. Suddenly she heard a:\"Pock!\" and felt kind of relieved. She looked down and saw what caused it. The button of her pants flew of. It hit the underside of the table what was the: \"Pock!\" sounds she heard. Now without her pants button her belly flew out like a river forcing her zipper all the way down. Now with her belly free she thought she found enough room to finish the food and she continued eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hmm. That's a good girl. She has a good appetite. It's almost a miracle she did't gained much weight before. I don't know what her mother did but she fattened that girl up good. But I'm also pretty good. I can't wait until she digested that food and see all her fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was busy with her last burger. She was eating slowly now. But surely the burger disappeared. Finally Asami took the last bite chewed it and swallowed it. When Patricia saw her empty mouth she clapped like a happy child. Asami shook a bit and let out a huge belch loud enough that some birds in the tree outside flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops! Excuse me. That food was soooooo good! It all tasted delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well dessert is coming up.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? BURP! Dessert? Really Granny. I loved your food and I'm sure so does your dessert. BURP! But I'm really stuffed. Look even the button of my pants flew of.\" Asami said and she pointed at her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the problem those days.\" Patricia said shaking her head. \"People use washing machines these days. Back in my time we need to wash it all by hand. But now with those washing machines many people wash their clothes to hot... and they shrink. I guess that's what happened with your shorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah my mom said that too. Why do people wash their clothes so hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make them clean. They are clean all right but as a result they shrink. In my time you need to wash it by hand. Then it did't shrink. But I must admit I also bought a washing machine some years ago. I'm getting to old to do everything by hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami shivered by this. She already hated walking or climbing stairs. Doing chores was probably even worse. But Lucky there were machines now to do it.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you don't want you dessert?\" Patricia asked again sounding a bit like Asami hurt her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No! I would love to. Just not right now, first let this food... digest. Then I'll be happy too eat dessert.\" Asami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then. But be sure to work up a appetite. We also have dinner.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami waddled back too the couch wondering if she could eat dinner and the dessert. She felt like a turkey stuffed for thanksgiving. She curled herself up in the wool blanket and turned on the T.V on. But while she watched Johnny Test her eyes got heavy and she fell in a deep sleep<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eating is fun anyways, and I get to have new squishiness every time I eat!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, Asami could see herself one year later: A jolly, fat little girl with great rolls of fat and love handles jiggling as her belly rested on two tire-thick thighs. A broad, fat-cheeked face smiling with every meal as Asami ate greasy burgers in her swimwear on the beach. Danny snuggling up to her chest like a stuffed animal-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami examined her own body when Grannie Patricia was not scrubbing her back with the sponge: Already, Asami had some permanent love handles which only needed to get a little deeper, and growing a beautiful Buddha stomach would only require some more effort...</span></div></div>",

So she really was't tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I need to obey your mother's rules and she was clear about your bedtime. If I won't obey your mother's rules I won't be allowed to babysitter you anymore.

She was very nice to her and most important she was a terrific cook. She was the only one she ever met in her short live who could make food from Jack in the box and make it even tastier. She did want Patricia to be her babysitter. After all since they moved over here they need to have a new babysitter for her anyway. She lived nearby and loved children. She was perfect.<br>\r\nPatricia carried her out of the bathtub and got a towel and started to rub her dry. <br>\r\nThen Asami wondered something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granny Patricia, where you fat when you were a child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I were fat like a child? That's a long time ago. A very long time ago. Let me see.\" She closed her eyes for a second. \"Well perhaps I was a little chubby but not really fat.\" She patted her potbelly. \"Most of the weight in here I gained in my teenage years. I never was able to lose it. Why would want to lose it anyway. It looks kind of good at me right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would a potbelly look good at me too?\" Asami asked while she curled a towel in her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my dear child I think you would look good with a potbelly but even better if you were even fatter.\" She looked a moment in the air. \"You know Asami I once went too new york. They say there that everything is bigger. Including the people. Or to be totally honest... mainly the people. So they say that bigger is better. I think it's true. You would look even more adorable and cute if you were fat. You should try it. But now into bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Asami in a room that was full of kid stuff. It even had some fun posters on the wall. Patricia tucked her in and kissed her good night. But Asami still was't really tired and explored her new weight and thought about becoming fat. Liking the idea more and more every second.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took four weeks for Asami to gain six pounds, yet her metabolism finally gave up as Asami gained four more \u00a0pounds in just three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's bare belly sagged over her thighs as five thick fingers caressed a bulging fat roll whilst Asami slept on her back with the white cami rolled up.

At least twelve pounds overweight, Asami was well accustomed to her weight at this point, though she did not tell Granny that she liked being so round.

The only thing she disliked a bit was that Patricia seemed to be even better in the fattening of her daughter then she was. But that was just a minor detail that she did't mind too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Asami. Did you had a nice time here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did mommy. Granny Patricia is the best babysitter ever. She also cooks delicious. She's a fantastic cook. You should really ask her the recipe. She can make the food from Jack in the box but makes it even taste a bit better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really. Well that's the first time I ever heard you say something tasted better then Jack in the box. Can you wait here for a few minutes? I want to have a talk with Granny Patricia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami looked at her mother when she left the room and wondered what her mother was going to say to her. Was she angry she fattened Asami up. She did't thought so. Sure she thought her mother fattened her up just as well, but perhaps she did't do it on purpose. Her mother also smiled when she saw her so she did't seem to mind it. If she did mind she knew very well how to hide it. Perhaps she just wanted a nice talk. She would find out later and she focused her attention back too the T.V. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well I must admit  you did a real good job at fattening her up.\" Yoko said too Patricia. \"How did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a secret of the cook. But I guess I can tell you. I simply made the food from jack in the box and added a lot of extra grease to the stuff. Added a bit of liquid butter to the sauce used more grease for the burgers and more of that stuff. She seems to have a taste for greasy stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has a taste for greasy stuff? Really? Well that's fantastic.\" Yoko said with a smile. \"She fattens up pretty good. She does't even notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if she does't notice.\" Patricia said. \"She does't seem to mind or act different but I'm not sure she does't notice her weight gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I would't mind telling her if I knew for sure she would like it. But Asami seemed to really like you and she wanted you to be her new babysitter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I like her too and I would love to be her new babysitter. It's not like I'm very busy so I have enough free time. So everyone is happy.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then everything I fine. I take my butterball home. How much money do I owe you?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I would't dare taking your money. I really loved taking care of Asami. Besides I have more then enough money of my own already. Keep you money. But I would like it if I might visit once in a while. See the fattening process. Meet her father. Besides does he know about the fattening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko froze. She must admit that she did't thought about that. But she fast recovered and looked calmly at Patricia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but I will worry about that when it's time for it. Maybe he does't really mind Asami's weight. He also never mind how lazy she was. Now it was so nice you took care of Asami. You're free to visit but call before so we can be sure we're home. Now it's time I and Asami go back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Yoko waked back while carrying her daughter. She could really notice that she got a lot heavier and she liked it. But it might become a problem later. Then she would be too heavy too carry. Well she would worry about it then. But for now...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Asami... are you hungry?\"</span></div></div>",

An explosion of crumbs landed upon Asami's tube top-like cami and the growing mass of soft, obese Japanese fat which appreciated the increase in calories. As Asami sank her teeth for a second bite, she could feel her hips and thighs squeeze against her narrowing cut-offs: As they did so, the fat felt warm and comfortable. Just like Asami wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko continued the drive home but managed to give a few glimpses at Asami's gluttony as the overweight child stuffed her face with fries.

Looking like you saw something nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sorry. I was... just thinking about something.\" She said and helped Asami to get dressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked dressing Asami in tight clothing and she had been able to do that for a long time since she always used to be skinny but now she could she tried to do it as often if possible. Her husband did't mind. He thought that his wife and daughter just liked dressing up. Why would he spoil their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy most of my clothes are getting a little tight.\" Asami complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course honey. That's because you're growing. You're getting bigger.  Just like Miyuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiyuki was Asami's cousin. She could get pretty well along with Asami. Miyuki was only a few months older the her but a lot taller, and by now also a lot thinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miyuki is tall because she's growing and you're also growing. So you also are getting taller. But your clothes are't. That's why they are getting tight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami did't thought she was getting taller. Everything just seemed as high as it did when she first got here. But she knew she grew. But she was't taller but wider but for some strange reason Yoko seemed to hide it. It could also be of course that she was too stupid too notice but  Asami did't thought that was the case. Mommy fed her so much food and did't seem to notice her weight gain. At least she did't said much about it but why. She must have noticed she was getting heavier since she carried her around so much. Or was it all just in her imagination. She knew she had a lot of imagination but she doubted it was that. Was she getting fatter or not. She hoped she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right you're all dressed up. You can go downstairs.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami looked at her mother with very sad eyes. She reached her hands out too Yoko. Yoko sighed and picked the lazy girl and carried her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I getting heavy mommy.\" Asami asked innocent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Don't worry sweetie. I can easily carry you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko could still easily carry her fat daughter but if she kept gaining like this she would soon be too heavy. <br>\r\nAsami in the meantime was thinking. So according to her mother she was't fat or gaining. But her mother was just one opinion. She wanted to ask somebody else. Not granny Patricia. Not that she did't liked her since she liked her a lot but she talked a lot with Yoko so she would probably get the same answer from her. She wanted the opinion of somebody outside her mother or Patricia. But who? Was she really gaining? If she was did Yoko know about it? If she did then why hide it from her? All this thoughts were going to the little girls head. while her mother carried her downstairs.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Asami seemed to put on some weight lately and since she always used to be skinny he did't worry too much at first but now she really was outgrowing clothes. She also ate way more then a normal girl of her age would normally ate. What Asami's mother and Patricia fed her seemed a awful lot for a girl of Asami's age. Especially she also ate at Jack in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko can I speak to you in the kitchen?\" He asked and pulled his wife with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh sure. Patricia can you help her eating?\" Yoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would love too.\" Patricia answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Kitchen Yoko looked a bit disturbed. She was enjoying it so much.

She's just growing.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko knew she was lying. But this was just the part she worried about. All this time she was worried that her father would be against the feeding while Asami was't near the size Yoko wanted her to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's growing but wider. Not taller. I can't believe you don't see that. We should start thinking about a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are't you a little over reacting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she should at least stop eating by Jack in the box and Mc Donalds, eat smaller portions and put her on a exercise group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You van't be serious.\" Yoko said. \"Asami loves Jack in the box and Mc Donalds. Why not give her more if she's still hungry, and you know very well she hates exercise. She even finds it a lot effort walking down the stairs. Leave alone exercise on purpose. You can't do that to her. I think she't totally healthy and you're seeing things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then... Maybe I am. So I will make a doctor's appointment. He will knows what's best. I will agree with what he says.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked out to his car and drove away. Leaving a sad Yoko. She knew that normally he was right. Eating less junk food, smaller portions and exercise would without a doubt give Asami a healthy weight but that was not what Yoko wanted. She decide she might as well feed Asami for the last time.<br>\r\nAs she fed Asami Patricia realized something was wrong but she waited to hear it. After Asami was done eating and watched T.V Yoko told her what had been going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So we can't continue fattening your daughter?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia and she talked some more. After some time Yoko looked at the clock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's been gone for some time. How long can it take to make a doctor's appointment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not long. The doctor lives near. Perhaps he's already looking for a exercise group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko and Patricia talked some more but after another hour she grew concerned. <br>\r\n. <br>\r\n\"He's still not back. I mean it can't take that long. Or did I do something terribly wrong. I mean there are enough parents with obese kids. I'm not the first one who's over feeding her child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another half hour suddenly the phone rang. Yoko fast picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello this is Yoko....... Yes he is...... What? ....... Oh my gosh....... Yeah how is he?....... Are you sure........ Yeah I understand thank you.\" She hung up whit a pale face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Patricia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My husband. On his way too the doctor he had an accident with his car.

Not only was Asami putting on pounds at an alarming pace, but people always seemed to feel heavier directly after eating. Patricia noticed this with delight, as her current predicament confirmed it. <i>Yoko</i>, she thought. <i>Your child is getting big. I wonder how long you'll be able to carry her effortlessly now?</i> She hefted the girl up in her tiring arms. <i>Good luck with that.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I getting heavy?\" Asami commented, sounding innocent. But Patricia didn't answer the loaded question, staying focused on getting to the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami, meanwhile, was pretty grumpy. On top of family reasons to feel bad, her dinner had been interrupted. She was a bit hungry still, but she doubted she would get to eat any more tonight. She was tired, too. Her prolonged binge eating had expanded her stomach, so it took more and more to satisfy the girl lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the guest room, Asami was set on the bed. Patricia then went about the business of retrieving her nightwear from the drawer. She wanted to select something good and then let Asami change herself. She looked at the first choice, a top and a bottom. It was a set from before the girl started gaining weight: the whole thing was pink and it buttoned down the front. She took one look at Asami, regarding her belly and smiling at her. Asami smiled back. <i>No way this'll fit anymore</i>, Patricia thought jovially. So she put it back. Patricia wasn't a rude person. As much as she thought Yoko wouldn't mind, it wasn't her business to squeeze Yoko's daughter into outfits only to destroy them. Clothes can be donated, handed down, or sold to thrift stores and such. The next outfit was a similar pair, green this time, with buttons, but a size larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took off Asami's shoes because Asami had trouble with laces. \"Put this on and holler if you need help,\" Patricia directed. \"I'll be on the other side of the door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, Asami was crying for help already. She was half-dressed, unable to button anything. Patricia surveyed the problem. Asami's belly looked very round, and HUGE. It was forcing the sides of her shirt apart. Patricia could imagine the little girl trying to force the button and hole to meet. Asami's little hands and lack of physical strength working, maybe getting a button to go half in, but then the button escapes her grasp as her bulging tummy pushed against her arms. Her bottoms had two buttons to make them easier to get out of, and they were also a wide distance apart. That little monster of a tummy was going to be a difficult obstacle to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme see, stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia used an incredible amoount of force but the sides of her top wouldn't meet. \"Hmmm! Don't worry honey, we'll just try more pajamas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia gave the girl the biggest pair Yoko had given her. She left the room in much the same way as she did before, only to come back because Asami needed help again. With great effort, the largest pair of pajamas was buttoned by both girls. Asami was standing up on the bed. Patricia felt exhausted. The pajamas groaned with effort and looked like they were holding on for dear life; the stitches were screaming about the pressure they held back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we did it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it!\" Asami congratulated. She had a mischievous smirk on her face that Pat caught. Asami kicked her legs out and sat forcefully on the bed. <b>All </b>of the buttons flew off in Granny's direction, unable to take the sudden change in pressure as her torso constricted. Her top and bottom were forced open, flowing in the air before coming to rest uselessly at the sides. The mattress springs squeaked where she landed heavily. It was beautiful, and the buttons that had hit Granny stung. Asami laughed loudly, almost maliciously at her destructive behavior. She rubbed her tummy with content. TOO BIG for those pajamas!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia sighed. After all that effort this happens. Pat couldn't help herself anymore. She gave Asami's tummy many appreciative pats, which the huge round belly reacted to accordingly. Regarding Asami's form once again, her tummy was like a big bowl was placed there. She had love handles in certain positions Up close, she could see popped stitching around the arm pits and down the sides of her pajamas. Patricia hoped all her clothes weren't so... small, apparently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I getting heavy?\" Asami mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia nodded absently to the question. \"I'm going to go find something that you can fit into,\" she said. \"Something without buttons.\" She poked the little girl's belly for emphasis, eliciting a giggle. \"Don't get into trouble.\" As fat as Asami's belly was, it had little give to it. That suggested that Asami belonged at this size. Her clothes at home might suffer similar fates as her worthless PJs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was eventually dressed in a one piece swimsuit that Granny had (a perfect fit) and was tucked in. And just a few more belly pats... </span></div></div>",

I could't leave your daughter alone. If I went home I could't have lived with myself. But tell me how's your husband?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they stabilized him.... But he's in a coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do they know when he wakes up?\" Patricia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't know. It could be some weeks it could also be some years. Several years without him. It's gonna be a terrible time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I will help you. You can always ask for help. It's not like I have to do anything at home. I live alone, don't have a job anymore and I have more then enough free time. It's not a problem really. Oh by the way. Your daughter needs new pajamas. The old ones are all way too small. Even the biggest did't fit her. It looked like we got them on but when she sat on the bed all buttons popped of. Well I finally dressed her in a one piece swimsuit. But that girl really need new pajamas. Best elastic ones without buttons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko got a bit sidetracked by this. Did Asami already go too fat for her old pajamas. This made her smile a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really appreciate that you wanna help Patricia. I really do. There are also a few good points to this. We don't need to go to the doctor, and he won't stop us from fattening Asami. Also Asami might miss him so much that she needs a lot of comfort food. That way she will gain a lot of weight.\" Yoko said with a weak smile. \"I know it sounds a bit bad, but he's in a coma I cant change that I can at least use it to my advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's correct my dear child. Besides you need to feed a hungry child. Else it would be child abuse.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth woman laughed about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I am starting to wonder is or she's realizing she's gaining weight?\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good question.\" Yoko said. \"I think she's slowly starting to notice something. I still said it was nothing but if she gains a lot more it will be undeniable. If she hates it... what then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But perhaps she likes it. She's already pretty fat but that does't stop her from enjoying good food. If she does notice it she seems she does't mind it, or is addicted to it what many people say they are, or she likes it.  But let just wait some time before telling her. But your daughter is fattening up pretty nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she does does't she. You helped also good. I'm glad someone is helping me with fattening her. It's so hard to find someone who likes things like this. If you ask the wrong person you're end up like a crazy person.\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well you're perfectly safe with me. I said I would help you fatten your daughter and as long if your husband is in the hospital I can help around the house sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no. I could't ask you to do that.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really it would be my pleasure.\" Patricia said. \"I'm going home and I see you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko kept thinking about this generous offer. It would be nice having someone around to help as long if her husband was in the hospital. Yoko liked Patricia a lot and Asami also.

Even more visible was how muh her soft, bubble butt jiggled as she walked with the edges of her cheeks peeking through the edges of the fabric, and how chubby her chest was also getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only say one thing, either with ecstasy or shock:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!

Even fatter. <br>\r\nJust then Yoko came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look how big I got mommy. My bathing suit torn apart. I'm really getting huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly honey. It's just an old bathing suit. I should have bought a new one sometime ago. Well we need to go clothes shopping anyway. We can buy a new one. Besides I think you're old enough now for a bikini now. Would't that be better for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked so much forward to see her daughter later even fatter sitting in the garden in only her bikini showing her fat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Asami said. \"I would't mind wearing a bikini. But mommy I'm really getting huge. I did't fit a single pajama. I burst out of every single one we tried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko was disappointed she did't see that. But well nothing to do about that. But it was getting harder and harder to convince Asami she was't getting fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy!\" Asami cried when she suddenly remembered something. \"How's daddy? Is he okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I went to the hospital yesterday. It seemed that your daddy has a accident. He's in a coma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What''s a coma?\" Asami asked. \"Some kind of disease?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sweetie. It's some kind of very deep sleep. But you can't wake that person up. Daddy is now in a coma. He could be in that for weeks... or years. We don't know how long. But it might take a while. But right now he is't in any danger. I think we will visit about once a week or so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko knew there was a big chance her husband would't wake up soon. Going there every day would be silly. Especially since she could be doing that for years. But of course she still wanted to see him and so would Asami. She wanted to continue her life and fattening Asami, and right now she needed bigger clothes for her fattening daughter.<br>\r\nAsami was a bit shocked about the news of her father. At the other hand now she did't have to go to the doctor. Like most little kids she was afraid for the doctor. Besides her daddy worried about her recent gain while she wanted to gain more weight. Of course she did't want this to happen to him but it did solved that problem. For some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked in her daughters closet for some clothing. Asami gained faster then she expected. Suddenly she remembered the clothes she got from Patricia. She walked downstairs and returned a minute later with the box of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Patricia gave you some clothes. Now let's see of those fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked through them for something nice and found a sky blue shirt and some elastic pants that fitted the fat girl. It seemed like Patricia also had been a fat child. Well no wonder if you saw her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now those fit perfectly. Is't it nice from her that she gave us some old clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy most of my old clothes don't fit. So could't it be I'm getting fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie I already told you you're just growing. Perhaps it's a growth spurt. Don't worry about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe got in the car and Yoko drove away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy.... I believe the town is in the other direction.\" Asami slowly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know sweetie but I guess you hungry are't you. So how about we get some breakfast for you first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am hungry. \" Asami said with a grin when a loud rumble came from her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let's first get you a big breakfast.\"   <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Just barely a short while ago, Yoko could only feel Asami's ribs and a flat stomach; now, Asami's blubbery form was just two pounds into being officially obese. Yoko, however, wanted Asami to weigh 180 lbs- 200 pounds if necessary- and get too fat for <i>all</i> normal clothes.<i> She looked so cute in that torn swimsuit,</i> Yoko thought when her SUV reached a T-intersection. Once Asami wore her new bikini on a near-daily business, Yoko would not have to go clothes shopping as often as she did now. So as long, of course, if Yoko stuck with an elastic top and bottom for the beautiful stuffed doll in the back. Each bikini set would have to last at least four weeks for Asami's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami opened her ees and tried to smile as she saw her mother pull up to the menu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I want lots of pancakes, tater tots and a nice, big ice cream!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what you'll get, honey.\" Yoko and Asami smiled towards one another before Yoko turned her head to the voice grille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, may I take your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we would like two boxes of eight miniature pancakes with lots of syrup. Add in a box of extra large potato bites and a large chocolate shake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Yoko got the food at the counter, Asami bounced in her seat eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I am hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, sweetheart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko turned around with a wink before Asami's greedy fingers took the entire bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoko drove out of the parking lot, Asami did not even bother with the plastic knife and fork; she hated how dull they were and how hard it was to cut breakfast. She grasped two pancake wafers at a time between many pudgy fingers, dunked those said pancakes into the syrup box before molasses ran down Asami's chin as she feasted on her entire breakfast like a rabid dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, sweetie. Eat it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko couldn't help but grin in approval at her daughter's messy eating habits: Asami, once she finished her sixth pancake, did not hesitate to slurp the syrup sticking to the edges of the plastic container before she resumed to stuff herself with more pancakes. Next, Asami tore open the second bag of pancakes, poured the second entire carton of syrup onto her pancakes, and sank her teeth into the golden buttermilk bread. Flakes of pancake stuck to Asami's cyan shirt, pants and even along her widened jawline &amp; thickened double chin. She liked the feeling of being stuffed with food.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yoko smiled seeing how her daughter stuffed her face. Getting fatter. She was only a bit worried if Asami noticed it. Asami was perhaps kind of lazy, and not very strong. She even was't able to open a bottle of coke but she was't stupid. After none of her pajama's fit her and most of her clothes also were too small or very tight. The little girl did notice all this but she kept telling that she just was growing but Asami did seem to know very well she was gaining weight but she also did't seemed to be bothered by it. She seemed very happy stuffing herself. Well no wonder. Eating food from Jack in the box was her biggest hobby. However some people did't consider eating like a hobby. But still she was afraid Asami did knew the truth she perhaps did't want to become fat and then she would't gain anymore and Yoko wanted her fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So and we're here.\" Yoko said when Asami licked the last crumbs of her lips and the last drop of syrup out of the plastic container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami looked at the store. She did't knew this store. But after all they moved and this store was probably closer to their new house. What the little Japanese girl did't knew was that it was a store for big sizes. But she could't read yet so followed her mother into the store without a second thought. But inside she started to notice most kids here and also some of their parents were fat. <br>\r\nAsami looked suspicious at her mother. She was sure she knew about her weight gain. Why else would she take her here. She could't be that stupid. Not that she minded but why not telling her? <br>\r\nYoko smiled looking at her and then thought about her husband. In the hospital. Well he was't doing worse, but also was't doing better. That could continue for a long time. Sure of course she was sad but she could fatten Asami up this way without any trouble. Always look at the bright side right. He would't be happy if Asami was a obese ball of fat but she could of course make him believe that was because he was in the hospital. She heard enough stories  of people who gained weight after a family member past away. Especially kids who lost one of their parents. So why not Asami. Combined whit her lack of exercise it was hard to believe she gained a lot of weight. Suppose her husband would come out of her coma years later and found out his daughter became obese in the meantime. What kind of expression would he have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh hello.\" Yoko asked a clerk. \"I'm looking for clothes for my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right miss wait a moment so I can take her size.\" He said friendly while he took a tape-measure and wrapped it about Asami's middle. You can find clothes on the third floor. Oh and if you want a sumo costume for her they're in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami did't react to this but noticed her mother looked angry at him. She knew something about sumo. After all it was the sport of their nation. It came from japan. Sumo wrestlers were adored ,had millions of fans and could win a lot of money... in japan. She wondered a moment of her mother planned to make a sumo wrestler. She sure hoped not. Not that she minded the clothing or a huge weight or body but simply because she hated the exercise. She was also happy the store had a elevator. But when they arrived at the third floor she soon found out her mother came not even near the sumo outfits while she looked for some nice clothes.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As long as Asami was happy and well-fed, Yoko was ready to accept an obese ball of jiggling fat as her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, Asami's eyes were set upon some aquamarine-teal two piece swimsuit: Both flaps of the bottom were joined by two brass rings through a total of four loops while the top's triangular coverings were joined to a brass ring. Yet what caught Asami's attention was that it sparkled like glitter as the underlying blue floral pattern's costume glitter refracted light back out into the Japanese girl's eyes. The size itself, though, was two sizes too loose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko, on the other hand, ran her fingers along the elastic, violet trim of another bikini set which consisted of purple striped briefs and a tube top-like bra which had not only a back strap but also a neck one to keep it nice and secure. It bore little of the glamor of what Asami had seen, but this was made up with being not only the right (currently) size but also in giving some growing room for her daughter. Also, the triangular profile of these briefs would give Asami's thighs plenty of room to expand in girth without discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! I want this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko turned her head toward Asami and smiled... Until her eyes recoiled at the extra size<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What good is it if she's too small for it? She'll be disappointed.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks nice, honey, but I was thinking of getting you this one as well.

Even if it was a bit too big. But with her growing body it woud't be too big for long. Besides Asami really seemed to like it. She must admit that image her daughter wearing it did look nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right. Why not. It's fine having a extra bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Milly has three bikini's, and three bathing suits. I think that's a bit much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko sighed. Milly was a girl about asami's age. She was the most spoiled kid she knew. Her mother bought everything for her she wanted no matter how much it cost. She Always wore the newest fashion, the most expansive  design clothing. She knew she was rich if you saw her parents and the car they drove. They owned a huge villa and they thought they were better then anyone else because they were rich. Milly even wore make-up and like most girls that considered themselves gorgeous she thought fat girls were ugly. Asami never needed to deal with that because she used to be thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you did't liked Milly.\" Yoko said. \"Why do you know she has three bikini's and bathing suits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was bragging about them telling how much she had and how good they looked at her and telling she had a swimming pool. I don't like her. No one likes her except her parents. I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile talking Yoko found a big pajama that would probably fit and a nightie. She also found some elastic clothing what would really be handy with her gaining daughter. She was so happy her daughter was a born gainer. She was also lucky she found a friend like Patricia who wanted to help her fattening Asami and did a pretty good job. But getting new clothes so often was a bit difficult sometimes. But it was totally worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Asami. Could you please try those things on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mommy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe yelled and went to a changing room and tried the outfits on. Most fitted her daughter nicely and were't tight around the tummy. Yoko was happy she went too a big size store. She would having a hard time finding clothes that fit her in a normal store.. <br>\r\nA few minutes later she paid for the clothes and got in the car. Suddenly she saw Asami staring at something. She looked and saw a Jack in the box. The same time she heard a growl coming from Asami's belly. Yoko could't believe it. How could Asami still be hungry. Perhaps her breakfast was too small and it was't enough for her. That was probably it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want some Jack in the box honey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Mommy.\" Asami said and licked her lips. <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Asami, meanwhile, sat in the back rubbing her tummy: She found herself feeling very, very hungry as another rumble growled within her stomach. Yoko was right: She needed to eat more since her stomach was growing. And her flabby body which would soon spill over the seatbelt if Yoko continued to feed her long enough. This thought made Yoko smile more as she continued her paththrough the drive-thru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the car was loaded with food, Asami could not help herself any longer: Immediately when the first bag rested on her beefy thighs, Asami tore open the first burger box and began to stuff her face with hundreds of calories at once. Yoko seemed pleasantly surprised as she glanced at the rear-view mirror. Asami's huge appetite would no doubt accelerate her outward growth which would further drive her appetite. As Asami started on her second burger, she felt grease sticking through Patricia's old clothes to her skin. She smiled at this feeling before taking another huge bite of her burger between a gulp of Pepsi. Yoko grinned as she drove forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep eating, Asami, for you will need that energy later.

The bottom of Patricia's shirt rode up Asami's thick torso as a cute, creased bellybutton peeked out from under the fabric with a whole spare tire of flesh: As Yoko caught a glimpse of this, she began to wonder whether or not to weigh Asami before going to their neighbors' house. She wanted to know Asami's exact weight gain and possibly take a good note of how much Asami gained, and where.</span></div></div>",

She wondered if Asami knew she was trying to fatten her up. She tried to fool here. Asami might be very lazy but her brains were't lazy. She was pretty smart. That look gave her the idea she knew. Better don't do the weigh in. If she did that Asami would sooner suspect something was going on. If she did't knew it already. She could always weigh her tonight.<br>\r\nAsami fast wolfed down her food. She loved the taste but was 100% sure her mom was fattening her up. She suddenly thought about her conversation last time with Danny and Jamie. They said that you got fat from fast food. Well they had been right about that she thought while she patted her belly. Would the two still like her. She must admit Danny looked kind of handsome. She thought she also looked pretty nice. She was't really vain but hey just thinking you looked nice was't so bad was it? She hoped Danny still liked her. If not... then he was't worth her. She thought and swallowed the last crumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right we're at home sweetie. But first we need to change you. You look like you went swimming in your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami thought for a moment to have a swimming pool filled with food. How she would swim through it with her mouth wide open swallowing everything what came near her mouth. And what if she ate every single piece of food from the swimming pool. How fat would that make her?<br>\r\nYoko picked Asami up, who of course did't complain. However Yoko must admit that she slowly had trouble picking her fat daughter up, but also thought it was worth it. Perhaps she also needed to gain some weight. But in her case, weight gain in muscle. At least then she could still carry her daughter if she gained more.<br>\r\nAt Asami's room Yoko fast undressed Asami who calmly looked in front while Yoko dressed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you thinking about?\" Yoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing special. I have't seen Danny and Jamie for some time. Would they have changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so. Not in a few weeks. If you have't seen someone several months... or years then they look different. But you don't change so much in just a few weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But some people die there hair, or have plastic surgery, or take piercings, or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think Jamie and Danny would do that?\" Yoko asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know. Perhaps. I don't knew them that well. I only met them once.\" Asami mumbled while Yoko gave her another shirt that clearly showed a stroke of white flesh but Yoko thought it looked cute, and it was clean after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked at the shirt she got from Patricia. Looking at the size Patricia probably had been a fat girl herself but if even her clothes became a bit small that mend Asami was getting even fatter. She liked that thought while she picked Asami up and went to the neighbors. A few steps before the front door she put Asami down and rang the doorbell. They heard some notice and the the door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Yoko, and.... is that your daughter. She looks a bit... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah she has grown quite a bit. Can we come in. We thought it was nice to pay you a visit or is this a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no not at all. We were just were busy getting a pie out of the oven. Come inside.\" She said friendly. \"Asami I bet you like to see Jamie and Danny they're in the living room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami waddled to the living room. She saw Jamie playing with some dolls and Danny with some cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there!\" Asami yelled excited  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth kids looked up with a smile but stared in shock when the saw the obese girl walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking. It's me Asami. Remember?  We visit you about a month ago. Don't you know me any more?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Eh... of course we do.\"Jamie mumbled. \"It's just... you look... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different how?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... fatter.\" Jamie said while Danny seemed still in shock. \"How did that happened?\"   <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nAsami said....</span></div></div>",

Her thighs touched one another like a pair of stuffed chicken legs, and Asami's gorgeous girth appeared so... Soft. Jamie giggled as she and Danny watched Asami struggle to sit comfortably with a sizeable paunch spilling over her lap. \"Only she won't tell me. She doesn't mind that I am getting fat- actually, she might want me to get fat. I don't know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you stop her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami and Jamie turned to see a rather curious Danny who eyeballed Asami's exposed belly button. \"Just look at you, I mean... You are getting very fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the four eyes turned back to Asami, who subconsciously rubbed her gut with both hands as a deep rumble came from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to? All this delicious food and ice cream is great! I love to eat, and- actually...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami paused for a moment. Her double chin folded out for both Jamie and Danny to see, and Asami rolled up her shirt, showing that she was almost twice as wide before and already fattened enough to develop deep pockets of yellow flab. Jamie forced a smile while Danny remained dumbstruck by how much Asami \"grew.\"  As Asami let the roll of her shirt rest just under her chest, her fatty stature enveloped the waistband of her shorts as a massive muffin top spread out and hang a whole inch below her waistline. A big, golden Buddha-like Japanese girl who was on track to be twice her friends' weight appeared happy with how her fat leaked from the crevices of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami pinched one hanging fat roll between her thumb and index finger. It felt like an oozing blanket which sank between her fingers like a sandbag. From another standpoint, each roll was as meaty and well-nourished as another roll such that anyone who snuggled up to Asami could end up spending countless hours massaging, poking and stirring different layers of Asami's fat. She smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually...\"</span></div></div>",

But she looked forward to a big lunch. A chance to gain even more weight. She reached her arms out to her mother who picked her up and noticed how much more difficult it was. Asami was getting pretty heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was fun seeing you again. We should soon meet again.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami also yelled good bye and the two left leaving a very confused Danny who did't know what he thought or liked,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy my pants ripped.\" Asami said while they walked over to their house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I noticed sweet hart. Stupid me. I guess I washed them again too hot. Perhaps we need to go clothing shopping. Most of your clothes are pretty old anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami knew her mother was lying. Some of her clothes were brand new. But they did't fit her anymore. She was really turning into a butterball and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you giggling about?\" Yoko asked. \"It sounds like you're up to something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are we gonna get lunch?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Are you hungry again already?

Her mother changed Asami into a pair of shorter shorts which extended only a quarter-thigh after the woman reduced the pipe length. Best if Asami didn't split the seams of her pants, Yoko thought when she peeked through the kitchen to inspect Asami. If Asami already ripped through her week-old clothes at this rate, her nighties were probably useless. Useless, but then there was an opportunity to dress Asami in her new bikini at night to acclimate her to her thicker, prettier, fatter physique. Then, Asami could at least sleep on her bare belly and not have to worry about splitting any more seams, and Asami would just look so cute with her hanging pot belly jumping up and down when she ran! That is, if she could still run...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami herself seemed bored more or less with what shows were on. An empty chocolate shake carton sat on the coffee table before her with another empty burger box and a curled-up bag. Asami noticed just how much softter her chunky arms were and was now resting her head into them. She had never slept with a softer \"pillow\" in her life. When Yoko could not see, Asami smiled and patted her belly which peeked through a sliver of flesh beneath her overstretched shirt: In response, a dozen or so fat rolls bounded around for a second which tickled Asami. She could get used to being the town fattie. With so much \"free\" food coming in, and Asami not havig to share any of it, she couldn't complain everytime a new fat roll appeared to cushion her yellow flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on, honey,\" Yoko began from the dining room. \"I need to finish up some work within five minutes before we leave for Jack-in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ding, dong!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy! Someone is there!\" Asami's chubby cheeks jiggled when she cried. Yoko rolled her eyes playfully as she stood. \"I hear it, Asami. I am not old, yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rolled onto her belly as her fat spread to her sides, making her shirt ride up two inches to show the extend of her muffin top. She let it stay like that and even rolled it up another inch so Asami could feel her belly get tickled by the fuzzy couch padding. At the same time, anyone walking in through the front door wouldn't be able to not notice an overweight little girl playing with her beloved paunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yoko opened the door, she saw a smiling Patricia with...</span></div></div>",

That, or I can make some,\" Patricia laughed quietly. \"It's easy to make! All you need is lots of sugar, milk and vanilla inside a bag surrounded by ice, and your little one will be all over the stuff when it is ready to eat! Also, be sure to feed her lots and lots of chocolates: She will get even rounder and cuter for you and make her crave more sweets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Patricia.

It was becoming ever so difficult to finish the meal, but Asami was determined to eat every last fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I want to get much, much cuter,\"</i> thought Asami when she pushed her free left hand into her stomach such that neither adult could see her explore her fat.

But her belly protested. It stabbed her with sharp pains every time she took a bite, so she did the smart thing and stopped. There were still plenty of fries left to eat, and she could tackle the leftover's later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami laid back and hiccuped. The adults noticed while she drummed her fingers on her belly. Asami basked in the feeling of satiation. In her mind it was worth the journey to this lazy, stuffed feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Full?\" asked Yoko. This would be the first time in recent memory that her daughter didn't finish a meal, but she wanted to be supportive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami could only manage a groan, and began to dose off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think someone needs a nap. Excuse me Patty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike usual, where Asami could cooperate with her mother in order to be carried, this time she was dead weight. Asami's ponderous bulk wouldn't allow mommy to budge her daughter from her place. She was again surprised, because Yoko had spent all this time unaware of the leverage her daughter was giving her. She briefly panicked, remembering her fear about not being able to do this one day, when her strength would not be enough. If that moment wasn't now, it was soon, unless Yoko did something about it. Yoko thought about doing housework around the house while carrying her daughter to muscle up to the challenge. It might be fun for Asami to help do stuff, too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for try number two. Yoko wrapped the girls arms carefully around her neck, squatted, and prepared to do a proper lift from the knees up. Yoko reflexively let out a groan as she taxed her arms and hips: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>EEEEIII</b>UUuungh</i>... Phew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She stood proudly, hefting the child in her arms to ensure her grip. She felt her daughter's immense belly pushing rhythmically against her torso with each drawn out breath. It was a pleasant, soft feeling from cuddling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounded difficult,\" Patricia commented warmly. \"You ought to weigh that child soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be difficult now, but the reward is great. Truthfully, I've been debating the scale issue,\" she said. \"A number to go along with this heavy feeling would be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone needs a starting point in order to track growth,\" Patty replied simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs in her bed for a nap, Asami laid asleep. Yoko poked her daughter's belly just to watch her squirm. Her tummy was as tight as a drum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, was Yoko ever lucky that her girl hadn't heard her struggle. Asami would tease her mommy to no end about that, she thought. And the charade would be over for sure. Although, maybe it was time for this to end. It was getting hard to believe that the toddler didn't know about things by now. She gave plenty of hints. She definitely reacted very enthusiastically to food.

Gently, she rolled up the sides of Asami's shirts some three inches to let her fatty body spill onto the bed. Truth be told, Yoko felt impatient with how slowly it took for Asami's belly to permanently Hang out of her shirts; in a matter of months, Yoko hoped, Asami would be well in the triple digits with so much fat pushing aside shirts that Asami would show her gorgeous beautiful stomach to everyone as a source of pride for the perfectly-fed girl. Yoko needed to act swiftly to start Asami's snacking routines, and thus left the woman as she ran to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami slowly rolled onto her stomach and moaned in quiet pleasure as her fat seeped out like a squishy mattress: She hadn't felt so SOFT before like a cuddly pillow in her life!

Inside, her body was converting the day's meal with amazing efficiency into great soft, warm pockets of fat which spread throughout her body, but more so to her cute tummy and chubby thighs which provided warmth by blanketing her big bones. If Asami ever became too hot in the Summer months, she could just get addicted to fattening ice cream which would both cool her and add to the blubbery, jiggling, waddling butterball just wanting to be super fat and happy. This was everyone's last chance to make Asami a skinny girl, but now Asami's weight gain would seem to accelerate in a blissful cycle of eating, sedentary play and napping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami...</span></div></div>",

It smelt delicious anyway. Asami belly rumbled and she really did want a bite to eat. But she hated to get out of bed. Asami was't active and hated moving and that was even worse after she just woke up. She rolled out of bed much like a beached whale and slowly waddled downstairs wising her mommy would build her room on the first floor. The delicious scent of snacks took her straight to the kitchen were her mother and Patricia were busy talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See. You can make it just a bit more delicious with the right spice. Why make something good when you can make something fantastic and it is't that hard.\" Patricia told her mother and suddenly saw Asami. \"Oh hello sleepyhead. You fell asleep so we took you to your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would still like it if my bedroom was on the first floor.\" Asami whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry honey but we don't have any more rooms left on the first floor. Your father decided to give you a room at the second floor. Not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can't you at least build a elevator?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry honey but we don't have the money for that. This house and garden cost a lot of money. Say are't you hungry? While you were asleep Patricia was so nice to make a delicious meal for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatricia walked too the kitchen and returned with a big plate of fries, burgers and chicken nuggets. Asami's mouth started to water. She need to eat all of this. It smelled so delicious, so good that it would a shame to leave anything. She would eat anything to the last crumb. It tasted to good to not eat it all. She grabbed the fries and dipped them in mayonnaise and ketchup and stuffed them in her mouth. Yoko enjoyed seeing Asami eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wondering when are you gonna make that swimming pool ready?\" Patricia suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko got distracted from Asami's eating and even Asami stopped chewing for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which swimming pool?\" Yoko asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one after your house. Did't you know there was one. I mean it's a pretty big one. You did see this house and garden before you bought it right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my husband did.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo be totally honest she did't went into the garden that much,  and Asami rather stayed inside on her fat but in front of the T.V or something else that did't cost any energy. Of course in the first weeks they were busy unpacking. Now she thought of it her husband kind of tried to not let her go into the garden too much. Since she was busy unpacking  and Asami's gaining she did't really thought much of it. But did't he knew about that swimming pool? Then it hit her. He did't told her because it was a surprise for her for when it was summer. The swimming pool was surrounded by a hedge with one gate so you could't really see it so that was why she did't notice it. Since no one told her there was one she did't really looked for one. And she was't really a woman that liked to work in the garden. But a swimming pool sounded great. Especially since with a swimming pool Asami would wear her bikini a lot with all of her fat spilling out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a swimming pool?\" Asami asked slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OMG did't you know that. Come on I show you were it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami fast grabbed a burger to eat while she followed Patricia into the garden to a corner and then patricia opened a gate in the hedge to a swimming pool. A pretty big one too. It was covered with a plastic blanket and she also saw a few jerrycans with chlorine. Asami looked also interested. She could swim. Her mother put her on swimming lessons last year. To be honest swimming was the only kind of exercise she did like. since she could float in the water without using any muscle and it did make her body less heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It needs to be cleaned of course. But I can help you with that if you want. In a few weeks it will be summer and when it's hot it's nice to cool of in a swimming pool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami nodded excited an took another big bite from her burger.</span></div></div>",

Asami started on her second burger and worked her way into the ketchup-slathered stack of lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions. Yoko and Patricia smiled when, after returning from the back, they saw Asami lick her pudgy fingers before starting on several fistfuls of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko, I brought two gallon-tubs of chocolate fudge ice cream she will like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko nodded while watching Asami's pillowy arms move. \"Good.

Nor did she care. The last burger bite sat on the platter, with a stuffed Asami gearing up to finish it off. Sauces were smeared across Asami's face with great abundance. Asami's shirt was once more rolled up to the top which revealed curvy rolls of blubber hanging over her waistline. Without any effort on her part, Asami lunged a fatty arm towards the burger segment and stuffed her face with the delicious combination of fattening stuff yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Burp!</b> I am finished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami licked her fingers greedily before letting them rest between two fat rolls: For the first time, Asami felt surprised at the <i>absence</i> of pain! Though full, Asami knew one thing with quiet excitement: She could eat more, meaning her stomach was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko and Patricia grinned at the sight of the adorable fatty before Yoko reached out to pick up Asami. Asami wrapped her pillow arms around Yoko's neck before Yoko turned to Patricia. \"This little one needs a cleanup. Plus, I found a solution to our problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami did not let it show, but fear crept into her mind: What was the 'problem' here? Did Yoko think Asami was too fat? Asami felt her belly rest against Yoko's slender form as she thought along. Asami wanted to get rounder, softer and cuter- not skinny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, before Asami woke up on her accord, Yoko had made sure to move the scale before the bathroom counter and had weighed herself out to what she'd expect before. <i>Now to hold Asami while cleaning her up will be a challenge</i>, Yoko thought as the two turned into the bathroom. Holding Asami, Yoko needed to weigh their combined weights in a subtle manner while cleaning Asami innocuously like usual.</span></div></div>",

You have a healthy appetite. Healthy. You know it would't hurt you too eat a bit more. After all you're a growing girl. Growing girls need a lot of food. A lot of people grow into their weight so don't have to worry about anything.\" Yoko said. \"You should't be so worried about your weight. You're just five. I know a lot of teenagers are worried about their figure but you're way too young to worry about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rolled with her eyes. She knew her mother was lying. How old did she think her daughter was. Three? Why did't she just told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko filled the bath tub with water and made sure there was a lot of foam just like Asami liked it. She thought it was funny to make a foam beard and/or hair from foam. Asami smiled when she saw all the foam. She liked it to go in the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko was thinking what to do. How was she able to read their combined weight without Asami noticed it. <br>\r\nAsami in the meantime undressed and Yoko got a good view at how fat her daughter was. Beautiful love handles and fat folds. Yoko thought she looked beautiful. Like a princess. Just a princess in those stories Asami liked. Yoko many times also told her stories she made up. She had a lot of imagination. Asami always got lost in her stories. Then she knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asami let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, long, long ago, in a land far, far away from here, lived a princess. She was a young precious little girl. Beautiful, cute and fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat?\" Asami asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe never remembered a single story about a fat princess. Normally it were always tooth pick girls with a waist of a insect. Asami must say she liked this story about a princess much more. It was't for Yoko hard to describe the little princess. She only needed to look at her daughter. Asami was so lost in the story she did't notice that after her mother picked her up looked at the number of the scale and put her in the bathtub, very happy with the result. She washed her daughter wile going on with the story and how it ended with marrying a nice prince who loved a fat princess and how she lived fat and happily ever after.<br>\r\nAsami smiled. She liked this story of her mother way more then any other story she ever heard. Partly because it reminded her a bit about herself. Also that a fat girl was beautiful and cute just like that princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko smiled now knowing how fat Asami was. <br>\r\nThen she picked Asami out of the bathtub, rubbed her dry, dressed her in her pajamas that looked a bit tight already, and after she brushed her teeth she went straight to bed since she was pretty tired.<br>\r\nAsami was asleep in a few minutes and Yoko fast ran downstairs to tell Patricia the good news<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her belly must have grown in her sleep. She took a deep breath while poking underneath her extensive muffin top. She heard stitches creaking. <i>I feel hungry...</i> So she called for her mommy, and Yoko came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey exchanged <i>good morning</i>'s. Asami was about to tell her mom that her clothes felt tight, when she was pre-empted by a deep roar from her cavernous stomach. The dutiful mother lugged her downstairs for breakfast. Waiting for her was a country style feast, full of Western foods: a big omelet, a heap of hashed potatoes, bacon, sausage, and some toast. To drink, she would have heavy cream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy little girl dutifully slaughtered the omelet and its friends. And it was oddly too easy. The omelet took up a whole plate, and yet with the last bite, she felt very unsatisfied; the food tasted delish, but it wasn't filling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today Asami, I want you to do chores with me; I'll carry you around and you can help mommy.\" She would need to do vacuuming, dishes and laundry at least. Asami would be most helpful in hanging the laundry and folding.\"Then after that, you'll play with friends.\" All together, the day sounded exciting, and Asami excitedly talked with her mom while she ate. She was a polite girl in conversation, so she minded her manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami ate, and ate, striving to feel sated. Reach for the bacon--munch, munch, much--feel that tee shirt stretch and climb up her gut. As Asami leaned forward to reach for her milk, the furthest thing away, the room filled with a most delightful tear. The seam that sewed Asami's sweatpants had burst. Her waist bulged out of the hole. Her waistband, still in one piece, but useless, created bulges where it lay. Asami drank the milk in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko sat there, rather stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami felt like she just ate a light snack, and really needed something to put a dent in her stomach.

Yoko looked at her daughter and thought she looked kind of adorable her cheeks stuffed with ice cream. But doing chores with her did't really worked. She was about as helpful as a bag of flour. She was just too lazy to really do anything. Not that Yoko did't really saw that coming. Asami never really liked anything where you needed to move. At the other hand if she did't moved she would gain faster.

I mean you're only five years old after all. You still have a whole life ahead of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko did worried a bit. How would she be able too carry that fat daughter of her around if she got too heavy. Especially since the fact she was very lazy and did't liked too walk and rather got carried. It took a long time before Asami started crawling and walking while most other kids of her age already could walk. Even back then she was lazy. Perhaps she would have been able to walk but she was too lazy to put enough effort in it. If she went to the gym she could get some muscles. But going to the gym was hard with all the things she needed to do. Especially since her husband was still in the hospital and somebody needed to watch Asami. She knew Patricia would wanted to do that without a problem but asking her to watch Asami so she could go to the gym. That felt a bit like using her. <br>\r\nShe looked at her watch. She still had some time before lunch. What could she do till then? Suddenly she got a idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Asami. Let's go look at our swimming pool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" She mumbled not really sounded excited while she must admit she liked swimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them walked too the swimming pool. There was a lot of stuff in the water. She needed to get most of that out first, then put a lot of chlorine in it and the she would be probably be able to swim in it. She started to get the stuff out while Asami went lying in the sun. Yoko looked smiling at her young butterball. She looked at the jerrycans of chlorine and remembered herself to make sure that Asami would't come near them. That stuff was very dangerous if it came in contact with the human skin.<br>\r\nIt was hard work. cleaning the swimming pool but Yoko knew Asami would have fun in it. She would't be the only one. She would also like it to see her fat daughter in bikini with all her love handles and besides that she also liked swimming. This also was a good workout. This way she might get the muscles to carry her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah cleaning the pool I see.\" A voice suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked up and smiled when she saw it was Patricia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Yeah I was cleaning the swimming pool.\" Yoko said and bend a bit closer to her and whispered. \"Also trying to get some muscle. I hardly can carry her anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm You know I have some weights at home. Perhaps you can use those to grow some muscle. They were from my niece. But she left them about five years ago and never asked for them so I don't think she will miss them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that would be nice, and if you niece does ask about them you can have them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think she needs them back. That training with weights was more a phase. She grew out of that. Talking about growing girls how is Asami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko looked at Asami and noticed her soft breathing. She fell asleep.\"Then she looked at her watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's almost time for lunch. would you mind stay here to keep a eye on her while I go get some food for her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I would love that. Take your time.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko fast went in her car and drove to: Jack in the box.         <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Certainly, in another hour or so, the water would be finished with distributing the chlorine and Asami would dress up in one of her revealing, adorable bikinis which would give her bare belly room to bounce around and show off every bulging fat roll worth a tickling or caress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami, meanwhile, continued to sleep in the pool area in her torn pajamas when her mom walked in with the Jack-in-the-Box delivery. Patricia smiled as she shot a glance towards Asami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's been sleeping since you've left\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Sweetie, food's here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's eyes opened as the alluring aroma entered her nostrils once more. Sitting upright, Asami was about to open her mouth when a smaller tear erupted along the back of her PJ's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you should buy some more swimwear for her to sleep in. Wouldn't hurt to even let her waddle around bare-bellied since she would look so cute,\" Patricia whispered to Yoko, who smiled for an instant after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... Sweetie, finish your lunch here: It's your favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Asami squealed as she thrust up her pudgy arms to take the bags before the first carton of fries was opened. Drenched in ketchup, Asami's fries soon spread the ketchup to her face as she shoved fistfuls of fries at a time into her maw. Once those were finished, Asami began to chow down on her juicy burgers which continued to saturate her stomach with delicious, fattening calories that would soon widen her curvy hips, chest and thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank- BUUURRRP! - you, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko and Patricia just smiled at Asami and to each other as the two women watched the adorable butterball continue to grow thicker, softer and cherubic.</span></div></div>",

Apart from Patricia, Danny, Jamie and their mother she did't met any other neighbor. Perhaps she did't put much effort in it but neither did they.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm done mommy.\" Asami said and let out another belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl honey. Say I'm almost done with the swimming pool. So what do you say I help you get bikini on and then in a few minutes you can swim.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami must admit that it was pretty warm. Warm enough to just wear you bikini. Perhaps she would swim. If the water was warm enough. So she smiled and nodded. <br>\r\nYoko took her daughter by the hand inside. When they reached the stairs Asami stopped and reached her hands out to her mother to show she wanted to be carried like normally. Yoko gathered all her strength and picked her fat daughter up. She hoped Patricia could get those weights for her. Just a few more pounds would be too much for her to carry. But she could't tell that too Asami. Upstairs she put the lazy girl down who walked straight to her room.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Mommy can I wear this one? Can I?\" She asked holding the glittered bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Yoko thought that it perhaps still was a bit big for her. So she slowly shook her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now honey I think you can better put on those other ones. That purple one. It looks so cute on you. Patricia would like it to see that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami could't think of any reason why Patricia would rather see her in her purple bikini then the other one but she decided that it was better not to argue with her mom. Since they had a swimming pool in their backyard she would get more then enough chances to wear her other bikini. She took the purple striped bikini.<br>\r\n While she put it on Yoko noticed that it was kind of tight. Could Asami really have gained so much in such a short time. Or did she read the size wrong?<br>\r\nWhen she finally put on her bikini Yoko suddenly saw that Asami's fat belly covered her briefs. If you did't knew she wore a bikini you could think she was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a bit tight mommy.\" Asami said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah I can see that without a doubt. Yoko thought but did't say it. She still did't want to let Asami know that she was fattening her up. So she walked over to her daughter and softly stroke her over the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it looks good. It's perfect for you.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rolled with her eyes. There must be a moment her mother must admit she was fat. But when would that moment be. Perhaps something must happen. Like getting too fat for the door. But she realized that might take a while. several years before she would get that fat. But perhaps getting stuck in a slide or break something by sitting on it would help. But she would think about that later and waddled behind Yoko who of course need to carry her downstairs again.<br>\r\nWhen Asami came down she did't saw Patricia. Asami knew her mother said that the swimming pool was almost ready. So she laid on her back in the grass and fell asleep while Yoko continued cleaning the swimming pool. Suddenly Patricia came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I left so suddenly but I thought when you were busy I could take those.\" Patricia said and gave her two weights who were pretty heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... thanks. With those I can really train.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"You're welcome. Oh Asami looks so cute and fat in her bikini.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think I can wake her up now. The swimming pool is ready.\" Yoko said. </span></div></div>",

Yoko struggled for a second before Asami wrapped her own arms around Yoko's neck and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You are welcome, my fat round princess,</i> Yoko wanted to say, but thought the better of it to just carry the yellow butterball over to the pool. \"You are very beautiful, Asami. Perhaps the most beautiful,\" Yoko laughed with Asami as she let several of her fingers massage Asami's fat rolls. The obese girl was easily outgrowig her bikini not only towards the bottom, but also at the top: Yoko let her eyes wander to Asami's overstretched top and saw that some of Asami's weight was collecting on her chest. This made her smile as she stopped at the pool edge. Asami held on tight as she pet her mom lower her into the pool; the moment her first inch of hanging fat hit the water, Asami felt ecstatic as Yoko dropped her in.<br>\r\n Yoko watched as Asami floated in the water, with her fat sloshing around so adorably as the well-insulated Japanese girl embraced the cool waters.<br>\r\n \"I like it!\" Asami shrieked as she floated on her back: What would have felt like freezing water to a normal-sixed girl her age was comfortable as her fat provided heat, comfort and volume. Asami's round arms jiggled like the rest of her beautiful girth as they treaded water.<br>\r\n \"Asami, Patricia will bring lots of fries and another tub of icecream to snack on while you are in here,\" Yoko noted while she watched her gorgeous fatty rest along the edge. Asami's bulging cheeks creased up as she smiled back.<br>\r\n\"Okay, mommy-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for the wait, Yoko. I decided to mix in something extra to Asami's ice cream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko and Asami looked to Patricia, who stood with a platter of fries surrounding an ice cream pot in the center. Asami licked her lips as she imagined the fries shouting \"You can't eat us!\" just an arm's length away.</span></div></div>",

I'm so worried about those young girls who suffer from anorexia because they think they need to be thin like those super models. But you're a healthy girl.\" Patricia said like a grand mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami swam to the stair in the water. This way she could sit on a step in the water and easily eat her food. She looked with sparkling eyes at the food and licked her lips. Patricia put the plate down right next to the stairs and without saying thank you Asami started to demolish the fries like a starved animal. Soon her face was covered with the food While she happily was eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feed her?\" Patricia asked. \"She eats like she's almost starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me I feed her enough... but... now I'm thinking of it... I never increased her portions... and if her tummy did grow bigger then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start over again since I'm not really following you.\" Patricia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when I start fattening her up I gave her bigger portions.

I guess her tummy stretched too so it can hold more food but I did't thought of that. Silly me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven while Yoko and Patricia whispered with each other Asami heard every word they say. Why keep it a secret? That was the big question that was going through her head. She liked being fat so much that the thought of that her mother did't tell because there was a chance  she did't like it did't came up in her little head. <br>\r\nShe wolfed down the last of her food and continued floating. Liking the view of her big belly that rose up out of the water like a island. She loved it. She liked it most when it was soft and squishy. Point was on those times she was hungry and Yoko did't gave her much time to be hungry. But at the other hand she also did't liked being hungry.   <br>\r\nAsami floated around for some time but finally the low temperature of the water started to catch up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I'm done swimming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wait for a second pumpkin. I get a towel for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a pumpkin. Asami thought. I have perhaps a pumpkin sized belly. She rubbed her belly liking how big it was. She enjoyed her fatness. <br>\r\nPatricia looked at it and smiled. Asami was turning into such a adorable fat girl, and she was still gaining.<br>\r\nYoko returned with a towel and lifted her butterball daughter out of the pool hoping that she did't notice how hard it was for her. She really need to work out soon. She rubbed Asami dry and cuddled her a bit and rubbing her belly a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Literally hundreds of calories per minute entered Asami's system as the Japanese girl stuffed her face with chocolate. Streaks of ice cream spread across Asami's bikini top, but that was the last of both women's worries: It was time to see if Asami could finish the entire table's worth of six ice cream tubs, four 2-liter Delaware Punch bottles, sixteen chocolate chip cookies and countless amounts of fries layered on a platter.</span></div></div>",

But hey I can try.\" Asami said to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed the first tub of ice cream and started to stuff it in her mouth. Yoko looked at her little girl. Finally. This was what she always wanted. A fat daughter. It took a long time but she finally had what she wanted. Ever since she was a little kid she always wanted to have her own fat little girl. She always hated those barbie girls. They were way too skinny. When she heard she was pregnant she was so happy and even more when she heard it was a daughter. A daughter she could fatten up to her own desire. Especially with her husband still in coma, and  a friend like Patricia who helped her, and a daughter with a huge appetite and a taste for Jack in the box and Mc Donalds.<br>\r\nThis did make Yoko think again. Asami did seem to notice her gain but did't worry about it. She seemed to be fine with the gaining weight. She wish she could see what she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami already ate two ice cream tubs, half of the chocolate cookies and was now busy at the fries while she watched T.V. She liked Manga's. Yoko was sometimes a bit  worried about that since she knew there were manga's with hard violence in them or porn but she knew that this on was suitable for children, and she knew Asami liked them so much. She sighed softly while Asami belched loudly and started on another tub of ice cream while taking sips of the Delaware punch. Already her second bottle.<br>\r\nAsami worked her way through every single fry, licked the ice cream tubs totally clean and after she wolfed down the last chocolate chip cookies she finished three of the four bottles. She took the last bottle and started drinking. Yoko could't believe how much food fit in her little daughters belly. She drank half of the bottle. She took the bottle between both hand and started drinking again. Slowly the bottle went emptier and her belly fuller. Wit a last sip the bottle was empty. Asami belched long and loud and tossed away the empty bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe she was able to eat it all.\" Yoko said.and walked over to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I'm a bit tired.\" Asami mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I gotta clean you up first.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took Asami upstairs what was very hard. She hoped Asami did't noticed that she needed three tries before she was able to lift her. She took of her bikini and cleaned her with a face cloth and got a good view at her daughters huge belly that was as hard as a bag of wet cement. Yoko wondered if Asami pajama's fit now she was so bloated from all the food and then she thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asami why don't you sleep in you other bikini. Then you don't have to chance when you wake up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami cheered when she waddled to her bedroom. She fast put on her glitter bikini that by now fitted nice around her body. After that she crawled in bed.. Yoko tucked her in and kissed her good night and went downstairs.      </span></div></div>",

Asami knew that to get fat you need to eat and the more you eat, the more you gain. Besides this tasted way to good.<br>\r\nYoko smiled seeing how Asami wolfed down all the eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nine entire plates.\" Yoko mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one stopped her from fattening her toddler up. A moment she thought about her husband. He did't knew about her desire to fatten their daughter up. Sure she loved him but that was one thing she did't told him. She thought it was terrible what happened to him  but at the same time it was easier this way to fatten Asami up. He wanted to take her to the doctor and she knew for sure that Asami was to heavy for a healthy weight. Then she needed to let her daughter lose weight while she just wanted to do the opposite. Now she could do that without a problem. With the help of Patricia of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! It all tastes great mommy.\" Asami said with a wide grin, and Yoko could see pieces of eggs between her teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it sweet hart. You need to eat enough to become big and strong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami and her mother both added: \"Fat\" to this without telling the other.<br>\r\nAsami licked her last plate clean and emptied her fifth two liter  bottle of chocolate milk in her mouth. and tossed it aside. She belched loud and looked at her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy... can I eat the ice cream in front of the T.V?\" Asami asked on her sweetest tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can honey.\" Yoko said with a smile. \"But also drink that last bottle, and please be careful. Those chocolate stains are almost impossible to get out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay mommy. I will be careful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped on the couch and flicked through some channels until she found some nice cartoons. The she stuck her spoon deep in the bowl of ice cream and stuffed it in her tiny mouth. She fast wolfed down the ice cream taking big sips of chocolate milk between.<br>\r\nFinally she put the empty bowl on the coffee table and tossed the empty bottle aside and opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!! That tasted great mommy.\" Asami said and rubbed her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was kind of hard but she knew she could still eat more but she decided not to tell her mother. But then she saw her mother moving from out a corner of her eye and saw she put several delicious and fattening snacks on the table.<br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

Yoko sat down by Asami and pinched one of her fat rolls between her thumb and fingers: It felt so milky and soft since Asami was still in her bikini, and this made Yoko wrap her right arm behind Asami's blubbery back as it sank into the plumper's sea of fat. Asami noticed this, and, with great difficulty since she was getting so fat, scooted in towards Yoko until she felt snuggled by Yoko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does someone want to watch a movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Asami smiled as she stuffed some more chocolate into her mouth. Yoko felt proud as she fired up the DVR with a remote: Asami was fat enough to resemble a baby, and it seemed she outgrew her other clothes too as her chest, thighs and belly expanded. Asami was going to need a week's worth of bikinis if Yoko did not want to waste any more money on torn \"regular\" clothes, although it would be useful to buy Asami something to wear in public. Preferably something which still let Asami show her belly proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami, too, was aware of her gain and let Yoko's fnigers caress her stomach rolls: She liked feeling so soft and cute, and Asami wondered with her two friends would still recognized her when she got stuck in a water park slide. If they didn't... She was worth another group's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe obese girl took another bag of chips from the table, tore them open, and stuffed handfuls of the salty treats into her chocolate-stained mouth. Her belly easily covered the front side of her bikini as it rested between her thighs, and soon crumbs began to get stuck within Asami's folds as she continued to eat chips while Yoko loaded a movie into the DVR's memory. It felt great to eat and have her mother tickle her newfound fat rolls, since Asami could hardly shift around anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko thought about her husband again. He was going to be super upset if he saw a bouncing, jiggling mass of flesh that was his daughter. Unless... If Yoko fattened Asami up to the point where weight loss was impossible! Then he would have no choice but to accept his excited, blubbery daughter into his arms. Maybe he would even admit to Asami's cuteness, however remote that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe movie started as woman and child snuggled closer to feel each other's company.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Asami liked Disney movies and if Yoko needed to tell the truth she liked them too. Some old Disney movies like Cinderella or Snow White were made for little kids, but some other like Jungle book, Lion King or Finding Nemo, young kids but also adults enjoyed those movies. Not that she really mind now. With feeling how fat her daughter was she was very happy and enjoyed it more then a movie no matter which one.<br>\r\nYoko was't the only one. Also Asami enjoyed how her mother explored and tickled her new love handles, but at the same time she also enjoyed watching the movie.<br>\r\nAsami emptied the bag of chips in her mouth and chewed loudly before swallowing it and dropped the empty bag.<br>\r\nWhen Yoko saw this she got up to get some more snacks. Asami saw her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's really trying to fatten me up. Why else would she feed me so much snacks. But why?\" Asami whispered to herself and continued watching T.V.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko returned with some snacks and Asami grabbed a box of cookies. She liked it to munch on something while watching T.V.<br>\r\nYoko knew very well many parents wanted their children to be slender and thin however many did't succeed in that. At least not in America. There childhood obesity was a growing problem. She did't understand why people did't saw how adorable those children looked. Here in Japan people at least saw what beauty was. They had sumo wrestlers. They were big and fat and people adored them and they had millions of fans and many woman waned to marry them. It used to be a sport for men but lately still more girls also wanted to become sumo wrestlers. Enough woman wanted to marry a man because he was a sumo wrestler so why would't it work the other way around.<br>\r\nBut she did't want Asami to become a sumo wrestler. Besides Asami was way too lazy to put any effort in any kind of sport or exercise. Sure she would like the eating part of sumo wrestlers but that would be all.<br>\r\nShe tried to image how fat Asami could become. So fat she could become immobile. Yoko realized that Asami would't mind becoming immobile. She hated moving. So if she could't move... she would't mind it. Probably even like it. This way she had a good excuse not too move.  <br>\r\nAsami dropped the empty box of cookies and started too munch on some Twinkies and looked a moment at all the snacks at table. would she be able to eat all that? She still had some room in her tummy but was it enough? She could try of course. By the way... this was't breakfast lunch or dinner but just some snacks between. She did't need to eat them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to buy some new clothes. Most don't fit you anymore. Guess you eh... I washed them... too hot. That's it. Stupid me. They must have shrunk. That's too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure it's because they shrunk in the wash?\" Asami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course sweet hart. What else could it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm-hmm.\" Asami mumbled and stuffed another Twinkie in her mouth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that Asami focused on the movie. Yoko too but still  softly pinched and tickled Asami's fat. Asami slowly ate but at one moment she suddenly realized that she had eaten every snack until the last one. Then she noticed how swollen her tummy was. Full on snacks. The movie was about halfway done. She decided no to tell her mother. After all after the movie it would soon be time for lunch.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Her body jiggled when Yoko tried to lift Asami by her under arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. You are a growing girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No. I am just very fat,</i> Asami wanted to say, but thought against it. Why complain if she enjoyed her mommy tickling, folding, and massaging every fold of fat on her own adorable body? Asami let her mother carry her into the master bedroom, where Yoko searched her dressers for something Asami could wear over her bikini. As much Yoko loved feeling and playing with Asami's bulging fat rolls, she knew that the store required a shirt, shorts and shoes for service. The time would come later when Asami became truly too fat for even the largest retail shirts. Yoko would feel very proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami, meanwhile, sat on Yoko's bed squeezing, pulling, and slapping her own abundance of fat rolls. She liked the feeling of her body jiggling in response. She wanted to get much, much fatter so she could eat as much of the tasty treats without getting stuffed. Besides, her mommy would always be around to carry her to and from the pool, kitchen, and wherever else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try these,\" Yoko began before she slipped the large hole of a tube top through Asami's head. The turquoise fabric matched nicely with Asami's underlying bikini top as it, too, showed most of Asami's great rolls that would bounce violently with each waddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's tight, mommy,\" Asami complained, but her mother just smiled at her, pinching her daughter's chubby cheeks in pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fine, dear! It looks cute on you, but we need more clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do look cute...\" Asami muttered out of earshot as she patted her belly. She intended to get much, much fatter. Fat enough to stay home and watch TV all day while enjoying sugary, fattening snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami's mother managed to squeeze a pair of denim shorts around the little girl's bikini bottom, but her muffin top was such that it completely covered the button. Furthermore, the pipes constricted the fat Japanese girl's thighs and threatened to tear at the seam... But this was necessary, thought Yoko as they both entered the car and pulled out of the driveway.</span></div></div>",

A day, a week, a month, a year, a century, a millennium. But like I told you I washed your clothes too hot so most got too small so I need to buy some new ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami rolled with her eyes. How long would her mother keep acting like if she was too stupid too notice how fat she was. She looked at her mother and thought what could be the reason. She liked being fat so what was wrong with it. She had't told that to her mother but that that could have anything to do with it did't came up in the young girls head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain they went to the store for big sizes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Asami. On your feet.\" Yoko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry me mommy.\" Asami said while she stretched out her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on I don't have time for this.\" Yoko said while she pulled Asami out of the car and put her on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne reason Yoko had why she did't want too carry her was not to show how much trouble she had carrying her.  Asami was getting very heavy and Yoko was getting pain in her back from lifting her. She really need to train. Yoko hold Asami tight by her wrist and dragged her inside the store. Straight to a clerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me were can I find clothes for my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I need to measure her first.\" He said friendly and wrapped a measure tape around Asami's belly thighs and finally said: \"Third floor miss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko was glad they had a elevator in the store. Asami was struggling a bit since she wanted to be carried. Yoko was glad that on third floor she could finally put her down next to a T.V screen with a movie for kids that was placed there so kids could watch something while their parents looked for clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stay here. I look for some clothes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right mommy.\" Said Asami with her eyes glued to the T.V screen.\"But mommy... after we're done shopping, can we go to Jack in the box? I'm getting kind of hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoko smiled widely.\" Sure we can.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she looked for some nice clothes but most important clothes that were elastic so they would hold for some time since Asami was gaining and getting bigger very fast. Yoko liked that very much but it was hard if she need to buy clothes every few days. She decided to buy some clothes on or two sizes bigger. They would be a bit loose first but would soon fit her nicely. She also needed to buy some pajamas or perhaps a nightie for Asami. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Or at least I did't tell her. Perhaps she suspect something... But I don't know. I would't mind telling her but perhaps if she finds out she does't want to become fat. So I keep it a secret and keep telling her she is't getting fat. But it seems like she does't believe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Miyuki said. \"Yumiko knows she's fat. I hope she starts liking it. That would make things much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime Asami and Yumiko also started talking with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Asami said with a grin. \"I'm Asami. What's your name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I'm Yukimo. Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you're fat Yumiko.\" Asami said with a happy smile but stopped smiling when she saw how sad her new friend looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm fat? I don't....\" Yumiko said with tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I think it looks good You look fantastic. Look I'm also fat, and I like being fat. What can be wrong about something so soft and squishy? I think it's great to be fat. Why would't it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimo fast wiped her tears away and started thinking. Perhaps this girl was right. If she really liked how fat she was the calling her fat was a compliment and not a insult. Did she hated being fat. What she did't liked was the teasing. There was further noting wrong with being fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the bad thing is that kids teasing you with it.\" Yukimo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\" But now what if you like being fat. Then if they call you fat you can see it as a compliment. Besides you like eating right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah. I like eating. I like it to eat a lot... but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like soft things?  Like your belly?  A fat belly is soft. You like playing? A huge belly is fun to play with. You don't like it too worry about your eating. If you like to get fat you don't care what you eat as long if it is a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimo did't knew what to think. That all made sense. She grabbed her belly left and right and shook it and watched it jiggle and smiled. It really was a great toy. You also did't had the trouble of losing it like some other toys. She liked eating and if you did't have to care what you ate it was easier. It also did feel so soft. So soft that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asami... Do you mind if I put my head on you belly for a second?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead.\" Asami said with a smile and lifted her shirt.            <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYukimo slowly put her head on Asami's belly and smiled. It felt like a delicious soft pillow to sleep on. After a minute she went sitting up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That felt fantastic. I think I like being fat. Sure why not. I like eating without caring what it is, I like soft things and I like playing with it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls started to giggle and were still giggling when their mother's returned.   </span></div></div>",

Eating a ice cream too fast, and\u2026 Oh men that hurt.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAsami started to slow down eating her ice cream. She did't want to be in pain.

Not stupid. Since we moved you're fattening me up. Before, whenever we went too Mc Donalds I just got a happy meal. But now you buy several burgers with fries, chicken mc nuggets and milkshakes. Did you think I did't know how much you bought? I can count mommy. You feed me enough for several adults. Mc Donalds, Jack in the box, burger King. Those at not known to have healthy meals.\" Asami went standing on her bench, and grabbed her belly left and right and shook it. \"I did't had this before. But from all the food you gave me I became fat. Not only you, Patricia helped you obvious. She wants to fatten me up just as much if you. But you keep telling me I'm not fat. Well I am fat! I know that! You must be blind not to  see that. I love being fat. It's cool, it's fantastic. I would like it to become fatter. But why are you keeping it a secret from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko did't knew what to say until she suddenly realized what Asami just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You\u2026 you like being fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah duh. Of course I do. Why would't I? I can eat lots of tasty foods and being fat feels great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko hugged Asami tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true I did try to fatten you up. I always wanted you to be fat. And yes Patricia did help. You were right about that too. But I was scared that if you realized you got fat you did't liked it a would try to lose weight. So that's why I kept it a secret from you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you did't have to worry about that mommy. But from now on no more lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you mommy?\" Yukimo asked her mother. \"I know you trying to fatten me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes I did because it made you look so adorable and cute with such a fat belly. Do you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I like being so fat, and eating lots of delicious food. I also like gaining but... Idon't like the teasing. But thanks to an idea of Asami I think I can handle the teasing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth mothers looked with faces glowing from happiness at the two fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now I started to eat my ice cream before it's totally melted!\" Asami said.     </span></div></div>",

She did't have to fool Asami she was thin since she obvious was't. However she did sometimes gave Asami compliments about how fat she was getting what was totally true. Weighing her was now easy. Asami stept on the scale. However Yoko need to bend over to see the numbers. Asami could't see them because her belly was in the way. Mother and daughter were both happy with every pound she gained. She also often liked it to show her belly to her mother showing how big it had gotten. <br>\r\nAt the same time Asami loved how much she could eat now. How happy it made her mother and also herself since she loved being fat and getting fatter.<br>\r\nOf course Yoko told Patricia when they got home. She was happy she could now feed her without problem. Since all three of them wanted her to get fatter.<br>\r\nYoko also had felt a drawer with candy, chocolate, cookies and other sweet stuff. Every time Asami wanted a bite she could take something, and Asami often wanted a bite. You could see her often with something in her mouth. And Yoko kept buying huge meals at Jack in the box, Mc Donalds and Burger king. Asami loved all their food. The greasier the better. For the both of them it was Paradise. <br>\r\nYukimo and her mother appeared to be living very close. Both mothers wanted to make a play date for the two fatties with of course a lot of food for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami was sitting on the couch munching on some donuts. Yoko just stared a it on the air. Thinking about what the future would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy,\" Asami said, waking Yoko up from her day dream. \"You wanted me to become fat. I still want that. Don't worry. But I wondered\u2026 what about daddy? Did he want me fatter too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoko was surprised. She did't think about her husband for some time. She also did't went to the hospital for some time. Perhaps she and Asami should go again. But how long would he stay in a coma? Weeks? Months? Years? ...Forever? Suddenly she realized Asami asked her something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Or at least he did't knew anything about the plan to fatten you up. I don't think he minded it if you got a little chubby, but I don't think he wanted you to get fat. He wanted to make a appointment with the doctor to check your weight. Then\u2026 well then came the accident. Terrible of course... but I must admit\u2026 this did make fattening you up more easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it really an accident\" Asami suddenly asked suspicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Asami how could you say that?  Of course it was an accident. I love your father. I don't want anything bad to happen. But if he did make the appointment with the doctor... well no doctor  would have thought you were healthy. I can tell you that. But maybe we should visit your father. Would you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsami nodded but looked suddenly wit a grin at her mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But can we first get something to eat. I'm starving.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Yoko said with a smile.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

At least that's what her mother (Caroline) said. For Ami it was important as long if there was food. All Ami's intrest's included food or the result of food and in Ami's case you could clearly see a big result. <br>\r\nAmi's mother tried giving her daughter some less and healthier food when she was little but it did't really worked so she accepted Ami would never become thin, and since her husband left with most of her money and jewelry without a trail while she was pregnant she found it hard enough raising a child on your own without watching her diet. She was so glad she at least had her friends who helped her. But no one of them tried and if they did it failed to let Ami lose weight by healthier or less eating. <br>\r\nAs for exercise Ami hated exercise. She even hated walking from the dinner table to the couch or from the couch to the bathroom. At that point Ami was kind of lazy. <br>\r\nShort after Ami was born her mother moved with her to the USA where her parents moved to. Her mother always wanted to live there and after Caroline and her sister were out of the house they moved over there. A wealthy country with a lot of fast food places and Ami loved the new food. She got a real taste for the fatty food and soon the weight of the cute little girl started to climb very high and Ami was happy.<br>\r\nAmi was fat and Caroline accepted that but Ami also liked being fat, and if Caroline needed to be honest she found out she thinks her young girl looks beautiful so large and goes on overfeeding Ami and both are very happy with their life. <br>\r\nSince Ami is only child and also only grandchild she get's pretty spoiled by parents and grandparents who live next door.<br>\r\nThey also don't really see a problem with their granddaughter being large because Caroline's mother s also very obese and her dad likes fat woman. Like he always says: \"The bigger the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi always ate a lot at breakfast, lunch and dinner. At least in one point she was healthy. She drank milk by litres. But only whole milk. Else she thought it tasted to muck like water. She also liked warm chocolate milk with whipped cream on top. So at least Ami need to have strong bones and teeth.<br>\r\nAmi also played sometimes with other children in the neighborhood and some of them also liked Ami's fat body, and of course some don't but you have those people everywhere  Caroline thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy I'm hungry! I want more cereal!\" Ami yelled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline filled the large bowl with cereal and poured milk on it until it almost reached the edge of the bowl and shove it over to Ami who like always covered the cereal with sugar for taste. Telling her there was already sugar in the cereal was a lost cause and Caroline knew that. <br>\r\nShe smiled seeing how her fat daughter wolfed down the cereal. looking at her big belly that was bare since she normal only wore a bra and panties at home. Even in the winter. Not that it minded since Ami rather stayed inside. The reason that Ami only wore a bra and panties at home was that Ami outgrew clothes so fast it was't of much use buying them. But when they went outside in public she always gave Ami a dress and it was slowly always getting harder to find one since she outgrow them very fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi belched loudly. Something she always liked to do. Especially after drinking a lot of milk. She shove the empty bowl away and smiled widely at her mother. <br>\r\nShe climbed on the table to grab the carton of milk and with that she waddled over to the T.V with rubbing thighs and jiggling rolls of fat.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Years of over-indulgence in sugary beverages like chocolate milk had definitely protected the girl by adding many inches of warm, velvety blubber onto Ami's frame. Now here she was; 169 pounds and surrounded by calorie-rich flab protecting her insides. So soft was Ami that the little plumper began to fondle her love handles by sticking her fingers deep into her blubber. Ami smiled widely as she dug her chubbed-out index finger into her deep bellybutton with glee. \"I'm so beautiful!\" Cried the girl with delight as she massaged the entirety of her voluminous form by poking, prodding, tugging, and pulling upon an over-abundant supply of little-girl flab. </span></div></div>",

Caroline agreed with that. She knew very well her parents did too. <br>\r\nHer dad told her many times that when he was in high school he started too (like any) boy get interest in girls. Most of his friends were attracted to Ann the girl with biggest tits but also some liked Jet the lovely brunette with long legs or the super cool Jane with flaming red hair and beautiful green eyes but he never really wanted one of them. Sure he liked them and had no problem hanging out with them but he never really found them attractive. But there were a few girls he found attractive. His favorite was Leorna. A girl with very long straight black hair with C cups but what most interested him was that she weighed over 200 pounds. She was very surprised when he asked her out since he was kind of popular well she was not but she said yes. After a few dates he found out he liked more then her fat body but also her personalty and her hobbies and interests. After being together for a while she asked of she should lose weight. Then he told her that he loved her fat. How fatter how better. She then said she did't mind getting fatter for him. Now she was almost immobile she needed a wheelchair to get around and help getting in or out bed but her parents still loved each other and her grandfather loved his wife's fat and so did she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee mom can I have some more milk?\" Ami asked after she emptied the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure honey.\" Her mother said and took the empty bottle and walked too the kitchen to get another bottle. \"Sometimes I think I should get some cows. But then I need to live on a farm, and living on a farm means hard work, and since Ami hardly moves... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the refrigerator and noticed the was only one gallon of milk left. That mend that she needed to go shopping today since it probably would be empty by the end of the day. She looked outside It was snowing big white flocks. Lucky the store was't that far. Ami could stay with her grandparents in the meantime. That's so nice if your grandparents live next door. They could always babysit and Ami liked going to her grandparents and they liked it when she came so everyone was happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed her daughter the gallon of milk and she put her lips over the opening and making folds again at her arms while lifting the gallon of milk and started to drink. Almost unbelievable how much that girl could drink. <br>\r\nShe love most things liquid. It took her a lot of time to get Ami of baby food since the mashed food was a bit like liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lucky she still a toddler.\" She mumbled softly. \"I really get worried when she starts drinking alcohol.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami take your dress and your cote and some socks and shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi looked up disturbed. She hated going outside or wearing her dress. She liked it just wear her bra and panties. It was easy to move in and she could show how fat she was and she loved showing it to everyone beaming with pride..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have to go over to grandma and grandpa. Over there you can take your cote, dress, shoes and socks of if you like they don't care but You can't get out without clothes. It's freezing outside. Even if they only life next door. Besides Miss Peterson could see you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Peterson was a grumpy old lady that thought she knew best and she had always something bad to say to... everyone. To the paper boy how he delivered his paper, to a teenager boy how he walked, to a couple of girls how the played their game, to some teenager girls how they dressed and to every parent how to raise your kids. Especially to Caroline. Caroline soon found out why. Miss Peterson was a racist. She hated black people. She lived in the south when she was young and liked having slaves until the civil war. But if she had something to say about it black people would still be used like slaves, that and she hated fat kids. So she double hated them, and if Caroline took Ami outside with only a bra and panties she would have a reason again to say what a bad parent she was and tell the whole neighborhood. That was also something she did. Tell the whole neighbor hood how bad she raised her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi put on a dress and socks and shoes. While Ami put on her jacket Caroline could clearly see her belly pressing against the fabric of her dress. She smiled when she took Amy by the hand and took her outside in the white cold snow.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It took a long time before she started walking She was already two years and few months old before she was able to stand. Ami never saw a problem with it. Ami was't only fat but also pretty lazy.<br>\r\nAmi crawled over the carpet and giggled when she dragged her belly across it. She enjoyed this so much she did't looked were she was going and bumped too someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! Is that my favorite granddaughter?\" He asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grandpa, I'm your only granddaughter.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? So then you're also my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your worst.\" Ami mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's look at the good things my parents always said. You're getting pretty big Ami and more beautiful each day. Just like your grandmother.\" Her grandfather said while he looked at Ami's blubber. \"If I would be about 67 years younger and she was't my granddaughter I would fell in love with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi pushed herself in a sitting position and spread her legs so her huge belly could rest between them and looked smiling up at her grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm thirsty!\" Ami yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really well let's see if we have some chocolate milk.\" He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and his wife always had chocolate milk and regular milk since she knew Ami was addicted to it, and since they liked it their grandchild was so fat they also made they got plenty of ice cream and cheese cake. Ami was their only grandchild and they loved to spoil her and fatten her up a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Ami a whole carton of chocolate milk an smiled while he saw his grandchild started chugging the chocolate milk. Suddenly he was disturbed by his wife and daughter who came out of the other room. His wife in her wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Caroline. Sofia is all barking and no biting. I don't own her a penny but she thinks I do. If she would really make a case out of it I would win. You don't have to worry about it. But it's frustrating for her. She hates me already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is she a racist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She is but not in the way you're thinking. She does't care about skin color but she hates fat people. Stupid racist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so unfair.\" Caroline said angry. \"Even a lot of fat people don't want to be fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she does't like them and not the people who want to be fat. So that's probably the reason why she was so mean to Ami. Because she is fat. You did't scare you to much did she Ami?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi swallowed the last sip from the carton and threw it aside and belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No she did't scared me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I almost forget. I need to go to the store I'm out of milk. Could you watch Ami until I'm back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course honey. We would love to watch her as long if you want. Go to the store, take your time. Maybe take a manicure when you're there, and a new haircut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline smiled. She knew how much her grandparents liked it to babysit Ami. Maybe letting her stay a bit longer was't a bad idea. She loved Ami more then anything else but she was a handful. If she could work a few hours without Amy that would be nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Well I need to go Ami. Be a good girl and listen to your grandparents.\" Caroline said and hugged her fat daughter sinking a bit in her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaroline fast walked out and her grandmother looked at the young girl with eyes full of love. She was so glad that her grand daughter followed in her footsteps. She had always been fat but after she found out that her husband liked fatter girls she started to gain for him but she found out she liked it to gain and also loved the fat herself and she was sure Ami was the same and she could't have been more right. <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She just stuck both hands in it and grabbed chunks opened her tiny mouth as far if she could and tried to stuff as much in it as was possible. Ami did't showed any manners. She did't mind them, and she remembered she heard that mean girl at the door calling her a fat pig and decided to show what a pig she could be.<br>\r\nHer grandparents did't mind. After all she was still young and both thought it was kind of cute seeing the little girl eat like a starved animal. However a lot of the ice cream did't reached her mouth and came on her face or her huge belly were it slowly melted leaving colored stains that slowly slide down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like me when I was young.\" Grandma whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry honey but you were't even near her size on that age.\" Her grandfather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True but I was eating like that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi liked eating all the time. After the last bite went past her lips she let out a long, loud and satisfied belch. and looked at her grandparents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were eating like if you mother don't feed you any food at home.\" Her grandfather said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mommy does feed me at home.\" Ami said fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can clearly see that she feeds you.\" Grandpa said friendly with a look at Ami's huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think someone needs a bath. What do you think Ami? Is it all right if grandma gives you a bath?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi nodded and got up to go to the bathroom with grandma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and you be a dear and go to her house and get some clean clothes for her.\" She said to Ami's grandfather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandparents had a key for Caroline's house. Always handy for if Caroline forget the key again but also if Ami stayed over there and they forget something like clean clothes or her favorite stuffed animal. A round piggy. She could't go to sleep without it. Also if Caroline went on vacation they could water the plants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma fast undressed Ami and noticed that even those things started to get tight on her granddaughters frame. This did't made her worried but even some sort of... proud. <br>\r\nShe filled the bath tub with water and she soaped in Ami's body and must admit she was surprised when she noticed how much soap she needed for that. She liked taking care of Ami. It reminded her of the time Caroline and her sister were still little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Ami I heard you are going to daycare.\" Grandma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Tomorrow mommy is taking me to daycare to play with some other kids. I would like a few more friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe must admit she was a bit worried. Ami was morbidly obese and she knew for sure that some other kids would tease her with that, just like they teased her when she was young. The teasing back then was terrible and she sure hoped Ami did't need to go through the same pain she did. But she did't tell Ami or else she might get scared and don't want to go to daycare in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now keep the wash cloth tight against your eyes.\" Her grandmother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi did while her grandmother washed the shampoo out of her long black hair. Caroline always liked her daughters long black straight hair. She thought it was beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she was right.\"  Grandma must admit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a towel and started to rub Ami dry while her grandfather handed some new panties and bra for her to wear. While Grandma dressed Ami she must admit that also these were getting pretty tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So all nice clean so that mommy can be proud for having such a beautiful and nice daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi nodded and slowly waddled back to the living room and climbed on the couch. She yawned on time and after that she leaned back and fell asleep right on the couch.<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Everything edible she could find were fast gone inside her belly. She suddenly noticed the fridge was empty. But in the freezer she found two gallon of ice cream and a loaf of bread. She started to stuff the ice cream in her mouth with her hands. Making them all cold and sticky bit she did't cared. Not even the pieces of ice cream that fell on her bra, belly and legs and slowly melted. <br>\r\nAfter the ice cream was gone she ate the still frozen loaf of bread.

Even stuff like a two pound bag of Sugar, a whole box of crackers.<br>\r\nFinally the last edible stuff were two bags of pasta. She looked a few seconds at them and opened them and stuff them in her mouth. Crushing the hard stuff between her teeth. She did't cared it needed to be boiled first. All that mattered was that she ate it. <br>\r\nWhen the last hand full of pasta went past her lips she slowly looked around. All doors were open. The floor was covered with empty boxes, bags, cans and wrappers. A proof the kitchen once had been full. But all the food was gone in the huge belly of this little girl. She did't leave a single crumb.She must admit she felt bloated but felt so good. It felt so good having all this food inside her. She felt a bit sad there was't anymore food.

And yet, Ami is still hungry!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, come on, I need more food for my poor tummy,\" Ami said as she tried to shake a bag of cookies off one of the top shelves.  However, as Ami struggled to get more food off the cupboard, she began to feel her throat become dry.  Ami ate so much food that she forgot to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I forgot to leave room for milk,\" Ami said to herself as thoughts of milk entered her mind.

However, the light from the fridge illuminated a part of the kitchen that held an even larger fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't checked this fridge before,\" Ami wondered as she waddled to the larger fridge.  As Ami opened both doors of the fridge, she squealed in delight.  The fridge was filled to the brim with milk.  Seemingly endless gallon-sized milk jugs lined the inside of the fridge, with no other food in sight.  One half of the jugs were filled with whole milk, while the other half of the jugs is filled with Dutch chocolate milk.  The freezer half of the fridge was filled to the brim with large tubs of ice cream with a multitude of Ami's favorite flavors.  It was as if this was Ami's dream fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! There's so much milk!\" Ami squealed.  She took a gallon of whole milk from the fridge and sat down on her huge bottom, making yet another <b><i>THUD</i></b>.  She brought the jug to her mouth and chugged down the milk in the jug like a big fat baby, not even taking the time to pause for breath.  As the milk went down to her stomach, the dry food in her stomach became drenched in milk, causing her belly to expand even larger.  After some time, Ami depleted the entire gallon of milk, yet she was still craving for more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thirsty...\" Ami moaned as she took a gallon of chocolate milk out of the fridge.  She gulped down the gallon of chocolate milk the same way she drank the entire gallon of whole milk, and her belly grew bigger and more distended as it filled with more milk.</span></div></div>",

She saw the open refrigerator and lifted her leg just enough to kick it so it closed. The next moments she passed out right on the floor her belly sticking up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami! Ami wake up! What are you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi sleepy opened her eyes and saw her mom by her side. She yawned and rubbed with her fists in her eyes. She looked a bit surprised why she was in the kitchen. Then slowly she remembered what happened. However she did't exactly what happened at her grandparents house. That part was bit blurry. But she remembered it included a lot of eating. But she could't even remember what all went through her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami! What are you doing here. You would stay at you grandparents house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well... I did but I got hungry.\" Ami mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did't grandma and grandpa have any food?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" Ami mumbled so soft her mother did't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I go over there to tell them that you here before the notice you're missing and are worried sick about you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi bend her back. It hurt a bit. She stretched her arms a bit a got a painful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make a mental note. Don't fall asleep on a hard floor. It's kind of bad for your back and neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a look at the fridge. It really was her dream fridge. However she wondered why she never saw it before. She could have walked past it for several years without noticing it. according to her mother she always opened closets to look what was in it. See if it was edible. One time she even drank a bottle of methylated spirits. Afterward they went to the hospital to pump her stomach empty. However that did't ruin her appetite or space in her stomach.<br>\r\nA few minutes later her mother came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my grandparents did't noticed you were gone. However It seemed that there was't any food left there. You ate it all. How were you able to eat all that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It's all blurry. I just wanted to eat. I was't thinking clearly. The only thing in my mind was eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way how did you boil that pasta. You know that you're too young to use the cooker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't boil anything... I think. But I'm pretty sure I did't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate all that pasta raw?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do remember I ate something hard. However I don't remember much about it. I don't know why. But since the food there was gone I went over here. By the way, since when did we have this fridge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of yeah. Do you like it? I bought it especially for you. since all the milk you drink and all the ice cream you eat. Now we have a fridge just for you with enough milk and ice cream for some time. That way I don't have to go to the store so often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you mommy. It's wonderful.\" Ami said and stood up and fast grabbed pants. Thanks to the size of her tummy the elastic broke. \"I'm sorry I ate all the food from the cupboard, and that I walked home without telling them, and that I ate all the food at their home. Are they angry at me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. Grandma I proud that you were able to eat so much for a midnight snack. Well I see you're sorry and it's just some food. No big deal. There are more important things to do. Like day care. Are you still hungry for breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi thought for a second. Sure she still felt some of the food of her feast in her tummy. She was't hungry but she could eat something, Besides she never turned down a chance to get something to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... perhaps just a small breakfast.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nonetheless, she didn't want to bother her mother by asking for even more, so they left soon after. Now, though, she wished she had- she had only been at daycare for 30 minutes, and already her big belly was hungry again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh!\" she said to it, trying to quiet its growling. \"We can't eat right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly growled again, sadly, and Ami was truly able to appreciate how massive she had made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a high school, her outfit would be called indecent. Here, though, it was simply out of necessity- she had eaten so much last night that she burst the elastic on her stretchy pants, which kept them riding down her vast body, and her T-Shirt was far too small to contain all of Ami's bigness- so that left her big tummy on display for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich, of course, growled again. Much louder. A few feet away, a girl building a block tower looked at her in surprise. Ami turned away, hoping to avoid further embarrassment. Her belly had grown so much that it now touched the floor whenever she crawled, and when she sat on the floor, it did the same. Ami was rather proud of her immensity, all told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not when it kept asking for more like this! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growl it just let out actually was so loud it startled the block-tower girl into misplacing her next block, which in turn collapsed the entire thing! Seeing all her hard work go to waste, the girl began to cry. </span></div></div>",

I'm just very hungry so my belly growled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl whipped her tears away and took a better look at Ami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You're fat.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis insult did't really hurt Ami at all. Her mother and grandparents were always proud that she was fat. The word fat was always used like a positive word. Like being cute or being beautiful. So Ami was't hurt by it at all. She was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you. You're also look... nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi took a good look at the girl. Bright red hair and green eyes. Normal body. A green shirt with a black leather jacket and some jeans. Her hair was loose and had wild spikes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Ami's belly growled and she blushed. But the red haired girl bent over to Ami's huge gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I... Eh... can I touch it?\" She asked careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eh... sure. If you want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl put her hands on Ami's belly and felt it and slowly started to play with it, Kneading, pulling and pushing it. Since her midnight binge and breakfast had been digested her belly felt all soft and squishy. Like a nice fluffy pillow but much warmer. The girl liked this. But she was't the only one. Also Ami liked all the attention and playing with her belly. It was just like a nice belly rub. Both did't noticed how long they were bus and might have done it even longer if the belly would't suddenly have growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. I told you I'm hungry. I have a big belly to fill. By the way I'm Ami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Bernadize. But I hate that name. So most people just call me by my nickname Red. Because of my red hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmi smiled.

The search went longer than they thought due to Ami having to waddle her huge, flabby body around, occasionally stopping to catch some breath.

She grabbed some peanut butter snacks and stuffed them in her mouth liked if she had't eaten in days. Ami ripped open one package after another and stuffed in one snack after another in her mouth. Red carefully stuck out her hand and also took a snack. <br>\r\nShe was surprised how much Ami could eat. She just started daycare two weeks ago and did't made that many friends yet. She never thought her first friend would be so fat. Not that she had something against fat people. But she did't liked them either. She was kind of neutral about fat. But she must admit this girl seemed nice enough. But she sure could eat. half of the fridge was empty but Ami kept on stuffing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure were hungry.\" Red whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmphhp.\" Ami agreed with full mouth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed kept on the look out if no one saw them. She knew very well that eating anything out of the fridge outside snack time was't allowed, but at the other hand this girl was hungry. She did't want her new friend to be hungry.<br>\r\nAmi ate and drink everything she saw. She did't really cared what it was. She just wanted to eat and fill her huge belly. Finally the last piece of food went past her lips and found it's way to her stomach. She belched loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sssssh.\" Whispered Red. If they find us here we're in big trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Ami whispered and massaged her full belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited but no one came to look who made that loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right let's get away from here. It's better if the did't know we were here and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a RIIIIIP!!! what was Ami's too small shirt. The lower half ripped in the front.

I thought it would be hard. You know. First day at a new school. Were are you friends by the way?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... i don't have friends.\" Natasja said. \"I'm kind of shy and i'm not good in making contact with others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well from now on you have a friend! Me! At least if you would like me as a friend. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i do!\" Natasja yelled happy.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nShe started to hug Nikki what was a bit hard thanks to the big bellies they had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better be careful. I'm not sure the swing can hold our combined weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja let go and went back sitting on her own swing with a smile this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you often go too eating contests?\" Natasja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. My parents feed me but are a bit worried about my weight. How about you. I'm sure you'll be good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But i don't think my parents want me in an eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls looked at each other and with out reason the both started to laugh and they both liked it.     </span></div></div>",

Even more so, a friend who thinks of being fat the same way she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tubby two were almost without eachother for the rest of the day. They had so much in common. They talked about favorite food, least favorite food, the great feel of being fat, ect. Natasja had never been so social in her entire life. Probably because Nikki is a lot like her when it comes to food and the concept of being fat, something both of them love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the end of the school day. The two fatties stayed a fair distance from the rest of the kids, who were waiting to be picked up by their parents, as well as Natasja and Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you never really told me why you're fat and why you like it\", Nikki noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\", Natasja apologized, \"You're fat because of constant hunger right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Nikki, patting her gut, \"Some people would probably look at it as a curse, but if you ask me, it's a blessing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's your story?\", Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh\", said Natasja, \"Well, I never really did much of anything other than sit around and eat. I remember back when I was thin, when all this\", she placed a hand on her belly, \"didn't exist. At some point, because of all of the lazyness and eating, I became a chubby girl, and then later on, became the fat girl I am today. So me being fat was an accident, but hey, it shows good things can come from accidents\", she patted her belly, using it as an example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good thing for you that it happened\", said Nikki, \"I personally think skinny is ugly\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but to skinny people fat is ugly\", said Natasja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you ask me\", said Nikki, \"I think if you want to be thin, you're crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I\", said Natasja, \"But if they want to be paper, let them. They have their reasons. No one can control others\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki frowned, thinking about her parents having a conversation about her weight that she overheard a while ago. She remembered hearing the phrase that utterly scares her: \"...put on a diet\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\", Natasja asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki shook her head, \"Nothing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja saw her parents drive up to her. \"Goodbye\", she said, getting in the car. They drove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki's parents picked her up a few minutes later.</span></div></div>",

Calling up all things that went on a pizza. The only problem with this game was that she got very hungry doing this. But she knew she was going to get pizza soon so it was perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms... eh peperoni... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother returned with a big pizza an put the box in front of her more then chubby daughter.

Could you tell me something more about her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh well she's always hungry. We saw her on an eating contest remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you mean that girl  with brown hair that said she was always hungry. Now you've said it i remember her. So she's always hungry. I can see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja took a big bite from her pizza and looked at her mother. She chewed slowly and swallowed her bite pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would also like too be in an eating contest.\" She said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Natasja i have rather you don't. You are already a bit at the heavy side. I don't want you to become any fatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i would like it so much.\" She tried again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... i guess hat one time... i talk with your father about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja smiled. Then it would be all right. Her father was never worried about her weight or what she ate. He even seemed to like it she was chubby. Natasja focused on her pizza again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you really like that new girl Nikki. I would like to meet her. Can you ask her too come over once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja froze. She never asked anyone too come over ever. She knew other kids did it. She never did it because she had no friends, until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... i could ask her. But you better can have some food ready then since she's a big eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind. How about tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? When i drop you of i'll look for her mother and ask her. You like her right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja slowly started to calm down.

We can watch T.V or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good.\" Natasja said a bit relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few kids were surprised that The shy fat Natasja found a friend in the fat Nikki. They never thought Natasja would ever get a friend but now she seemed to be best friends with this new girl.<br>\r\nNatasja looked how Nikki was eating her lunch. She was more wolfing it down pushed almost an entire slice of bread in her mouth in one time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee you're really always hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki and Natasja both looked over their shoulder to see who said it.<br>\r\nA boy whit long dark brown hair was standing behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes i am. So what?\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasja looked a bit scared. The name of the boy was Jeroush. He could be a real bully.

She looked back and did't seemed impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you hang out with such a loser?\" He asked pointing at Natasja.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's no loser, and she is way nicer then you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.

He can be very mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee that's what friends do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Natasja felt the warm friendship she felt before. She looked at Nikki. She saw how her butt was hanging over the edge of the chair and giggled softly. Fast she pushed her bread in her mouth so Nikki would't see it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you wanna do now?\" Nikki asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i normally go to the reading corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like books?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that. I like eh... liked it to be alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it to watch pictures in books. I wish i could read more. But i can only read a few words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i can't read more then my own name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey smiled at each other and start laughing and rolled together in the pillows of the reading corner Natasja stuck out her hands and they sank in Nikki's fat. Natasja stopped for a moment. This felt very good. Pushing with hands in someones fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Nikki this feels really nice. Can i touch your belly?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Nikki said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki lifted her shirt and Nikki started to play with Nikki's fat.

And if you wan't you can take some Cola to wash it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy and Wanda both liked Cola. So no wonder that they both took a large glass cola and waddled back to the living room since it was a lot warmer their. The both made themselves comfortable in front of the fire place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do?\" Wanda asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I was't my idea to stop watching T.V.\" Wendy said taking big bites from her apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play pretend then maybe. I mean if we need to do something i guess that's the most fun thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the two toddlers went upstairs to get some stuff to play pretend.  </span></div></div>",

She was the youngest of the two kids and their parents liked it to spoil their little kids. Her older sister was Melanie. Some older sisters are mean but Melanie was't one of them. She was always nice to her little sister. <br>\r\nBut one of Sophie's hobbies was being fed. She liked it if people fed her food. In the past she always tried to let her parents feed her even when she could eat by herself. But Melanie also had one strange hobby. She liked it to stuff her little sister. If her parents where out of the room she shoved all kind of food in her sister's mouth. The point with Melanie is that sometimes she does't know when to stop. So it happened she fed her sister so much that she was stuffed until over the limited. It hurt Sophie in one way but at the other hand she liked the pain from her overfilled stomach. This way she had became quite fat.<br>\r\nShe had cute puffy pink cheeks, a big belly and chubby limbs.<br>\r\nMelanie also was fat. when she was busy stuffing her little sister a lot of the food also ended up in her stomach.<br>\r\nSo this is why Sophie's life was perfect. She could get most things she wanted, had a nice bigger sister who was always there for her and thanks to her sister she could be stuffed when she wanted <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"A little more?\" Melanie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really full Melanie.\" Sophie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was sitting in her chair. Melanie had fed her sister a whole box of cookies a big bag of chips and now she tried to finish it white a can of whipped cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Open your mouth. You know you want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie opened her mouth wide and Susie spout whipped cream in her mouth until the can was empty. Just a moment later Sophie felt the pain. She liked this pain in one way. She slide out of her chair and crawled over (since it was easier for her to crawl after she was stuffed) too the T.V. She climbed on the couch and started to watch Cartoon Network.<br>\r\nShe smiled when her older sister also walked over to the couch and went sitting on it next to her. She liked when she and her sister where together. She curled up against her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay. I hope i did't stuff you to much. You know how it goes. when i'm busy i..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it.\" Sophie said. \"I'm fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a lie but Melanie did't asked further. She started to cuddle her little sister. Sophie started to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you my little sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i like you big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both cuddled again up together and watched Atomic Betty.        </span></div></div>",

You're not allowed to eat the fish out the aquarium.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i like fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe we eat fish tonight.

He big belly was noticeable poking out from under her shirt. Sophie was lately outgrowing all her clothes. It was more the fact she got to fat for them then the fact she was growing. But neither of the parents cared about the weight of their daughters. They thought it was all just baby fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie my shirt is to little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No it just looks like a top. It looks cute on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is't supposed to be a top.

He was the son of the half brother of their father. Robbie was already twenty and he liked fat girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean that girl that looked like a beach ball with two bowling balls attached to the front?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well she was fat but not too fat to get a nice guy. I mean Robbie is kind of cool. Believe me Sophie something like too fat does't excised. It's just a fairytale. Like little red riding hood or Hansel and Gretel. You just growing. Your a growing girl after all. And even if that shirt of you is't supposed to be a top you can still wear it like a top. And it shows that cute belly of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think my belly is cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah i think so.

After the cake disappeared in the bellies Melanie again took the bottle and they drank another one third of it. Then Melanie grabbed the box of cookies.

Melanie always knew how much she could eat.<br>\r\nShe started to rip open the first bag of chips and started to push them  in  her mouth. with both hands. like a machine. Then the right hand then the left. <br>\r\nShe worked herself too three bags of chips, three and a half boxes of cookies, two cakes and three boxes of chocolate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime:<br>\r\nMelanie woke up. She slowly stretched herself once and looked around.<br>\r\nThen she noticed Sophie's empty bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" She mumbled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that her sister was sometimes a bit too young too know what you can and what you can't do. Fast she rolled out of bed and waddled downstairs. <br>\r\nThen she heard sounds in the kitchen and walked inside and looked with big eyes at her sister. Her face was covered with crumbs and chocolate stains. Burping rubbing her belly. She had a painful look on her face. Melanie  saw all the empty bags and boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie... did you eat all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Oh i don't feel so good. I'm feel like i'm gonna burst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie pulled her younger sister out of the kitchen and put her in the couch in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie i know about how much you can eat. But you kept eating without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry but i was hungry. Auw! My tummy hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have waited for me. Or else wake me. I would have stuffed you.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"I feel like popping. Please Melanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie Slowly started to rub and massage Sophie's belly. Sophie opened her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUURRRP! BU... BUR... BURP! BURPI\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. that were some nice burps Sophie. Feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Thank you.\"   <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nThe next moment Sophie fell asleep. Melanie used that time to clean up the kitchen. <br>\r\nShe also took a few moments to look at her fat sisters belly that now was even less covered. Melanie did't mind. She liked her little butterball of  a sister. </span></div></div>",

Sophie looked even better with her big round stuffed tummy. She could see the dome slowly move up and down as the little girl breathed in and out. As it did so, it jiggled and rippled a bit from the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Melanie could tell her sister was in pain. Sure it wasn\u2019t as much as before, but she could still see a strained looked on her sister\u2019s face. She frowned at this and even more as she could see her little stuffed sis\u2019s hands. They were aimlessly flailing a bit, trying to soothing rub her belly. It proved a bit hard for Sophie\u2019s hands to find the round dome of toddler tummy while she was asleep. Melanie sighed a bit,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Sophie, I\u2019ll help you.\u201d She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then waddled over to her. Careful not to wake her sleeping sister, she slowly and soothingly began to rub her tummy a bit. She couldn\u2019t help but grin at the feeling of so much stuffed belly in her hands. She always loved the feeling of her little feedee\u2019s tummy and it felt even better being so packed with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie soon began to grin through her crumbed and smeared little girl face. Even in her sleep she enjoyed her older sister\u2019s touch. Especially now though, as she could feel her belly being more able to handle the massive breakfast she had just eaten. She even let out an odd, cute, burp in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though, the little plumper toddler opened her eyes and grinned over at her sister.

Melanie liked it to rub Sophie's tummy but she was kind of worried about what happened too her little sister. <br>\r\nShe knew when she fed Sophie she also fed her more she could handle but just a bit more. Sophie just had eaten anything in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie when you're hungry you don't need to eat more then until you're full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when you feed me you... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but i know how much your tummy can hold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie did't really know how much Sophie's tummy could hold. But she guessed about it and so far she never had been wrong.<br>\r\nSophie patted her belly a few times and liked the feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look my tummy is so big and round.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it really is. This makes you even more cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie grinned hearing this.<br>\r\nMelanie's tummy rubbing speed up Sophie's digestion and soon he felt better. But she did't said it afraid that Melanie could stop rubbing. But Melanie found it way to much fun too stop rubbing but then noticed Sophie's face and belly and most of her pj's were still covered with chocolate stains and crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to clean you up sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, and the kitchen!\" She suddenly remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about the kitchen squirt. I took care of that but we really need to clean you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled her sister up from the couch. Both waddled fast to the bathroom they threw the dirty pj's in the basket they used for dirty laundry. Then Melanie filed the sink with water and took a face cloth too wash of the crumbs and chocolate stains from her little sister. She liked it to feel the love handles of her sister and the rounding of her belly. Finally Sophie was totally clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like new. Well in a way of speaking of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie fast rubbed herself dry and then the two girls went too their room to get dressed. Melanie always liked it to try on clothes and that was also a reason why Sophie let Melanie decided what to were. <br>\r\nA little later Melanie wore a fire red sleeveless T-shirt that just covered her belly and some cut of jeans. She had some short elastic pants and  red blouse with buttons for Sophie. But here was a small problem Sophie was't able to button her entire blouse. Her belly was just too big for he last buttons and her fat was poking between the holes of the buttons before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm! Maybe better normal T-shirt.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a black T-shirt but even that did't totally cover her belly but Melanie thought it was all right for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on let's go.

Thank you Melanie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Sophie. Now go back to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie crawled under the covers and wanted to turn off the light when she saw Sophie was still standing next too her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie i thought you said your belly was fine. So you can go back too bed now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie... can i well...\" She waved a little on her legs. \"Can i sleep together with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked up. She was pretty tired and she did't wanted to argue with her little sister. Well it was vacation so she she could stay in bed longer. But she knew Sophie would talk a bit. Well maybe she would fall asleep while doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Come on then crawl in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sophie did Melanie could clearly see how her little sisters round belly was poking out of her pajama. She knew that was partly because she fattened her little sister and too be honest she felt kind of proud.<br>\r\nAfter Sophie got in she turned the light off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice and warm in your bed.\" Sophie said and giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cuddled up against her big sister. Melanie felt the big ball of fat that was her sisters belly before she noticed her sister. Then their bellies brushed against the others. Melanie liked the feeling. Her sisters big fat belly filled with fish, chips, candy and ice cream and a lot of soda. If she listened carefully she could even hear her little sisters belly gurgling. While it digested the food. That was good. Then she would be hungry tomorrow morning.<br>\r\nShe liked it too feed her sister. She did't knew if that could be wrong of crazy but she did it because she liked it. Since Sophie liked it too it could't do any harm could it. She noticed she was getting pretty fat and Sophie was pretty fat. Compared to age, height and size Sophie was fatter then her. But it was't so bad too be fat? Was it? With just a age of seven all she knew was that getting fatter was a bigger belly and bigger limbs. Immobility, health problems and death was't something that the little girl knew that could happen. Even if she did she probably would't have worried about it. At least not until there were clearly problems because of their weight.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Melanie. I love you big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Sophie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie. You're three years older then me. I was thinking... once you will be also old enough to go out of home and you will leave me.\" She said and tears welled up in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie. That's gonna take years. It's not gonna happen for at least... let's see... eh... eleven years. At least. Don't worry about it. When i'm seventeen you have enough time too worry about it. Who knows maybe you can come live with me.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Life With you. Do sisters life in the same house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes they do.

She was right of course. But their mother did't knew how much they ate and that she fed Sophie more then she ate herself.

You're getting pretty... well... fat.\" Their mother said while she took a worried look at Sophie's belly.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure Melanie was also pretty fat but Sophie was even fatter while she was much younger. <br>\r\nMelanie liked it that Sophie got so fat but she was worried that her mother did't liked it. Maybe her mother would put Sophie on a diet and that was the last thing she wanted. Stuffing Sophie was her biggest hobby just like it was Sophie's biggest hobby to get stuffed.<br>\r\nSophie looked at her mother excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am i fat?\" She asked her mother while her cheeks were so stuffed with food it looked like they would almost snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it would't mind if you would lose some weight.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie thought fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom Sophie is a growing girl. It's just baby fat. She will lose it! When she's older she will grow into it.\" Melanie said hoping her mother would believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe your right. Sophie is just four years old. Being a bit big at her age is't that bad... but still try too watch out a little. Now i need to do the laundry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out the kitchen while Sophie stuffed the last food in her mouth. After she swallowed she let out a big belch and looked at her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am i going to lose all my beautiful fat? I don't want too lose my fat. I like it too be fat. I wanna be fat and i wanna become fatter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was thrilled when she heard this. She fast rushed over too her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Sophie. If you eat enough and let me stuff you i will make sure that you become a fat... no not a fat an obese girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does obese means?\" Sophie asked not really understanding what her sister mend with obese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means beyond fat. So even fatter then fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what i wanna be!\" Sophie cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.  will try too make you obese but if momma wants to put you on a diet... i maybe won't be able to feed you anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

The sisters felt a bit envious, watching these people pack on the pounds; just watching them grow made them want to eat more and outgrow them all, despite their very filling breakfast earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we search for that blueberry from the chocolate factory?\" asked Sophie eagerly. Melanie smiled. Both of them loved the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but the scene they loved the most, was Violet Beauregarde swelling up like a blueberry. They never got bored of seeing the girl's skin turn blue, followed by her belly gurgling and swelling up like a massive blueberry; they would often pretend it was happening to them. After Violet finished swelling, both girls were excited to hear the Oompa-Loompa song that followed. Both girls sang along happily to the song, using their bellies as drums, making them jiggle with every beat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the video ended, Sophie wanted to watch it again, so Melanie agreed to play it one more time, and this time they would re-enact the scene as it played; Sophie wanted to be Violet. As the Oompa-Loompa song played, Melanie started rolling Sophie across the floor, like the Oompa-Loompas rolling Violet to the juicing room. It was already making Sophie feel sick, thanks to her earlier massive breakfast binge, that hadn't finished digesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie could already tell that Sophie wasn't feeling good from all this rolling and stopped before it got worse, but Sophie was already moaning weakly, one of her hands rubbing her aching tummy, and her other hand covering her mouth, in case she threw up. Melanie also gently rubbed her sister's belly to try and soothe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, let's not do that right after we've stuffed ourselves,\" Melanie thought to herself.</span></div></div>",

She looked in the fridge mumbling things like: \"Please let it be here. I hope we have some left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie did't knew what was gonna happen but she sure hoped Melanie was able to find something that would prevent her from throwing up. She had thrown up before when she was sick and it was one  of the most terrible moments of her entire short life. She did her best to keep the food down. Apart from the fact that throwing up felt terrible she would lose all those precious calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aha!\" Melanie said. \"This might help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bottle of sprite and poured it in a glass and handed it to Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sprite help against a upset tummy. Drink this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie had't a clue or this was true. However she did't care. She was willing to try anything to prevent her from throwing up. Besides she trusted her big sister. She emptied the entire glass in one go. She let out a huge belch. Melanie started to rub her tummy. Did her best to be as gentle as possible. Mumbling encouraging sounds. Sophie slowly started to feel better. She closed her eyes for a second but soon was out like a light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up some time later. She was still in the kitchen. However there was a blanket over her and a pillow under her head. She wrapped the blanket around her and slowly waddled to the living room. Melanie was watching T.V but looked up when she saw Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You're up. You passed out and you looked so cute. Little kids always look so cute when they're asleep. So I decided to let you stay. But I decided to give you a blanket and a pillow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But next time also take a mattress. That kitchen floor is hard. But at least that nap give me the time to digest the food. It also preventing me from throwing up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that Sophie. I did't knew it would make you feel sick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sis! Stop it! You're acting like it was all your fault! I was on in this too! I wanted to play Violet too! I wanted that you rolled me around! Well until I felt sick. But what I try to say is that you can't take all the blame. I'm just as much responsible for it as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm you big sister. I'm suppose to look out for you. I should have known better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. You can't know everything. No one can. There are things no one know's about. Like do parallel universe exist? Why do boats and airplanes disappear around Bermuda triangle? Is there live on other planets?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the universe is endless. At least that's what they say. If that's true it means there are countless planets. Then the earth is the only plant with life on it. Seems a bit strange. I think there can be so much more plants with life on it. But it does't have to be intelligent life. It could as well be some squirrels. Or perhaps dinosaurs. The lived on earth millions of years ago until a asteroid hit the earth. Perhaps on another planet the same happened without that asteroid hitting it. Than they're a still dinosaurs alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sophie asked excited. \"Wait a second! You're missing the point. What I tried to say is you could't know that rolling around would make me sick. So I don't blame you, and afterwards you help me to prevent me from throwing up, and it worked. So there's no harm done. But if you wanna make up to me you need to\u2026\"     </span></div></div>",

Even after nearly causing her sister to empty her stomach's contents, Sophie still wanted to be stuffed full of food. That just showed how committed she was to gaining even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure your tummy is feeling better?\" Melanie asked, just to be sure. Sophie's belly suddenly gave a familiar-sounding gurgle, that pretty much screamed, \"FEED ME!\" \"Pretty please?\" Sophie begged, holding her hungry belly in her hands while using puppy eyes. Melanie couldn't say no to a face like that, even though she would gladly feed Sophie regardless. \"Right away, Violet,\" she replied, patting her younger sister's rumbling tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie looked around the kitchen and found two boxes of cookies, along with a 2-liter bottle of Coke. When Melanie returned with the snacks, Sophie eagerly laid on her back with her mouth wide open, both her hands on her jiggly dome. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go, blueberry,\" Melanie quickly opened the first box of cookies and stuffed two into her sister's mouth. While Melanie stuffed two cookies into her own mouth, Sophie quickly chewed both her cookies and swallowed, opening her mouth for the next batch. Melanie quickly finished chewing and swallowing her cookies and fed Sophie two more cookies. And so it went, back and forth, until they finished the first box. Before Melanie could open the second box, Sophie interrupted, \"I'm thirsty.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie quickly opened the Coke bottle and began pouring the drink down Sophie's mouth. Sophie drank it down like there was no tomorrow, feeling her tummy expand with each gulp. Melanie also saw her sister bloating with each gulp she took. Sophie had finished half the drink, and Melanie finished it off in large gulps, one hand on her expanding belly. After Melanie drank the last drop, both girls let out enormous belches, causing them to blush. </span></div></div>",

When I did something wrong, even the smallest thing, she hit me with a whip or twig. Several times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she do that? Why did mommy let you stay with her?\" Sophie asked with full mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's not her mother. But from daddy. Grandma was't very nice to her either but it's normal that children don't like their parents in law. Especially mothers have problems with their daughter in law. But she assumed that grandma would be nicer to her grand kids. Until she noticed the bruises of the twig. That and that I cried the few times she took me to see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad she's dead,\" Sophie said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Grandpa was all right.

Do we stay together forever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeeeeeell,\" Melanie slowly said. She did't wanna make Sophie upset but she knew she would't keep living with her parents forever. But it would take years before she would move out. Even then she could always visit her sister. \"I will Always be there for you.

She believe she did a very good job at that but Sophie also was helping. But she knew she could't say that. Just this morning her mother made clear that she was worried they they were getting a bit fat. Melanie could hit herself. Why did't she threw away those empty boxes and bottle. Rule nr. 1 was to never leave evidence. She never had left any evidence. Except for the pounds on her sister and this one time. <br>\r\nMelanie took a deep breath trying to stay calm. Careful not to make her voice sounds strange. That was always careful if you lied. You needed to sound normal. She did't liked it to lie against her mother but she simply could't tell her the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not mommy. Why would I do that? We were both just still a bit hungry so we both took a box of cookies, but then we got thirsty so we shared a bottle of coke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left out the part that she had only eaten half a box and Sophie one and a half. Sophie also had most of the coke.<br>\r\nHer mother looked at her. Not sure if she believed her. She knew Sophie had a big appetite. She did ate a lot at breakfast but maybe that had't been enough. But really both her daughters were getting fat. She did't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, Sophie, I'm slowly done with it. You both are getting fat. Come on Melanie look at this.\" Their mother pushed her finger in Melanie's fat belly. \"And that goes double for you Sophie. You're even worse then Melanie. You're both fat, and lazy, and addicted to unhealthy food and soda. I guess that's partly my fault since I bought the food and I did't put enough attention to you. I should have been a bit more strict. So I'm gonna start today. First thing is that you two don't get any more food until dinner. Understood. We're gonna start a diet and do some exercise.\"      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie and Sophie felt they were punished with a face worse then dead. <br>\r\nMelanie looked sadly out of the window at the street beneath her. Their house had three floors. First was just storage. Third was bathroom and bedrooms but all other rooms were on the second floor. Both sisters liked that since that way they could look down at everything what happened.<br>\r\nSadly with bowed head like if they were sentenced to death. They walked upstairs to their room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Sophie asked. \"I don't wanna go on a diet, or do exercise. I just wanna be lazy and that you stuff me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna do that to. Dad does't have a problem with it but mommy will\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was suddenly interrupted by a loud scream and a long rumbling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Sophie asked scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Melanie answered. \"Lets go and see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth came down but did't saw or heard anything. Then Melanie looked down from the stair and saw her mother lying on the floor. Blood around her. Fast she closed the door to the stairs so Sophie woud't see her. She took a deep breath. She was the oldest. Se needed to think clear. She then realized what to do. She took the Phone and dialed 911. She explained what happened. Soon a ambulance was coming and took their mother away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is their a place were you can stay?\" One of the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Our neighbors.\" Melanie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good go over there I call you when we have some news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir neighbors were an man and woman with their teenage daughter. She had babysat Melanie and Sophie many times. She did their best to comfort them and put on a cartoon so it would take their mind of their mother. Of course she fed them also a lot of snacks after a few hours the hospital called. Their mother was...  </span></div></div>",

She and Taylor both liked it to play with their fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor lived since she was two by her sister. She did't remember much about that time before. Before Taylor was skinny. She found comfort, love and protection by her big sister. She liked her big sisters belly. Her bigger sister started to feed her all kinds of stuff and very much. Taylor liked it when she was fed by her big sister. She did't knew but Sam did that most of the stuff was high fat. This way the skinny Taylor gained a lot of weight that was clearly visible at her thighs and butt. Now her little sister also had her own fat so they could both play with their fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam?\" Taylor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can i watch Spongebob today.

Taylor had black hair and did't said much while Sam had blond hair and liked it to talk. But even if they did't looked like each other they were the best friends and loved the other. <br>\r\nThe doorbell rang and Sam stood up. Taylor fast crawled behind the couch. Sam waited until her little sister was behind the couch before she opened the door.<br>\r\nA tall blond girl was standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! You must be Samantha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Sam.\" She said snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sam. I'm your new babysitter. For you and your little sister.

She liked it too be in cramped places. Behind the couch was one of her favorites. Her butt and thighs were scrapping against the wall while she crept out. It was getting harder to get in and out lately.<br>\r\nSam looked smiling at her little sister. Taylor yawned one time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam i'm hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too.

She smiled when she found a two pound bag of sugar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Taylor lay down! I have a funny idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor did like her big sister told her. She totally trust her big sister. She knew Sam would never hurt her on purpose.<br>\r\nIn the meantime Sam finally found what she were looking for. A funnel. She also took a large bottle of coke and put the end of the funnel in her sisters mouth and opened the bag of sugar and the bottle of coke.<br>\r\nTaylor giggled. She knew what her sister was going too do.<br>\r\nSam grabbed the bag and poured sugar in the funnel. Taylor started to swallow it and Sam now poured cola in the funnel like a machine. Sugar, cola, sugar , cola.<br>\r\nWhen she poured the last cola in she looked in the funnel. It was about two third full. A mix of cola and sugar. Taylor seemed very happy swallowing the sweet mix.<br>\r\nSam waited patient until her little sister was done swallowing the sugar with coke what did't take too long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right Taylor.\" Sam said while she took a few bottles of Soda from the refrigerator. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed one bottle of coke next to Taylor and took herself a bottle of sprite. After that she gave Taylor one bag of chips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think you can eat and drink that faster then me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe i can.\" Taylor answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets find out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Sam the bottle.\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She tried to open the bottle with her tiny hands but she was't strong enough. Sam sighed and opened the bottle for her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's see who is faster in eating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls both started to stuff themselves with chips taking sips from their drink after every few bites.<br>\r\nSam was bigger with a bigger mouth and bigger hands but she knew that Taylor could eat really fast.<br>\r\nTaylor took a few big sips from her bottle of coke. She then opened her mouth and... BUUUUUURRRRP!<br>\r\nSam started to laugh. Her little sisters had no manners. But with only four years old and she five her parents did't mind yet. Sam knew about manners but did't cared about them and returned eating.<br>\r\nAt the end Taylor put the bottle upside down in her mouth and laid on her back letting the coke slide in her throat. when the bottle was empty she spit him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUURRRRRP! I'm done Sam.\" Her little sister said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled on her belly and looked at Sam. The bag an bottle were both not empty. Sam smiled at her little sister. She did't really did her best to eat fast. If she would have done she also could have lost but she did't really mind and Taylor liked it so much if she could beat her sister in an eating competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now i could go for some... cookies.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ripped open the bag of cookies. Then she stopped one moment and looked at Taylor. Her pants who were kind of tight this morning were now at the point of snapping and the sides also looked like they could split any second. She then took a moment to look at herself. A big part of her belly was hanging over her waist band and what was inside pushed against her pants and it seemed like the button could pop of any second. Sam just lifted her shoulders. Their parents would buy new clothes. Her parents did't mind that their daughters were kind of fat and they thought it was cute when Sam fed Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here little sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor just rolled over too Sam. Sam dropped one cookie in her sisters mouth and took the one herself. The fed one too Taylor and again one for herself. They both liked those moments for some reason. They continued but after Taylor's fifth cookie her pants split at the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it were old pants anyway.\" Sam said against her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree cookies later the button popped of Sam's pants and her zipper was forced all the way down. Sam only lifted her shoulders and they both continued to eat the cookies until they were all gone.<br>\r\nTaylor felt a bit stuffed. She was still lying on her back and cookie crumbs in her long black hair.<br>\r\nSam looked again in the refrigerator and found what she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here little sis. Butter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some strange reason Taylor lover the taste of butter. Sam hated it but knew her sister liked it. Butter really helped fattening Taylor up in the last two years.<br>\r\nWithout a second thought Taylor stuffed the 250 gram stick of butter in her tiny mouth. She pushed it in so far  her cheeks were full with butter and with those bowl cheeks and she looked like a chipmunk.<br>\r\nIt did't take long before The stick of butter was gone too Taylor's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i think your full for now. So now what do you wanna do?\" Sam asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Taylor slowly got up her chubby legs. Her ripped pants fell of her her chubby lower half leaving her just in her sweater and underwear but she did't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play with your belly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but i wanna give you a belly rub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters walked over to the couch and both pulled of their sweaters and Sam also pulled of her pants and they both started to play with the other's fat.   <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I know your shy but i mean she is becoming our new babysitter so you need to see her sooner or later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor sighed and crawled out of her little hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all right then. But you stay with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i will. I always do. You know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam and Taylor slept in the same room and were almost always together. Until Sam went too school. Taylor was really upset the first weeks Sam need to go, but finally she got used too it but she still did't like it. Since some time she also went herself too school and since then she saw her sister during recess and they walked out together after school was over.<br>\r\n Taylor walked with bowed head like if she was going to be hanged and walked too the babysitter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your Taylor. Ah you're such a sweet girl and you look beautiful. You should't hide your beautiful face from other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor slowly nodded and shook her and and after that walked fast back to her sister and hold her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i come tomorrow morning too watch them, cook for them, take them too bad and after that too bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam fast walked too her and asked: \"You also gonna cook for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes i'm a good cook and your mother thought that was handy so i could babysit and cook for you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want Taylor too like you... buy some junk food and candy. She loves that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. I will keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her sister really did't had anything in common with the Goldilocks in her books. A least not in looks. Taylor brushed some of her black hair out of her face. Some of her hair fell over half of her face covering one eye. Sam found it looked kind of mysterious. She liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say are you hungry?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! yes! Feed me! Feed me! I'm hungry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then first get of my belly so in can stand up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor went sitting on her knees. Her cute belly bugled out forward a bit so it was clearly visible between her pants and shirt. She looked smiling at her sister.<br>\r\nThe two girls quietly as quiet as a kid of their sizes could be walked downstairs. Their combined weight let hear every now and then a soft: \"Crack.\"<br>\r\nTaylor and Sam walked too the kitchen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what makes a healthy breakfast.\" Sam said. \"What am i saying? Who cares if it's healthy as long if it's tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But eh Sam i'm thirsty. Can i get something to drink first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the refrigerator and pulled out a bottle of Cola. She unscrewed the cap and handed it too Taylor.<br>\r\nShe took the bottle in both hands and lifted the bottle up and opened her mouth wide and poured some cola in her mouth. She put the top of the bottle in her mouth and went laying on her back holding the bottle between hands and feet just like a baby sucking at a bottle.<br>\r\nSam opened the cupboard and pulled out a bag of chips and a box of cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good start for the day. Now what do i miss. Something sweet to help it slide down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the freezer. Her parents put the ice cream in the top of the freezer. Not that it made any difference. Sam pushed a chair too the freezer and climbed on it and took a gallon of ice cream. She closed the freezer and opened the gallon of ice cream and hit the ice cream with a spoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hard like a rock. Well lets start with the Cookies and chips. In the meantime this get's soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRP!\" Taylor belched loudly and an empty bottle of coke rolled away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You drank that entire bottle of coke! Come on there must have been about two third in it!\" Sam said but she felt kind of proud at her little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor slapper her cola filled belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thirsty. But i'm still hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's take this over too the T.V and watch some of those morning cartoons.\" Sam said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor dragged the bag chips over too the T.V and Sam took the gallon of ice cream and the box of cookies. Taylor crawled on the couch and turned on the T.V and look for some cartoons. In the meantime Sam ripped open the bag of chips.<br>\r\nTaylor finally found some nice cartoons and laid back. The next moment Sam pushed her sisters mouth full with chips and after that her own mouth. Soon Taylor shewed to be ready for the next bite. She focused her attention to the T.V and her sister. Opening her mouth any time a handful chips came her way.<br>\r\nAfter the chips were gone Sam opened the box of cookies and pushed one in Taylor's mouth then one in her own and then again one in Taylor's mouth.<br>\r\nTaylor focused her attention back too the T.V and just ate.<br>\r\nSam took the gallon of ice cream and opened it. It got pretty soft and she scooped a spoonful out of it and pushed it in her sisters mouth. Then another in her sister mouth and another and another. Sometimes she gave her sister time to swallow but most of the ice ended in her sister huge gut. After the two cleaned the gallon Sam hide it deep in the thrash can. <br>\r\nSam looked at the T.V and sometimes at her sisters big belly that was busy digesting all the food. She almost could't wait until it was done and she could play with all Taylor's new fat.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She turned the T.V on. Judy watched with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad your little sister is't here. I had a bag of candy for each  of you. But now i don't see her i can't give it too her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam smiled when Taylor crawled from under the couch.

She did't expected to hear something like that. Most people said something insulting about her weight. Like at school. Sam did't had such a problem with it but Taylor was a lot more sensitive. She had sometimes trouble with it if someone insulted her and then Taylor need to defend her again. But now someone said she liked it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like it that our bellies are big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. I like it too see rolls of soft squishy fat. I like it a lot more then those skinny anorexia kids you see everywhere who only drink juice. You're not like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam saw Taylor smile. Taylor smiled a lot but not so fast near adults. Especially if she did't knew them that long. Maybe it would become all right between Judy and Taylor. </span></div></div>",

Her shyness slowly got less, or her love for food was just bigger then her shyness.<br>\r\nSam was thinking about what too take too eat. She saw Taylor thinking about what she would eat. She thought they would eat the same. Taylor maybe even more. She giggled. Taylor with a whole year younger but a tummy able to hold more food then her's while she was a year older. It was a good thing both had big bellies since both girls loved it too play with their own and the others fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want big mac's, and a lots of fries, and milkshakes, and chicken nuggets.

But then she stopped for Mc Donalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right what do you two want?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i would like Three big mac menu's. With vanilla milkshakes and a big box of chicken mc nuggets and a Mc Flurry*.\" Taylor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked with open mouth at what the little toddler asked.

But i hope you two are able too finish it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Judy would have put more attention too Sam's face she would have seen the evil twinkle in Sam's eyes. Sam could eat a lot but if she was't able too finish it she knew for sure it would go her little sisters huge gut. Sam saw how innocent she looked there just playing a bit with her own fat. At the other hand would Taylor be able too finish it all. She knew how her little sister sometimes had a bit trouble too know how much she could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw Judy come back wit two plates piled full with food. Sam opened the door and Judy handed her the plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i hope you two are hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Judy drove back the two girls were both happily stuffing their faces. Judy must admit that she liked kids who ate this much. She only wondered if they could finish it, and would she be in trouble if their parents found out?    <br>\r\n <br>\r\n*A Mc Flurry is a ice cream made by Mc Donalds</span></div></div>",

Well she was't yet but she planned to become one. she liked it to cook in her free time and became very good. Probleme's with like it to cook is that you need someone to eat it. But here were two little toddlers 4 and 5 years who ate more then a normal adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's hurry op!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put butter in the pan boiled water.

I thought that was our little secret. You never told anyone else except me. Not even mom or dad. So why her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. It just slipped out. But don't worry. She said she liked our big bellies. If she told the truth then she would't mind it. Don't worry little sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor slowly lifted her shirt. Showing her fat bulging belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam I feel tiny. Even worse i feel skinny. I'm much too thin. Just look at this.\" She said and lifted her shirt some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam jumped on her sister laughing and pulled at her sisters love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Then what's this fatty? Come on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaylor laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine so i'm not skinny. But even if i am fat i want too become fatter. Besides that i'm starving. Can you please get me some food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam slowly walked too the kitchen and suddenly smelled something delicious. She walked too the kitchen and opened the door. Her mouth fell wide open. A feast was on table. with some of her favorite kinds of food. This was delicious. This was great. She ran back too the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sam. Where's the food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam pulled Taylor from the couch and pulled Taylor with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got to see this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost need too drag Taylor with her.

Eating was something the three sisters shared. Her two sisters were opposites of each other while she was a mix of both but they all three liked eating. Mandy always eat the most and yet her stomach was flat while Ayme had a nice round potbelly just like her or at least hers was smaller then Ayme's. Something she hated was that she was the smallest. If you said something about that she was small you hit her on the wrong place.<br>\r\nShe ripped open the box and start eating some cookies.<br>\r\nShe heard the kitchen door and looked over her shoulder. A small old women came in and even with looking kind of old with gray hair she walked fine even without a stick.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hello grandma!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grandmother of the three sisters lived with them for as long if they could remember.

She fast started to eat the rest of the cookies. After that she ripped open the bag of chips. <br>\r\nWhen she was halfway through the bag the kitchen door opened. Ayme came in.

She looked angry, with her teeth clenched, and both of her hands in fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only you knew what happened to mom!\" Tears began welling up in Mandy's eyes. She ran to her room and locked the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy was a sweet girl when she was 2 years old. Her mother spoiled her rotten. Mandy never stopped smileing. But then came Nov. 2nd 2002. She witnessed her mother die at the hands of her drunk father. Not only was she scared to the core of her being, life without her mother completely changed her. Originally, she always spoke, and was always a part of everything. Now she almost never says a word, and is always that one person outside of the croud. She never did, however, abandon her kindness. Because their her little sisters, Mandy's always there for them, no matter who it is. Not only is she always protecting them because their her sisters, but if she wanted to die, it would be protecting those she love, like her mother. But the main reason she protects them is because she learned of death very quick. Someone dies, they're never seen again. And Mandy doesn't want anymore of her family dead, not after seeing her mother die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what did happen to our mother?\" Garcia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\" Ayme said. \"No one ever talks about her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.

They will never know mom or dad. They don't have any memories about them and don't know how much i miss her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood up and took a dark blue cloak with cap. It was officially a Halloween costume for raven from teen titans but she liked the outfit since it hid her face in the shadow. <br>\r\nShe walked out her room and walked too her grandmothers room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Mandy. Feeling better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so. But i was wondering can you show me some pictures and tell something about my mother? Then i think i can finally let go of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i knew you would ask once so i made this.\" Her grandmother said and took a big dusty old book. \"In this book are pictures of your mother with some important things of her life. Here she was just born and her she's one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy smiled when she saw the pictures of her mother and enjoyed what her grandmother told her. <br>\r\nShe and her sisters all had the black hair from their mothers side of the family. She noticed that her mother was a fat girl when she was young. She suddenly remembered the soft belly that she liked to lay on or cuddle up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know your body doesn't look like that from your mom. She looked more like your sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say i look like my father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nothing like your father in character. But he also had a fast metabolism. That's why he was so thin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i only have his metabolism. I guess i can live with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know many people would do almost anything to have your metabolism.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandy looked further with her grandmother while in the kitchen her sister were starting their weight gain plan.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ayme took the remote since She knew that Garcia still was a bit too young for some cartoons however she still tried to watch them and never liked it when her sisters or grandmother send her out of the room. Finally she saw some cartoons that were't too scary for Garcia.<br>\r\nGarcia ripped open the first bag of pretzels and started to stuff her face with them. Scooping them into her mouth with both hands. Ayme grinned. Her little sister looked a bit like a pig eating like this and she would soon look like a fat pig if they would continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And i will look like an overfed pig.\" She thought before she ripped her bag open and buried her head in them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarcia was younger then Ayme but was a much faster eater. After she emptied the first bag she opened the bag of sugar and poured in in her throat. She stopped for a moment to take some sips of cola and after that continued eating the sugar. <br>\r\nAyme was also done with her first bag but just like always she was't so hungry and had trouble eating the entire bag of sugar. only with small pours the sugar went down her throat. After the bag was empty and she washed it down with some sips of cola she belched loudly.<br>\r\nGarcia was already busy with her last bag of pretzels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice burp big sis.\" Garcia said and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyme patted her big belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you full already?\" Garcia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... no of course not!\" Ayme said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this was a lie. She was full but don't wanted to let her sister notice. Even while her belly hurt she kept pushing the pretzels in her mouth. <br>\r\nShe took a moment to look at Garcia and noticed her bag was empty on the ground and suddenly an empty bottle of cola rolled away and Garcia let out a cute little burp like a baby that caused Ayme to giggle.<br>\r\nShe concentrate on her bag again and slowly with trouble she managed to strangle the last pretzels down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow i'm full!\" Ayme said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarcia got up from the couch and returned with two boxes of donuts and placed one in front of her sister and started to eat the other one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Garcia i don't think i can do this i feel really full already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGarcia lifted her shoulders and took her sisters box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Then i just eat those two boxes by myself.\" Garcia said while she took a bite out of a donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyme was a bit surprised but her little sister seemed to be able to eat both two boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow now i'm too really stuffed.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThey both started to laugh. Suddenly Mandy walked in. Both stopped laughing. She still wore the cloak from her Halloween costume so the upper side of her face was still hidden in shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mandy. Hey listen about what we said... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget it. You two just don't know what happened. Its not your fault. So don't worry about it. I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAyme took one look at her older sisters almost flat belly and was surprised how much her sister could eat without almost gaining a pound. But soon there would be two fat girls in house here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She could be as sweet a sugar or so mean like the devil. It depended on if she was hungry or not and she was a big eater. <br>\r\nHer parents had a lot of troubles the first years with Kelly. They did't understood why there little girl could act nice the one time and mean the other time. When she was about three years old they started to notice something and when she turned four they knew for sure that it depended or she was hungry or not. To keep it nice in house the made sure she was always well fed. Her mother even put a bowl of breakfast in her room every day so she could eat something after standing up. Three years of being well fed did made her a fat girl and eating was her biggest hobby.<br>\r\nwhen our story starts our little eater is seven years old and is eating a big cake while watching cartoons in her pajamas. It's Sunday and the next week is summer vacation. She already has eaten two hamburgers from the day before and a bag of chips and for drinking she has a bottle of Cola<br>\r\nKelly was't really a girl for table manners and was making smacking sounds while eating and belched loud after every few sips of Cola. She always said that in some other lands belching is showing that you liked the dinner and well that's true.<br>\r\nNow she was breaking off big lumps of cake and stuff them in her hungry mouth and slowly she became full and her personality became nicer and when the entire cake was inside her belly there was a friendly smile on her face. Her pajamas were becoming a bit too small. You could see some of her belly between her pajamas pants and shirt.<br>\r\nHer mother looked at her from the table. If you wonder or her parents did't mind that their daughter was a fat girl well they did't mind how fat she was or would become as long if she was happy and nice and the only way too keep her nice was keeping her well fed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Kelly could you come over here please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course mommy what is it?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well your father and i decide that we maybe need a bit vacation. We found a nice hotel that's famous because of it's great food. You can eat there twenty-four-seven as much if you can possibly eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was almost drooling hearing this. This sounded like a dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly you can come too under one condition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" Kelly asked doubtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want you to stay nice. The entire time. You understand. If you be mean we take you directly back home. understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was thinking. She wanted really to that hotel. But stay nice. If she became hungry she just became mean. But her mother said that you could eat there twenty-four-seven. If you really could eat there twenty four seven then it would be no problem and normally she would wake up before her parents and she could eat herself fat, round and nice before they even woke up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will stay nice. I'll do my best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. You can come with us. We go...</span></div></div>",

Oh and Kelly don't forget Wolfie!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfie was a cuddly toy that looked like a wolf. Kelly had him since she was born and could't sleep without him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked upstairs and packed her stuff. Paper and drawing stuff. A few books. She was learning how to read. Some of her CD's and tapes. She had a walk man and her father always took a CD player, tape player and radio in one. He liked music and normally he also played her music now and then, Also a few comic and of course Wolfie. Well she tied a rope to one of his legs and tied the other end to her bag so she could sleep tonight with him and would't forget him.<br>\r\nHer mother also came upstairs to pack in her clothes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh before we go tomorrow... can we have a big breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Kelly. I don't think so. We want to go early. But i will take some food with me so you can eat in the car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kelly made a painful face. Her mother saw it and sighed deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tell you what. I make one sandwich and give you one apple tomorrow morning to eat before we go. But you'll have to do it with that. Can you do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly nodded. It would't be enough to let her feel full but enough to stay nice. Especially if she would try her best too stay nice. Suddenly her thoughts were interrupted by a crying in another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jennifer is awake. I also need to pack her stuff. Now you go play.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer is Kelly's baby sister. Really baby. She was only a few months old. Kelly's parents were pretty young when the got Kelly and since Kelly could be such a big trouble maker when she was hungry they were't sure about taking another kid. But since they knew Kelly now and everything on her dads work went pretty well they decided to take another kid. What's kind of strange is she stays awake until pretty late in the evening but sleeps also until pretty late in the morning. Her parents were thankful for that. When Kelly was born she woke her parents every moment she was hungry and that was around 12:00 pm and 6:00 am.<br>\r\nKelly did't really knew what too think from Jennifer. Her parents of course had some less time for her. She noticed that but her parents tried to also be always there for her when she needed them. Besides it could be fun being the big sister. But for now Jennifer was only 5 months old and Kelly did't had any problems with her.<br>\r\n She looked in her bag or she missed anything. Extra batteries and of course some candy. After that Kelly went down and watched some T.V. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her first thought tell her mother to get out of her room and let her sleep. But she suddenly remembered what her mother told her. She needed to stay nice. She was still sleepy but got up. <br>\r\nHer mother took some clothes and helped her get dressed. <br>\r\nThe problem with morning was that Kelly did't eat anything during the night when she was sleeping. So in the morning her belly was empty. A empty belly was a mean Kelly. But she knew what her mother said. However it took all her will power to stay nice while her mother helped her get dressed.<br>\r\nShe waddled downstairs after her mother and pulled her mother at her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy. Food. You promised.\" Kelly said and looked at her mother and added: \"Please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I promised you I know. Here a sandwich and a apple. But you promised to stay nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I get food in the car?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I packed in some food.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it will then be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next moment she stuffed the sandwich in her mouth. It took her less then a minute to finish the entire sandwich. She saw her dad in the hall busy with the bags and suitcases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly did you already took your suitcase down?\" Her mother asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh no. Not yet.\" Kelly said with full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then better hurry up and get it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly grumpy walked up the stairs. Her mood was't good but as long if she could hide it and act like she was nice it would be no problem.But with a sandwich in her stomach and a apple on the way she thought she should be able too stay nice until she could eat in the car. <br>\r\nShe loved eating. It was her hobby. She could be just as happy with food if other kids her age were with a new doll. And she liked eating as much if other liked playing with new toys. But the toys lasted longer then food around her. She liked it to eat, eat, eat and the eat some more. Of course this was part responsible for the big belly she carried. However she did't mind being fat. To be honest she liked being fat. At school she had seen kids who were so skinny you could count their ribs. She must admit she did't liked that. She rather did't wanna look like that. She would rather be a shapeless blob of fat, and that was what probably was gonna happen to her. She probably would't mind as long if she could eat. She also liked watching T.V and reading. She just started to learn how to read. But it was less fun than eating.<br>\r\nShe grabbed her suitcase and noticed something was attached to it. She looked angry over her shoulder and sighed relived when she saw it was Wolfie. She tied a rope to one of his legs and the other to her suitcase. So she could sleep with him and would't forget him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't leave you behind now can I?\" She said an kissed Wolfie and hold him tight under her arm and carried her suitcase down stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her suitcase down and finished her apple. She always ate the entire apple. Pits and all. Some people told her apple pits were poisonous but that was't true. She had eaten dozens of apples pits and all and never got sick.<br>\r\nA few minutes later her mother put her in her car seat. It made cracking noises in protest but hold. However Kelly need t squeeze a bit to get herself in. Her mother tried to buckle her up but it was hard with Kelly's big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly sweetie could you suck you belly in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was about to say something mean but remembered she needed to stay nice. So she sucked in her belly and heard the click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh mommy. Can you make it a bit wider?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry honey. But it's already at it his maximum size. Tell you what. We will buy a new bigger one when we're there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well okay then. I guess so.\" She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked a moment at her little sister who was sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try to sleep a bit sweet hart. You were up pretty early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly must admit she was still pretty tired. She closed her eyes leaned back and soon she went to dreamland.          <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was no way you could get her to eat vegetables. Except by cutting them in so little pieces and mixed them with other food so she would't notice or taste them.<br>\r\nIt looked like a lot of food for three people but Courtney knew that there would't be a crumb left.<br>\r\nShe heaved her own 400 pound body on a chair that made squeaking noises in protest but hold. Courtney always had been a fat girl. Even since her childhood. She had been a real sweet tooth and a healthy appetite. Her parents were also pretty fat. Too be honest her whole family was fat but no one really minded. Her parents always found her fat, cute, beautiful, nice, soft and warm. The whole family liked fat and of course they all want to show of their children and how fat they were. <br>\r\nCourtney was the youngest in the family so she was also the last one who got children. She was a bit worried since she was overweight during her pregnancy but it all ended well. She got a healthy twin and after that she put a lot of extra pounds on her body.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust like her parents did with her she raised her kids to be fat. She could't be more happy since her kids seemed natural gainers. They both got a huge appetite and a taste for fatty food. They liked eating and Courtney did't know or it was because what she and her family members said or because they were just born this way they both liked it to be fat and liked it to play with it and with each other.<br>\r\nShe always wanted her daughters to be fat but she did't have to be worried about that. Both liked their fat and Georgia hated losing weight and both girls hated any sort of exercise except swimming. But that did't want to say they were any active in the swimming pool. They like it to float, splash around and of course they liked the slide.<br>\r\nShe was so happy her kids were so fat and liked gaining. She liked seeing her daughters getting fatter and was so proud at them. Especially Bethany who put already 165 pounds on the scale.<br>\r\nOf course she did't told that too Georgia who only put 155 pounds on the scale. But she loved Georgia just as much as Bethany but told her she should eat a bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked her life with just her two kids. Her husband and father of her kids did in a car accident a few years ago. She did't felt so bad about that. Sure he used to be very nice that was why she was married and got pregnant from him but he changed. The love they felt got less and less and she was sure he cheated on her but he always denied it and even hit her and he also was't really nice with the two kids and did't really cared about them. But the worst thing was that he suddenly hate the fact that she was fat while it before never had been a problem. Probably it was because some new friends he made. Suddenly he did't want to grow old with a fat ass bitch and two fat ass daughters. She never forget how he hit her and kicked her and his friends called her: Fatty fat, two by four, can't fit through the kitchen door. And then they laughed and he laughed with them and it did't sound fake. Just to get back to him she stuffed her face every moment of the day he was away and that was often, while she watched the kids.<br>\r\n He even was mean to the kids some time because when they cried they woke him and he hated how everything suddenly was all about them. He hit them also. She remembered that the two babies soon learned to stay away from their father and always looked with big scared eyes at him until he suddenly one day did't came home anymore. No one mind. But her mother suddenly got a lot of money.<br>\r\nShe now made computer programs and made a lot of money with them. Good thing too or else she could't buy all the food they consumed all the clothes her kids every now and then literally grew out and her own clothes who were specially made for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled again when she saw her kids eating the spaghetti. Around their mouths it was red from the tomato sauce and their bowl pink cheeks were chewing none stop. <br>\r\nThey never had to bother with left overs since there never were any left overs. Never. Except about two years ago. Georgia became very sick for a long time about one month. Lucky she became better. However she lost some weight and was very sad about that. That was probably the reason why she weighed 10 pounds less then her sister. But after Georgia was better again she showed she had't lost her appetite, but she never had been able to catch up with Bethany who was only a few minutes older then her and could never leave it to rub that in her face and tell everyone they met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso important was Kelly. A friend from their mother since childhood. She came over a few times a week and sometimes she babysat them. She also every now and then cleaned the house since it was hard for Courtney doing that with her weight of 400 pounds and it was't likely she would lose that weight. She was more likely to gain more. Of course Courtney wanted to pay her for it but she never wanted that she told her it was a hobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started on her own plate.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.0;\">Zoe and Stella giggled and whispered to each other as they sat waiting for their mum to pick them up from school. This was their first day at their new school. In fact recent days had seen the girls experience a lot of firsts. That Monday had been their first house move as their mother had called to another job in another city. Then they had been bought they\u2019re first gaming console, a PlayStation 4, on Tuesday so they would keep quite while their mother unpacked. Their mother had been incredibly busy between unpacking and settling in to her new work, and had bought them McDonalds for breakfast on Wednesday morning, getting back from an incredibly early meeting and not having time to cook the twin\u2019s breakfast before leaving again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had been an amazing discovery for the twins, and they\u2019d instantly fallen in love with the greasy and filling food they\u2019d gotten. They\u2019d never had take-away before, their mother instead showing her love and devotion for them by hand cooking meals. Each twin had gotten a Mighty McMuffin and a medium orange juice as well as two hash browns, and they had both scarfed their meals down as quick as possible, loving every bite. Their mother was so happy she didn\u2019t have to feel guilty about cooking them breakfast that she\u2019d quickly promised them they could have McDonalds, and any other fast food, very often.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis fairly large meal had left the twins stuffed and happy, and they\u2019d spent the next few hours lying on the couch playing games together while their small bellies got to digesting the fatty food. The rest of the day was fairly uneventful, snacking on biscuits and fruit as they waited for their mum to get home and cooked dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThursday then was their first time eating take-away for dinner, their mum ordering in 2 large pizzas and two servings of brownies with the intent of there being enough left for the girls to take to school for lunch the next day. The girls however made a serious dent, eating one of the pizzas between them, which was as much as their mother ate. This again left them quite gassy and stuffed and they lazed around and played their PlayStation again before eating the brownies for dessert and collapsing in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Friday had also been uneventful, going to their first day at their new school although they kept mainly to themselves. They were currently whispering and conspiring about what they should get their mum to buy on the way home that afternoon, seeing as they\u2019d only had a quarter of a pizza each for lunch. They also had their first swimming lesson at the indoor pool in their new town and while swimming used to be their favourite activity, they were now looking forward to their afternoon binge far more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, donuts would be best!\u201d Zoe whispered, \u201cStacy used to say they were her favourite and I want to try them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut McDonalds would be so good,\u201d Stella replied, \u201cI really want to try a big Mac.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMm, that would be nice.\u201d Zoe said thoughtfully, the image of a huge greasy burger just for her making her mouth water, \u201cBut we had pizza for lunch I want something sweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then their mum pulled up in their car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on girls get in, we\u2019ve got to go pick up your swimming stuff from home!\u201d Their mum shouted from the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins got in the car they found a McDonald\u2019s bag each on the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you girls might be hungry after your small lunch so I got you each a snack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls ripped open their paper bags to find a small burger meal, not much food but enough to last them for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Zoe stopped and turned to her mum, \u201cThanks mum but can we get donuts?\u201d She pleaded, \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to getting some all day.\u201d She finished, putting on her biggest puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mum turned to look at Zoe and instantly fell for the puppy dog eyes, \u201cWell alright, I\u2019m sure we can pick up a box. You can finish it for dessert too.\u201d<br>\r\nZoe cheered and Stella smiled through her mouthful of fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls finished their McDonald meals as they drove home and their mum rushed inside to get their swimming suits, and then talked excitedly between themselves about the donuts they\u2019d soon be eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at the local crispy cr\u00e8me their mum turned to the twins and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright girls, you can get two donuts each, one for now and one for after dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe pouted, \u201cAw but mum, I\u2019m still hungry. You didn\u2019t give us much lunch and that snack was pretty small too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mum felt a wave of guilt at her children\u2019s hunger, feeling as though her inability to feed them enough was a sign of her failing as a parent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell alright then, we can get a mixed dozen, but I don\u2019t want you two eating too much now or you won\u2019t want to swim!\u201d She finished sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls cheered at this and waited excitedly as their mum made the purchase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins took a donut each and Zoe clutched the box protectively as they walked back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they drove to the pool their mum made the mistake of not checking just how many of the donuts the girls were eating, instead revelling in the silence that permeated the car while they didn\u2019t talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that silence was broken as they pulled into the swimming pool carpark and a huge belch erupted from the back seat. And before their mum could reprimand Zoe\u2019s manners, Stella let out her own loud belch, rivalling her sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGirls!\u201d Their mum said sternly, \u201cManners!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls replied \u201cSorry mum.\u201d In unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother got out of the car with a sigh and went around to the back of the car to get out the bag with all their swimming stuff in it. After she was done she was surprised to find the rear doors to their car still closed. The girls loved swimming, usually she could barely keep up as they ran to the water, so why were they still sitting in the car?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to Zoe\u2019s door and opened it, only to find her daughters still sitting in their seats, burping and rubbing their stuffed bellies, the messy remains of their meal still stuck on their faces and their eyes glazed over as they digested their meals. Their bellies weren\u2019t very big but they looked pretty obvious on their otherwise skinny bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on girls, what\u2019re you doing?\u201d She asked, more than slightly confused, \u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, urp, we don\u2019t really feel like, urp, swimming after those, urp donuts.\u201d Zoe said, struggling to keep her gas down as she rubbed her own belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d They\u2019re mum asked confused, before seeing the completely empty donut box sitting between the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ate them all?\u201d She said, more shocked than angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! Urp, they were delic-urp-ous.\u201d Stella said, her hands also rubbing her own swollen belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you if you ate too many you wouldn\u2019t want to swim!\u201d Their mum said in frustration, \u201cCome on, we\u2019ve driven all the way here so I think you should at least try to swim for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls groaned out loud, but went to get themselves out of the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls walked into the changing rooms with an exaggerated slowness, each still using both their hands to rub their bubbly bellies, letting out burps the whole way. Their mum was slightly embarrassed by their constant gas, messy faces and exaggerated belly rubbing, avoiding eye contact with the other parents who\u2019d brought their children to the swimming pool after school. Luckily, due to their snack brake all the other kids were already in the pool and the changing room was empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls got to taking their school uniforms off, stripping down so they could get their swimsuits on. Their mum opened the bag with all the swimming gear in it and quickly handed each girl a swimsuit, Zoe getting a pink one and Stella getting a blue one. They were simple one piece swimmers, basically just a square of fabric with holes cut out of the bottom with straps on top to go over the girl\u2019s shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stepped into their swimsuits and pulled them up, being very careful to not bend too much and put undue pressure on their stuffed bellies. When they had finally put their swimsuits on they stood there, burping still and rubbing their bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mum was slightly shocked at the sight of them, their faces were messy and their usually very form fitting swimsuits now looked even more so as the tight plastic outfits hugged their swollen bellies, accentuating just how much they had managed to stuff in there. They looked a few months pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, their mum asked \u201cAlright, now that you\u2019re dressed are you two still sure you don\u2019t want to swim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d the twins replied in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess there\u2019s no point in making you.\u201d Their mum said, trying to keep her frustration down. The girls were a mess and maybe it was best she didn\u2019t force the issue right now, she could always bring them next week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls sat their burping, still waiting for their mum to make a move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh their mum went to pack up the bag, putting the girl\u2019s school uniforms in it. \u201cAlright girls let\u2019s go. There\u2019s no point in you changing out of your swimsuits again yet, you can do that at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls grunted in agreement and followed their mum back to the car, and sat quietly, except for the burping, the entire trip home, their usual energy quelled by their full bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls collapsed on the couch as soon as they got home and just sat there watching tv, not even bothering to play games. Their mum gave them a sandwich each for dinner to top them up so they wouldn't get hungry during the night, and then sent them to bed.</span></span></div></div>",

Mary followed here and looked where she went<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maaaary! I'm here.\"Rachel yelled in the box with balls. \"See if you can catch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel dived under the balls. But Mary saw clearly where she went. It was like a giant moll crawled under the balls. She could easily see where her sister went. She could of course just follow her. She would come up, sooner or later. But she decided to keep it fun for both of them. So she also crawled under the balls toward her sister. It did't take long. Soon she grabbed a struggling body. But when the both came from under the balls she suddenly noticed she grabbed a other kid by accident. She looked around and saw Rachel appear from under the balls and ran away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if you can catch me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, sorry. I thought you were... someone else.\" Mary apologized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all right.\" The other kid said. \"No problem. Now go catch your sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked where her sister could have gone. The she saw her running to the toddler section of the play land. She sighed. She hoped Rachel had outgrown her toddler time. Mostly Rachel did act according to her age but there were moments she still acted a bit childish, like now. besides Rachel was still a bit short for her age. The doctor said she would soon have a growth spurt. But for now she was still kind of short.<br>\r\nShe went down a slide. Mary sighed and also went on the slide. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She can't get off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, come back. I'm stuck.\" Mary said still struggling to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel heard what Mary said and ran to the slide looking shocked to see Mary stuck to the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, Mary I'm so sorry I went you through this.\" Rachel said feeling really sorry for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't worry yourself Rachel\" Mary said \"Just help me get unstuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rachel got up to Mary by grabbing one of her arms and pull while Mary uses the other arm to push herself out. They kept trying to get her out but Mary is still stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, It's not working. I'm still stuck.\" Mary said a bit upset \"Go get mom, maybe she can help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then Mary.\" Rachel acknowledged<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then ran towards their mom and told her about Mary's problem. ms. Summers then followed Rachel to where Mary is. Their mom helped out by pushing Mary's sides. With that and Rachel's pulling, they got Mary out of the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, thank you Rachel and mom. I thought I'd never get out.\" Mary said relieved<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you do seem to getting bigger Mary.\" her mom said \"You should probably not go to the small places if we don't want something like this happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mom, I'll be more careful of where I go.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo then they leave Mcdonald's and got into the car and are driving home. While driving, Rachel still feels bad about herself about bringing Mary to the slide that got her stuck. Mary was noticing Rachel being depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, what's wrong?\" Mary said <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary, I'm sorry that I put you though all this. I just wanted to play around.\" Rachel said sounding a bit sad<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still thinking about that?\" Mary asked with Rachel nodding in agreement. \"Look Rachel, You're right\" Mary said in a supportive tone \"You were just playing around. You couldn't have known about it when you were having so much fun. Look Rachel, you're a good girl and a fun little sister. So no matter what, I will still love you as my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rachel asked with Mary nodding yes. Then both Mary and Rachel hugged each other and Rachel feels better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got back home, the girls and their mom went inside the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok girls\" their mom said \"Dinner will be in a few hours. Don't spoil your appetites for dinner. Especially you Rachel, tonight it's your favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Gasp) Lasagna? Yay!\" Rachel said with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the girls are waiting for supper with Rachel thinking about the lasagna. She would love it for having so much in it and she especially love the cheese on it. Rachel couldn't wait for supper. after some time.....</span></div></div>",

Mary followed but a lot slower. She smiled when she thought about what happened on the slide. The fact that she got stuck on a slide made her feel kind of... proud. She knew she was fat and she wanted to get fatter. No one knew this except Rachel and a few good friends. Rachel also wanted to be like her but she could't eat like Mary could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it looks yummy.\" Rachel said looking a a very big lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary must admit it did look delicious. It looked pretty big. Their mother was't such a big eater but she knew Mary could eat a lot. And Rachel... she would probably eat herself sick. She did't really knew her limits. Lucky for her Mary always cleaned her plate for her. But with lasagna... Rachel liked it so much she thought it was worth the pain in her belly. Until she really was in pain from eating to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you two are hungry. We need to eat all this and daddy comes home tomorrow. So it's just the three of us tonight.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Mommy! I'm starving! I want some lasagna now!\" Rachel yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me first cut out a piece for me, then you two can have the rest.\" Their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel knew very well her mother would just take a small piece. But as soon as he was done Rachel cut out a huge piece for herself. So did Mary and both girls started to stuff their faces. Mary showed her huge appetite and Rachel showed she loved lasagna. Rachel was the first who cleaned her plate and took another huge part of the lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel take it easy. You don't want to get a tummy ache like last time, or the time before that.\" Their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo. But I think I can handle it.\" Rachel mumbled slowly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then.\" Their mother said not really convinced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary cleaned her plate and ate the remaining lasagna and wolfed it down fast. When the two girls were both done they were sitting in their chairs with round tummies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we leave the table mommy?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure you two can. I'll clean the table.\" Their mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Rachel waddled to the T.V in the other room. But Mary noticed Rachel's painful moans and the fact she was holding her tummy. She fell down on the couch. still moaning.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I guess you overdid it again with the lasagna.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe liked it when Rachel did this since it would stretch her tummy a bit so she would be able to hold more food in the future. She bend over to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here I help you.\" She said and started to rub her sisters belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel soon started too feel better and looked thankfully at her sister. Mary smiled and continued rubbing her sisters belly while watching T.V. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The mean jokes they made were't even funny. She did like her fat but disliked the teasing that came with it. But she had friends who did't mind how fat she was. With them she could deal with the teasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee Mary are you still able to fit through the door?\" A boy yelled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did't knew hippo's were allowed at school!\" A girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary knew that it was best to ignore them. Besides she was pretty slow thanks to her weight and they were thin and pretty fast so she could't catch them. She sighed and walked to her class. It was a comforting thing to knew that her sister did't have to go through this. At least not yet. She wished she did find a way to fatten her sister up fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel sorry for your chair!\" A girl said who walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked angry at her. When they started teasing some years ago she started crying. But after some years she was used to it. She could't do anything about it. After all it were just words. However... there were some girls who were more mean. Who also really hurt her, Like mean redhead Daisy, or slimy Susan. They were real mean who also really hurt you. And she was an easy target. She walked in her class room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I thought there was a earthquake but it was just you!\" A boy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you stand on a scale it read: People, people, please one at a time!\" A girl yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to them. They're stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked up and smiled when she saw her friend Diana. Fast she went sitting on the desk next to her. Diana was tall but pretty chubby with bright red hair a almond shaped green eyes. Mary believed she would once be a real beautiful girl were all boys would be drooling about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike I said don't listen to them. I like your big belly. I have also a nice jelly belly.\" Diana said while pointing at her belly, however it was smaller then Mary's. \"Besides you're planning to gain more weight right. It's fine. I support you. I think it looks good at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do I.\" A voice said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked over her shoulder and saw Virgina. Bit of a tomboy with her short blond hair and dungarees with a few stains on it. A girl who was't worried to get dirty and liked cars and motor's. <br>\r\nSuddenly she saw Jennifer walk over to them. Jennifer was kind of small and thin as a rail. She had dark brown hair till her shoulders and a pinched face with a tiny cute nose and beautiful big brown friendly eyes. She went sitting on the spot next to Susan.<br>\r\nMary smiled. Her three best friends. All three knew about her desire to gain and supported her in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it seemed like you gained some more.\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... but I feel a bit bad for Rachel.

Most others of the team did enough. So Mary could just stand in a corner of the field doing nothing. <br>\r\nThen their teacher entered. If you saw him you could be scared. He was about seven feet tall and was all muscle. He was black with a bold head with a beard of a few days. Huge shoulders and arms round from muscles. A wide chest and visible abs. Sure he looked dangerous. Some people whispered he used to worked in the army. Like a drill sergeant. But the kids were't scared of him. They knew he looked kind of mean and scary but was in reality pretty friendly. Especially to the young kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you all.\" He said on a friendly tone what made him look less scary. \"Today I had something new in mind for you to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine a new sport.\" Mary whispered disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ...\"   </span></div></div>",

I want to design clothes. But I wanna do one special thing. I also wanna design clothes for chubby and fat girls. Most people design clothes for toothpick girls. There are't any nice clothes for fat girls. At least not many. So I wanna design clothes for thin, normal, chubby and fat people. So I can reach everyone. That's what I wanna do. I already have ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always want to become... a mother. With a lot of kids. Five. Or more. Girls and boys. Both of them.\" Jennifer said with a dreamy look on her face.\"Of course I need to have a boyfriend first. But I don't think that will be too hard. I look cute. Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking cute is not enough. Sometimes the ones who look cute are't so cute in reality. Like my cousin had on Internet. She met a guy He was so nice and sweet. Told her nice things. He seemed perfect. Fantastic. But one day she got a bit drunk and send him a video where she was naked. He wanted to see more. But she refused. Suddenly he was't so nice anymore...\" Virginia said. \"However she told her parents and they called the police and all. So she's save now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do you wanna become when you grow up?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought mechanic or something like that. Stuff where they use engines. Maybe when I graduate they already have robots. Can I repair robots. That's pretty cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you Mary? What do you wanna become?\" Jennifer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanna become fat. No way beyond that. Morbidly obese. A Immobile blob.\" Mary mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that. But like work. You know. A job or something like that. Because become a mother is't really a job Jennifer. It's hard work and all, but still. You don't get paid for it.\" Virginia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah what do you wanna do?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't have anything to come with it, but when it comes to sports, she knows one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I grown up, I wanna be a sumo wrestler.\" That was Mary had her mind of being a sumo, even she can imagined herself being one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that sounds cool!\"  Jennifer replied with a positive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, in fact, my Dad's a trainer down to where I live, and he does take sumo lessons for anyone this age, and I'm one of them.  If you wanna try it out, you're more than welcome to come along.\"  Diana says in reply and she had no problem explaining that her father is a head trainer for sumos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat lit Mary's eyes up when thinking about it, it was as if she never thought this could be a chance to get herself big, but also to be a sumo wrestler she never knew she wanted this way.  she did played a part when stuffed in pillows whilst still chubby at the time, but it would feel like her dream would become a reality and thoughts this could be her chance to give this a go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll give this try and hopefully I'll become good at it.\"  Mary tempted with a smile and would make a sumo pose by stomping onto the floor, when the girls giggled and surely this would be the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, this should be fun indeed!\"  Diana says and would sure let her father know her friend would be coming down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they talked, the bell had started to ring and it was time to head to class.  They've waved their goodbyes for now and gone to their separate ways.  Until then, Mary would be much looking forward of becoming a sumo wrestler, whilst she would need some more food to try and gain some more weight in her body.   </span></div></div>",

Even if other kids did tease her about it. But Mary could handle it. She was used to it and she had friends she could turn to. Rachel could't handle it and did't have any good friends like Mary.<br>\r\nShe rubbed her own belly. Sure she was chubby but not fat. She wondered if she would like it. Sure she hated the teasing but Mary seemed okay being fat and Mary was her roll model. Mary did had friends even while she was fat. According to what she heard from Mary being fat was a good thing, but still... she was't able to eat as much if Mary. She wondered why. How could she ever become fat with such a small appetite.<br>\r\nThen the door of their room opened and their mother walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rise and shine girls. You don't wanna be late for school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls moaned by the word school. None of them really liked school that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Rachel I rather had you stayed home today. The doctor said you should give that sprained ankle some rest. Stay home today, take it easy in the weekend and then you can go back to school on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about the sleepover?\" Mary asked a bit worried Rachel perhaps could't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Mary. When school's over I will drop her and both of your sleeping bags of at Diana's house. But don't gonna play hide-and-seek or tag or anything that includes a lot running or walking. That ankle of her needed some rest. But I guess she would't really use her ankle that much during a sleepover, so I guess it's fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So you drop of my sleeping bag.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And some clean clothes and Wolfie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfie was a stuffed animal that looked like a little wolf cub.

Did't the doctor said that you should give that ankle some rest?\"<br>\r\n    <br>\r\n\"Yeah he did.\" Rachel said while her dad picked her up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they stood in line. Rachel smiled laying in her father's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want sweet hart?\" Her father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought what too take. She did want to gain but she was't sure she could eat too much. But at the other hand she did love burger King and perhaps this was a good opportunity to stuff herself a bit. But could she really eat so much.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After eating her first burger Rachel immediately started eating her second burger. After eating her second burger Rachel's belly started feeling a little tight and she started to rub her belly and was moaning and her father noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Rachel?\" asked her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's just I think that I may have ordered a burger too many\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would it be alright if we went home now and save that burger for another day?\" asked her dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I think so\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was upset since she wanted to gain weight but unfortunately she has such a small appetite especially when compared to Mary who she has seen eating more than double then what she ordered and still have room for more. So they went to their car and drove home and when they arrived they saw that Rachel's mom was back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alice\" said Rachel's dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Robert, so how did you and Rachel enjoyed Burger King?\" asked Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great, but I ordered a burger too many and I didn't eat it\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well that's okay, we'll just put it in the fridge and you can eat it another day\" said Alice as she put the burger in the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dad can you take me to the living room so I can watch the?\" asked Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing sweetheart\" said Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking Rachel and putting her on the couch Rachel watched tv while her parents were in the kitchen talking and from the laughter she heard it must have been a pleasant talk. After watching tv for a while her mother came from upstairs with two bags in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright I packed you both your pajamas, some clean clothes, your toothbrushes and your sleeping bags\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget Wolfie for Mary\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I made sure to pack Wolfie. Now just to let you know your father will be driving you instead of me\" said Alice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said Rachel's dad put her in the car and drove to Mary's school. When they arrived he called out to Mary who was surprised at first but when she recognized him she went up to hug him and after that she got into the car and they went to Diana's house.</span></div></div>",

They're my friends.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir dad bent over to Mary and whispered: \"Keep an eye on Rachel okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile their dad drove away Mary rang the doorbell. Diana opened the door with a bright smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary! Rachel. I'm so happy you could come. Come right in. Virginia and Jennifer are already here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was surprised when she saw the room. It was obvious this room was made for kids. There were some chairs and tables but they were kind of small. Easy to sit on or use when you're a little kid. There were boxes full of toys. The closets were filled with toys and boardgames and drawing stuff. There was also a computer with lots of games but also... a big T.V with DVD player and a lot of movies for kids next too it. Two couches were standing for the T.V so the kids could easily watch. There were two mattresses on the floor. Virginia and Jennifer were talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But He really likes Ronnie .N. I'm sure of it. They just don't want that everybody else to know.\" Virginia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would't they? Love is a beautiful thing.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah. On high school. If you're in love in elementary school all class mates tease you. Oh hi Mary... Rachel.\" Said Virginia<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello girls.\" Mary said. \"Ready for a sleepover?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all cheered.<br>\r\nThe next hours were filled with talking about what happened on school, funny things they saw on T.V or on the computer and watching T.V. Rachel must admit she did had fun. The other four girls really tried to take her up in their conversations. Perhaps they only did it to do her and Mary a favor but she had fun. <br>\r\nA moment when Rachel was talking with Virginia and Jennifer Diana tapped Mary on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to start. My mom ordered pizza's. I made sure she ordered enough since you and I eat a bit more then a normal girl. But also because tonight we're gonna force your sister to eat more. If she eats more after she thinks she's full her stomach will stretch. If we do that on a daily basis she'll be able to eat more in the future. I already told Virginia and Jennifer\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah all right... but eh.... If we feed her way too much... it comes all back out again right. I remember I once tried to eat without paying attention to my complaining tummy. Finally it all came back out again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to be careful that does't happen. Sure it will hurt in the beginning... but we do this to help her. We wanna give her the chance to become fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that's true. No pain no gain. Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later they heard the door bell. Diana walked too the door and returned with several pizza's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great I love pizza!\" Virgina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll girl grabbed slices from several pizza's. Trying different flavors. Diana and Mary showed the could eat but noticed that Rachel was full after a half pizza and one slice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm full.\" Rachel mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you're not little Rachel.\" Diana said. \"You see... I like you. You're the little sister from of one my best friends. You have a nice personalty. You're fun to hang out with. That's why we also invited you. But we know you want to gain. But you don't seem able to gain thanks to a small appetite. So we made a plan to help you gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. However it might hurt a bit. We just need to stretch your stomach by pushing more food in it.\" Virginia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. But girls I'm full already.\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just need to eat more.\" Diana said and brought a slice to Rachel's face who held her mouth shut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Rachel.\" Mary said. \"We're only doing this to help you. You know I would never hurt you on purpose. Now just cooperate and eat or else we have to force it down your throat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked at Mary, at the slice and at the others. She felt so full. But she wanted to get fat. This could help her. What should she do?       </span></div></div>",

As expected it started to hurt belly but she kept eating anyway because she's always wanted to be fat like Mary.

We got chocolate chip cookies, chocolate cake, chocolate ice cream and just regular chocolate\" said Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was torn, she really loved anything chocolate but she felt like if she kept eating she'll either explode or throw up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a little room for more\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls then fed Rachel the entire chocolate cake which made her extremely full but before she could say anything they started feeding her the ice cream and the cookies. None of them could imagine the pain in Rachel's stomach and none of them knew as they were too busy feeding her cookies and ice cream. However Mary then noticed a tear on Rachel's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys I think we should stop now\" said Mary as they all started to notice the tear on Rachel's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was feeling pretty sick and she didn't know if she could keep it all in or not. </span></div></div>",

But just a tiny bit of her liked the feeling of being this over stuffed. But she was in so much pain. Suddenly she felt the pizza crawling back up but she swallowed it down. She laid back her belly sticking up in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think she surely gained a few pounds.\" Virginia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to wait until it has digested.\" Jennifer sad who softly pinched Rachel's belly. \"All the food is now in her belly. After it digest it turns into fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It hurts so much.\" Rachel moaned.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh I don't like seeing her in so much pain.\" Mary said. \"Can't we do something to help her ease the pain a bit?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... the pain is just something she needs to go through. Several times. but your belly get's used to hold more food this way. But I guess we can give her some belly rubs. That will take away the stuffed feeling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Jennifer started right away rubbing the round swollen belly of Rachel. Rachel must admit that it felt good. But she wondered if there was't another way to get fat. But she liked the belly rubs. She felt again pizza coming up but swallowed it down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Her belly is really hard. Like a solid rock.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happens after you stuffed yourself to the brim. I have done it several times. My belly was always hard after wards.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Rachel. But if you wants to get fat you need to eat more. This way we're gonna stretch your stomach. See it like a t-shirt. You know that if you pull long enough at a T-shirt it stretches. We're doing the same witch your stomach. Or see it like a balloon. Blowing a balloon up the first time it's kind of hard. But if you blow it up once it's easier blowing it up a second time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But balloons... can... explode. \" Rachel mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I don't think that's true. I never heard a human explode from eating too much food. Sure there are some silly kid stories about it but I never heard somebody really explode.\" Diana said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch me with a sharp object and I will proof you I can.\" Rachel whispered so soft only Mary and Jennifer heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct me if I'm wrong, but my mother always tells my fat little sister that it does't matter so much how much you eat but what you eat. Fatty stuff makes you fat while you should stay way from fruit and vegetables. However we fed you a lot of fattening stuff so...\" Virginia said slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True.\" Diana said. \"But that's just part of it. Getting fat is part what you eat and part how much you eat. Like you get way more calories from a huge bar of chocolate then from a apple. But you get really fat if you combine eating more and fattening stuff. And seeing Rachel she really needed it. Sorry for that Rachel but don't worry. You'll will get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and I will help you all the way.\" Mary said. \"You're my little sister. I won't let you do this alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel felt again pizza coming up but she swallowed it down again and this time for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also don't do to much exercise.\" Virginia said. \"That's a way to lose weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they did't have to worry about that.\" Mary thought. \"Jennifer never really was an active kid.\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But it had been terrible but the dream already started to fade away like it mostly does. Sometimes you're able to remember a dream but mostly you forget them as soon if you wake up. Sometimes you remember a few parts but mostly you totally forget what the dream was about. Rachel did her best to remember. She remembered it included a lot of food, pain and weight gain but that was all. <br>\r\nHowever there was one good part. She was't sure if it was because of the nightmare but she felt pretty good. The pain of pizza stuffing was gone. Sure the pain had been terrible but if this was the way to get fat like her sister she would do it. She rubbed her belly and realized she could eat something. <br>\r\nAll others were still asleep. She could clearly see her sister. The shape of her huge belly was clearly visible.<br>\r\nShe remembered a fairy tale about a man who had six servants. One had such a huge eye that everything he looked at exploded. One could stick out his neck very far, one got it cold while it was warm for everybody else. But one of them was very fat. When he slept other people thought you saw a mountain. Just like she now saw the belly of her sister. However her sisters belly was nowhere near a mountain. She did't believe anybody could reach that size. It was a fairytale after all.<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw the small shape of Jennifer and Virginia. She looked further and saw the chubby form of Diana. Suddenly she noticed something. The eyes of Diana opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Hi Rachel.\" She said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Diana. Did I wake you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No don't worry. Anyway I'm sorry for stuffing you with that pizza. It was't fun for you. But you got to believe me. I just want to help you get fat. That's what you want right. Else I will stop right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do want to get fat just like Mary. But it was so painful. But I guess no pain no weight gain. (giggle) Anyway... it's strange but I could eat something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Does it already has effect?\" Diana asked and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. I think it's better of we let the others sleep. We go to the kitchen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girl slowly slept barefooted too the kitchen. Diana opened the refrigerator and suddenly smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel Eat this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw two pounds of butter and looked with a smile at Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat Rachel. Believe me. Butter is one of the most fattening things in the world. It's about 80 % fat. Believe me. You can't go wrong with butter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled. She did't knew this but thought Diana was right. But she never ate butter. Sure she had eaten bread with butter before. But just eating butter without anything else was different. She took one huge bite of better but suddenly realized she liked the taste of butter. She started to stuff her face with it. Soon two entire pounds of Butter were in Rachel's belly.<br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

I'm sure she will gain a lot from that. Together with all that pizza, pudding and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was interrupted by a loud belch from Rachel with a empty bowl of whipped cream next to her. She had a silly grin on her face. Sure she was in pain from eating so much... but it was a good kind of pain. She knew her stomach was stretching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the whipped cream. I think we better take this little butterball to bed \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel did't complain when Mary and Diana pulled her on her feet and waddled with her back to the living room and put her in her sleeping bag.

A few wrinkles at his eyes told her he laughed often. Rachel understood why Diana's mom married him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there tiny. You're... Rachel. Mary's little sister is that right. The one with the appetite of a mice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh! I'm just trying to gain weight. I want to be like my big sister. I wanna be fat. Have a huge big belly. Bigger butt and thighs. I wanna be fat but... at the same time... I don't want that they tease me with it. I know some kids tease Mary with her size. However she's very confident being fat. I'm not sure if I am if I'm fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Confidence can come from many things. Weight, muscle, clothes and other stuff. But I guess you gotta choose. Being fat and be teased with it or stay thin and not... or well not be teased about your size. But you probably get  teased anyway. Bully's pick out a easy target. If it''s not about your weight they do it about clothes or hair or freckles. So that really does't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I do wanna be fat. Just like my sister. I already started by over stuffing me.. Yesterday and during a midnight snack. It worked. I ate more during breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel do you know what I do for work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh... I know your wife is a teacher in kindergarten.\" Rachel mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and she's good with kids. But I'm not. Well I'm also good with kids... I think but I'm no teacher. I'm a scientist. I'm creating new things that can help the world. Help people. Perhaps I have something that can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached in his pocket and took out a little box. He opened it. Inside were seven white pills. Rachel looked at them and then back at Diana's father. Not really knowing what to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invented those pills. What you need to do is: take a glass of water and put the pill in it. It soon dissolves. Then you drink it. Don't worry it tastes sweet. Now the pill makes you hungry. It also makes you able to eat more, slows down your metabolism and makes almost anything you eat turn into fat. It has't been tested on humans yet, so we don't know if it has any side effects. But if you really want this... I can make you our guinea pig. So take one of those pills each morning. I'm sure you'll soon see results. Now don't tell anyone about this all right. It's just our secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel put on big eyes. She was't really sure. But why would Diana's father do anything bad to her. She wanted to gain weight. So why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right I'll do it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. wait here. He returned a few seconds later wit a glass with water and put on pill in it. It soon started to dissolve. It did't looked much different. Rachel took the glass and took one sip. It tasted delicious. She drank the rest of the glass in one go. She waited. One minute... two minutes and after three minutes Rachel felt something in her belly gurgling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh men I'm hungry. I better get back to the kitchen. See if the have some waffles left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't forget the pills. One each morning in a glass of water and don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel put the box with pills in her pocket and ran back to the kitchen.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

But if she gained a few extra pounds that would't be too bad. Besides she never really cared about Mary's weight and that was way higher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you two. Time to say bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls moaned. They were having a lot of fun together. But they all three knew That they needed to go. The two girls walked inside to pack their bags.

Rachel bend for over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom can we stop to get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother was so surprised she almost drove the car in the river. That Mary would ask her to stop to get something to eat , that was normal. she knew Mary could eat a lot but Rachel. That was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel are you feeling all right honey?\" Their mother asked worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I'm fine. Just a bit hungry, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Mary also looked surprised at her sister. Was she kidding? Or was she just trying to stuff herself over the limit like yesterday. Probably but she already did that at breakfast. At least she never saw her sister eat so much at breakfast. She knew that their plan was to stretch Rachel's stomach so it could hold more food. But she thought it would take longer to have this much effect. But apart from what Rachel's reason was she bend for over too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom I also would like some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother sighed. But that Mary asked for extra food was normal. Since both were hungry she decided to stop at the drive through at Mc Donalds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Mary?\" Their mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh two big mac's, and fries and a strawberry milkshake. Super size that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. What about you Rachel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same. But I rather have a vanilla milkshake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth looked in disbelieve at Rachel. She never was a big eater. Besides she had a big breakfast not too long ago. Could she really eat this much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you'll be able to eat all that honey. It's a lot of food.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I can. Mary is also allowed to take it. So why would't I be allowed to take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother had no answer and no reason so she ordered what both girls asked. <br>\r\nNo body noticed that Rachel softly stroke her pocket in which the pills were.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Wait what did Diana's father said? Take one pill each day. Perhaps the idea to take another pill just to be able to finish the food from Mc Donalds was't the best idea I ever had. So just take one pill each day. That's easy. I'm normally the first one awake. Then I can take one. But to be sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a little box. It was a nice box decorated with fake gem's and her name on it with red letters. She took her teddy bear. The teddy bear had a zipper on his back. She opened the zipper and took  key that was hidden inside the teddy bear. She used they key to open the box and put the pills in it and closed it after wards and hide the key again inside the bear. It was her biggest secret not even her sister or mother knew were she hide the key. That box was something that she used for special things. No body except she had access to that box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. No one knows about it except for me. Oh I wonder how Mary is doing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel walked to the living room. Mary was on the couch. At her feet she saw a empty bag of pretzels and a empty box of cookies. She was busy eating cookies from another box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hungry?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well I think I'm full after this box. I don't know why I'm suddenly so hungry. You too. I saw you at breakfast. you really stuffed those waffles inside. I never saw you eat so much. At least not on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess that pizza binge did stretch my stomach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary pulled up one eye brow. Stretching Rachel's stomach was what she tried to do but that took time. They need to several times over stuff her before it would finally be stretched. This was way to fast. She had a feeling Rachel kept something from her. But maybe she was just seeing things.<br>\r\nRachel also watched T.V but after one and half hour Rachel noticed she did feel hungry again.

There they saw all types of animals that lived in the Arctic such as belugas, walruses and of course penguins. Mary and Rachel were fascinated to see all of these unique animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got out of the exhibit both of their bellies growled and their parents got them Popsicles. Both of their parents needed to go to the bathroom so they found one near them and they asked Mary to look after Rachel while they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how are you enjoying your day so far Rachel?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty good, all I need is to see the Komodo dragons and it will be the best-\" said Rachel as she suddenly saw someone she recognized. \"Mary let's go sit somewhere else\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because of them\" said Rachel as she pointed to a group of girls her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know them?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they're the ones who called you a pig and said I was going to be a pig and then pushed me... \" said Rachel as she was tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary suddenly remembered how angry she was that day and how she would take revenge on whoever did that to Rachel and now the ones who did it are right in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It did't take long before the kids saw her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it looks like a hippo has escaped!\" One of the girls said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is't that the fat sow sister of the little piglet we teased yesterday?\" Another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the ones who teased my sister?\" Mary asked angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first girl dad a few steps back. Mary was taller, older and way fatter then her.  Three things who could work in her advantage when it came to a fight. None of the girls really wanted to get into a fight with the huge girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. So what fat ass. You're a fat pig and since she's your sister she's also a fat little piglet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? Rachel is not fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled weakly. She did take a pill this morning. Before the others woke up. She noticed she ate a lot at breakfast. Mary did noticed it too. Rachel also noticed her clothes felt a bit tighter. But that did't matter right now.<br>\r\nMary however did't wait for the girl to answer. She bumped with her belly forward much faster then you would expect from somebody Mary's size. The girl at the front was pushed backwards. Tears welled up in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Au! That hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really. My little sister has sprain her ankle thanks to you. Think you that was fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stood up but Mary pinned her with her belly against a short rock wall. The girl looked over her shoulder and gulped. The rock wall was around a deep hole. And in the hole were two tigers. The girl was trapped between the wall and this girls belly. Suddenly Mary noticed the girl hold a bag of candy. She snatched the bag away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well. What now if I push you over this wall. Then at least the tigers have a decent meal. You have a terrible personalty but I'm sure you taste fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? No! You would't dare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls started to worry for their friends life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let Angelique go.\" A different girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah don't do anything to her we promise we will never tease Rachel again.\" A girl with purple hair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You promise you'll leave Rachel alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scouts honor.\" The girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others also mumbled: \"Scouts honor\" or \"We promise\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good but... leave those bags of candy here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave them or I throw her to the tigers anyway!\" Mary yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls left their candy on a spot of the wall near Mary. Mary stepped backwards. The girl ran to her friends and together they ran away. Mary grabbed the bags and waddled back to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here'you Popsicle. It'almost melted. I saw what you did. Hopefully they don't tease me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so and if they do, we at least have their candy.

She looked around and saw Mary in the other bed. You could't miss her. She remembered she once heard a story about a man who had a few strange servants. One had such a big eye everything he looked at explodes. One could stick out his neck very far, however one of them was so fat that when he slept his belly looked like a mountain. Just like the belly of her sister did. Well perhaps not really a mountain. but a hill. A small hill. She heard the soft breathing of her sister what mend she was still asleep.<br>\r\nRachel took her key and opened her box and took one pill and after that closed the box again. She walked bare footed to the kitchen. She grabbed a cup and filled it with water. She let the pill fell in the water. waited a few seconds. Then she drank the entire cup in one go and waited. She let out a large belch and the next moment she felt the familiar hunger feeling. She really needed some food now.<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the freezer and took out a gallon of ice cream. She grabbed a spoon and carried the gallon of ice cream over to the T.V and started to watch some morning cartoons. In the meantime she ate the ice cream. not minding the stains she got on her pajamas who were getting pretty tight. Well thanks to the pill she would be able to eat more and it turned all the food she ate into fat. She noticed that she was starting to get a nice layer of fat on her body and must admit she liked it. also a bulge started to appear on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hour later Mary walked in and saw her sister on the couch with a empty gallon of ice cream on the table and her sister with ice cream stains on her pajama and face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel did you eat that entire gallon of ice cream?\" She asked surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUURRRRRP!!! Yes I did. I was just... hungry. To be honest I could still eat some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary started to get a bit worried. Not about the gallon of ice cream that did't matter. With Mary's appetite food disappeared all the time. But that Rachel ate so much food was strange. Sure she wanted to fatten Rachel. That's why she did her best so stretch Rachel's stomach at the sleepover but after that she started to eat way more then normal. As far if she knew it was impossible to stretch her stomach that much in one single day. When she took a better look at her sister she clearly saw the weight gain. She must admit it did look good at her sister. She thought it made Rachel look adorable and she would be happy to help Rachel to put on more weight. But she was worried why Rachel was gaining so fast. She also ate a lot but she did't gain that fast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling all right?\" Mary asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'm all right. No problem. Why do you ask?\" Rachel answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... It looks like you eat more and gain faster the you normally did. What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel bit on her lip. She did't wanna lie to Mary. She and her sister had always been really close and told each other everything. But she also promised not to say anything about those pills. But at the other she could trust Mary. Sure she could but however she promised not too tell.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rachel then got her box and opened it with the key that she kept in her teddy bear. After she opened her box she showed the pills to Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're pills that help me get hungrier\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just swallow one of these and you get a huge appetite like mine?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think anyone can have a huge appetite like yours but yeah pretty much.

Suddenly the door opened and their mom was standing in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good you're both up. You two better get dressed or you'll be late for school\" said their mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Rachel got dressed and went to the kitchen to eat breakfast. After that their mom drove them to school. She dropped Rachel off first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye sweetie have a nice day at school\" said Rachel's mom as she waved goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then entered the building and went to her first class which was math. She entered the classroom without saying anything or looking at anyone like she always does. While Rachel was comfortable with hanging out with her sister and her friends, she was completely shy about meeting new people which is the reason why she doesn't have any friends. The teacher ms Boyle entered the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning class\" said ms Boyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning ms Boyle\" said the children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before we get started on today's lesson I would like to introduce you to our new student\" said ms Boyle as signal for someone to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid who came in had white skin with freckles on his face, wore a sleeveless shirt and shorts and was skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Mickey Night he just move in town yesterday and today is his first at his new school so let's all try to make his first day as splendid as possible. Okay let's see ah you can sit next to Rachel\" said ms Boyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after a few hours of classes it was recess and Rachel as usual sat around and ate some snacks that her mom packed for her. She then noticed Mickey coming towards her which confused her since most of the children either ignore her or just say something mean and then walk away. When Mickey finally reached her she found out that Mickey is....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Well they tease me anyway so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to become fat you need to eat a lot so... want my lunch?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up a bit surprised.

Mary noticed that her sister seemed kind of happy. She also noticed that her little sister was gaining. She could clearly see how her sister's body was getting a nice layer of fat all over. Her belly but also her butt, thighs and even her arms. She seemed to be gaining weight all over her body. Mary liked to see her sisters weight gain. Her sister was gaining pretty fast but Mary knew it was partly thanks to those pills that turned everything the little Rachel ate into fat. Combined with the fact that she ate more made her gain even faster. Mary wondered what would happen after Rachel stopped taking the pills. Her weight gain would probably slow down but all the extra eating probably stretched her stomach so she would still eat more then before. Rachel took one this morning but was starting to get a bit worried. She only had two left and she did't had a single idea when she would see Diana's dad again, so he could give her some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. We're here. Now Mary, Rachel have a fun day at school. Come on. Give me a kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girl kissed their mother good bye and walked to the school. Suddenly Rachel saw Diana, ad her dad. You could't really miss him. He was one of the tallest people and not many people were so muscled. Rachel was happy she knew  how nice Diana's father was or else she would be scared for him.Fast she walked to him just after Diana walked toward school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh excuse me Mr.\" Rachel said polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello Rachel. Ah I see the pills are doing what they need to do. You gained a noticeable amount of weight.\" He said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they work great but eh... I only have two left, But I really wanna keep gaining soooo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I hoped I would see you. Here you go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her a bag with white pills. Rachel put on big eyes. With all those pills she would be able to gain a lot for a long time. She thankfully took the pills but thought she also should tell him something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh there's something else. I knew I promised not to tell anyone about it... but I did told Mary. But don't worry. Mary won't tell anyone else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...

I will look for some of my old clothes. You can wear those. Perhaps they will be a bit baggy on you since when I was your age I was fatter then you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then at least I have some room to grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not growing sis. You're gaining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. I'm growing. I don't care in which way but I am growing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked to school.   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But Diana did't knew about the pills and thought that Rachel still had her own small appetite and that she need to force Rachel to eat more so her stomach would stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must say I'm surprised.\" Diana said. \"Your stomach is a lot bigger then last time I saw you. I mean even before dinner. You're noticeable fatter and I clearly see your clothes are pretty tight, and you belly is playing peek-a- boo. I thought this process would take a lot more time then just a few days. Or have been eating butter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I'm just a born gainer.\" Rachel said on a innocent tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You? No! Born gainers are people who easily gain weight and normally have a big appetite. Like Mary. You on the other hand have a small appetite and barely gained weight... at least you did until the sleepover. But I don't get how you could have gained this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked at her friend. She thought about telling Diana about the pills but remembered she promised Rachel not to tell anyone else. Besides she did't want to let Diana know her own father gave pills to Rachel. At the other hand Rachel need help to get fatter. Mary and Diana were perfectly able to fatten themselves without any extra help.<br>\r\nDiana kept stuffing spoonful after spoonful in Rachel's mouth. Even with the effect of the pill Rachel was starting to become full. She knew that over stuffing stretched your stomach but she had't a clue what the effect would be with the pills. But she really wanted to get fatter. However she Really needed to ask Mary about her clothes. The next moment she felt on a strange way relieved, and also a cold breeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember that I told you your clothes were getting tight?\" Diana asked. \"You just popped two buttons of your blouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked down a saw Diana told the truth. Two buttons just popped of. She felt kind of proud. Diana fast fed her the last food on the table. But Rachel was really stuffed now. However she was't gonna tell that to Diana. At the sleepover Diana tried to stretch her stomach. That was something that needed to be done. But now with the pills she did't really need to stretch her stomach anymore. She did't want to be in pain again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was all the food. However I'm still surprised how you were able to gain so much weight and increased you appetite in just a few days. I watch you Rachel. But it looks good at you. You look very adorable with such a fat tummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled with white teeth, A bit of food between them. She rubbed her round fat tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange. You want to gain wight while hundreds of other people would kill to have a slender body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what they say: \"Nuts go to a old men with no teeth.\" Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So now what do wanna do?\" Rachel asked.</span></div></div>",

Now how do you think about a thin girl who's trying to gain weight to become a fat girl?\" Rachel asked excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be a fantastic girl. A girl that would make the world a more beautiful place.\" Mickey said and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's me! I want to become fat and make the world a more beautiful place. I wanna become fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you really wanna become fat you need to eat a lot.\" Betty said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah and it's almost dinner time Rachel. I can tell you our dinners are pretty fattening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel heard a loud rumbling suddenly coming out of her own tummy. She put a hand on top of her tummy and thought about the pill she took this morning. She softly started to smile. She was't sure if a fattening meal would really help her by gaining weight. Of course normally it would. But Diana's father said that the pill would turn all the food she ate into fat. But they mend it well. Besides if the food tasted good.    </span></div></div>",

She almost could't believe how fast the food disappeared in their mouths. The food went down so fast they barely seemed to have time to chew. Rachel fast started on the food on her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later she leaned back with  swollen belly. She rubbed her belly with a grin. Rachel was't entirely full. She had a good reason for that. There was't a crumb of food left on the table. Everything was gone. Except for the chocolate cake. Rachel was't a big eater but like most kids she was a sweet tooth. She loved chocolate cake. She looked with sparkling eyes at the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\" Betty said. \"Not too much but considering you just started gaining not bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least you ate a lot more then most others at our house.\" Sally said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Yvonne did eat more then...\" Alex started but was cut of by Sally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Yvonne ate more then her but she was also very fat That girl was almost spherical.

She remembered the huge dinner she had yesterday and thanks to the pill it all turned into fat. She was't so fat like Mary or the sisters of Mickey but she was't the toothpick girl she was some time ago. She found out she really wanted to be fat. Be confident just like her sister, or like the sisters of Mickey. They all seemed pretty confident being so fat. She wanted to be like that too. But for that she needed more pounds of fat on her body.<br>\r\n She then remembered something. She reached in her pocket and found a pill. She softly crawled out of her sleeping bag. On the tips of her toes she walked out of the room and too the bathroom. She soon saw a glass. She filled it with water and dropped the pill in it. Soon it dissolved and she drank the entire stuff in one go and smacked her lips.<br>\r\nShe felt the familiar rumbling in her belly and smiled. She was sure there would soon be a big breakfast downstairs. She soon walked back to Mickey's room and crawled back in her sleeping bag rubbing her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you wait. Soon you're gonna be filled with delicious food. Don't worry... I'm gonna stuff you to the brim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel put her hands behind her head  and looked at the sealing. She really liked Mickey, and his sisters. Seemed like she finally found a real friend. Of course Mary was also her friend but that was different. She was her sister. If Mary was't her sister they would't even know each other. However family was important. But it felt good having a friend. <br>\r\nShe wondered would Mickey maybe once become more then a friend. She heard enough of friends who fell in love. Well she did't thought she needed to worry about that. Boys and girls also could be friends without falling in love right. It would probably take some time before she really thought about love and relations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah so you're up.\" Mickey suddenly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Oh yeah. I'm up. I normally wake up pretty early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Did you sleep all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel thought about her dream. It was terrific. Being so fat and getting food from everybody. She was sad that it was't real. She felt so skinny now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I slept all right. Too bad it was just a dream. But I'm hungry now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just wait some time. Mostly when my mother and sisters wake up they start making breakfast. So if we wait some time then breakfast will ready by the time we go downstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but... what are we gonna do until then?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could...\" </span></div></div>",

Mary's friends were shocked that there was actually a kid who was fatter then their friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex spotted them, waive hello and invited them to sit with her and they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you must be Mary, pleasure to meet you\" said Alex as she shook Mary's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you too, so what did you want to talk about?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well when Rachel was sleeping over at my place she was talking about how fat you were and my mom was wondering how much you could eat and that got me interested in an eating contest against you\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An eating contest you and me this Saturday, so what do you say?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Mary started to say when suddenly Virginia started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary would demolish you in an eating contest\" said Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could she now?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virginia what are yo-\" said Jennifer before she was interrupted by Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only would she demolish you in an eating contest she would demolish your sisters, your mom, your dad in fact she would demolish your entire-\" said Virginia before she was pulled aside by Mary so they could talk privately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I was just trash talking her to psych her out before your eating contest, wrestlers do it all the time\" said Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know if I want an eating contest with her. I mean look how big her lunch is, my mom never makes big lunches like that\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it Mary you can do this, I've seen you eat you can totally beat her\" said Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright if you say so\" said Mary as she and Virginia went back to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Alex I except your challenge\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be any prizes?\" asked Jennifer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of any. What do you have in mind?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! The loser has to buy lunch for the rest of the school year\" said Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" said Alex as she finished her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow your mom sure packed a big lunch for you\" said Diana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this? Those were just the appetizers. THIS is my lunch\" said Alex as she put away her lunch box and brought out an even bigger one that had twenty ham sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have made a huge mistake\" though Mary as she saw Alex eat her sandwiches with no discomfort.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rachel went sitting at a table and took her lunchbox. She took another pill this morning and it was clearly she ate more and was gaining too. Sure it was a little belly but it was a nice start. Sure considering she used to be a toothpick girl before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Rachel. Can I sit here?\" A voice suddenly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel looked up and smiled when she saw it was Mickey who looked smiling at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead. I would like that. Mary went over to your sister. Your sister wanted to ask her something. Do you by any chance know what she might wanna ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since it is Alex I think I know,\" Mickey said. \"You saw my sister. You know she's fat. Not just a bit chubby but fat. Really fat. Even fatter then you sister. Compared to height and age she's even fatter then my other sisters. Anyway Alex is proud at how fat she is and about how much she can eat. But well she wants to proof how big and fat she is and how much she can eat. Especially against another far person. A person like your sister. No offense. So she's probably gonna challenge her to a eating contest. But let me tell you\u2026 I never saw her loose a eating contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Mary can eat a lot but... I'm not sure if she can beat your sister. I mean I saw her eat. She has a huge belly so she can stuff a lot of food in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure can. Alex thinks: Being full is no reason to stop eating. Or in her case, stop stuffing her face. She has eaten herself sick more then once just so she could keep eating. Other kids are happy with a new doll, or I Phone, or tablet. But Alex likes food, eating and gaining. That are her hobbies. I'm sorry Rachel, but your sister does't have a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it is't over till the fat lady sings right. But I think you're right. Mary can eat a lot but not as much if Alex. But well that does't matter. I mean it's just a eating contest. In life you win some you lose some. I mean it;s just for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps. But my sister takes this very serious. Some people hate losing. Well my sister does't mind it if she loses a board or a card game, but I knew for sure she won't be happy if she loses a eating contest. So your sister is gonna lose a eating contest. I guess for a gainer like your sister that's no fun. But you're right. It's just a eating contest. It's for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm happy to hear that. But who knows. If I get really fat perhaps your sister can challenge me once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry to say this Rachel but There's no chance you beat my sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no not with this stupid, skinny, toothpick body. But when I stuffed it full with lots of junk food, sweets and chocolate and other stuff for several years who knows?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand then you will be fat, but Alex will gain too while you gain. And she has a bigger appetite then you. So she will gain even more then you gain. Sorry but there's no way you gonna beat my sister. Not now, not ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well perhaps not but still\u2026 I wanna become fat. Perhaps I'm never gonna get fatter then your sister or my sister but well I can be a good third fattest girl. Would you still like me if I'm fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will I also like my sisters and mother and they're fat. If you wanna get fat I'm gonna help you.\"     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled.</span></div></div>",

However Alex got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you say punk\" said Alex clearly mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I called you a hippo, but that's a little harsh you're more like elephants ha ha ha\" said the bully laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Yeah you probably said this hopping that we would go home and cry to mommy. Once upon a time that's exactly what I did. People would call me 'hippo', 'elephant girl', 'fatty fat fat', 'Alex two tons' and every time they did I would cry home to my mommy. Eventually I stopped caring what people think and a few years ago I learned something\" said Alex as she was approaching the bully clearly shorter than her.\"I'm bigger than you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex then bumps her large belly into him knocking him to the ground. And then Alex turned around and sat on him. As she sat on him she placed both her hands on her belly rubbing it lovingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off me\" said the bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think so, and you know another thing I learned you taste like chicken\" said Alex licking her lips and shocking the bully and Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what?\" said the bully frightened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on you didn't think I got fat by just eating food. The first girl who ever bullied me I stuck her head in my mouth and finished her off in just three gulps. The next guy my dad barbecued him and ate until he was nothing but bones. The next one my boiled him and made into soup. Anyway what I'm trying to say is that anybody that even though about teasing me went straight to my belly\" said Alex as she patted her belly making it jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me, I'll never make fun of you again I promise\" said the bully now crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good also don't make fun of my pal Mary or I'm going to introduce you to your new home\" said Alex rubbing her belly. Alex got off the bully and as soon as she did the bully ran away. When the bully was far away Alex started laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see the look on his face? He actually thought I was going to eat him\" said Alex as she was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't eat people?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EWW of course not. But at least he won't bully you or me ever again\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell rang and the children made their way to their next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's just for fun.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point. It's not. If it was just for fun I would't mind so much loosing but... See I went over there with Diana. Jennifer and Virginia.

Why did you listen to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might of habit. Anyway she said I should do it. So I did. But then came the question if there's a prize and Virginia suggested that the loser should pay for all lunches of the winner for the next year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Mary you can't be serious. You maybe get more allowance then me because your older but what Alex eats in one day. I mean all your allowance in a whole year would't be enough to feed her for a month, Perhaps not even a week. Then what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I know I just did't knew she could eat that\u2026 much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you thinking. Mom told us never bet about money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean never bet with money. Does't matter I guess. If I need to buy lunches for a whole year\u2026 I guess I need to sell some of my stuff. Perhaps I can\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man that's really mean of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. She's not so mean. She helped me get rid of a bully. She can really defend herself. She was pretty nice to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It was Virginia who made that stupid bet was't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It  was. But that does't matter.

Of course they asked Mary's mom if she was alright with it and she was, so they all agreed that Mary's mom will pick up the girls to bring them to her house and they'll pick up their daughters before dinner time. The rest of the night was pretty uneventful, Mary and Rachel had dinner, watch tv and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day they went to school and at noon they went to the cafeteria for lunch and sat with Alex again.

Your mouth is big enough to get a airplane in,\" Jennifer said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but what are we gonna do now?\" Diana asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.... you brought all that food. It would be a waste not to use it.

Between Wednesday and Saturday Jennifer, Diana, Virginia and Rachel trained Mary by stuffing her with lots and lots of food even when she was already full. The training paid off as her belly was noticeably bigger than it was a few days ago. Mary's mom also noticed as Mary's clothes were getting a little too tight for her and said that after Mary hang out with Alex she would take them clothes shopping(I say them because she also noticed that Rachel's clothes were a little tight).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Friday at lunch Alex told them to come at her house at 10:00AM and I'm bring their swimsuits tomorrow to go swimming in their swimming pool after the eating contest. They arrived at Alex's house with Mary's mom saying that she'll pick Mary and Rachel up at 2:00PM. They rung the doorbell and Alex answered in her two piece bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey guys you made it, come in\" said Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you in a bikini?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To give more room for my belly. Speaking of which you should probably change into your swimsuits now this contest shouldn't take long\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all went into the bathroom to change into their swimsuits Mary and Jennifer both  had two piece bikinis while Diana, Virginia and Rachel all had one piece swimsuits. When they got out they followed Alex into the kitchen where they saw Alex's big sisters Betty and Sally in their two piece bikinis, her little brother Mickey in his swimming trunks, her dad outside grilling on the barbecue and her mom who offered them some lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is your sister ready for this?\" asked Mickey to Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be, she didn't eat anything this morning to make room for this\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must have been hard for her. But still I don't think it'll help her against Alex\" said Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex's dad came into the kitchen and brought two platters that had enough hamburgers and hot dogs to feed at least three families. Alex and Mary both sat at the kitchen table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Mary before we start I just want to ask. Win or lose, can we be friends?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course we can\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good now let's dig in\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlex and Mary both dug in and started eating the hamburgers and while they were doing that Betty, Sally and Mickey were cheering for Alex. While Rachel, Diana, Jennifer and Virginia were cheering for Mary. After about fifteen minutes the platters were empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are both of you full?\" asked Alex's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha!

Although we should take a little break besides it'll take your father a while before the next batch to be ready\" said Alex's mom.

Nobody's ever lasted this long against Alex\" said Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's just getting started\" said Rachel. After a few minutes everyone was talking to each other and Rachel went to go check on Mary but not before she got something out of her bag. Rachel knocked on the door and Mary told her to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can do this Rachel, I'm more full than I've been in my life\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you're packed\" said Rachel as she touched the normally squishy belly of her sister which is now as hard as a rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I got a solution\" said Rachel as she showed Mary what she got out of her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those the pills you take to make yourself hungry?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I figured that I should bring them just in case you needed them and right now it looks like you need them\" said Rachel as she put a pill in her lemonade and it dissolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, isn't this cheating?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ether this or you have to sell your stuff in order to pay for Alex's lunches for the year\" said Rachel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm good point\" said Mary as she drank the glass of lemonade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you feel now?\" asked Rachel as Mary's belly growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Rachel went back to the kitchen as Alex's dad came back in with a second batch of hamburgers and hot dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for round two?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was about to ask you the same thing\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Alex then ate.</span></div></div>",

More burgers and hot dogs went past each pair of lips. <br>\r\nMickey, Betty and Sally were all impressed. Their little sister had competed more times against other fat kids and never lost. They knew for sure she did't want to lose this competition either. <br>\r\nFinally both plates were empty and both rubbed their swollen bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like it's a tie.\" Jennifer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we're not done,\" Alex said. \"There's more food. But after all those hot dogs and hamburgers I'm looking forward to something sweet. Sally, Betty, can you two be a dear and make two of my favorite ice creams?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally and Betty smiled in a sinister way and waddled to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A delicious ice cream,\" Alex said. \"How does that sound? Delicious right. I must say I'm impressed. No one has ever gotten this far. And believe I had plenty of eating competitions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary rubbed her swollen belly. Sure the pills helped but they also they had their limit. Mary was starting to feel full. She wondered how Alex was doing. Perhaps she also was a bit full. She was worried that she perhaps could't beat Alex. Not that she minded that so much but buying lunches for Alex for a entire year\u2026 that would cost a lot of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your sister can really eat a lot,\" Mickey said. \"I thought she would have given up by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you don't know my sister yet!\" Rachel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Sally and Betty returned with a bowl with each five different kinds of ice cream with a warm sauce of red fruit like strawberry's, raspberry and some other red fruit. On top whipped cream with some sprinkles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she really still eat all that?\" Diana asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls grabbed their spoon and started to eat. <br>\r\nMary must admit that it tasted fantastic. They made good ice creams. But no matter how good it tasted, her belly was almost full. But she kept eating. Just a bit more that would stretch her stomach even more. But finally she could't eat another bite. Not without exploding. Her belly was tight and hard like a drum. She belched loudly<br>\r\nAlex looked at her smiling and kept stuffing her face and finished her ice cream. Her sibling burst out in applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you!\" Alex said. \"Eh Mary if you can't finish your ice cream... can I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go Ahead,\" Mary answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we go swimming!\" Virginia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead. I need to sit down for a bit,\" Mary moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSix girls and one boy ran or waddled to the swimming pool. The other two girls heard loud splashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, some people call me the walking garbage bin. Guess I'm sort of am. At least I eat leftovers from my friends. If they agree of course. Guess they call you names too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they do but well, I'm fat and I'm a gainer so\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah me too. I like you.

No of course not but now she has something to think about over the weekend. And the bright side is Alex and I are friends now and she said I don't have to pay for her lunches. She would't be a good friend if I needed to pay for her lunches for a whole year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice of her. Besides paying all lunches for her for a entire year, how much would that cost? So much money that would be a real prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two talking about?\" Their mother suddenly asked. \"I hear some things about money and paying. I want you girls to be careful with money. You can get in serious problems. Remember aunt Gina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean gambling Gina?\" Mary asked. \"I do remember her. But we did't saw her that often for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the reason was that she had a gambling addiction. That's terrible. You play games so you can win money but... You don't win or barely. Anyway you lose more money then you make. Way more. Some people lose a lot of money or their stuff, their car and even their house. That's what happened to Gina. And she still wants more money to play hoping she's gonna win. So that's why we rather don't want you two seeing her. To be honest I hope she gets caught and get's help. Problem is you need to accept help since they can't force you to get help. So be careful you two.<br>\r\n Anyway back to more fun things. Buying clothes. You both need new clothes. Now that's nothing new for you Mary. Since I need to buy new clothes for you about every month. However for you Rachel... I noticed your clothes are getting tight. Seems like you're gaining weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I do. It that\u2026 eh... a problem?\" Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A problem. Rachel how can I have a problem with your weight while I have to buy new clothes for your sister every month because she gains so much weight so fast she outgrows them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled. It seemed like her mother would't bother her in her way becoming a fat girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom did you see Alex?\" Mary asked. \"She's fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mary Alex is not fat. She's morbidly obese! I saw her and I never saw such a fat girl. But I guess that's not her fault. At least not completely. I also saw her sisters and mother. Well they're also fat. She comes from a fat family so it's normally she's also fat. That are just bad eating habits. A young kid eats what her parents give her or him and she gives them fattening food... well then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Mickey is not fat. And what's up with me. You and dad are't fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't know how Mickey was able to stay thin but as for you you just had a very big appetite and a taste for fatty food. And when you could finally crawl you always crawled around looking for food Crawled to the kitchen and looking through the cupboard or when we had guests you grabbed their cookies. Also sometimes you tried to eat something that was't food like a cigarette from a friend of us. Soon you could get out of bed and went to the kitchen and sneak food and well you here now. That's how you got so fat. oh... eh sorry Mary I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mommy I'm fine. I'm: Fatty Mary. That sound nice does't it? It's catching.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here we are.

After breakfast their mother drove them to school. When Mary got to school she noticed that her friends weren't around. When she got to class she found out that Diana, Jennifer and Virginia were all sick which bummed her out since being around her friends was the only thing that made the teasing bearable.

My big sister Sally told me about it\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever sandwiched someone?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. A couple years ago this skinny girl was bullying me for weeks then one day I told Sally about and she suggested that we sandwiched her, so we sandwiched her between our bellies and we wouldn't let her go until she agreed to stop bullying me\" said Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright if you think it'll work\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it'll work. Now where do you think she is?\" asked Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well gym class is next and whenever we get gym class after lunch she's usually 10 minutes early\" said Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, let's go\" said Alex as she and Mary made their way to gym class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered the locker room and saw Susan putting on her gym clothes.

I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" Alex said. \"That works for her... but what about me. What's in it for me. I was just looking forward to a tasty meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I won't tease you either. Tell you what. I promise I will never tease a fat person anymore for as long if I live!\" Susan yelled while tears were running down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess so. To bad for that tasty meal. But well you promised never to tease fat persons gain so\u2026 go ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan ran away crying to the nearest girls bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I almost feel bad for her.

Mary would then ask their mothers if they could visit them for a while and they said yes. So Mary would visit her friends for a while and she saw how sick they were but also how happy they were when Mary and Alex visited them. Virginia's house was the last stop. Mary knocked on the door and Virginia's mom answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Mary\" said Virginia's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello ma'am, we brought Virginia's homework for her, is it okay if we see her for a while?\" asked Mary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How nice of you and of course you can see her\" said Virginia's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary and Alex made their way to Virginia's room and they heard a bunch of thumping sounds coming from her room. They opened the door and saw Virginia in her pajamas dancing wildly and listening to music as if she wasn't sick at all. It took a while for Virginia to notice that they were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Mary (cough) Alex (cough). What you saw was a symptom of the disease that I have (cough) it makes me do a lot of dancing (cough)\" said Virginia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVirginia was obviously lying and Mary and Alex were not buying it for a second.

However my mom probably let me stay home tomorrow to make sure I'm really better. Guess I see you the day after tomorrow!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. Guess I see you tomorrow.

Happily, Diana\u2019s mom had those kids lined up in the living room, ready to go, by the time he\u2019d arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel seemed fuller than before he noticed, looking at his daughter. Most of her recent gain was situated around her middle, which was worrying trouble for her clothes and, more importantly, her car seat. Would she outgrow those things soon? Only time would tell it seemed. He smiled ruefully, picking up on the fact that she\u2019s caught her sister's appetite and started gaining weight. That belly got awfully big overnight, he thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, though, Dad was filled with worry. \u201cRachel, honey, should you be walking? What did the doctor say yesterday?\u201d he quizzed. When Rachel shrugged it off as no big deal, he answered his own question next. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to stay off that ankle. Come on, I\u2019ll carry you out to the car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was excited to hear that but was too fat to leap into his arms. Instead, Dad had to heave her up like a sack of potatoes. He grunted softly as he lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s belly rumbles constantly along the way. He gets her all nice and snug in the car along with Mary, and then probes, \u201cYou hungry, sport? What d\u2019you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurger King again!\u201d cheers Rachel. Mary approves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna order for yourself, like a big girl?\u201d he asks. When Rachel enthusiastically says she wants to, he pokes her belly. His finger goes in surprisingly deep. \u201cYou\u2019re just saying that so I have to carry you in the store~\u201d It was gentle teasing. He smiles and messes with her some more, stealing her nose and stuff, before he gets in the driver's seat and takes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow they were in line ordering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want three whoppers again,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI think I can eat it all this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad whispers to himself, \u201cFeels like you can\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary\u2019s order was similarly impressive: two double whopper meals, but Mary always ate. No one else knew about the pills yet. Rachel smiles greedily, eager to show everyone her drastically improved appetite. She chomps on her burgers, filling every bit of her mouth with the meat bun and extras. Like this, she ate her first two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad and Mary stared at the third burger, with Dad in particular wondering if she would finish this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel\u2019s tummy growled a bit, and the poor burger was doomed. She ate this one at a normal pace so she could finish with her family. But lo and behold, little Rachel\u2019s little appetite was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Dad\u2019s arms were a little sore just from thinking about picking up the hefty runt again and packing her in the car. He hoped it wasn\u2019t one of those slow-to-heal, nagging injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stretched her arms and the next moment the button of her pants popped of and flew over Mary's head and landed behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Rachel mumbled. \"That has never happened to me before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary rolled with her eyes. True in had never before happened to Rachel. But at the other it happened to her more the once. Since she was pretty fat it happened sometimes that her pants button popped of or just was't able to close. Of course Rachel's belly was swollen from the waffles and the burgers. Also the fact thanks to the pills all the food turned into fat. Also the pants she wore were mend for very skinny girls. Like Rachel used to be not too long ago. But Mary seemed very happy. She did't understood how it came but it seemed like her sister appetite really did grow. First the waffle breakfast and now the food at burger king. If this went on she soon would be round if a barrel. Anyway she liked her sister planned to follow in her deep footprints. However she wondered if this was all just because she overstuffed her sister two times. She thought it should be several times before she really saw some result. Stretching the stomach was a slow process. You also need to be careful because if you overstuffed her too much she would barf it all out and then it would't have any effect. But Rachel seemed to be totally fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Rachel I must say I'm impressed.\" Mary said while chewing. \"I did't thought you would be able to finish them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Her father said. \"It's way more the you normally eat. If you keep this up you're gonna look like your big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel doubted that. Sure they looked a bit alike but Mary was very confident, and could easily stand up to others, and could handle being teased. That were things Rachel was't, or could't do like her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel laid back and looked at how Mary stuffed her face. Well it seemed fun to be so fat. You could eat all you want and as much if you want. She did't want to be such a girl that counted every calorie she consumed. Mary enjoyed life. he just what she wanted and how much she wanted. In Mary's case that was a lot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't remember. when it was the last time I ate three burgers.\" Rachel mumbled and rubbed her stuffed belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. Never. You never have eaten burgers on a row.\"  Mary said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel patted her belly and must admit the idea she was gaining turned her on. Finally she would no longer be know as the skinny twig. However she was seen if the girl with the fat sister. If she would became fat as well they would probably tease her also. At the other hand they teased her already so it did't really matter.<br>\r\nA loud belch told them that Mary was done eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delicious. But they could make those meals a bit bigger.\" Mary said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on sweet hart.\" Their father begged, \"You cant still be hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looked at her dad. True she was't  really hungry but she could still eat a bit more, but seeing the look on her fathers face she decided that she had enough for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True I'm not really hungry.\" Mary said and got up and waddled to the car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stuck her hands out to her father who picked her up but noticed she seemed to be heavier then yesterday. She could't have gained that much in just one day. Or could she?        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She needed to after what happened at her school yesterday that made her have that sprained ankle. Rachel was having a great time sleeping on her bed until she can hear her tummy growling. Rachel open up her eyes and sat up on the bed after hearing her stomach growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's time for breakfast.\" Rachel said holding her hand on her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel got out of bed and walked to the kitchen at a steady pace to not let her ankle hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry belly, you'll be fed soon.\" Rachel said after her belly growled again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Rachel got to the kitchen, she was looking around for something to eat for breakfast. Since Rachel can't do any cooking, she couldn't have her favorite breakfast \"Pancakes with lots of syrup\". So instead, she would have to eat some cereal they have in the cabinet. Luckily, they still have her cereal that Rachel loves out of all the cereal they got, \"Lucky Charms\". She likes all the marshmallow that are in there and they have many different shapes. Rachel doesn't even care about the brown stuff and didn't taste as good as the marshmallow, she still loves this cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then poured her cereal in a bowl she got and then poured the milk in there. She then sat down at the table with her spoon and began eating her cereal. It didn't take long before she finished her bowl and drank the rest of the milk. She liked it so much, Rachel tried another bowl even with her appetite not as big as Mary's. She did the same thing she did before and began to eat her second bowl. Rachel was kind of slowing down when she was halfway done but she made it through and ate her second bowl making the little girl full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that was some good cereal.\" Rachel said patting her stuffed tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel then put the cereal and milk away and went to the living room. Of course with all that eating she did, Rachel's tummy was kind of sore from all the eating she did. She then got to the couch and sat down to watch some tv to pass the time. She had to rub her sore stomach herself since Mary and her mom's not here and she felt better. She was there all morning sitting on the couch watching tv and letting her ankle rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while Rachel was sitting on the couch...</span></div></div>",

Mary felt satisfied since being fat of her age made her get used to feeling things when having some huge appetite to fill it up.  His sister, Rachael meanwhile may had to come to terms of her stomach being sore from being full.  But a loud burp made her feel satisfied and a 5 year old's belly was started to feel better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me!\"  Rachael says when had to make some manners from her belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling a bit bit better now?\"  Mary wondered which hopefully that belch would be the case of that.  Of course her sister nodded and Mary smiled to know all it fine to say the least.  \"That's good, just letting out a burp would make yourself feel better.  You may had to get used to this for a while, but you're be fine though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachael smiled and a smile hug to give to that before the two girls continued on watching the TV for the remainder of the day.  They wouldn't bother playing some toys or outdoors by chance, but for fatness a bit, it was a chance to let their bodies settle and calms things down a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt would take hours to watch and it was almost time for them straight to bed,  but just before it happens though, Mary had her eyes bright wide, when a 7 year year old saw something interesting through watching the ads as the cartoons were taking a break.  It may sounds like a fattening advert to come with it, but what commercial was all about though?  </span></div></div>",

She just met this girl but felt now like if she knew her very good. Like something connected them.<br>\r\nShe opened the cupboard and took out two bags of chips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which do you like more... oh sorry. That does't matter too you of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. I'm used people ask me before they remember that i don't have taste. Most people talk before they think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin and Kathrin both ripped open their bag and started to stuff their faces. They almost finished at the same time. Robin took two boxes of cookies. They both finished them up just as fast.<br>\r\nRobin showed her new friend a grin. She liked this new girl but that did't mean she would just let her win. She always eat more then her friends and she was't planning at stopping now. But neither was Kathrin.<br>\r\nRobin pulled out a big box of muffins. Both grabbed one muffin at a time and eat them this continued until the whole box was empty.<br>\r\nRobin's belly started to feel a bit full but also Kathrin's belly felt a bit full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you give up Kathy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a chance Ro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both giggled at the short versions of their name.<br>\r\nRobin bend deeper in the cupboard and pulled out four bags of licorice. Both girls started to stuff the candy in their mouths until it seemed their cheeks were almost snapping.<br>\r\nRobin like licorice and almost any other kind of candy but now she just ate for food Just like Kathrin. Finally the bags were empty. But none of the girls wanted to give up. Robin waddled too one of the chairs and pushed it too the refrigerator and climbed on it  and opened it. At the top she saw what she looked for. An apple pie.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Is she still goes after this i'll give up.\" Robin thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the pie out and placed it between her and Kathrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right each one half!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth started to eat a piece but slowly since they both felt full but both grabbed a second piece. Almost strangle it down. But after that the second piece of pie was gone.<br>\r\nFinally Kathrin said: \"All... right... fine enough.... One more... bite and i'll... explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin took one last bite of pie and threw her hands in the air. Robins shirt rode up showing her round belly and the button of her pants had trouble keeping her belly in. The next moment Robins button popped of and forced her zipper all the way down, but the a few seconds later also Kathrins button popped of and forced her zipper also all the way down, and she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alway's likes it when that happens. All right Robin you beat me this time but i'll win next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Both girls started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do you wanna do?\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust then Robin heard her older sister leaving the T.V room and she looked at Kathrin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna watch T.V?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Kathrin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe both went to the T.V room and smiled when they both sat lazy on the couch while their body's digested all the food turning it all in too more fat!</span></div></div>",

Why was she reading in braille you ask? Well that's because Daisy was born blind but don't think she is weak. Her hearing is very sharp. She can hear the softest sound and can feel the smallest movement in the air or floor. She also has a perfect nose for the smell of food. She also don't likes it if people think they need to be around her the whole time because she is blind. Her parents are a bit concerned about her but know she can do a lot on her own. She normally wears dark glasses and a white stick with red stripes. On top of being blind she's also pretty fat with a little big belly. She suddenly heard a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in\" said Daisy <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened and it was her mother. She's kind of normal height and weight with black hair and a nice smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy honey dinners ready\" said Daisy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mom \" said Daisy as she put down her book and walked out of her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite being blind Daisy knew her house like the back of her hand. Whenever she would go down or up the stairs she would always count the stairs to indicate when she would arrive upstairs or downstairs. She could also tell which room she would be in by felling the floors with her bare feet for example the kitchen floor was made of wood and the living room has a carpet floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Daisy entered the kitchen she sat on her chair and with her sense of smell she could tell that they were having roast beef with corn, mashed potatoes and pees. And also at the table was her father who is also kind of normal height and weight with dark brown hair like his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Daisy your about to start school tomorrow\" said Daisy's dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just any school but a school for children with disabilities\" said Daisy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah a school where kids like me are reminded how much different they are from other children\" said Daisy unenthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on Daisy don't be like that this school is supposed to help children like you further their education to help them in the future\" said Daisy's dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And who knows you might be able to make friends with some of the students there who understand what you're going through so give it a chance\" said Daisy's mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy always did have trouble making friends. It was usually one of two things. One someone would make fun of the fact that she's blind and she in turn would be mean to the person who made fun of her and two because she was fat and most people consider fat to be ugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sight ok I'll give it a chance\" said Daisy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful\"said Daisy's mom \"oh and I want you to wear shoes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mom you know I feel better when I'm barefooted\"said Daisy <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know but this school has a very strict dress code and that includes wearing shoes\" said Daisy's mom <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing that Daisy frustratingly just kept eating her dinner.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After she went to college she moved and they had lost contact  but now she moved back and she and her mother met in the city and she invited her mother to come by the next day.<br>\r\nSo now they were in the car on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Else you would be all alone home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can stay home alone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you can't! Now stop whining. Maybe you like it. I have't seen her for a long time. Maybe she also got some kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i have't seen her for some years. Many things can happen in a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was still disappointed. Finally her mother stopped for a big house. Becky looked at the house with big eyes.<br>\r\nHer mother rang the bell and a her female friend opened the door. She was kind of normal height and weight with black hair and a nice smile. She wore some jeans and a dark green shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Jo it's so nice to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure is Miranda. Oh this is my daughter Becky. She's 5.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really well i also got a daughter. She's 6. Daisy can you come here!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA small girl appeared. She hard dark brown hair till her shoulders and a green dress. She also wore dark glasses and a stick. She was bare feet's. She was just like Becky fat. All over her body but a bit more in the belly. <br>\r\nBecky found it a bit strange that the girl wore sun glasses in the house and with only 6 years old walked with a stick.<br>\r\nShe reached out her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. I'm Daisy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky shook her hand and said: \"Hello. I'm Becky. Hee you have a big belly just like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose. If you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No i can't!\" She said snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Sorry i did't tell you. Daisy is Blind.\" Miranda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy took of her dark glasses. Her eyes were white. Now Becky saw the stick was white with red stripes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! S... sorry. I did't mean too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. You did't know.\" Daisy said while she put her glasses back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda took her Becky and her mother too the kitchen. Daisy did't seem to have any problem to know where she needed too go.   <br>\r\n  The kitchen was connected too the play room. Jo and Miranda went sitting at the table while their daughters walked to the play room and went sitting on the ground. <br>\r\nBecky waved her hand in front off Daisy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop waving you hand in front of my face!\" Daisy said snappish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were blind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am. But i can feel that you're moving air in front of my face. I was born blind s i don't feel like i miss anything and i can do enough things on my own.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Sorry. It's just that i never met someone who was blind.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right. You said you had a big belly. I can't see it but i can feel it if i may touch it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure. Go ahead!\" Becky lifted her shirt.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nDaisy slowly let her hands feel Becky's belly. She also felt Becky's chest and arms and also her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you see me by feeling my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really see. But i can image how you look.\"</span></div></div>",

See this floor here is made of wood. Every time you put your foot down i feel a vibration and don't get this the wrong way but your kind of heavy so i can easily feel where you are. So i can easily play some games. But i don't have to close my eyes when i play hide and seek. But i'm not that sportive.

The garden was very big and next too a forest. There was also a small river that  (Daisy's mother told) ended in a small lake in the forest. There were also some people who lived in the forest and most of those people where kind of friendly. It was also a great place to look for animals. There lived a lot of animals in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You live at a beautiful place Daisy.\" Becky's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See it once and the next time you look it's still the same.\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy is a bit critical about seeing things.\" Daisy's mother whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that mom!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And she can hear any word you say even if you whisper it.\" She said and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy and Becky happy eat their chips.     </span></div></div>",

Daisy got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine let's go!\" She said and walked straight too the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daisy wait! First put some shoes on!\" Her mother said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mooooom!\" Daisy whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No but's young lady. Inside it's fine but i want that you wear shoes outside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry Daisy turned and walked back to the room but after three steps she turned and asked: \"Eh mom... where are my shoes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next too the fireplace and don't try too hide your shoes between the fire wood like last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you hate wearing shoes so much?\" Becky asked while Daisy tied her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you i can feel vibration when you put down on feet. Well not with wearing those things! But since my mother knows i can feel with my feet she allows me to be bare feet inside or in the yard but else i always need to wear shoes...and i hate it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls walked too the forest and soon disappeared between the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they fine alone in the forest?\" Jo asked a bit concerned.\"<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Yeah. Don't worry. Daisy knows her way around the forest, and like i said there live some people in the forest so they can always ask for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky looked around with big eyes. She did't had such a forest around her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! What a great forest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you have seen one, you've seen a thousand.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you can't see the forest but you must smell the flowers and trees, and hear all the animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point! Everyone is always such excited. Look a bunny or look a fox or look a bird. The only thing i hear are some footsteps of the animal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you girls don't make so much noise.\" An old man friendly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a whit mustache and a hat on and was fishing at a small river. He was sitting on a small chair and had a lot of fishing tools and a bag with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two scare away the fish. Don't talk so loud until you two are around the corner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know where the corner is.\" Daisy said flatly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere you two have some food. Then you mouths have something else too do then talk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave both girls a big sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, ham and a lot of mayonnaise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Both girls said happy.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBecky and Daisy happy walked further while eating the sandwich. When the were around the corner Becky said: \"What a nice man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M.r Johnson. Oh he's all right. He loves fishing. He knows everything about fishing but i don't really like fish.  Except served on a plate baked or cooked with a nice sauce. Sometimes he gives my mother some fish. I love salmon. Baked in puff pastry together with a delicious sauce.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well M.r Johnson makes perfect sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I know everyone around the forest here. I heard that the people who lived here ones owned a restaurant in a forest and now moved here. But they still all make delicious food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the restaurant?\"    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody knows. But you can always can coun't on some food when you visit them.\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe happy patted her round belly.</span></div></div>",

Closer than Joey, Justin, Ned, and Sasha. She is like me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" asked Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are both missing something we should have.\" said Daisy, \"An average person should have five senses, sight, hear, touch, taste, and smell. I obviously can't see, but Kathrin can't taste food. She doesn't have a sense of taste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must stink!\" exclaimed Becky, \"I mean, if you can't taste the food, how will you ever know how good it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we all have a favorite food and food we just can't bear to eat.\" said Daisy, \"She doesn't have either one. All food tastes the same to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything good about that?\" asked Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she has an eating disorder.\" said Daisy, \"She eats more than the average girl. If all food tastes the same to her, then she doesn't have to worry about not liking any kind of food. She never says no to food. Ever. Tell her it's food, and she'll eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When was the last time you saw her?\" asked Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple weeks ago.\" said Daisy, \"She moved. She's not even in the same city anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...I would like to meet her.\" said Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really would.\" said Daisy, \"She's just like you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big and fat and loves to eat?\" asked Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big and fat and loves to eat.\" repeated Daisy.

Why would't they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since they all run off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey and Justin need to go. You heard that, and Sasha's parents want her home at exactly 5:00 pm, and Ned... well he's a bit shy. He's fine around friends but if he does't know you he first watch you from a distance. He is very close friends with Joey. So When Joey need to go he also went. It' has nothing to do with you. He acts like this around anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad it's only that. To bad i did't had a chance to meet Kathrin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of funny that i can't image a live without taste while she can't image alive without sight. (giggle)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walked inside.

Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh Becky i was wondering... would you mind to stay longer here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i need to go somewhere and the babysitter just called she suddenly became sick. Josh can stay at his friends place can you stay here until i'm done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's easier she can sleep here.\" Daisy's mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she doesn't have any clothes here and... \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She can borrow some clothes of Daisy. I believe they have about the same size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJo saw suddenly how tight Daisy's dress was on the girl. She was right. Daisy must be around the same size if Becky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She has vacation right. So it's no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on. I show you my room!\" Daisy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecky was wondered how Daisy's room would look like <br>\r\nDaisy walked without a problem upstairs too her room. Becky found the wall a bit boring. Not one poster or drawing but at the other hand if there would have been she could't see it anyway so no wonder. She did saw a big stereo and a lot of music. She guessed since Daisy could't see much her mother had enough money to buy other things for her like music since she could hear. She also saw some old toys. Probably bought for her before she was born since it were baby toys.<br>\r\nShe also saw some books and opened it and looked strange on the inside. Not one picture or word written on it. Only white dot's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't read that.\" Daisy said laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are no words in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you i can't see but i can feel the dotes on the page. Every dote stands for letter. So can i read without eyes. My parents bought them for me when i would get older. I'm practicing to read it.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThere was also a desk with chair in the room and a big closet with a big mirror on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice mirror.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I don't care how i look. I can't see it.\" She said calmly.</span></div></div>",

She had dark brown hair till her shoulders and a green dress. She also had white eyes and a stick.

Oh\" said Daisy as she realized that she said that out-loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay I like being fat I think fat is beautiful. In fact I think you look really pretty\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so\" said Daisy as she got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you something?\" asked Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\" said Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come you're barefooted\" asked Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel vibrations with my feet, I can feel how far or how close someone is every time someone puts his or her foot down\" said Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Toph from avatar\" said Nikki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Sure whatever you say\" said Daisy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki then notice a woman coming towards them.She was kind of normal height and weight with black hair and a nice smile.

It sounds strange but those blind people can do a lot of things on their own. You would't expect that. But they can hear way better and can also feel better. Very sensitive. They can even smell better. That way they can do a lot of their own. However there are of course still a few things that they can't do. But they can do most things. A lot of things you would think are impossible to them. We could't do it if we should do it with our eyes closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said she could feel vibrations. That was why she was barefooted. Do you think there's a chance I will see her at school?\" Nikki asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I don't think so. She goes to her own school of course. She can't read your textbooks. That's one of the things they can't do. reading. However I know they can read but not with words. Their books have pages with small little lumps on it. They feel them and that way they can read. By feeling instead of reading words. I guess she learns that at her school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki thought about Daisy. She seemed pretty nice. She wondered if she cared about her size. Of course she could't see how she looked but she could feel how she looked right. Would she ever meet her again? The village were they lived was't that big. But that did't want to say she would ever see her again. But who knew. Perhaps. If she was just at the right time at the right place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look. There are the new people who bought that old house.\" Linda said and started to drive very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNikki looked outside and suddenly saw Daisy. She said she just moved. But it appeared she moved to her street. Only three houses away from her. She looked again and there was no doubt it was her. Barefooted, brown hair, big belly but now she wore some black glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee mom. That's her. That's Daisy.\" Nikki whispered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well that's a coincidence. Hm perhaps we should visit and call them welcome in the neighborhood. Would't that be nice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I guess it would.\" Nikki said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also nice that they have a kid about your age.\" Linda said and parked her car. <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Even if I did, I don't think that your mom let you go to school barefooted. She probably would take you shoe shopping. So stop acting sad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy was surprised.

Waddling away with rubbing thighs, a jiggling belly and a wobbling butt, however Daisy could't see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. My class must be around here somewhere.\"  Daisy said and walked down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee are you Daisy?\" A voice suddenly asked.

She decided to wear it. She fast undressed and first put her bikini on and after that her normal clothes. She also took her towel and ran back too her parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready mommy!\" Missy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good well we also got our things. Here give me your towel.\" She said and put the towel in a big bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like it to go swimming mommy. The water feels so nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother smiled. With only four years old Missy could swim. She was a born swimmer. Her parents learned her swimming while she was a baby. There was a forest behind their house with a small lake's and a few pound's. Through the whole forest there were rivers. Some small and some a bit bigger but still they were always afraid she would once fell in a lake, pound or river and drown so they made sure she learned swimming when she was a baby and she became very good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey got in the car. Missy struggled a bit to fit in her car seat. I was getting very tight lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my your belly got very big.\" Her mother said proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs long if she could remember her parents loved her big belly. Because of this she always saw fat like a good thing. She never heard about anything like health problems and becoming obese or immobile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey drove straight to the swimming pool. <br>\r\nMissy ran inside as soon if her mother unbuckled her belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missy wait up!\" Her parents yelled. \"We first need to pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy was still excited but waited for her parents  until they paid. After that she went straight to the dressing rooms and pulled of her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you put your bikini on. I forget we bought that one. It looks so cute at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her mother said cute it mend it showed more belly. And in this part the belly even covered partly the bottom part.<br>\r\n Missy ran too the water and dove right in. Her mother did't worried. Missy was a good swimmer and besides there were hundreds of people around and always a few life guards so she did't need to be worried<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy first swim  a bit in the big pool. Every half hour there were waves, and there were small rivers to other parts of the pool and of course there were slides, some jacuzziu's some smaller pools and also a kiddie pool. <br>\r\nMissy liked it too first swim around in the big pool and explore it again. Not that it was strange for her. She had been here before. But every now and then they had something new and it was always fun to see the old things again. <br>\r\nAfter some time she got a bit tired of the swimming and decided to go too the kiddie pool and take it easy for a while. She slowly got in the warm water of the kiddie pool and went sitting in the lower part of the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She knew one thing for sure. She would never starve. <br>\r\nHer parents always wanted her to eat more. They never force fed her but they always wanted her to eat as much if she possibly could. And she must admit she liked eating. Not like a real hobby but she liked good food. She also wanted to make her parents proud so she did her best to always eat a bit more. Not too much since she once did that and and after that she threw up. <br>\r\nBut now she really was't full yet. She knew she was pretty chubby but did't really mind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go honey.\" Her mother said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put down a tray with two hot dogs, two hamburgers, a pack of fries and three can's of coke. <br>\r\nIt was always the same thing with her mother. You need to say what you wanted or else she ordered for you and it was always a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her shoulders and started to eat her first hot dog. She must admit she liked hot dogs. She also liked hamburgers and fries and she liked Coke. But why did she need to buy so much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes i think she wants me to be as big as a circus fat lady.\" She whispered to herself. \"Come on just eat your food now. You do want to swim a bit after you ate it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard of course no swimming with a full stomach but she could always splashing a bit in the kiddie pool or sit in the jacuzzi until she could swim again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother looked at her chubby child. She loved Missy and was happy her child had such a big appetite but still she was't happy Missy was just a chubby child. She wanted Missy to be fat. But she also wanted to let Missy do that on her own and she sure did't want to force her. She hoped her little girl would like it to become fat. She knew Missy did't mind her size but she did't really tried to gain on purpose. She only ate a lot to please her parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy did already ate the two hot dogs one burger and most of the fries but started to feel full. But she did want to finish this. Her mother was watching. She kept opening her mouth and chewing  taking sips coke every now and then.<br>\r\nHer mother looked excited at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Missy. I don't like it to throw food away. So please make your mom proud and eat all your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy pushed the last fries in her mouth and focused on her burger. She grabbed it with both hands. Slowly but surely she ate it and finally she swallowed the last bit and washed it away with cola and let out a loud belch.<br>\r\nHer mother praised her but Missy saw some people around who did't seemed to be so pleased. She wondered if the did't liked that her mother encouraged her too eat, or her belch, or both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She liked this feeling. Enoguh to make her feel full and her belly get a little rounder, but epmty enough to move around and her tummy not hurt. She decided to go sit in the jacuzzi and wait a little while before she went swimming again. She got up and noticed how her swimsuit felt a little tighter then before. she just smiled and placed and hand on her belly and walked to the jacuzzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoone else was there so she could pay some attention to her full belly for a little while. Also she though the warm water felt good on it and the rest of her. She started thinking. She liked the size she was now. To her it was just the right size, a good bit chubby with a nice round belly. She liked it. However she would not mind if she was bigger. But she really started to notice the bigger she got,the less she ever wanted to be skinny,ever. In fact it was at this point that she made the decision to never loose not one pound. She would only allow herself to gain,or stay the same weight. Which she doubt she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhiel thinking this some came over and handed her a flyer. She looked at it.  She was glad to see it was for a contest, and one that she was sure to do good at, and eating contest. The pool they where at would set up a buffet style table and hold an eating contest every year. She winner would get 50 dollars and a piture of thier winning belly to go in the hall of fame.

This eating contest was a good way too fatten her up while it seemed she only wanted to win a simple contest. She would gain a lot of weight during the training and after that even more at the contest. It also seemed Missy wanted to win. Of course $50 was much money for a four year old and your belly on a wall of fame was very special.<br>\r\nMissy slowly waddled back too the swimming pool to swim some more.<br>\r\nAfter some time her mother told her it was time to get out. Missy hair was also wet and it partly hid her face. She liked that. Giving her a mysterious look. While she undressed she got also a good look on her belly. She heard a sound like someone saw something gross a saw it was a girl that was so skinny you could count her ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissy looked angry at her and got dressed. She did't saw herself as fat. Sure chubby but fat. However her belly was a bit bigger thanks to the food her mother bought. But after that digested it would shrink a bit. However her mom told her it spread around her body, and she was very short. Even for a four year old she was still pretty short even when she was standing on her toes. So the fat had't that much room to spread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they were in the car her mother looked at her with the rear-view mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it bothering what that girl said?\" Her mother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so much what she said... it was more the way she said it and... I thought i was more well... chubby not really fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind it to be fat?\" Her mother asked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too be totally honest... No! I should never wanna be skinny. But i would't mind to become bigger.\" She though about the contest. \"I'm sure i will become bigger with the contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tomorrow we will start with your training. Then you do need to eat a lot. More then you think you should be able too. But not too much. If you throw up you will never gain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry mommy i know that. I will never ever do that again. It's only... i don't want my tummy to hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you'll get very fast used to a filled tummy.\" Her mother said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother thought about this. She sure hoped that her little girl would gain a lot of weight. How fatter she got how more food could fit in her belly so fatten her up would help her. Maybe she could ask someone to help her fatten Missy up. Or would she fatten Missy up all by herself?<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

I think you wanna talk to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they walked to the stair Saskia saw a about seven year old girl sitting in front of the T.V. She was very fat. about 200 pounds. She smiled.<br>\r\nUpstairs the woman knocked on a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serenity some people here wanna see you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a minute!\" They heard following by sounds like someone put something away. \"Come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaskia, Missy and the woman walked in. Saskia looked around. It was just a normal teenager room. A bed  and some bookshelves. A desk with a computer. A stereo with some CD's next too it. Some posters of hot boys and a few beanbags. <br>\r\nSerenity was sitting at one of them. A chubby girl about five-teen or six-teen. Fire red,straight hair till a bit over her shoulders. Firm D cups that would sure attract some guys and beautiful green eyes. Average height and a beautiful white smile.

I normally only were this when I'm alone because it's comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This woman wanted to ask you to babysit. So i leave you three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh maybe you can take Missy with you. I wanna talk to her alone. She can watch some T.V with eh... Lin. Right\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right. Come Missy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they closed the door Saskia looked  Serenity straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanted me too babysit your daughter. I'll be happy to do it.\" Serenity said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First i have another question. I noticed you sister was very fat. You also babysat by a friend of my and i noticed her kids gained some weight lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaskia enjoyed this. It was obvious Serenity was scared. She was sweating buckets. Suddenly her eyes looked at the pillow on her bed. Saskia walked over to it and felt under the pillow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Serenity screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaskia already saw pictures of young girls who where fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you like fat kids. Are you also fattening them up? I sure looks like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't tell anyone. It's true. I'm fattening them up. I do like fat kids but I never do anything bad with them. I only give them food or feed them I never force them to eat against their will. I'm not a pedophile. I only take a picture of them. I like their big bellies. I rub their bellies sometime but only if they want it. I don't do anything wrong like letting them strip or something. Except when their parents ask me to put them in bath of course. I really love kids. I'm always  nice to them and they like me. Just ask some of them. Please don't tell anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine i won't but then you need to do something for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. Anything. But don't tell.\"       <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to become my daughter's babysitter, and i want you too fatten her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. I'm not sure i heard that right? Do you want me too fatten her up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what i said. I now know you do it with other kids so it should't be any problem for you do i think but you need to buy the stuff to feed Missy by yourself. Just fatten her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. I like fattening up little girls. Can i take pictures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to take pictures that's fine with me. I won't tell anyone as long if you fatten her. I hope to see you tomorrow evening a six hour by our house. It's in this street number 8.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be there.\" Serenity said relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid back. She could't believe what just happened. She tried to understand anything while she looked at the sealing even after she heard Missy and mother leave with the car. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
