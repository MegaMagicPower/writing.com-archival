District (Enter Number Here, Preferably 1 or 2) always held a grand reaping ceremony. It may have been only 6:20 in the morning, but his presentation to the Organization Department heads that were appointed to prepare the 73rd Reaping of the 12 Districts had been scheduled for 7:10 AM. That may seem to be plenty of time to get there, except that John lived 30 blocks away from his new job, and had yet to buy a closer apartment. He was just a couple of blocks from his office building when, from out of the nearby alley, came forward a large group of mysterious dark and hooded figures, and John felt strange and powerful energies coming from several of them.</span></div></div>",

He is immediately spotted by the District's Peacekeepers, and lets himself be captured. Then, when the local chief asks him who he is and where he is from, the Stranger responds with only seven words: \"I am here to kill the President.\" The security chief first looks at him with horror, then says after he abruptly stops laughing:\" Kill him.\" The Peacekeepers then draw their rifles, and the Stranger laughs at this pathetic attempt to stop him, and proceeds to draw a pair of flaming knives that appeared on his belt. The Stranger then calmly slit the Peacekeepers' throats with a cold and lethal precision. He then speaks to the now terrified and shocked Chief:\" WHO'S LAUGHING NOW, HUH!? YOL BAH!!!!!\" The Stranger's Shout first set the helpless chief alight with a pure, white flame, and his screams were then amplified as he was then elecrocuted. The chief's death scream and the sudden powerful heat thunderstorm then drew the attention of every Peacekeeper in the District, and they proceeded to take up firing positions around the Security building as they listened to the screams of horror emitted by their comrades who were unfortunate enough to be in the building at the same moment when the Stranger was killing his interrogators. The doomed Peacekeepers then heard a strange sound of pulsing energy after the last trapped Peacekeeper was killed.</span></div></div>",

His assistant, Katri, quickly walked up to him, carrying a hand-held messaging device. \"Dr. Overhill...\" Katri began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel stopped and turn to look at her. He smiled, and gave a soft chuckle. \"Please, Katri,\" he said. \"You know we're on first-name terms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" she said, \"but I want to call you 'doctor' in front of the Gamemakers. It'll look more official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you like, Katri, whatever you like,\" said Kestrel. He was to meet the Gamemakers today, in order to discuss the next Hunger Games. He had heard that it would take place in an abandoned city, and already had a few ideas. However, he'd wait to propose them at the end of the meeting, after the Gamemakers had given him their suggestions. They were an egotistical bunch, and each one of them seemed to think that they could do Kestrel's job better than him. Kestrel was a Genetic Engineer (or mutt-maker, as some people called it) who designed the creatures used in the Hunger Games. He'd only done it for a few years, but he had already established himself as one of the best. He usually made his creatures reflect the design of the arena, a detail that made them very visually appealing. Kestrel was also willing to go to more extremes than previous Engineers, which lead to much more entertaining games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Gamemakers are in the conference room, Dr. Overwhill,\" said Katri.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful. You are dismissed,\" replied Kestrel. Katri nodded and went back down the hallway. She'd get the chance to call him 'doctor' when the Gamemakers were leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKestrel entered the conference room. There, about twelve Gamemakers sat in his custom-designed rotating chairs, sent from District 1. Each chair had the face of a particularly vicious animal sculpted on the back. The head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, sat in the furthermost chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The Badger,' thought Kestrel. 'How fitting.' He did not have much love for Crane or any of the other Gamemakers, but he had to deal with them if he wanted to maintain his position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Dr. Overwhill, I assume you know the location of the next game?\" began Crane. Kestrel nodded his head. \"Wonderful. We've been discussing the creatures that will appear during the game, and we have come up with some preliminary designs. If you would, Trajan...\" Crane gestured to a Gamemaker sitting next to a mobile holographic advice. Trajan activated the device, and three-dimensional models of several animals popped up. \"These,\" said Crane, \"are the proposed creatures. As always, we'll let you modify them in minor ways as you see fit. You can keep your own suggestions to yourself until the meeting ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He acts like he owns my facility,' thought Kestrel. 'Oh, how I'd love to feed him to something.' Kestrel quickly shook these thoughts from his head, and tried to focus on Crane's presentation. He was going over the different animals they wanted to include in the arena. Overall, Kestrel thought it was a good list: a few primates, a couple bird species derived from vultures, and a multitude of larger-than-average insects. But one creature caught his eye. It was an eight-foot long pig, a semi-aggressive food source for Tributes. It struck Kestrel as incredibly boring, especially when compared to the unique creatures intended for the arena. 'I could probably make it more interesting,' thought Kestrel, as he began to consider different ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, that concludes our presentation,\" said Crane. \"Do you have any suggestions, Dr. Overwhill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes. I do.\"</span></div></div>",

It's alright, we won't harm you! We're just travelers!\" The three Panemans then climb down from their secure nests, and Maisie instantly asks:\"Well, if you're travelers like you say, then why did we see you guys fall from a weird Capital hovercraft just now?\" The Other Stranger then replies:\"Well, we're not Capital, but we are travelers, of a sort.\" As the three mortals approached the strangers, Lilly asked:\"What do you mean, of a- Maisie! Jack! LOOK!\" Lilly pointed at the still-hooded figures, for she could now see their faces, and was frightened at seeing a mirror image of her friends! Walking up to her, Maisie asked her what was wrong:\"What is it, Lilly?\" She then took a closer look at what her cousin was pointing at. Upon seeing herself, she fainted. Jack ran up to them, a look of concern and angered fear on his face. Then he saw his hooded self, and asked:\"What the heck is going on?! Who are you people, and why do those two look just like me and Maisie?!\" The Other Stranger replied:\"Like I said, Jack, we are travelers of a sort. We come from a parallel universe, and my companions here ARE you and Maisie. Our own Lilly was aboard the shuttlecraft that, heh, DROPPED us off here just now, filling the three of us in on your Lilly. You see, we are here on a mission of GREAT importance to the remnants of North America, and not just Panem.</span></div></div>",
