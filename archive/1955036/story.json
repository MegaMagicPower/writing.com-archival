Now see here you big bullies either you can leave these innocent shopkeepers alone or else it's gonna get real ugly real fast!\" Our protagonist shouted as she got the mafia goons attention as the shopkeepers themselves felt quite relieved that someone had come to their rescue as they were now worried about the story's protagonist as they knew she wouldn't be able to beat those goons themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here little Missy there ain't no way that you're gonna be able to beat us ergo move along and go play with your dollies or whatever.\" The lead mafia goon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah go on now go play and move along for we're gonna shake down these shopkeepers and no one's gonna stop us including you.\" The second mafia goon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear hear after all what makes you think you can stop us as we're bigger than you and stronger than you for after all if you try to stop us we'll flatten you like a pancake ergo get lost toots.\" The third mafia goon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree ergo you can either leave or else you'll be sorry.\" The fourth mafia goon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little Missy?! Now listen here you greasy Italian American meatballs I ain't gonna leave here and by the way I don't play with dollies or whatever for I'm a martial artist who happens to have a black belt in karate as I also lift weights ergo these shopkeepers ain't gonna be shaken down by the likes of you guys as I'll also have you know I've taken on big guys like you as I've also clobbered them and made mincemeat out of them ergo you guys asked for it as it's go time!\" Our protagonist said as she was getting ready to clobber her opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greasy Italian American meatballs?! Greasy Italian American meatballs?! Alright that does it ergo let's get her boys!!\" The lead mafia goon barked as he and his fellow goons stepped forward as they were about to clobber our protagonist until four heroic male sumo wrestlers arrived on the scene as they happened to be on our protagonist's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you guys and I can assume you must be the cavalry or something?\" Our protagonist asked the four anthropomorphic male animal sumo wrestlers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow us to introduce ourselves my name is Doug Dalmatian as I'm the team's leader.\" Doug Dalmatian said as he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Ace Dalmatian as I'm the team's second in command and Doug's loving nephew.\" Ace Dalmatian said as he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear ma'am for yours truly Shorty the basset is here to save the day!\" Shorty the basset hound said as he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allow me to introduce myself for my name is Wilfred the rat for after all I may be a sumo wrestler but I do have a big heart.\" Wilfred said as he introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And together we're known as.....The Mega Stars!\" All four sumo wrestlers said in unison as they stared down their enemies as both member's sides then charged right at each other as an all out battle between the forces of good and evil was under way as our four heroic animal sumo wrestlers and the story's protagonist with their strengths combined sent the mafia's goons running away in terror with their tails between their legs as our heroes proudly gave each other high fives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now that we've taken care of those goons we may as well be on our way.\" Doug Dalmatian said as he his nephew and their allies started to walk off towards their destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
