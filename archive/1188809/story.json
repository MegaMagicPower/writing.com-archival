You were restrained on a small metal table, with iron restraints holding your arms and legs back on the sides of the table, will there was another 2 iron bar clamping down on your tail, along with another padded iron bar, pushing down on your forehead, and because of that, the only way you can actually see anything OTHER than the ceiling, was because of an Angeld mirror nearby, mounted on the ceiling as well, like whoever kidnapped you wanted to make sure you knew what was going on around you, you also noted that none of the restraints you were actually locked in felt uncomfortable, which thankfully ment that whoever brought you here clearly didn't want you hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were trying to find a way out of your restraints, the same person who tickled you before peered back inside your room, he was wearing a hood, so you couldn't see his face, \"Oh, I almost forgot,\" he said walking back in to your room, you yelped, thinking that he was going to tickle you again, you've always absolutely HATED being tickled, especially on your belly, but to your surprise, (and relief,) your captor actually walked to the other side of the room, where he flipped open a hidden door on the wall to reveal some sort of control panel. He flipped a few switches, pressed a button, and than closed the door panel, doing so seemed to cause some sort of machine to start up within the room, signaled by an a quiet, yet odd \"wirring\" noise suddenly filling the room. \"There we go\", your captor said almost maliciously, as he started walking to the door, stopping at the foot of you. \" I'm guessing you want to know where you are\", he said to you, \"well all YOU need to know is that you're about a mile down underground, in a completely sound proof room, so don't be afraid to scream when you want to, and WHY you're here is not irrelevant, what IS however relevant, is that this machine is about to start up, and I don't know how long it will be untill this machine will stop, if you're lucky, it will only take about an HOUR, otherwise, it could take all day, so have fun!\" , He said almost evily. Worried about what was going to happen, you tried to shock your captor with a thunderbolt, but when you tried, nothing even seemed to have happened, you couldn't even tell if you even DID fire off a thunderbolt to begin with, seeing this, your captor turned back to you, and said, \"Oh, and don't try to use any of your attacks on me, that table your on is made of a newly discovered metal, that completely NEGATES all Pokemon moves, so long as your touching that metal, you can basically forget that you knew any Pokemon moves to begin with\", He said. Hearing this, only made you feel even MORE helpless than you already were. You captor turned to leave the room, but ton before saying, \"Good luck\", to you in an evil tone, before leaving the room, and locking the door behind him, \"W-wait! What do you mean, \"good luck\", you worriedly tried to shout back at your captor, but he was already long gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOW you were getting scared, what was going to happen to you? Were you going to be tickled again? But it didn't take long for you to figure it out, as all of a sudden, 2 robotic hands with fingernails appear about a foot above you. \"N-NO! PLEASE DON'T!\" You screamed in fear, hopping nothing would happen, instead, both hands started to spider tickle the air above you, as they slowly started to decend, in a one-way trip to the middle of your tummy. \"NO!!! NONONONONO!!!! PLEASE!!!!! I'LL DO ANYTHING!!! JUST PLEASE!!! ANYWHERE BUT MY TUMMY!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!\" But it was no use, as the hands decended, you braced for impact, but then, just as the hands were a few inches away from your helplessly ticklish tummy, the hands stopped moving all together. \"H-h-huh? Oh thank Arceus!!!!\", You said out loud to yourself, thinking your prayers have been answered, so you relaxed a little bit, which was a HUGE mistake, because the second after you relaxed, both of the hands sprang to life, and EMIDEATLY dove into your HYPER ticklish tummy, spider tickling it like it was the end of the world. \"NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHANOHOHOHOHOHOHOSTAH AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAPIHIHIHITHAHAHAHAHAPLEHEHEHEHEHEHEHSEHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIHIHIHIHIHISIHIHIHIHSTOHOHOHOHORTURE!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!! !!!!\" You can't stop laughing as tears start to fall down your cheeks, you pull on your restraints like your life depended on it, as your most ticklish spot is being put through hell. Seconds feel like minutes, and minutes feel like years, as the tickling when on and on. After about 7 minutes of begging, screaming, crying, and endless laughing, the hands that are torturing you, DOUBLE in speed. TRIPLING your laughter. Now you can't even beg anymore, now all you can do is sob into your own fur, and laugh and laugh and laugh. \"<b>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up, what feels like DAYS later, and you find yourself...</span></div></div>",

You probably know Bowser by now. Your first challenge is to show me the absolutely most ARTFUL tickling you can. Make it look beautiful, and extremely torturous to the victim.\" Marsha says, winking. She quickly pointed to a chest containing several tickling mechanisms. \"You can use these tools, your hands, your tongue, whatever you want.\" Marsha says, as she quickly moved over to Bowser's throne, and sits on it. \"Well, what are you waiting for, show me some fun.\" marsha says, giving a compassionate smile.</span></div></div>",
