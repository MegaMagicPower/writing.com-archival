A few were rushing to get to their lockers while others merely went to class. A member of the first category was Twilight, hurrying along with her backpack slung over her shoulders. Quickly passing by the sea of people, Twilight found herself in front of her locker. She turned the combination with no trouble and opened the door. On top of her math book, strangely enough, was a small note. It had clearly been shoved through the small openings in the locker as it was bent slightly. As Twilight grabbed her things and walked off, she worked on opening the letter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear Twilight,<br>\r\nI am sorry I had to do this, but I knew you would turn me down face to face. I need to meet you in the chemistry lab after school PRIVATELY. I cannot stress that one word enough. I will know if you skip out on me and I will know if you bring your 'friends.'<br>\r\nSincerely,<br>\r\nSomeone cheated out of what they deserve.</i><br>\r\n\"Well....\" Twilight thought as she looked over the letter for the third time, \"I can't say I'm not curious. But who could have made this?\" Judging by the way this was written and how seemingly dark it was, Twilight had a bad feeling this was no friend of hers. Then again....Pinkie often had weirder ways to get attention. The question was bubbling in her if she should get her friends on this or follow the letter....to the letter.</span></div></div>",

Of course none of her friends were in this class with her so she couldn't discuss the note with them. She stepped into the classroom bright-eyed nonetheless. \"Ah Twilight.\" The teacher said, her face obscured by a clipboard. \"I hope you don't mind, but it seems you're gonna have a new partner at your table. They aren't here yet but they will be soon.\" As the bell signalling the start of class rang, the teacher pointed to some flasks carrying a blue substance. \"Alright class, we will continue where we left off in our studies. Now be very careful with these mixtures......\" Knowing what the teacher wanted done, Twilight went right to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? Excuse?\" Twilight looked up from the flasks....and stared. \"Um...I was told to sit here, do you mind if...\" Twilight shook her head and moved slightly, never taking her eyes off the girl.

Starlight never missed dinner with her. She had sent Spike to fetch her, but he had yet to return. Just as Twilight was about to get up, the sound of a screaming dragon echoed through the halls. Twilight had become a master noe at detecting where sounds came from in her castle and followed them.<br>\r\nStarlight's room was a mess, pages torn, the walls were marked with either equal marks or 'lies', and worst of all, Starlight was nowhere in sight.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight pushed on the door, halfway locked in her memories. With only a few steps in, the door closed and locked behind her. Looking forward, a figure could be seen in the darkness of the unlit room. \"Hello Twilight.\" Wanting to take an easy route on this, Twilight spoke as if this was possibly this world's Glimmer. \"Oh right, from chemist...\" A light came on, with an enraged Glimmer standing in it. \"Don't act like you don't know who I am little miss 'princess of friendship.\" <br>\r\nWell...there was no deny what Glimmer this was.<br>\r\n\"Why did you leave me Glimmer? How did you even find out about this place?\" The girl sneered, \"With a kind heart like hour's gullibility is quite a trait.

Of course not, unequal people like you only care about finishing so you get the praise.\" As Twilight tried to pick herself up, she found herself being splashed with the blue concoction. With no way to defend herself, all Twilight could do was watch. With one last rush, Glimmer pushed Twilight back again. This time she landed in a puddle of a few of the other blue vials. Glimmer stood triumphantly over her fallen former teacher. \"As I said, you made me see the extreme of your argument. Soon, you'll understand why equality is a must for friendship.\" Twilight attempted to pull herself up, but her eyes fell upon her 'arms' as they called them. There had been a little serum spilled on them, yet they were colored like they were coated in the blue stuff. Taking a look at herself, Twilight's entire body seemed to fall under that same category. \"In a few moments, you're going to be so different and unusual that even your so-called friends won't help but mock and laugh.\" Twilight smiled, though it faltered as she felt her stomach bluging out. \"You're wrong Glimmer, you clearly have a lot to learn about how friendship works.\" We'll see Twilight, we'll see how difference is noting to smile about.\"</span></div></div>",

The girl ran out with the others, leaving Twilight all by herself. Along with the hurt, there was a hint of satisfaction by making them leave. How could she possibly call them her friends now? After that rant about how...different she was from them....how....unequal. Twilight paused, suddenly she could see what Starlight had been telling her.

Don't tell me you all have already forgotten. One little difference between you and she turned on you and vice versa.\" Not wanting to argue with that, Sunset stepped back while Rainbow stepped forward. \"And you think that justifies what you did to her?\" Starlight nodded, \"Think of it like this: Everyone on a sports team must put in the work right? How can that be if some are better and or worse then others?\"<br>\r\nRainbow stood back in thought.<br>\r\n\"Many animals get angry if not given an equal amount of love and affection, right?\"<br>\r\nFluttershy nodded, though regretted it.<br>\r\n\"In baking, it's better to make sure everything is followed equally to the recipe right?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...sometimes...but....well\"<br>\r\nIn clothing in farming, it's important to keep materials at a equal preparedness.\"<br>\r\nRarity and Applejack looked to eachother in realization.<br>\r\n\"Sunset, I've heard the stories about you.

Starlight shrugged playfully, \"Just a little something that I his from my teacher. I don't know what she told you all about me, but let's just say this gave me the power to equalize others.\" She held the dark object closer to the girls, who all backed slightly. \"I know however that in this world, magic is not so commonplace, you all have nothing to protect you from the truth. Even now just being in the mark's presence makes you desire equality. While the girls did have resources with them being elements, their sparse use coupled with Twiligh's breakdown madethier magic weak.

It was seemingly to make sense, if so many things required equality to be perfect, then why was friendship any different? While they didn't fully accept it, their colors were beginning to gain a gray dull tint. Out of the girls, Sunset seemed to be the one holding out.

I need to return the favor!\" Turning her whole body to the school, Sunset rushed in with the intent of saving her friends. \"After all, why wouldn't I save my eq...\" Sunset stopped that thought before she finished thinking that word. The girls may be on the same level as her but the magic Starlight had still seemed to be in her. She had to be careful. With that in mind, she kept running through the halls until she heard voices. Not from where she left the girls but from where they had left Twilight. Wanting to see what was happening, Sunset sneaked over to the room and peered in through the open door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how much you six want to be equal now that I've given you it's magic, however I don't think you truley understand it.\" Twilight just kept her mouth shut when she had realized they weren't listening to her. \"What do you mean Starlight?\" Applejack asked, the gray tone more pronounced and her accent a little less noticeable. Starlight took one of the few remaining bottles of serum and gave it to the girls. \"You all will join Twilight in her blueberry state until further notice. To be more specific, after school tomorrow. When the students treat you all in the exact way I know they will, then equality's magic shall be a true thought in you all.\" With a smug grin, Starlight looked to Twilight and said \"Then I'll become YOUR teacher Twilight.\" Twilight said nothing still. Sunset  looked to the girls as each took a look at the serum. Each of them had the gray tone just as obvious as AJ and their more unique clothing items were off. Sunset had to stop this, but how? As much as she wanted to rush in, it was 7 to one along with Glimmer's amulet to make things difficult. Plus, just being close to Twilight would throw her off with what had happened earlier.</span></div></div>",

They had to be at a size that allowed entrance into room, but they were berrygirls nonetheless. Despite Sunset's best attempts, the girls were all mocked and teased either openly or behind their backs. Twilight, thinking there was nothing she could do, tried to ignore it as best she could. The others though had clearly been in Glimmer's equality mind control as they were disquested by their differences. Most of Sunset was enraged at Glimmer for doing this sort of thing. There was a small part of her though that still had a piece of Glimmer's power in her. This part felt it was the girl's fault for not being like the other students, but Sunset suppressed this this as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording the texts, the group all agreed to meet in the library after school. Hoping for the best, Sunset opened the doors. Sure enough, huddled by a table in the most low-traffic area of the place was her squad. Adagio was the first to see her, with a face that bordered between \"You have some nerve doing this.\"..and\" what happened to you?\" Noticing this, Sunset took notice that there was a slight gray tint left in her color. Quickly, she made her way to the table where an open seat was put. \"I want to thank you...\" \"Stuff it fire-hair!\" Aria growled, \"We aren't doing this because we want to!\" Everyone at the table nodded except for EGTwilight who just squirmed. \"Well then why are you here if you didn't want to help?\" Indigo spoke up, \"I know my friends and I just want the pleasure of possibly punching those game-breakers.\" Sonata added \"And no way is anyone gonna rob me of my personality!\" \"Yeah...\" Aria whispered, \"...because then you wouldn't annoy us for fun.\" Sunset hit the table softly to put attention back on her. \"Look, Starlight will be with the girl in the chemistry room, possibly to turn them back. We go in, stop her, fix the girls ourselves and break them from their trance. EGTwilight spoke out, \"Well what's in in for us?\" Sunset waved a hand, \"We'll discuss it later, let's go!\" The group(most of them reluctantly) got from the table and walked out of the library.</span></div></div>",

Most of the berries seemed uninterested in the newcomers and seemed to be rolling towards Sunset. \"No offense Sunset.\" Rarity said, her high class accent all but gone from her voice, \"But it's clear your the one in control.\" Fluttershy, her shyness obviously degraded, took notice short time in rolling on top of the girl. \"Yahhh! Get off of me!\" Sunset's muffled voice could be heard. \"Not until you join us in equality and your 'friends do the same.\" Applejack said as she and Rarity rolled on either side of Fluttershy. Meanwhile, none of the other non-berries were having good luck in their advancement. Even with her drive to be the best athlete gone, Rainbow's reflexes were still top notch as her large frame kept the Dazzlings from getting closer to Starlight. Pinkie meanwhile was herding the shadow bolts and SciTwi back, putting the two groups back together. Starlight chuckled as she leaned to Twilight. \"Yet another need of equality 'dear student.' It seems your friends are truley able stop this little invasion. They aren't worrying who'll get more praise because third all equal. Applejack and Rarity aren't fighting over who's idea will be better because their equal.

Sunset was doing her best to keep Twilight from rolling off course while everyone else kept running. Taking a shortcut through the main foyer of the building, the group made their way to the gym. Taking a quick look inside, Sunset saw that no one seemed to be in and began rolling the big berrygirl in. \"Well.....\" Aria said after gathering her breath, \"...I think we can chock that up as a failure.\" Sunset looked back to the group after she made certain the grayish-blue blueberry was stable. \"Now you all know just why I had you all come here, that Glimmer needs to be stopped.\" Twilight, now getting a good look at just who it was that tried to save her and her friends, had her jaw drop. \"Wh...w...What the heck are you all doing helping me?!\" Adagio looked to the girl and gave a smirk, \"We may hate you and your little friends for what you all did to us, but there is no way I'm gonna be just a boring face in the crowd.\" \"Me neither.\" \"Definitely not.\" \"No way in Tartarus.\" Twilight smiled, it was nice to know that it was possible to think even the worst of enemies could decide to help her. No one noticed but for a slight moment, her body gained a tint of blue back over the grey. As the rest of the girls began talking about how horrible the situation now seemed, Sunset sneaked back to Twilight. \"Hey...ummm..sorry about...\" \"No....I overreacted, I think Starlight had affected me more then I realize.\"<br>\r\n\"So, while we're on the subject.....\" Lemon Zest called out to Sunset, \"...you still haven't told us just what you were gonna give us for helping you.\" The whole group except for SciTwi turned their heads and passed slight glares along. \"Oh...ummm.....well....what do you think I should give you?\" \"OhOhOh\" Sonata yelled out as she shot her hand up before Aria slammed it down. \"No\" \"But I....\" \"NO Sonata! No more of your taco addiction.\" \"At least I have something to be joyful about, you just step aside and act all 'I don't care about anything because I'm a jerk.'\" Adagio held the two girls apart like a teacher seperated little kids. \"Both of you calm down and be quiet!\" Beside them, Sugarcoat snickered to her friends. \"Just look at em', little pony world freaks can't keep their heads straight.\" All three Dazzlings turned at the hearing of the comment and growled. \"What did you just say you hoofless human?\" Indigo laughed at Adagio's comment. \"Oh, hoofless. Is that what passes for an insult in your world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight watched as what she thought was a budding friendship burst through arguments. The blue tint she had gained back retreated to grey again as the thoughts of needed equality passed through her head. Even with her magic, her proximity to that equal mark amulet had given her a big dose of the power.</span></div></div>",

Besides, we're already here!\" The Dazzlings turned the corner into a dimly lit back alley with makeshift steps leading to an armored door. \"By the way, this place isn't exactly a crime free place so don't bother remembering it.\" Adagio stepped up and gave a series of quick knocks. A panel opened in the door and two blue eyes looked over the four. \"Password.\" A male voice said behind the door. \"Why does the fly wrap itself in the spider's web?\" Aria said in an uninterested tone. The eyes squinted before the panel closed. Multiple chains rattled and locks clicked before the door opened up. The three sirens stepped in with their 'friend' close behind with a guy wearing black and green clothes and black hair standing before them. \"Where would we happen to find Chrysalis?\" \"She's teaching some of the other 'drones' in the room three doors on the right. Welcome back by the way.\" Moondancer stayed close to the three girls as her eyes wandered around what she could only assume was an old stage. Many teens, all of them with the same blue eyes and black and green colors were either digging through undoubtedly stolen bags or.....reading off scripts. A slightly older female voice became obvious as the four girls came to the room. \"...most important thing about impersonations is to keep calm unless the person you're imitating is a nervous person.\" Sonata opened the door and a woman who looked about graduate age looked over a group of 'drones.'

Moondancer took a moment to look around the old building before meeting in the main theater with the rest. Many rooms were similar to the classroom the girls found the 'queen', as Chrysalis like to call herself. Others seemed to be storage for untold amounts of stolen items, black market merchandise, and more makeup and costumes then any working theater Moondancer saw had..(which isn't many but it's still a lot of makeup.) One last room that surprised her was what seemed to be sleeping quarters. Instead of average beds, it seemed the drones slept in some sort of green waterbed/sleeping bag hybrid. Putting her focus back to what was important, Moondancer made her way to the stage where everyone else was seated. The one empty seat she could immediately find in the audience section was in between two female drones in the front row, which she quickly took as Chrysalis continued her speech. The Dazzlings were on separate sides of the stage with a picture of Starlight Glimmer and a large map of Canterlot High tacked to a billboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....mantra is most likely coming from the Principal's office here. What that means is that it is another key area we need to pay attention to.\" Adagio stared to the large crowd before her and began to speak. \"Believe us when we say that this Starlight girl is smart and powerful, it won't be easy to fool her or anyone inside that school. This is especially true if she has already made the school into grey equality lovers, which makes them all boring, dull and similar down to the slightest movement. This means studying patterns before choosing who to impersonate is critical.\" Aria took a few steps before continuing. \"All three of us are aware Miss Chrysalis has taught you all much about obeying her, but don't think this alone will keep you safe. The magic she holds is capable of making friends turn on friends if necessary, so you all need some sort of ear protection to keep safe.\" Sonata took a step forward and added her own words. \"It seems Starlight has an odd thing for blueberries as she has turned all but one of Canterlot's magic-users into her blueberry slaves and seems to be growing herself. Take that into consideration if you all may.\" Chrysalis rolled her eyes. \"Yes...well...do you all understand? Impersonate the students after giving them our 'usual treatment', get close to Starlight and the office, turn off the mantra and smash her equality necklace. As stated, it would be better if the intercom comes off first as it can serve as a signal. With both sources of the spell gone, the students will be easier to revert to normal. If the principals, the 'blueberries', or anyone figure you out, non-lethal force only! I've trained you all well in breaking and entering so each group of seven should be able to sneak in from different angles. Make sure to refill makeup and costumes holders, and overload them both with grey's. Any questions should be directed to either our Dazzlings or to your queen:ME. We all meet back in ten minutes before heading out, do make your queen proud my sweet little drones. A collective \"Yes Queen Chrysalis.\" sounded before everyone started getting out of their seats.</span></div></div>",

A few teachers were eager to remind student of assignments and tests that would loom shortly upon their return, but such was lost amid the plans and chaos of the buzzing student body. And none were buzzing more than Twilight \"Science\" Sparkle and Sunset Shimmer, the biggest pair of love nerds this side of the mirror portal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you as excited as I am?!\" Twilight twittered with glee, a manic grin smeared across her face as dozens of thoughts raced across her mind. \"We'll finally be able to do all those long-form experiments we've been dying to do!

The only thing that threw her off was a missing mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? You home?\" she had called out, only to find a note explaining that she had gone off to visit an old friend and would be back later, leaving a small snack and pizza money for her to enjoy with Sunset for their night in. Twilight could only shrug, not recalling her mom mentioning seeing friends, but she supposed it was a last minute arrangement and would be fine. It jut allowed her more time to focus on getting preparations finalized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few hours, a knock came expectantly at the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sunset~ Come on in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Twi.

With a smile, Twilight closed her locker and saw Pinkie standing right beside her with her usual grin plastered to her face. \"Hey Twilight!\" Pinkie said gleefully \"Are you excited? I can't believe  the luck we're getting! I mean a three day weekend is great enough, but a FOUR day weekend is wonderful as all getout! By the way, I wanted to ask you something. Do you have anything that your doing this weekend?\" Twilight giggled at Pinkie's happiness and shook her head saying \"I've got nothing important that I know about, I guess I'm free to.......\" Before Twilight could say another word, Pinkie grabbed her by the arm and started dragging her along. \"Great Twilight, cause I've got something that I just know you'll love!\" Twilight rolled her eyes, but said nothing. She knew that once Pinkie was this excited, you could only play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight looked at the delicious desserts thst surrounded her. Brownies, pies, cakes, so many delicious goddies she didn't know what to choose. Her eyes darted around until she came to an eye-catching piece of peach cobbler. She licked her lips and prepared to dig in until she was pulled away by her friend.\"No silly.\" Pinkie giggled \"That's not what I wanted to show you.\" Pinkie pulled the grumbling Twilight to a locked door, entirely painted blue. Pulling out a key, also painted blue, from her hair, she unlocked the door and pulled Twilight through it. Twilight looked around the room and saw the amount of blue and guessed what was in them. \"Blueberries?\" Pinkie nodded and said \" I've been working with a whole load of blueberry recipes. I've been planning for all my friends to taste them. However, sence you've been such a superiffic friend, you can be the first to try them.\" Twilight grumbled, her heart still placed on that peach cobbler she saw. Not wanting to displease her friend however, she grabbed the closest thing she could.... a piece of blueberry pie. Holding it in her hand, she slowly bit into it. The warm sauce burst into her mouth, the flakey crust the perfect constast to it's smoothness. She could feel the lumps that were blueberries rolled across her mouth and swallowed. \"Oopsy\" Pinkie said as she pulled out a napkin, \"You got some blueberry sauce on your face.\"</span></div></div>",

She chomped down on a brownie stuffed full with the little blue fruit and shivered with delight. The chocolate seemed bittersweet, but this was counteracted by the blueberries perfectly. She soon turned her attention to a case of blueberry muffins and stuffed two in her mouth at once. The juice oozed slightly, spreading more of the deliciousness into her mouth. Pinkie watched a her friend kept eating with glee..... then to curiosity as she noticed something. Even though the sauce from another piece of pie was splattering onto Twilight, Pinkie was sure that none had gotten onto her legs. Twilight didn't notice, she just kept biting down on the irresistible treats with each bite becoming better than the last. \"Mmmmmmm. \"Twilight said through a mouthful of blueberry syrup. \"This is soo<span class=\"cblue\">ooo gooood.</span> \"Uhhhhhh.... Twilight?\" Pinkie said as the blue started crawling up Twilight's legs \"Why are both you and you lines of dialogue turning blue?\" Twilight took a second to register what Pinkie said, but dismissed it and went back to eating the heavenly buffet that Pinkie had so lovingly set out. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Delicious.....blueberries....must...have...more.\"</span> Pinkie watched for a few more seconds until she put two and two together. \"Twilight stop!\" she said as she tried to pull Twilight away from the blue buffet, \"Stop eating!\" Confused at her friend's actions, Twilight kept a hold on the table and said<span class=\"cblue\"> \"I don't want to.... I must have more.\" </span> With all the strength she could muster, Pinkie turned Twilight around and pulled her hand back, eventually slapping Twilight.<span class=\"cblue\"> \"Ow!

Pinkie was at a loss for words..... she just looked to her friend with fear and surprise on her face. \"Just see for yourself.\" She said as she pulled a large mirror from nowhere. Twilight gasped at what she saw. It was her face but she seemed a bit more 'blue' than usual.....literally. It was slowly enveloping her face, driving the previous color out. Her hair was becoming stripes of blue and she could almost swear her clothes were gaining a blue tint. \"What's happening to me?\" Pinkie looked over her friend, her fear changing to amazement. \"Your turning blue! Wow, this reminds me of that one story we read... what was it called? You're like that girl who got turned into a blueberry! Except..... you aren't....\" Before Pinkie could say another word, she saw Twilight had her back to her and was looking back at what blueberry themed desserts were left. She had grabbed a handful of the chilled blueberry cobbler and swallowed it. As she did, her body slowly began to blow up. \"Me and my fat mouth.\" Pinkie whispered, then said \"Twilight! You know what will happen!

For there, sitting with little comfort in a small plastic bowl, rested what appeared to be several dozen berried people, each shrunken down to true blueberry size and wriggling about with their useless appendages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sunset's body automatically stepped back, allowing her the room to rotate herself and prompty relief her stomach of its content into the local waste bin. Once, twice, three times did bile and the remains of Granny Smith's \"Apple Dapple Surprise\" come out of her, a small course of dry heaves followed to ensure all was lost and accounted for. Sitting herself down, Sunset put both hands to her face, the overwhelming tensions taking their toll on her psyche. She felt a small hand to her back, her mind alerting her to Fluttershy's comforting touch. With an internal nod, she embraced her friend, tears streaming between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I-i'm... so sorry...Fluttershy...\"</span></div></div>",

The Dazzlings, the soon-to-have-been conquerors of Canterlot High School and the world at large, were fleeing on foot to escape the inevitable wrath of the student body they had just tried to mind control with teir siren songs. Unfortuantely for them, those accursed Rainbooms and that Sunset girl had foiled their plot and shattered their only means of taking control over the simple for of CHS. Adagio was fuming, her mind reeling with how to solve the current predicament while her cohorts, Sonata and Aria, bickered back and forth at who's fault it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"If you had actually managed to <i>hit</i> one of those Rainbooms, I wouldn't have to have covered your flank!\" Aria raged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's not my fault that you're a poor shot yourself!\" Sonata shouted back, resting on the fin line between her usual happy-go-lucky attitude and a seething frustration that welled inside her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Will you two shut up for once! Celestia! I can hardly think straight with you two at each other's throats!\" Adagio barked at them, silencing the two for the moment. Rubbing her fingers against her temples, Adagio tried to figure what was their newest plan. Something bold and ensuring of their revenge. But, they only had a little magic left between the three of them, so everything had to hinge on that contingency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Quick, what do have in your pockets,\" Adagio commanded. The other Dazzlings rapidly rummaged through their pants to find a paperclip, seventy-two cents and a stick of gum. \"Ugh, mostly junk I see,\" she growled, \"but it'll have to make due. I can;t see anything worthwhile outside of the gum, so we'll need t enchant that with what we have left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What's gum gonna do? It's not like it can get our powers back...\" Aria grumbled, her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"It's all we have left Aria! Unless you have some better idea?\" A long pause followed. \"I thought not. Come on, let's get this thing going before anyone sees us.\" The other two nodded and began to harmonize with one fina, although rather short, song which infused the gum with a dark and mysterious blue aura. \"Now all that's left is to bring our little payload to the right target.\"</span></div></div>",

She was so nervous that she was starting to sweat, then again, who could blame her? Her nervous sweating got worse as she saw students coming to the door. She looked through the small number coming in, though shook her head. When she was certain they had passed her, she turned the walkie-talkie on. \"Students have come in but Twilight isn't with them. Considering she seems to be the smart type, she would be as early as now.\" \"Okay then....\" Adagio's voice could be heard through the speaker., \" Then she's somewhere already in the school like I thought. Sonata and I will keep looking, but tell us if more students arrive.\" Aria waited for a moment before saying, \" Where the hell is Sonata anyways?\" A muffled voice came through, \"I'm definitely not in the kitchen making tacos.\" Both girls groaned, but Adagio's voice said \" Wait..... I see her.She's sleeping at a desk, I'll have to be quick about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping her disguise on, Adagio crept to the sleeping girl. Carefully, she put the gum the girls had infused with magic into Twilight's hand. \"She has it,\" Adagio whispered, \"I'm getting out. Before she could move, she heard the door handle jiggled. She quickly used he costume to her advantage, staying out of sight. \"Hey...\" She heard outside her costume, \"...who left this trashcan here?\" Adagio could feel her hiding spot moved, but not before an unknowing person threw a piece of gum in, landing g right on her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the lunch, the chemistry lab seemed to have a wailing spirit somewhere around the new trashcan.</span></div></div>",

Through the streets of town and across the parklands, Adagio and crew kept a close beat to Twilight until reaching a small homestead on the opposing side of the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Let's hope she takes the bait here, my feet are killing me,\" Aria grumbled in whispers, wanting to remove her shoes and rub her sore soles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Just keep focused! I know she'll chew it here,\" Adagio said with a firm voice, a small clump of hair missing from her otherwise bouncy hairdo.

Although Sonata was a little miffed about the news, she looked through the window in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant Twilight had begun chewing, the unmistakable taste of blueberries spread through her mouth. Twilight licked her lips at the taste, believing it to be one if the greatest things she had ever tasted in this world. Twilight sat there for a few minutes, merely enjoying the taste of the gum. As she chewed, she felt a tingle resonate throughout certain parts of her body. Curious to these tingling, Twilight looked to herself. At first she noticed nothing, everything seemed fine. But then, a tingle went through her hand. This was followed by the hand's color turninf from purple to a very dark blue. Twilight watched as the blue spread out, covering the whole hand. Rolling up her sleeves, she saw that the blue had already gone through her arms and around her body. Twilight figured her whole body was blue by now.

We get her so called friends to insult her....\" \"Yes...\" \"They can't use their magic on us or anything!\" Adagio passed the big berry to Sonata. \"After that, the next phase of my plan will be put into action.\" Sonata grabbed at the blue Twilight with a sigh. \"I still want some smoothies though.....\" Adagio walked to the blue ball of juice and lightly pushed Sonata away. \"Now our sweet little Twiberry, here is how you are going to be tomorrow....\"</span></div></div>",

Aria rolled her eyes, still not believing this plan was going to work. Sonata and Adagio lokked in hopefulness as Twilight seemed to tense up. She began to blow up even more then she had before, signaling something was happening. After another deep breath, Twilight relaxed and stopped blowing up.

She smirked, sensing she was the one with the overarching power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's right my masters, keep drinking. The more you do, the more of your power returns,\" she said, imitating her own droned voice. The Dazzlings simply nodded as they continued to lap and suckle and take in all the juice they could from their berrygirl, sticky trails of blue juice trickling down their bodies. Adagio was especially focused on her intake, trying to force gallons of juice into herself in the vain hopes of becoming the grand leader she once was. They were blind to what was actually happening and Twilight knew it all too well, pumping them full of her berried essence. </span></div></div>",

All the patrons inside did nothing but stare in awe as the aura swallowed them up, the light blinding all who saw. With a sharp pulse of energy, Twilight's body buckled, streams of juice gushing from her and into each guest, causing all to begin the same process as she had. Many screamed in fright before joining those who were now embracing the sudden changes.

Midnight gave a dark and maniacal laugh, she never got this respect from being a hero. She could see why many prefer the dark path, it felt so GOOD! \"Speaking of feeling good....\" She thought as she turned to the three sirens that had served her so well. \"Adagio, Sonata, Aria.\" All three stood at attention as their mistress motioned towards her. \"I believe you three have garnered my graditude. You deserve a nice little reward in exchange for your wonderful servitude.\" The three bowed their heads in reverence though their bodies shook with pure excitement. With a flick of Midnight's hand, three large chalices appeared in their hands. Sonata looked in the cup, but saw nothing in it. \"Um...Mistress?\" Midnight chuckled, \"Oh silly me, I almost forgot...\" Midnight took another deep breath and her body glowed a mix of purple and blue. The Dazzlings felt weight in the cups they were holding and noticed they were filling up. \"Go ahead my dears, drink up, I know how much you all enjoy my juice.\" None of the dazzlings took hesitation and began chugging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdagio's whole world had vanished around her, the delicious blueberry juice flowing into her the only thing on her mind. Her already blue skin had begun darkening, but she didn't care. Her stomach was slowly beginning to swell up, but that wasn't important right now. There was something that was proving curious though. No matter how much she was drinking, the cup still seemed as full as when it started. It wasn't a bad thing however, that just ment more juice for her to drink. Through the haze of the juice, she could hear the voice of her mistress. She seemed to be talking to the crowd. <i>\"Behold my new slaves, behold the transformation of the three that you all will obey alongside me. As with me, you all will obey them without question.</i> Adagio let the cup drop slightly, only to breath but she wasn't happy to do so. As she did so, she was able to get a good look to herself. Her clothing had become something similar to Midnight's but nowhere near as beautiful. Turning to her other sirens, she saw the same changes had happened to them. She could also tell they had all.swelled up like blueberries. Moreso then the crowd, but less then her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAJ and Sunset looked at the scene in front of them with wide eyes.

She tried to keep her focus on her target and tried to shut out everything else. She tried not to listen to the laughter of her former friend quickly drawing closer. She didn't think twice about the sounds of thrashing liquid knocking someone down to the ground echoing behind her. Her mind tried to block out the realization that there was no way she was gonna outrun Midnight and her juice whips. She hoped to Celestial the odd feeling wrapping up her legs was only her paranoia and imagination. After a blink or two though, it was clear this was all the case. The whips slowly pulled Sunset back, forcing her to watch as she was pulled from what was most likely their only hope. The whip soon pulled Sunset into the air and turned her around. Now dangling by her knees, Sunset watched fearfully as Midnight shook her head. \"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Here I was hoping I wouldn't need to be harsh, but you two are more trouble then anyone else.\" Out of the corner of her eye, Sunset could see the other whip grabbing a similar hold upon the downed Applejack. Soon, both girls were dangling in front of the berrybodied villainess. The whack from before tiring her out, AJ muttered, \"Yah'll...ain't gonna win.....Midnight...Twilight....whatever.\" Midnight let out another maniacal laugh. \"The old 'you can't win' speech, so like you AJ.\" Putting on a look of false worry, she then said, \"Oh you poor southern belle, I bruised you didn't I? Let me fix that.\" The juice from the whip speed across the scrapes, healing them instantly.  \"Now....the real question becomes what to do with you two? I could just turn you both right now and be done with it. Or....I can take you back to the party and let all of my little slaves watch as their mistress and her three commanders decide your fate. Either way is fine, but let's hear your opinion. Think of it as the last decision you'll ever make on your own.\" The two girls looked to each other, the situation seemed pretty hopeless either way.

Looking from the stage, she saw all of her friends and fellow students and teared up again. Just looking at their berry forms and knowing she was about to join them made her heart ache.

They followed their mistress as she left the building, all rolling along to her will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright....ah sure hope Twilight's friends know where the journal is in thier world.\" After retrieving Sunset's journal from her house, AJ ran right home. With all the apples around, it just helped her calm down after all the blueberrys she had seen. Applejack looked out the window and noticed a blue speck of light in the distance. Peering out her window, she could see the lights of Midnight's clothes...and loads of blue behind her. Students she was friends with, having saved a few times over, were rolling alongside their corrupted leader. All of them coming to turn her into one of them. If she had a plan, she had to choose it now!</span></div></div>",

She paid it little mind, flinging herself deeper and further into its throng. In spite of the warm spring weather that had graced the world around it, the woods around her were cast into the everlasting twilight of late autumn, trees barren of leaves and jaggedly clawing to the sky for a foul revenge. Losing wind in her lungs from the frosted bite of the oxygen around her, AJ slipped behind a nearby hus of a tree and took the moment to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Tarnation, the folks weren't kiddin' bout the spook out here. Hopefully it'll keep that pesky Midnight at bay for now,\" she grimaced as she better observed her surroundings. Tendrils of fog flitted in the air, wisps of curling plant tips ticked the ground-abiding clouds with barbs and briars. Shadows danced in delight, leaving no look at the same object twice the same. Despite her brilliance in hiding, AJ now feared she may have duped herself into missing her backup should she never break free of the darkness about her. It was a frigid feeling, casting an icy glaze over her stomach. Nothing but the faintest sounds of her former friends could be heard, all of them nowhere near courageous enough to bother searching this far out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And Ah'll be happy it stays that way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"To whom are you addressing, Child of the Apple Kindred?\" a voice spoke out from the depths of inky blackness behind her. Applejack's eyes slowly panned down to her shoulder and took note of the smokey blue hand grasping it. Her heart skipped a beat, the Enchantress! Locked by the fear, AJ could barely hold her ground against the living legend of her town. Perhaps her luck had truly run out after all.</span></div></div>",

If this was really gonna give her the power to even resist the power of Midnight then all she needed was to dig in.

She felt herself getting stronger, magic and her family bloodlines felt like they were coursing through her.

As she dropped the core, a pulse of power pinged inside of her and the golden glow started to brighten. <br>\r\nLooking to herself, AJ could see her clothes changing before her eyes.

In a short amount of time, Twilight was now a big red applegirl and released her mouth from the funnel. \"Thank you my mistress, I was so stupid to think blueberries were wonderful, or that I could rule over you.\" Appljack got off her friend and looked between her and those who were still blueberries. Thier eyes seemed lost, they needed a purpose....someone to rule them maybe? As this thought came through her head, a voice rang out from behind her.</span></div></div>",

Looking around once more, AJ finally found Sunset checking up on those she freed from Midnight. When the whining of the sirens hit fever pitch, AJ relented. \"Fine, ah'll let ya have some juice. Hopefully yah'll lose year evil ways through it.\" The three berrygirls rolled themselves back up, cheering as three golden juice ropes snaked towards them. Without any word from the annoyed AJ, the three began drinking. Having less dark magic then Midnight had, it took less time for the blueberry to leave and the apple essense to take it's place. Looks of bliss were on their faces as red now became their base color. When they were as big as Twilight was now, they let go of the ropes. \"Thank you Mistress Applejack.\" The three applegirls said in unison. \"Ah ain't year mistress so cut that out.\" \"But you've given us such wonderful juice.\" Aria said \"You've made us into the fruit of your command, of course you're our mistress.\" \"Well ah ain't.\" \"Oh come now mistress....\" Adagio said as she rolled closer to the farm girl. \"Only those worthy of control have the power to control us, and clearly you have it.

I need their help and so does Twilight! Even the whole human world and maybe even Equestria for all I know!\" Sunset tore through the room at breakneck speeds that would make Rainbow green with envy until Spike stood in her path and blocked her. \"Hey,hey,hey. We got your message alright. The instant the girls heard about the whole blueberry problem, they dashed through the portal without a second thought.\" \"So they <b>did</b> come last night.\" Sunset whispered to herself before her eyes widened in fear. \"Spike, I think those girls stood a face-off with three berried and powerful sirens last night when they came.\" \"The Dazzlings?! Oh great! Those girls were unprepared for the human world! They couldn't have reacted in time!\" \"Wait...maybe that is great Spike. It may be just what we now need!\" Spike raised what would be an eyebrow at his statement. \"Ummm..did that blackout give you brain damage or something?\" \"No, it's just now the blueberries have been turned into apples by Applejack and now they need to be stopped. Maybe if we can get the blueberry girls thriving again....I'll explain later. Right now....</span></div></div>",

My dimension's Applejack is currently ruling over a large population of apple people, and I have strong suspicions that the Dazzlings have transformed Twilight;s friends into blueberries. I fear for the worst, as it seems the leader of a given fruit is consumed with megalomania and some form of dark magic. I cannot do this alone, and am requesting some kind of help. Spike and I are currently trying to plan an uprising of sorts against the fruit people.

Sunset looked over the guards with a hint of worry. \"I sure hope we didn't hurt them.

We must cleanse them of this apple problem and they will undoubtibly be healthy.\" \"Right...now TO THE LIBARAY!\" With that, the trio rushed into the building. With their speed, they felt certain they would be able to pass by any guards way before they would catch up.<br>\r\nCelestial looked over the many screens that lined the wall beside her.

They might have returned so keep your eyes peeled.

After a few minutes of climbing and pushing, the berries, hybrid, humans and dog made their way back into the library. \"My sister is aware we're here, once she sees us on the security cameras she will alert the others. As for that blueberry-hater, I think she is in the gym setting up for a conversion show for if she catches you.\" Rainbow nodded at the blueberry-apple's notice and grinned. \"Well then, let's get rolling!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia stared at the screen showing the library doors with suspicious eyes. \"The one room we didn't put cameras in and it had to be there.\" She sighed, Luna should have given those non-apples a taste of apple life by now. Without warning, the doors burst forward and Celestia rolled forward in hope. Hope that was turned to anger when she saw that not only were the fugitives not apples, but that her own sister was once again tainted by blueberry juice. Leaning far to reach the intercom button, a small click was all that was needed before Celestia put on the alert. \"Attention all apples, our little fugitives are loose in the halls. They have blueberry girls in their possession and have turned Vice Principal Luna into a hybrid! All possible measures must be taken to ensure our mistress is safe!\" Upon hearing the news, all the apples in the school were on the approach. The group had no worries however as there was one thing truly positive about being a blueberry: Round shape= greater mobility!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEqAJ chuckled as she heard the intercom news. \"Yah see Twilight? Us apples always have an extra eye over everything, somethin yer blueberry ways didn't have.\" \"I know Mistress Applejack.\" Twilight said as she looked over the apple-themed stage with pride, \"What was I thinking? Being a blueberry was ridiculous. By the way, are you sure <i>they'll</i> be here in time for the celebration?\" \"The Dazzlings? Ah wouldn't be surprised if they're already back and......\" Applejack's talk was cut short by the sound of doors slamming open. Taking in a deep breath, she turned around to see the rebels standing before her. \"Ain't this a suprise? This saves me the trouble of having to hunt yah'll down mahself. Why don't yah'll just get on the stage and ah'll tell Celestia to call to students here?\" The blueberry AJ rolled forward with a scowl on her blue face. \"Bein an Apple may be a great thing, but bein the fruit is when it goes too far. Yah'll need to learn respect fer the only fruit worthy of such a transformation.\" The apple shrugged and motioned at Twilight. \"Twi, could yah'll take take of this fer me?\" Twilight nodded though not without the slightest bit of hesitance for hurting her friends. She went forward, ready to defend her mistress.</span></div></div>",

Most of those blueberries answered back with their own volleys of juice. Both sides put their differences in mobility to use as the large area of the gym became nothing short of a battlefield. As Applejack held herself back in hopes that Twilight could take care of this, the intercom system clicked on. \"Attention all apples! Our Mistress is under fire in the gym, this is a code red situation! Head to the gym immediately and protect Applejack!\" AJ smiled, there was no way these berries were gonna turn Twilight before everyone else got here. That thought sunk in despite seeing just how outnumbered her apple slave was. Despite the lack of numbers on her side however, Twilight's magic and proficiency in fruit juice blasting kept the blueberries at bay and the non-fruit even farther. Blast after blast was fired from all direction and the shots began to hit all around. The stages and chairs and everything Applejack had set up for the conversion of the rebels was getting juiced and slammed...and making quite a beat in doing so. Taking notice of this, Sonata began humming to herself, imagining what kind of tune could go with the crashing and dripping beat around her. Aria saw her fellow hybrid and began to take note of the beat herself. A little into it, she began to fire volleys not at Twilight alone but at the surroundings to see what noise it made. All the while, both began to shake to the slowly-distinguished beat. Adagio now noted this and an idea formed in her head. A moment of thought for what to do and she began her work, first softly then in a growing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/music1.png\" alt=\"*Music1*\" title=\"Music1\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> Boop-bop-shee-do.Shee-doop-bop.

A slight wiff of blue mist came from Adagio before be had stopped singing. Sunset, Spike and EgLuna held their ears down while the other berries urged the trio on. \"That was divine Mistress Adagio, sing on.\" \"Yeah, no way would we loose with singing like that!\" Taking in deep breath while slinging juice, the sirens took center stage and the jazzy tune sounded once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Unless Specified, the Chorus is Sonata and Aria, but soon shows the other berries as well)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChorus(Continuous):Boop-bop-shee-dop-bah-doop-boo-shoo-bah-doo<br>\r\n<i>With a belly of blue and a juicy spell, it was clear to non-apples that you ment well.

Poking through the apple miasma in her mind were thoughts of her rule, thoughts that she tried to supress. The mist the three sirens spewed began to touch the other berries, gving them a feeling of power and even giving some blue tint to the hybrids. EQApplejack scowled, \"Darn those sirens, ya turn yer back and what do they do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>All three: Listen dear Mistress, break from this your cage, show that no good apple just how to behave.<br>\r\nShe forced into something that breaks your code, She put you into some kind of slavery mode.<br>\r\nEgAJ: That ain't the way to focus for a blueberry queen, yah'll need tah break from power that mah other self feeds.<br>\r\nDazzlings:Listen to us mistress, hear our advice, that apple tried to break you so she must pay the price. Just let our words relax you and stop your assault, let us fix the problems that are the apple-girl's fault.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, many of the apple students had already reached the gym but the siren song made it so that was as far as they got. No longer on top focus, Twilight's guard was lowered enough that five bolts of blue landed square into her mouth. The urge to swallow was too much and Twilight could feel the darkness flowing again. As her body began to shake and spark, the somg began to reach a climax. The blue mist now began to circle Twilight, turning the red into a more suitable color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ahh,,ahhhh,ahhhh,ahhhhh,shoo-bop, dah-wahhhh,ahhh, Mistress Midnight making a comebacka!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark blast of blue magic and the thick scent of blueberries filled the air as the body floated up. The sparking became stronger and faster as blue completely encompassed the red and a round shape ended the bumps. The apple Applejack looked with fear as the round figure's transformation neared an end. A soft voice came as the smoke cleared.<br>\r\n<i>My dearest friends, my faithful friends, thank you for the drink. For the first time in hours, I can truly think. The apple infestation shall now come to an end, cause Midnight Berry Sparkle is now back in!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Midnight laughed as she teleported closer to the insubordinate applegirl. \"It won't work this time Applejack, this time it is I who is ready for you.\" With the apple students still blocked off by the fear of the blueberry sirens, Midnight had nothing stopping her as she pulled out her beloved juice whips and slashed away.

You don't deserve the enchantments in your posession!\" With that, the juice whips wrapped themselves around Applejack and moved in a pumping manner. The applegirl winced in pain as she felt something being pulped out of her. \"Ow...what...what are yah'll doing?\" Applejack froze when she realized she was able to point her hand at Midnight. Her fear grew when she realized she was also able to move her arm. Her apple form...it was shrinking! \"NO! My apple body! Mah magic!\" EQApplejack could only watch as her apple magic was being siphoned out of her and her body slowly turning to normal. While Applejack turned back to normal however, her magic was being changed by Midnight's whips. By the time the magic reached her, it was pure blueberry magic. Her body swelled even farther and her dress became even more elegant and eye catching. Hearing moaning coming from the doors, Midnight looked as those who relied on the magic of apples turned back into humans seeing as the magic was now gone. <br>\r\nSunset watched as Midnight now began to pump gallon after gallon of blueberry juice into Applejack. \"I don't know about you two, but I say we get out of here now!\"</span></div></div>",

The plan did not have the wanted effect and if they didn't get out right now then they wouldn't have time to make a second plan. Before they could do anything in the category of running, each found a blue juice whip reaching for them. As each of them struggled against the capture attempt, Midnight smiled upon them. \"You three have performed beyond my expectations. Especially you Sunset, risking becoming such a horrid fruit as an apple to save me. You three have earned quite the need for a reward. Just hold still so I can give it to you.\" Luna tried to blast the whip away from her, but every time she cut it then two would replace it. Spike attempted to use his size to get away, but his reckless running soon landed him in capture. Finally, poor Sunset had nothing to protect her and the hopelessness she once felt came flooding back. As Midnight pulled each of them closer, Applejack was being let go a happy blueberry servant like everyone else. Meanwhile the Dazzlings were at the door using their berry songs to transform the students. \"Twilight....\" Spike whined, \"Why are you doing this? Please stop.\" Luna added in, \"Your duties as a princess do not allow you to...\" A dark chuckle from Twilight stopped Luna. \"The age of friendship magic is over Luna, the age of blueberry dominance will now begin!\" Three juice whips rose up to the faces of the three captives while the berried five watched from below. While Rarity was prodding Spike and Luna was being difficult, Sunset opened wide. She had given up hope and was prep aired to drink to the content of her new mistress. </span></div></div>",

Within seconds she was happily sucking away at the whips and her pleas entry would soon be matched by Luna and Spike. \"The beginning of my true life....I will never forget that glorious day.\" Floating through the hallways of the castle of Blue Divinity (formally the Castle of Friendship), she was followed by a mare who attempted to overthrow her once before she was shown the light. \"I trust your studies in the company of the Dazzlings have increased your understandings Starlight?\" \"Yes, the commanders of what is now known as Canterlot Gardens truly have taught me much about the power of blueberries. They suggest I come back if only to ask when you will visit again.\" \"You may go, tell them I will be back in a day or two, there are some matters I must clear up.\" \"Yes my mistress.\" Starlight said as she tried to bow down and rolled away. Looking over her window, Midnight laughed upon the mares and stallions she used to believe were equal to her. When she had returned with her berrygirls though they all fell to her. If they were not working on another statue of her or drinking juice from various sources, she didn't care. Unless it involved remembering the important of her and blueberries. Passing by a darkened door, Midnight heard the grunts of her former mentor and her brother, possibly the only ponies left who refused her rule to this point. They never have broken their resolve but sooner or later. \"Mistress Midnight!\" Midnight turned to find her world's Rainbow: Captain of the Blue bolts before her. \"The festival The Obediant and Blueberried Trixie has created in honor of your first year of discovering Blueberry dominance is ready. She is humbly waiting for you to come and open the festivities.\" With a nod, Midnight teleported both herself and Rainbow out to the stage in front of her castle. \"My dear blueberry servants, today marks the first year anniversary of my discovery of the power of blueberries. I have granted it to you, and you all obey me as you should. Already, Equestria is falling under my power and soon I shall control all!\" The crowd, both of humans and ponies alike cheered a their mistress's words. \"I urge you all to enjoy yourselves my servants. Bask in the glow of your mistress and your chosen fruit.\" With a collective \"Long Live Mistress Midnight Berry!\" The crowd watched as the show began.</span></div></div>",

You don't know the first thing about magic while I am powerful enough I could take over the school even without my wonderful blueberry magic. I had to be broken from your magic but you never had that test.\" \"You tell her Mistress!\" Sonata yelled in encouragement. \"Stay out of this ya caterwauling creeps! And ah ain't gonna need that test cause when yah'll go down this time, it'll be the last time!\" Midnight chuckled as she let her whips down with a large sword forming on both sides of her body where her hands would have been. \"Alright then cowgirl, one slice each, whoever drinks first is the loser.\" The large applegirl smirked as she traded her many whips for two large lassos. \"Yer move berrygirl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of them could feel the shockwave as it passed by them after shattering every window in the school. \"That won't be easy to repair....\" EQLuna said.

We need them both neutralized or the whole cycle will start over again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trio kept up their conversation, a red apple-bodied figure made her way around the side of the building. Principal Celestia was determined to make certain that her mistress would not be hindered in her rightful control. Unlike the apples fighting in the gym though, she figured it would be better to get rid of the worst of the problem at it's source. \"Don't worry Miss Shimmer...\" she whispered as she watched the three figures talking, \"...all I need is one slight second of chance. With the power you three will give to the cause of apples, I'm sure Mistress Applejack will forgive your insolence.\" Readying her hands, three orbs of apple juice were produced, just enough that the three targets would become docile. After that, she'd close in for the kill. With careful precision, she aimed her orbs where they would directly hit the mouths of the targets.

My my, you're awfully unripe for being a blueberry. All my berries are the ripest, juiciest fruits from all around. And now, I'll make sure you get the very same treatment</i> the Bush soothed AJ as more and more juice and pollen entered her system. While her belly continued to expand outwards and reaching beach ball size, her butt and breasts also took up an assault, expanding furiously to catch up to the predominate gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Thank...you...\" AJ smiled weakly as her body ballooned outwards, her hands happily rubbing her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>Only the best for my favorite little berry.

No sense in having it then, off it goes!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"My...decency...!\" Applejack slowly tried to reach around herself to cover herself up, if only to get swatted at by the vines hard at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>Tsk tsk my little berry.

Thankfully, any sensitive spots were covered well by AJ being tucked away within the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>See? Isn't that better? Here comes a surge just for you my little berry!</i> the Bush cheered as it blasted a torrent of juice into AJ's tummy, forcing her body to truly begin to fully become spherical.</span></div></div>",

The minute her family came into town, things just seemed to fly south for Apple Jack's enjoyment. The Blueberry family might not be as widespread or as well known as the Apple family, but they seemed to be getting closer every day. Applejack and her family were never bothered by any Blueberry family members until Juicy Berry and her family moved in. The family immediately took up land not too far off from Sweet Apple Acres and started cranking out blueberry products like nobody's business. Some customers who weren't apple fanatics or close friends of the Apple family started turning their heads and wallets to the new family. Despite this, Applejack had tried to be friendly. However, when she had gone to the farmer's market one day. She became enraged at a blueberry stand standing where her family's stall usually went. That was when she first met Juicy Berry and the two certainly didn't hit it off. They were almost identical in personality except for one small difference. Juciy Berry seemed to be unbelievably certain that her family was better. She would often say to Applejack how her family would be working at Berry Blue Fields by the end of the year. The two bickered often and threats and a few sabatoges were flinged every now and again. The two had become quite the rivals, and nothing any of AJ's friends could say would keep AJ from such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how does it feel AJ? Having to sit next to yer future employer?\" She always asked that question. Applejack groaned at the girl's words, sick and tired of every day of this. Juicy smirked at AJ when she wasn't looking. Applejack didn't know it, but this time she was serious. Soon AJ would be a happy friend of both her and the Blueberry family.</span></div></div>",

Leaning up against a wall was her blue-colored rival: Juciy Berry. \"Juicy\" Applejack growled as she struggled harder against her binds, \"Just where the heck are we and what the heck are ya doing?\" Juicy chuckled as she walked to her apple-growing rival. \"To awsner yer first question, we're in a hidden shed out in the thick of Berry Blue Fields. And yer second awsner is that what I've told ya would happen will come sooner then ah've said.\" Applejack rolled her eyes, knowing quite well what Juicy ment. \"So year thinking that by kidnapping me, mah family will become yer workers? Talk about a low down snake.\" Once again, Juicy chuckled though with a darker aspect. \"Ransom demands? Maybe yer family would do such a thing, but the Blueberry family prefers more....creative methods.\" \"Now hold it right there! Mah family would never do this kind of thing! When they find out about this though, yah'all are gonna learn why we don't often have competition.\" Juicy just smirked as she pulled out.....</span></div></div>",

It plagued her in childhood and was never shaken, this fear of medicinal needles, as horrific images of words past spoken and memories flashed before her, her eyelids did flutter, before finding herself to weighted to carry a conscious load and returned to her darkened sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh Applejack, I can't have you passing out on me,\" Juicy sighed, injecting the syringe into AJ's arm before tapping Applejack's cheek to rouse her from her darkened state.

Applejack looked to her captor, who grinned evily at her look. Applejack looked back to the splotch, horrified to find out it had already spread to at least half her arm. A tiny blue speck came out from the puncture before it healed. Juicy dabbed it up with her finger and licked it, bringing a disgusted look from AJ. \"Mmmm...Blueberry juice, how delicious.\" The itching started to get worse and applejack looked back to her arm. The area around where the puncture was seemed to be inflating. Giving a slight wiggle, a sloshing sound could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well ah better get going, ah got some work to do in the fields. Ah'll be back to check up on ya.

A load of garbled audio was coming from seemingly nowhere and a slideshow presumably showing members of the Blueberry family was playing.

In exchange for giving them sanctuary, Cerulean allowed for them to join. However, only one of the three was on board with all the rules set forth by the first Berries of Light. In her mind, Cerulean expected it, only one of them naturally bore the great color while the others had orange and purple to work with. Shaking her head, Cerulean entered a large greenhouse area with three main berry bushes in the spotlight. The one on the far left was pristine and clear, already growing flowers and berries. It's caretaker was wealding shears, pruning the bush with her blue ponytail in a bunch to protect it. The two on the right were of less perfection, but still looked fine. The orange girl in the center seemed to be in a private conversation with her purple friend, one which was cut off by the cult leader clearing her throat. \"Excellent work my dears. You truly are becoming closer to the rank of believers. Especially you miss Sonata, your bush is beautiful.\" \"Thank you Mistress Cipher.\" Sonata said, happy to be given praise for once. \"Now Adagio and Aria, you two are farther behind but I know you will catch up to your friend.\" \"Thank you Mistress Cipher.\" The two had said mistress with a twinge but Cerulean didn't mind. \"Now my dears in case you didn't hear our goddesses have arrived at last.

With a collective nod, the group members got into position and prepared to roll the berrygirls towards their new \"home\". The back hatch flashed open, revealing a manicured lawn and an extensive estate of mansion. Much of the front looked more to be like an office building, but the back hinted at something far more inviting for the likes of the berried sisters. Rolled along, the group and the berries maneuvered into the enlarged front doors, directed down the nearest hallway and further on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The halls of the estate were of a pale blue color, many sets of double doors hiding secrets behind them, florescent lights buzzing softly above them all. Soon enough, the lot gathered before a rather impressive set of rich oaken doors. With a knock, a voice called to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Come in please~\" Swinging the doors aside, the group rolled the sisters into a spacious office space, a few scant chairs placed before one jet black desk with the high-backed matching chair turned away from its intended audience. \"What have you brought me today Cream team?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Madame President, we've gotten two more subjects, recovered from the Sweet Apple Acres. Appearances suggest farm hands or family workers. Highly addicted towards our \"A La Mode\" enhancers and having ripeened extensively,\" the first member replied, bowing before the chair. It swiveled to reveal a rather tall woman, still young but with a domineering face and an icy cool to her eyes. The stranger part was how her skin shone, a deep and saturated violet color glowing from her form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You've done me well Cream team. Please, leave me to these two. I must shower them with my love before I decide what fate will befall them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"O-of course Madame President...\" the first member nodded, ushering the others towards their lab for further developments. Now, left alone, the two berries were at the mercy of one Madame President Violet Hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Welcome my darling blueberries to your new home here at the Berry Foundation! Mama Violet is here tomake sure you get all the loving you'll need to grow and ripe into the perfect berries for the rest of your lives~\"</span></div></div>",

However, her thoughts were interupted by a clear voice giving her a simple \"Hello.\" Violet turned to the direction of the voice and internally screamed. Standing right beside two large berrygirls was the big woman herself. \"Mmm....mm...Madame President Violet!\" Starlight stammered as she gave a salute. \"Oh calm yourself Violet. I'm just making a surprise visit is all....oh, and I see my latest little berry is being shown around.\" \"*smack*...Hi Mama....*smack*\" Violet began to saunter towards the two as she continued. \"It would seem that through unfortunate events, our operation has been discovered. Not that it matters too much, this place isn't on maps of the packaging and people forget things in a big rush. Most of the staff already know by now but I wanted to personally give my favorite caretaker the news.\" Starlight's grin faltered, having always been fearful of Violet. \"When I say favorite, I mean favorite. Just look at all of my wonderful and cute little fruits cared for by such a delicate girl. I just knew hiring you was a wonderful choice, I just want to hug every single one of these girls...\" A lightbulb went off in Starlight's head. \"Well..., why don't you do that? Come on girls, pile onto Mama Violet!\" While surprised herself, Violet happily opened her arms to welcome the blueberries rolling to her. With their size, Starlight was obstructed from view and so she let fate take it's course.</span></div></div>",

All she could do was try to pick out shapes in the foggy door. She couldn't make out any facial features, but only seemed to see round shapes.A few loud rings signaled the shower was coming to a close and Starlight felt the locks releasing. Taking one last glance, her eyes widened.  \"No! Nonono....\" Starlight ran off, wanting to get as far away from the door as possible. As she turned the corner out of sight, the double doors slammed open revealing Violet with no changes whatsoever. \"I've been drinking berry juices for years Glimmer! I can't be berried! Which is more than I can say for you!\" In hindsight, Violet had long suspected Starlight was against her work. She had rarely attended the foundation's gatherings and always took way too long when she filed reports over her actions. \"Be a good group of berries my dears and go give Starlight a little 'push' for Mama.\"</span></div></div>",

The only problem was that she had the physique of a human being, albeit a slight pooch in the stomach. \"Sorry...who are you?\" The blue girl said in a southern accent while holding her white head in her hands. \"Ah...can't...*smack* remember...squeezing....than...fog clearing...so...*smack*...hard to...think...\" While the plight of this girl was pitiful, Starlight saw it as a chance to help expose Violet and end all this. \"Listen to me very carefully.

She could already taste juice pooling from her mouth and felt her hope lower. She had seen many a strong-willed person fallen to this method...and it tastes soooo good she could see why. She could already see her face going some blue, but was already becoming numb from the delicious mix of cream and berries.</span></div></div>",

The effects were strong enough to attract berries, but luckily sane humans had the will to avoid their urges. \"Cyro Flask, if I may...\" A peon said as she eyed how Trixie's peanut butter side was receiving glands from AJ, \"...what is the point of this experiment?\" Cyro laughed, \"Don't worry my dears, soon it will all become clear....\"</span></div></div>",

Looking at the chair however, she found it to be more then some hostage hot seat. From what she could see, the arms were made of some sort of gold tinted with a blue hue. Rainbow could feel designs on the chair, odd circles and a few bolts. Now looking around where she was, it was clear she was in a throne room in what she assumed was a castle. She could see the where she was, but now  she needed to know the 'why.' The large doors at the end of the room opened up and three figures stepped in. One of them was a girl possibly her age wearing some sort of tribal wear that covered her just enough. The blue color on her was obviously painted on, but if one wasn't looking close enough it would seem real. The other two were woman whose possible age ranged into that of Principal Celestial or Vice Principal Luna. They also wore formal wear and had the painted blue color on them. Rainbow watched as they kept coming closer and was ready to give them such a verbal beat down. A short ways away from the throne however, the three figures actually kneeled in front of her. \"Oh great goddess, you grace us with your return to our people. Your greatness shall rain upon like the juice of your given fruit. What do you whish of your humble servants?\" After Rainbow freaked out about how uniform they said that, her mind went  working. \"Wait...they called me a goddess? I mean I know people understand my awesomeness but I don't know these people. It may be better to ask what's going on, although they did kidnap me. Plus, having a title of goddess sounds pretty cool.

Daring was being held captive by a tribe of people like you except they were large like that woman and wanted her to be a servant to some hidden....\" Rainbow stopped, remembering there was more to Darling's  storys then fiction. \"Your words are humorous but only serve as another sign your divinity is lost.

She was so transfixed  on the thought that she didn't even realize she was being cut loose. The women quickly left the room and the door closed shut behind them.

She yelled as she pounder on the door. \"Let me out of here!\" \"Sorry goddess, but we can't until you remember who you are.\" \"I'm not your....\" Rainbow stopped, having heard an odd sound coming from the center of the room. She saw a large open pit filled with hot coals right where the noise was coming from. She also soon saw a blue liquid dropping onto the coals, giving them a blue glow and producing a violet colored fog. Rainbow took notice of a strong scent of blueberries and enjoyed it for a second before she also became light headed. She had to get out of here somehow but with the only exit blocked by heavy iron, it seemed it wasn't an option. The blue liquid was pouring onto the coals even faster which made more and fog and smoke. Rainbow tried pouning on the door again, not realizing the excerise was making her breath in more and more of the odd smoke.

A swirl of blue mist danced about her, forming into a gargantuan woman of berry size and berry appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>\"It is I your Goddessness, your faithful Embassy. To what honor do I owe thee in seeing you here?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Seriously? Stop calling me a Goddess! I'm just a high-schooler with some cool Equestrian magic! There's nothing there that screams 'female deity.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>\"But it's true your Goddessness, you're just the person our people have been asking for for years!

P.S.: Next time time your little savages want to pull someone into thier weird little world, a written invitation would be more welcome then kidnapping in broad daylight!\" Silence dominated the scenery before the embassy sighed. \"I do hope you will forgive me....\" Rainbow was about to add some more verbal denial before she found herself suspended in mirair by an odd blue aura. \"The world of mortals has such an effect on all. I feared I didn't need to do this, but your return is vital to all dear godess.\" \"I AM NTughh.\" Rainbow's yell was suppressed by a handfull of berries being thrust into her mouth. The taste, their soft texture and the little bursts of juice seemed to calm Rainbow down, although she still struggled. \"Remember your duty to your people. You are a goddess, not a mere mortal. You must remember who you are.\" \"But I'm...gulp...\" Another batch of berries was put into her, with a more gentle touch this time though. \"I am...not...mmm...I....my people...gulp.\" \"Forget your mortal life, it means nothing to a goddess such as yourself.\" \"Gulp....mmmm...a goddess...yes....wait....gulp...my duty...memories...gulp.\" \"Don't stop eating dear, we can't stop until ulyou know who you are.\" As the bowl's never ending depths went into RD, she began to loose herself. \"Yes my embassy....gulp....feed me my chosen fruit...gulp...my people need their goddess....gulp.

Soon, her bottom and her 'front-most cushions' were joining her stomach in creating a rounded shape. Rainbow sighed in relaxation as she felt her godly body and power come to her. \"Mmmm..yes...my people will soon have the perfect goddess for them to bow to.\" As Rainbow's thought came out, she began to notice the rock she was on went farther and farther away. She wasn't just growing round, but also growing in general. She wasn't alarmed by this of course, a goddess needed to tower over her subjects and she was no exception. Covering up her Equestrian magic, the powers of the new Rainbow Dash began to take their hold over her. Her hair, still Rainbow as according to her prophecy, began to twirl and mold itself into a beautiful blueberry stem. Her hands soon began to sink into her body but to the disinterest. A blueberry didn't need hands let alone a goddess with the ability to create auras. All of the knowledge of her powers flodded her mind and  soon, Rainbow could tell she was in control of her full power. The finishing touches on the blueberry cake was the glowing light manifesting around Rainbow, the final symbol of her divinity. As she gulped down more and more juice, she realized her body had now reached the true nature of her purpose. All that mattered at the moment though was drinking the juice she had neglected to find for so long.</span></div></div>",

Only my goddess has the right to call me by name.\" Rainbow was slightly miffed, but was willing to forgive her embassy for an understandable mistake. \"Very well then...I shall have the honor of naming you then.....\" Rainbow went quiet before willing a giant blueberry into existence. The embassy's bowing continued until her head was under the berry. \"By the will of your goddess, you name shall serve as a reminder of how you have brought me to the light of my divinity.

It was not a mask to wear, rather a mask of caution. Caution of a tribe she thought was long forgotten. She had to investigate, she could only hope what she was witnessing was wrong.

Swelling up with juice of her own creation, Rainbow looked to the clothes she wore as her more difficult parts grew. \"Hmmm...I must urge my subjects to make their goddess a robe to wear instead of these...mortal rags...\" The thought echoed in her mind before her body lurched slightly. Rainbow begrudgingly closed her mouth to inspect the odd occurance. \"What is this....has my body ceased growing under the falls? But I feel nowhere close to the form of a true blueberry goddess! Embassy!\" In a swirl of mist, the larger blueberry woman lifted the her up again. \"Oh my...I feared this would happen....something in the world of mortals is holding back your transformation. Although you appear more of a goddess then you were before.\" Rainbow internally scowled but kept her regal composure. She could sense her ability to create juice for her subjects to drink of. She knew she would need to restore her true power, but this would have to do for now. Soon though....soon enough....\" The Blueberry holding her looked to the darkness and scrunched her face. \"It appears our people request an audience with you. It must be important if they choose to interrupt us.\" Rainbow, egear to help her dear subjects, nodded. \"Very well, hopefully you will have figured out how to restore my full divinity before I get back.\" \"First I must speak with them, they must not see you until you have reached your divinity.\" \"Then I await your return, return me to the falls so I may relax.\"</span></div></div>",

Well liked by her peers and even deemed loyal by many. A girl embued with magical friendship horse powers shared by her closest friends. With this, the Dash was capable of the impossible. Tonight however, she faced a threat that even her magical might could not stand up against. The ever present, unstoppable, limitless evil of....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BOREDOM!!\" Rainbow groaned as she flipped through the tv channels. \"Over 1004 channels and all of them are nothing but BOREDOM. Even the sports channels are just showing replays.\" Rainbow's thumb kept clicking the guide button, hoping that some late night movie was bound to start soon. For a moment, Rainbow glanced to the piles of finished homework stuffed into her bag and sighed before turning back to the screen. Again and again the channel number went up as Rainbow sank lower and lower into her seat and again and again she was uninterested in what layed before her. She wasn't even looking at the remote anymore, so she had no idea her thumb was sliding gently away from the intended target. In an instant, her thumb hit the number 3 along with the guide button. What came onto the screen next baffled Rainbow. The channel number specified read Channel 1.w3, which was odd enough but the real spectacle was on screen. The screen showed a oddly lit indoor stadium with few people lining the rather small bleachers. Inside a plastic dome area, Rainbow was amused to find large, ball-shaped beings rolling around and into each other. It was hard to see thier faces but they were definitely feminine and and many shades of blue to boot. Rainbow couldn't help but snort at the spectacle, especially the rather tight looking bodysuits the women were wearing. The camera panned onto one green suited woman being pushed by two red suited ones. With a shove, the green suited ball was pushed into a goal similar to a soccer goal. \"Goal! That two points more for the Juicy Scores and it looks like time is about up so....wait!\" The camera panned again to another green suited woman charging at another red suited...berry person?....set in front of a ramp. Within seconds, the person was sent flying into a ring a few feet above the goal. \"I don't believe it! That ten points was all the Raging Brightwells needed to pull back to the lead! And with that bell the clock has run out! It is Raging Brightwells 16 and Juicy Scores 12,  this has been an excellent game of Blueberry Derby which you can only find on channel 1.w3: The best in sports so unusual, the big wigs and snobs refuse to call them  sports. If you out there wish to get in on this action, go to the website listed on your screen. Goodnight from all of us here at the Apploosa Stadium and keep your ball rolling!\" As the screen faded to static, Rainbow sat on her seat in awe of what she had witnessed. Her mind quickly locked the website name (www.berryderbyrollers.com) into it's vaults. Hopefully there was no school tomorrow because she knew where she was spending her time. Whatever this sport was, Rainbow was about to find out all she could. Quickly turning to her phone, Rainbow checked tomorrow's date.</span></div></div>",

For now, she needed some sleep but when tomorrow came.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow looked to her laptop in interest. She had just pulled up the website from last night and was taken straight to a condensed rule guide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>Blueberry Derby is a sport where two groups of ten girls inflate to large blueberries and try to push members of the opposing team into a goal. Game can be set to time or point limit. Use of hands and feet is prohibited unless the rules of the specific tournament say different. At least six girls should be on the field at all times while the other wait on the sidelines to be tagged....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven condensed there was a lot to go over, size requirements for berries, field types, weather conditions, optional tools. Rainbow's curiosity drove her to look deeper into the website. There was an ordering service for official bodysuit for the nonsewing type, shades of juice that do and don't count as blueberry and the steps used to inspect, there was even an area for accessories and a link to a Buckstarter page for a Blueberry Derby video game. What really caught Rainbow's eyes however was a tab reading \"Age groups.\" Curious, Rainbow clicked it and was surprised to find a few different age groups....including one the enveloped more of the girls in her school! \"So...if we wanted to....hmmm....is there a trophy involved?\" Rainbow types her words in and found there was indeed a keepable trophy. In fact there were different levels ranging from city to world champion. That settled it in the athlete's mind, \"Get ready Blueberry Derby world. Cause Rainbow Dash is about to enter the scene! According to the website, there was actually a tournament in Canterlot happening in a few months and sign ups were already in effect. \"Alright, I'm sure my friends are gonna love this so they'll be in. We are gonna need more players though, but we'll think about that later. Right now, I need to get my friends on board.\" Grabbing her laptop, Rainbow rushed out to find the first of her friends and hopefully one who will have the others close by: Pinkie.</span></div></div>",

Nevertheless, she hopped the fence into Pinkie's yard with a second shaven from her previous record and promptly knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Just a minute!\" came the singsong voice from behind, The sound of trundling, bounding feet came before the door swung open, revealing one Pinkie Pie. \"Oh, hey Dash!

The look of all these cute berries is just so hilarious and if it's funny than I want in!\" Rainbow smiled at her friend's enthusiasm, but that smile wavered when she looked to the two onlookers. Rarity squirmed in her seat while Juniper merely sat there in thought. \"I do hate to disappoint you darling, but I don't think this 'sport' is for me. It seems a little too....how do I put this....too unusual.\" \"Oh come on Rarity, the past few years haven't exactly been normal for us anyways. Besides, need I remind you there are trophys for each of us! Plus, I did some extra background checking and this channel actually has more than enough viewers to constitute fame if we get this right!\" At the mention of the words 'trophy' and 'fame', Juniper's eyes lit up. \"Well, persoanlly I think I could look good as one of those blueberry derby players.\" \"That may work for you Juniper, but I don't think I could risk being humiliated in such a situation. I bet some of those girls feel so degraded.\" Rainbow sighed, feeling like Rarity wasn't going to change her mind about this. \"Alright then..how about this then: The rules do state that we can have uniforms sewn ourselves if we have the skill.\" Pinkie jumped in, threading her poofy locks through the holes in Rarity' s hair. \"You do have quite a knack for dress making Rarity.\" The teens white skin turned red as she turned around. \"Girls please. Alright, I suppose I can cobble some things together, just don't expect me to play in this ridiculous game.\" Pinkie began buzzing about the room, reaching for her phone on the estate nearby. It was clear she was planning on calling up the rest of the group to hear this opinion as she cheered Twilight's name. \"Twilight! Guess what! Rainbow can in and told us about this awesome new sport and me and Juniper are going along with it and.....what? Oh I'm on speaker? Hi Sunset! Did you hear about.....really?!\" \"What?\" Rarity asked, as she looked up from the suit requirements page on Dash's laptop. \"Sunset wouldn't say, but I think my senses are telling me it may involve blueberries somehow.\" No more than a second after Pinkie finished her sentence, the video phone on Rainbow's laptop rang. When Rarity awsneref, the screen showed a rather spooked looking SciTwi. \"Hi Twilight! What was so weird that you couldn't tell me over the phone?\" The glasses wearing girl seemed to be sweating as her mouth opened and closed as if failing to speak. After a few seconds, the girl grabbed the screen and pointed it to a round blue ball with a very familiar face. \"Hey girls. Guess Twilight and I still can't get our magic completely right huh?\" As Pinkie laughed at the situation, Rainbow grinned in satisfaction.</span></div></div>",

We need to make sure Sunset can pass inspection, and don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll email you the inspection guide.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing, Rainbow.\u201d Juniper answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four teens were ready to head out with things to do.  Rainbow Dash and Pinkie Pie would take the bus to try to recruit AJ and Fluttershy, and Juniper, with a copy of the blueberry inspection rules in tow, had headed out to see if the now blueberried Sunset.  Rarity rode her bike back to her home to get straight to work on the bodysuits.  Pinkie and Rainbow walked down to bus stop and just caught the bus making its stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the bus, Rainbow did some brief extra research back on the blueberry derby website for a short while and discovered in addition to the trophy, the tournament was also giving out title belts and spectacularly large cash prizes for the winners in addition to the trophies.  For Rainbow\u2019s Age bracket of course, the money would only be available in the form of a scholarship, unless there were some emergency expenses that needed to be paid off.  The was championship belts are what caught the athlete\u2019s attention far more than the money. The large belt was designed with plates of blue tinted platinum with gold and silver accents, decorated with blue gemstones such as Lapis Luzlis, aquamarines, diamonds, and a large blueberry shaped sapphire in the center.  Rainbow just pictured it being hanged on one of the walls in her bedroom, or maybe how it would look on her, both normally and blueberried.  Unfortunately, that feeling faded from her face after a minute when she realized getting her two friends to join was starting to look realistically impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething wrong, Rainbow?\u201d Pinkie asked noticing her friend\u2019s gloom with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m thinking this is going to be a tough sell.  Fluttershy is just not into sports and AJ can be conservative and stubborn. Recruitment really been hit and miss, and I really wanted all of us to be in this together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Rainbow Dash, they'll come around. Applejack has always been there for you, And Fluttershy is full of surprises sometimes, so you don\u2019t know what to expect.  I bet even Twilight and Rarity will open up and change their minds once they give it some more thought.\u201d Pinkie assured her friend, putting an encouraging hand on Rainbow Dash\u2019s shoulder.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour right! Thanks Pinkie\u201d Rainbow said as her confidence came back. The bus arrived at the duo's destination...</span></div></div>",

She looked left, up and down until looking right yielded the result of seeing the girl on her couch. Pinkie could make out the light from the TV, with Fluttershy staring intently at whatever seemed to be on. At this time, Rainbow was digging through her pockets with a concerned look as if trying to find something. \"Let's see here, I know I have that spare key in here somewhere. Just where...aha!\" Pulling a key from her front pocket, Rainbow turned the lock and consequently the handle. \"Hey Fluttershy!\" Pinkie exclaimed as she rushed into the house, \"Would you like to join a club were making!?\" Rainbow Dash half expected Fluttershy to have a heart attack the way Pinkie barged in without warning. The athlete was surprised to find that in actuality the girl hadn't moved an inch. In fact, it seemed as if Fluttershy had yet to realize they were even in the room. Her eyes just stayed glued to the television screen as her friends glanced around. Understandably worried for her friend, Pinkie poked the yellow teen in the head while Rainbow glanced to whatever Fluttershy was watching. Rainbow was surprised to see a review of the very Blueberry Derby game she had seen last night. A small squeaks of surprise told Rainbow that Fluttershy had been sucked back into reality. \"Oh! Girls, I didn't realize you were coming!\" \"We tried to call you Flutters but you weren't awsnering your phone so we came in.\" Rainbow turned to her friend and pointed to the tv with a quizzical glance, to which Fluttershy quickly flipped the channel. \"Umm, I don't know how that for there. I was just looking for....ummm....\" Fluttershy sighed as she realized there was no way she could lie out of this if she wanted to.  \"Alright...what you saw was a sport called Blueberry Derby and...I find it so....fasinating. Watching all those women filled with juice and rolling it just...oooo I love it. But I figured you guys would find it embarrassing so I didn't tell you. It just sucks you in it's so fasinating.\" Pinkie raised Fluttershy up while Dash smiled with the knowledge this was easier than expected.. \"\"Ya know Fluttershy, I've been enjoying Blueberry Derby as well. In fact, there's a tourney going on in town soon and I'm looking for recruits to join me in taking it on.\" Fluttershy's eyes went wide and a smile stuck to her face that got even wider. \"Yes. Yes! Rainbow, sign me up. If our friends are getting into the sport than believe me I am going to love this.\" \"Really?\" Pinkie asked, confused by the rather upbeat nature if her usually calm and shy friend. \"Are you sure you won't be bothered by the people staring and the bouncing into berries and things like that?\" \"Well of course I will be a little worried Pinkie, but I been wishing to have a chance to be a Derby berry and I am not going to pass this up!\" \"Perfect!\" Rainbow exclaimed as she hugged Fluttershy tightly. \"Come on girls, let's get to AJ and see what she thinks.\"</span></div></div>",

They found Applejack in the barn loading the family truck with crates and kegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Applejack\u2026?\u201d Rainbow asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh can't talk to y'all.  Ah\u2019m going to be very busy for next couple of days.\u201d Applejack told them, not making eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat going on  Where's everyone?\u201d Fluttershy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGranny and Big Mac are at the farmer's\u2019 market and ah just dropped Apple Bloom off at Scootaloo\u2019s.\u201d AJ answered, applying some rope to tie her cargo on to the truckbed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened here? Everything was was all bright and sunny when we were here last week.\u201d Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2019m sorry, but..\u201d Applejack turned to face her friends,  \u201cWe\u2019ve caught ourselves a bit of a debt problem \u2018ere at Sweet Apples.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDebt problem?\u201d Fluttershy asked, only for the farm girl to point to a notice taped to the farmhouse front door.  Rainbow Dash walked up and ripped the tape out and read the collection note out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPredat Lenders: Collection Notice!?  If loan is not repaid in the coming months, Property will be seized and residents will be evicted!?\u201d Dash read aloud with fear and concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Predat Lenders, Rainbow Dash heard that name from overhearing some gossip at school.  It was foreign money lending company that set up an office in Canterlot months ago.  One good look at them screamt trouble.  A few family farms who thought they were getting cheap and affordable loans found out that Predat Lenders blantly lied in their contracts,  8% interest turned out to be 40%, and Five years turned out to be five months. And when they couldn\u2019t be able to pay, they ended up having their lands taken and worse, their livelihoods razed and burned to the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Some of the more extreme rumors the tomboy heard was that the thugs were getting involved with some sort of demonic power. one rumor was these mobsters were going to be summoning carnivorous animal-like demons,  the other rumor was <b>they were</b> the demons themselves, and the loan company was merely a front.  While Dash had dismissed those last two rumors as ridiculous, she hadn\u2019t worried herself about them, because mainly the predatory lenders\u2019 threats always fell flat at school.  The principals Celestia and Luna have both stood up to them and got them to leave on multiple occasions, and the police were investigating them  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt all started when we noticed water on the ceiling. When mah brother took a look he discovered our whole second floor was startin to collapse The plumbin was burst, the joists were rotted, the beams were being eatin by termites, and the upstairs floors began started ta sink.  We needed some serious money to make repairs, but due the drought  an' pest problems that been going on, the harvest wasn\u2019t able to cover it.   Mah family tried to avoid those creeps but all the banks didn\u2019t wanna lend us the money.  Grr\u2026 Predat Lenders must of threatened them, that I know.  When we did get the loan, We were hit with a forty percent interest hike immediately and they want all that money upfront. Make matter worse, If even we sell the farm to those monsters, it still wouldn\u2019t enough to pay off the loan, and those dang gangsters said they\u2019ll turn the farm into a weapons factory. Just like what happened at that blueberry farm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three teens then remembered what they came to Applejack about .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that reminds me AJ and sorry if this comes off as bad timing but,\u201d Rainbow said, \u201cWe\u2019re forming a Blueberry Derby team!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlueberry what?\u201d a confused Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sport where women get into teams, inflate into large blueberries filled with juice and ram each other into goals.\u201d Fluttershy explained, excited and utterly unashamed in explaining her secret passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found out about Blueberry Derby last night. There\u2019s going to be a tournament for it for girls our age, and I plan on getting our friends together and winning it.\u201d  Rainbow announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInflate like what!?!\u2026\u201d Applejack taken a bit by the premise of the sport before regaining her composure, \u201cWow, yah wanna compete in anything don\u2019t ya sugarcube?  Even if ah loved to join yas,  Ah need to be watchin the farm, those predators could be seizing Sweet Apple Acres at any moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can use the farm for practice,\u201d Pinkie proposed, \u201cThe fields you got is perfect for a whole bunch of us soon-to-blueberry girls to bounce around and be on lookout with our big sizes..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh still don\u2019t see how rollin around like ripe fruit is going to get the Predat Lenders off mah family\u2019s back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could the Blueberry derby prize money to pay the loan back.\u201d  Rainbow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d AJ asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe money is usually in the form of a scholarship, but if you told them your family was in a debt emergency, I\u2019m they would happy to convert it into a check.\u201d Rainbow answered, showing the Blueberry derby website on her laptop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Alright, lemme take a good look at it before ah make mah decision.\u201d  Applejack said, taking the laptop from Rainbow Dash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack\u2019s rigorous study of the Blueberry Derby website made the three of them nervous. Her stetson was tilted down enough that neither Pinkie, Fluttershy, nor Rainbow could see her expression. Aj\u2019s mind was processing all she could about Blueberry Derby The money the Derby was offering was more than enough to pay the Predat Lenders off to the point they couldn\u2019t pull any sort of stunt, and there was enough money left over so the Apple family could finally get the farmhouse repaired.  The tournament was took place before the loan deadline by a good three weeks. The website looked legitimate and from the comments from the officials, athletes, and eccentric millionaires financing the whole thing, AJ concluded that they were honest people brought together by their passion in the obscure sport.   On the other hand, the farm girl had good reasons to be wary, It\u2019s was a sport Rainbow just heard of and yet they\u2019re all putting their passion into competing into it, especially Fluttershy, who ought to be called Flutter-shameless. In addition, there wasn\u2019t any guarantee they would win the tournament, they would be just rookies going up against more experienced teams.  Unfortunately the farm girl couldn't think of a better way to raise money for the debt payment that didn't involve price gouging some unnecessary zeros to the family crop, or the Apple family working 10 jobs per family member every week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right, if this Blueberry tourney money can fend off those loan sharks and save mah home, then ah\u2019m in.\u201d Applejack announced, with some reluctance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent! Welcome to the team AJ!!\u201d Pinkie exclaimed, hugging the newest member of Rainbow Dash\u2019s Blueberry Derby team while Fluttershy smiled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many team members have ya got? Ah'm little certain our circle doesn't meet full team.\" Applejack asked as Pinkie Pie let go of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, our team is at six right now and consists as now the four of us, Sunset, and Juniper.\" RD answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow took her phone out and texted Rarity and Juniper the good news. When she returned to the phone's main menu, she got a good look at the time and was surprised on how, \u201cOkay it\u2019s 10:20, we still have roughly an hour and a half before we have to head out to Rarity\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven Rarity\u2019s involved?\u201d  Applejack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see AJ.\u201d Dash answered her new recruit.  \u201cOkay team, we\u2019re ahead of schedule, so... any ideas what next?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After wadding up and/or trying a plethora of ideas that fell into her head, she had finally come up with the perfect suit design. \"Although normally I would try to add a little more flair to these designs, the girls will need a near seamless surface of they want to roll efficiently.\" Rarity mumbled to herself as she looked to the bodysuit sketch in front of her. The design was indeed simple, befitting more a gymnast than anything else. \"And of course, in line with the 'sport's' guidelines, the material shall be a rather hypoallergenic form of latex. Now what kind of colors shall these suits be?....\" As the white skinned teen glanced at the sketch, she tried to imagine on of her friends wearing the suit. Pinkie would really fit in anything and even if she didn't she would somehow make it work. Juniper wouldn't have too much trouble with many colors either.....but 'whatever worked' didn't cut it for Rarity. \"Oooohhh, if only the girls would tell me who else is joining....\" Rarity stood up with the intent of taking a deep breath to center her thoughts. In one second however, she froze in place. Her eyes had landed on a full body mirror and pose she was near exact to the sketch on her desk. \"Mmmm....I wonder......\" Rarity's mind began to look at her own self wearing the outfit. A nice fit that wasn't too tight but just enough that she could feel it with every step. Then she heard it in her head, the coos and ohs of people watching her head onto a field in such an outfit with admiration. Then she imagined the juice, filling her up and causing her to slowly expand. The latex squeaking as all of her limbs began to grow, and the feeling of the material against her belly. Pockets at the shoulders and legs for folding them in. Finally, the light shining off the team's suits in the picture of thier trophy, being hung in every sport store that would sell such apparel. \"Hmmmm....maybe I could be a blueberry if I wanted to....\" With that idea, Rarity's mind was made up and she reached for the phone to ring the girls up.</span></div></div>",

She attached the photo to simple text message and sent it to Rainbow Dash for approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow and company were being driven back into Canterlot since Applejack still had a delivery.  AJ herself was the driver while Flutters, RD, and Pinkie got in the back in order from left to right.  As they were a few blocks into reaching the farmer\u2019s market, Rainbow\u2019s phone pinged, she got it out and took a look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Rarity just sent me a photo of the suit.\u201d Rainbow Dash said, opening the image and showing it to Pinkie and Fluttershy..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drawing was in black and white, and used roughly sketch version of Rainbow herself as the model, both normal and blueberried. The suit was latex that covered the body, stopping short of the neck, wrists, and ankles. A series of stripes ran across the uniform, which Rainbow guessed had to resemble... well rainbows.  The suit also had a built-in elastic sports underwear for both comfort and support.  Rainbow knew Rarity made it with her mind, and she was itching for the color version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie\u2019s phone started to ring, and the caller ID said it was from Rarity, the party girl answered and quickly put the call on speaker, \u201cYell-O Rarity!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Pinkie, did Rainbow get my suit design?\u201d Rarity asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe sure did, though she\u2019s wishing for the color version.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m still trying to figure out the color pallette, we will want to look our best for when we take to the field after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash picked up on that, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018we\u2019?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember when I said I wouldn\u2019t take part in the that sport? Well, I gave it some more thought and I changed my mind.  If my outfit is going to be stylish and spectacular, than being a blueberry won\u2019t be so bad after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow, Pinkie, and Fluttershy\u2019s smiles went wide with excitement, while Applejack was just blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Pinkie said, \u201cI knew you\u2019d come around!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you darling. Have you and Rainbow recruited anyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have! Two of them in fact, right Dashie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash signaled Fluttershy and Applejack to lean their heads close together.  Thankfully the truck just arrived at their destination, AJ had put it park and turned off, and she and Fluttershy just got out.  Fluttershy beamed excitedly while Applejack\u2019s body language was that of reluctance and nervous.  When Rainbow snapped the photo with her phone, she immediately sent it to Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never expected Fluttershy to be the excited one,\u201d Rarity said surprised for a second,  \u201cAnyway, I\u2019ll get to work straight away. I\u2019m getting closer to figuring out the color palette. Oh have you thought up a name for the team dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI uh\u2026 no, I haven\u2019t gotten that far yet. I should start thinking about a team name.\u201d Rainbow answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoncha think you\u2019re going to be busy?\u201d Pinkie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have the house to myself currently,  I\u2019ll be able to get a prototype ready for you and get some h'orderves for lunch in no time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome, as for us we\u2019re going to help Applejack for a bit then we\u2019ll pick up Sunset and Junie. Ciao!\u201d Pinkie said hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pinkie and Rainbow got out of the truck, the girls had a gotten look at the farmer\u2019s market. At first looked normal with customers present being the same, with several female classmate from school being present, but it was looking emptier than normal because of the fact some of the rural farms were being run out of business by that crooked loan company. As Fluttershy, Pinkie, and Rainbow volunteered themselves and started emptying the truck of its fruity cargo and Applejack headed to the apple stand to tell Big Mac and Granny Smith the news, but she was nervous trying to figure how she was going to leave out the blueberry inflation part.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright?\u201d Granny Smith asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yeah\u2026 Uh, Ah just found out some good news.  Rainbow formin a team to take on an upcoming tournament called Blueberry Derby an....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s Blueberry Derby?\u201d Her brother asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026 uh... ain\u2019t important, but the money the tourney\u2019s offerin means we can pay off the loan and we can finally fix our home up good as new so we need some space to practice and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be some space because we going to swell into giant blueberries and practice rolling into each other.\u201c Rainbow revealing what Applejack was too ashamed to talk about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre yah tryin to kill me of embarrassment sugarcube?\u201d Applejack asked, covering half of her face with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack's relatives were suprised at the premise but it was clear and without words, they wouldn\u2019t judge her for participating. But what would be a heart\u2019s warming moment was soon interrupted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKe-yahahahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen that psychotic laughter filled the air, the farmer's market froze in terror. Rainbow, Pinkie, and Fluttershy (the latter hiding behind the former's back) looked around  At the front entrance, two of the Predat Lender\u2019s collection goons had arrived to \u201cserve\u201d the community another collection \u201creminder\u201d.  The girls got a good look at him and they weren\u2019t sure he were even human. The one on the right, the Apples learned his name was Hammer Head, seemed normal with tan skin and greyish suit that wouldn\u2019t look out of place in an old gangster movie. However he had eyes that just looked a little farther apart than most people\u2019s do, a skull ridge that look like it was pushed more forward than usual and was covered with a long monobrow, hands that were webbier than normal, but the most prominent feature was the scars that ran across the sides of his neck, they resembled gills and seemed to breathe like such. The other, allegedly named Heckles, was browned skin, white attire that was utterly stained with spots of dirt, and torn all over place. He had the bloodshot eyes of a pyscho, his back was very hunched over, and his stance was very feral looking, almost looking like he was on all fours. The sadistic maniac\u2019s smile seemed to have larger canine fangs than normal.  It was obvious that sinister laughter everyone heard had originated from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 Well...  well well well, I ain\u2019t hearing debts being paid.\" Heckles observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want any trouble fellers,\u201d Applejack said, trying to get some peace into the situation. \u201cWe\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately she was cut off when Hammer Head grabbed her by the shirt and lifted the farm girl off the ground, \u201cIf you wanted avoid to trouble, then you should started paying us back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t even.. fix our home because of your\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOtherwise, the liquidating process tends to eat its victims.\u201d  Hammer Head threatened, snarling his teeth and watering at the mouth, when he said that last part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeave them alone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHammer Head turned around to see who dared to oppose him.  It was Rainbow Dash with her arms crossed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, some little cutlet thinks she stand can up to us.  Ke-yehe.\u201d Heckles chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNobody threaten my friends!\u201d Rainbow said, standing her ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDash had gotten a good look into Heckles face\u2019s, and noticed his eyes had a violet-red glow to them, and that Hammer Head\u2019s eyes had that same glow as well.  Heckles also gotten a scent of Rainbow Dash and his snarl widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou waded in too deep, stay out this ya brat.\u201d Hammer Head threatened, \u201cOnly a fool can think they can pay a debt of their magnitude.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, once we win the Blueberry Derby Championship, we\u2019re going to be paying off your stupid loan!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two thugs never heard of Blueberry Derby so that made little sense, with Heckles bursting out into mad laughter. Clearly they weren\u2019t going to take her seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPutting your all your money into some made up sport.\u201d Heckles scoffed while his cohort let go AJ, \u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cConsider yourself lucky, trout.  We\u2019re under orders not to start any fights,\u201d Hammer Head then turned other farmers and produce sellers, leaving them with one final threat, growling out loud, \u201cAS FOR THE REST OF YOU, YOU\u2019VE BEEN ON BORROWED TIME LONG ENOUGH! YOUR PAYMENT DEADLINES ARE NEAR! PAY UP OR ELSE!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two Predat Lenders left, Hammer Head stomped a stray apple that had fallen out of the truck, crushing it into pulp as one final show of force.

Even without the demons summoning rumors, which were looking to be true after that encounter, these thugs were active criminals and there could possibly be more of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Blue Rainbows are going those thugs to take a hike.\u201d  Rainbow said, finally announcing her Blueberry Derby team\u2019s name.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look at the time showed was 11:15.  The team didn\u2019t have more time to stay here since they had places to be at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, It\u2019s getting time. Let\u2019s go pick up Juniper and Sunset.\u201d Dash announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe, Fluttershy, and Pinkie got back in the truck with Applejack telling her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be need the truck to pick up a few friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGranny and Big Macintosh just nodded, and they waved bye when the girls drove off to next destination.</span></div></div>",

The sporty girl knew about her friend's family being in debt, but certainly never about this sort of thing. And the fact it was her personal hero putting a team together for this Blueberry Derby thing certainly brought up Scoots' interest. \"Wow! And Big Mac said this could save the farm? Well then why would he keep it secret?!\" The orange girl reached for the phone before Applebloom stopped her. \"Hold it, Big Mac don't want the family being embarrassed over this.\" \"Relax, I'm only gonna tell the girls at school.

The girls were busy establishing a recreation of an official regulation Blueberry Derby playing field on a cleared-out parcel of farmland.  The field was best described as a large octagon.  The center was of the field flat and open with clear sight of the six large goal nets arranged in the manner of 3 on each half of the play field.  Halfway from the goals to center of the pitch were raised ramps to reach the upper goals. Past the goals, posts were staked down and connected with 6 ropes each, acting as the outer boundaries.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack and Sci Twi were making sure the last post was fastened properly. Pinkie was arranging a large amount of Blueberry edibles for guest on a large table with Juniper\u2019s help.  Rarity was putting the finishing touches on the outfits, with the first seven outfits completed, with customized lettering and symbols, and she would complete the remaining once the team members were announced. The fashionista was wearing her own uniform as were the other girls.  Rainbow Dash, Fluttershy, and Sunset Shimmer (who was back to her normal skin tone and body proportions) were busy hooking up Fluttershy\u2019s laptop to a projector, preparing it to show the website using the barn wall as a projector screen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe got company!\u201d Juniper said, seeing the female students of Canterlot High eager to join the Blueberry Derby team. Lyra and Bon Bon both biked to the audition. Trixie was wearing a jogging outfit that implied the magician ran all to the way here.  Derpy rode along with Vinyl Scratch who even managed to drag a reluctant Octavia into the tryouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks for coming everyone.\u201d  Rainbow said, \u201cI bet wondering, what is Blueberry Derby?  Well I just discover the sport two days ago and all I know is one: it\u2019s a sport involving girls become blueberries, and then ramming themselves into goals; two: they hold tournaments for it, and broadcast said tournaments; and three they have offer excellent trophies and large cash for each athlete!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFluttershy activated the projector.  The prospective athletes gasped and went wide-eyed at everything the website showed to offer any girl who would answer the call of spherical juice-filled spectacle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe have a recreation of the course set up that way,\u201d Rainbow continued leading the girls to the derby field. \u201cHere\u2019s how the tryout will work:  We\u2019ll be going over drills and practice with me and the rest of the Blue Rainbows.  I\u2019ll have several criteria I\u2019ll be judging you girls on several I think would be best for the team, and the ones who show the top marks in them will find herself a surefire position on the team roster.   Now we can only register 3 more girls, but don\u2019t get discouraged as we call always use some backup berries. Now get because the tryouts start NOW!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow had given her signal to SciTwi to cast the spell.  Twilight sighed and began charging her magic.  Once the blueberry spell was cast (and with the caster careful not to get caught), the girls soon noticed the blue on their skin and got excited (except Applejack and Octavia).  Soon in only a matter of minutes the blueberry derby arena was now filled with 13 large and round blueberry derby girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo your best everyone,\u201d Rainbow said, \u201cbecause the first test for the tryouts is going to be\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash did prepare for that occasion as the teen had spent last night studying up with Fluttershy and the others on how mobility as a blueberry would have worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt's Easy!\" the blueberry Rainbow Dash answered, \"All you have to do is find the center axis in your body and then just shift your body.

After her first lap, Rainbow Dash took a brief look at her blueberry teammates. Almost all of them were enjoying themselves, with Pinkie smiling and giggling when Juniper had bumped into the former\u2019s backside, Rarity admiring how her outfit looked on Sunset, Fluttershy was utterly euphoric being able to live out her fantasy, and Applejack at least she was going to see this sport the whole way through. Among the prospective berries, two girls stood out, Lyra and Derpy.  The two of them were the first to figure out rolling and had gotten a head start.  Derpy was klutzy as usual, but made up for it with an unpredictable mobility, and her bounces had a long stride to them.  Lyra was able to handle corners better and had better top spped then the cross eyed girl.  The two of them were heading to one of the ramps, so Rainbow decided to personally test them.  Rolling forward, the blueberry captain would try and cut them off.  Rainbow used her spine as a spring to launch herself directly into Derpy and Lyra\u2019s path.  At the speed Rainbow Dash was going, only one of the auditionees would be able get past her and the other would get launched into a goal.</span></div></div>",

As Pinkie started to lay the wire down, a taxi pulled up from the streets with three distinctive hairstyles silhouetted through the tinted windows. The pink teen quickly rushed inside and pulled the curtains shut, putting the living room in darkness. \"It's alright, I don't think they saw me. If we just don't move they might go away.\" Juniper sighed as she turned to the faces giving glanced her way. \"Look, I don't know what these girls actually did to you all but they certainly can't be the cause of any trouble now. Just give them a chance, please?\" All three faces stayed stone stiff at Juniper as the sound of knocking began. After a minute of silence, Rainbow sighed in defeat. \"Well....without thier gems I guess they can't do too much harm. But one wrong move and they are gone!\" Juniper nodded and walked to the door. \"Listen girls, I'm going to....get Applejack and Fluttershy's word on the matter. \"Rarity quickly left through the back door as the front opened up.</span></div></div>",

Looking up from the television,she took note of her sister in a state that didn't say anything about happiness. The teen sulked to the couch and plopped herself down, staring ahead with somewhat vacant eyes. Having lived with her long enough, Sweetie knew that only a particularly stressful day would dish out this sort of body language. Despite better judgment, Sweetie made an effort to get her sister's attention if only to find a way to calm her down. \"Umm....sis? Anything wrong?\" Rarity instantly burst into tears and cupped her hands into her face. \"Today was horrendous, simply awful in every sense of the word! First my own work betrays me in the form of my shoes becoming difficult to walk in and making me late!\" Rarity now got off the couch, pacing away with her dramatics enhancing with every word. \"Every class had pop quizzes which I was woefully unprepared for, my locker kept jamming, someone had made a degrading picture of me in art and passed it out and the worst part <b>THE VERY WORST PART!!.....\"</b> Rarity pointed to a small blemish on her shirt that was almost unnoticeable. \"My favorite shirt is mud-splattered!\" Rarity once more broke down crying, this time walking to the freezer. \"This day has been the worst I can ever recall and it isn't even over yet!!\" Her hands fumbled around in the cold storage until they reached a section marked \"Drama Foods\". \"No....not grape.....no..no....oh...you'll all do...\" The tears now close to staining the makeup on her face, a crying Rarity marched up the stairs with multiple tubs of ice cream in her arms and a scoop balanced on them. \"I need to be alone!!!!\" Those words were all Sweetie Belle heard before hearing the door slam. \"A simple yes would have been fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh....my best friends, how I've missed you both so.\" Rarity whined as she uncovered her ornate fainting couch and opened up the first container of the frozen blueberry dairy product. Taking a big scoop and flinging it straight into her mouth, a shiver ran down the teen's body. The delicious taste of blueberries and the always welcome comfort of her fainting couch, this was a combo that Rarity was quite pleased with. Placing another scoop into her mouth, the poor girl was unaware of just what was in store for her.</span></div></div>",

I guess this spoils my diet for the week. Still,\" she patted her full tummy, hearing a very subtle sloshing sound, \"I suppose it was well worth it.\" Rising from her place upon th ecouch, she gathered up each container and placed one inside the other until all were in one neat stack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"And now, to the rubbish with you all,\" she chimed, unsealing herself from her space and traversing down the stairs. Upon entering the kitchen, she promptly placed the rubbish in her possession into the can. \"Oh dear, it's getting later then I thought...no matter, I'll just get to working on something and all will be well!\" she grinned warmly to herself as she made her way back to the hall and back up the staircase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Hi Rarity, glad to see you've finished your episode,\" Sweetie elle said as she passed her sister, pausing idstep as her face grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, you know how much a good helping of ice cream helps my nerves. Something wrong? I've got something on my face, don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I think so, give your nose a wipe,\" Sweetie said as she flicked her own nose with her thumb in demonstration. Rarity obliged, and Sweetie's grimace remained. \"I think you've smudged it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But my thumb is clean, how could I have smeared it?\" Rarity questioned as she ran her fingers over her nose. </span></div></div>",

Turning the sink knobs to a medium lukewarm and squirted a small splash of soap onto her hands. Lathering them up, Rarity began to scrub away at her face. Sure the problem was on the nose but why not clean the rest of the face in the meantime? As she kept her eyes tight and scrubbed away, Rarity began to him away at some tune that had been lodged into her head. After a few minutes of her musical melody, she began to splash water onto her face. \"Now..let us see that beautiful face that I knoooooo!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity's eyes opened wide as she looked upon her reflection.

On one hand, she did feel a little faith in her student's sanity fall if such a change in skin color would bring about such attention from her peers. But the fashionista couldn't care less, enjoying the gaping sight of students as they stared at her form. Of course her full body recolor wasn't the only thing that was new about Rarity, the seamstress having slaved over last night to create a new dress to accentuate her body. With two leaf clips in her hair, she had on a sparkling dress of various blues and violets, seams against her sides and a cut along the stomach area to make some room for her slightly larger stomach. As Rarity walked into the circled center of the school, she was aware of a few people following her from a ways off along with all the new eyes glancing to her. Without even bothering to think, she struck a pose for the crowd with the oohs and ahhs saying all she needed to hear. Through the hushed whispers of the crowd, she could hear Photo Finish's camera snapping pictures. \"You are impressed are you not? It's alright to look, I want to show this. Just don't miss your classes for little old me.\" From within the crowd, Rarity could hear Trixie's voice call out, \"Is this some sort of magic trick Rarity? Trixie thinks you are merely bamboozling us.\" \"Trixie my dear, I am certain that this is all natural. Or are you just being jealous of all my attention?\" \"How did you do this to yourself?\" \"Oh Bon Bon, you can't just expect a lady to divulge her beauty secrets. Besides, I don't have the time, my classes begin in a few minutes so I really should be going and I suggest you all do the same.

Thankfully, there hadn't been many problems that required thier assistance, but one person in trouble was too much in the eyes of the group. Sometimes they didn't even need to be called forward, they just found the trouble themselves. Such was the reason they girls found themselves on the grounds of an abandoned Manor a ways out if town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity shook her shoes, ripping the caught grass away. \"Pinkie.\" She grimaced, \"Are you sure you saw something fly this direction?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive\" Pinkie Pie stood right up against a worn out tree while Applejack knocked on it. The resulting crash to the ground suprising no one. \"I was standing on the roof when I saw something big and bright fly through the air. It didn't have wings though. And Twilight figured from all her math stuff that it would have to have landed somewhere here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manor overlooking the yard the seven walked across had clearly been in need of repair for quite awhile. Much of it's paint was falling off and it's roof was a checkerboard of shingle and shinglelsss patches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know why anyone in thier right minds would come to this miserable place.\" Rarity said. \"And looks as if no one has for quite awhile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even still...\" Sunset said as she held the cowering Fluttershy close, \"...if there's even a chance that something magical came here then we have to find it before someone else does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know darling. But we haven't found anything yet.\" Rarity wanted to lean against something to show how tired she was getting, but she wasn't going to soil her exploring clothes on those raggedy trees, no mam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight shook her magic detecting device and sighed. \"I hate to say it girls, but Rarity is right. And I can't get this darn device of mine to work right. Some kind of interference. We're gonna have to do this the old fashioned way. Split up. Anyone finds anything, they report back with thier geodes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the girls liked the sound of it, but at that moment it looked like thier only option. Each girl was given a partner, except for Rarity who stated herself no one would want to put up with her displeasure of the area. As such, Sunset and Pinkie walked towards the house itself, Applejack and Rainbow entered between two rose bushes while Twilight and Fluttershy walked towards a grove of trees. Rarity, being alone, walked off towards two tall walls of topiary. Which oddly enough were the most pristine areas of this worn down place. Little were any of the girls aware that each of them, while heading a different direction, were all heading to the same place: a hedge maze. As each girl went thier ways, walls of greenery silently rose up from the ground, blocking each group from one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware of this, Rarity continued on her way. For minutes, she walked left and right and all around, trying to keep a mental note of each direction she was going. But all the while, something was continually fighting for her attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my these hedge appear to have been expertly kept. No overlaying branches, hardly a leaf out of place, it's impossible to find much wrong in this place.

As she gripped her backpack straps, her sweater rustled about. After a long day at school and helping her friends out with whatever they needed it with, Fluttershy was more than prepared to head home and take a nice little nap. As she passed by an alleyway however, she heard a small whimpering sound. Fluttershy's mind nature immediately lead her to follow the whining to it source. A source which seemed to be a pile of trash. As she picked up the garbage, her mind raced in fear over just how badly the animal in question. Which was why she was somewhat relieved to find it was only a recorder and a piece of paper which read \"Behind you.\" Fluttershy gave a sigh of relief at the thought of no harmed animals. A sigh that became a scream as she felt two hands grab her and drag her down into what appeared to be a portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooofff\" Fluttershy grunted as she hit the floor when the hands let her go. Fluttershy looked about, gathering her bearings on the situation. It appeared she was now in the castle ruins a ways out of town. \"Quite beautiful aren't they?\" A horribly familiar voice said, \"I'm planning on redecorating when phase one is done.\" Fluttershy looked to the sky and found the culprit soaring above one of the broken ramparts. \"Midnight Sparkle! But...I thought Sunset had...\" Midnight let out a huge laugh as she fluttered to her captive. \"You honestly thought what little she did was enough? No my dear, it takes a lot more than that if someone wants to destroy me. For now however, that is not your biggest problem....\" Midnight's hands filled with a dark blue energy.</span></div></div>",

Midnight began to float down with a dark smirk to her face. \"Don't worry my little berry-to-be, soon it will all become clear. Fluttershy glanced to the demon with a questioning glance before feeling her hands tingle. Taking a look to them, Fluttershy was slightly horrified to find they were turning a blueish purple and plumping up. \"What....how....\" Fluttershy was in shock, unable to move as the dark color began to move down her arms and to her torso.

Then again, walking around the forest close to the park always did calm her down whenever she was stressed. Taking a break from humming to breath he turned her head slightly to take in some of the flowers on on side of the path. As she did so however, a soft rustling came from the bushes behind her. Upon hearing said rustle, Fluttershy jumped slightly in fear and ran to the other side of the path. After a few seconds, the rustle came again followed by a tiny squeak. \"Oh my...\" Fluttershy said as she took a nervous step forward, \"... are you alright?\" Another frightened squeak sounded, leading Fluttershy to believe that a small animal like a mouse or squirrel was stuck in the bush. This was quite common in the park, many of these bushes weren't kept nicely enough and animals often got tangled in the branches. Gathering up her courage, Fluttershy stepped towards the foliage. She slowly reached through the leaves, eager to help the little animal. When she reached the rustling though, Fluttershy was quite suprised at what she found. In her hands, she was beholding to what appeared to be a smaller version of her. The differences being her skin color was blue and covered by a blue tinker belle style outfit. What was really a difference though was the fact that the small being seemed quite...bloated. Looking up, the small Fluttershy squeaked again in fear and unfolded two wings from it's back. It quickly took off, with the real Fluttershy close behind. \"Hey! I need to see if your hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase kept up until the small fairy figure dropped down into a small cave hidden beside a few berry bushes. \"Hello?\" Fluttershy called into the cave on her hands and knees. The echo sounded before dying, leaving Fluttershy to believe the little thing was just shy like her. \"It's okay...\" She called out as she made her way into the cave, \"I don't want to hurt you. I want to helllllllAHHHHHHHHHH!\" Fluttershy hadn't gone through the cave for more then a few feet before the floor disappeared entirely. She found herself falling down a hole.</span></div></div>",

As she did, she could barely make out a light at the far end.  Taking a deep breath, Fluttershy ran in. The darkness became so thick that she could barely see where she was going. She wouldn't be looking anyways as she did her best to focus only on the light at the end. Many fears of tripping and falling or even stepping on an innocent creature flew through her head, but she kept running. The light kept getting closer and closer until she could see herself again.

It wasn't all the same shade of course, there were so many shades and mixtures that everything was distinguishable from itself. A very light scent of blueberries wafted through the air, understandable as the place was littered with blueberries and blueberry bushes. Fluttershy looked back to the cave and knew she wouldn't be able to get home that way. With the forest do inviting, there had to be someone in there who would be willing to help her. Maybe she'd find that little fairy and figure out what she was so scared about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fluttershy walked through the forest, hands in her pockets, she began to feel a strange sense of self conscience. Everything else was some shade of blue or another while she was almost any color but blue. As she came to a fork in the road, she put that thought away and looked over her choices. One path had a sign that probably meant civilization while the other path had thick blue cobwebs. Her choice was near obvious but before she walked, a familiar squeak came from the darker path. It sounded much like the fairy, but this sounded more desperate and worried. Fluttershy gulped at her options, maybe the fairy brought her here in someway but she couldn't help thinking she was really in trouble.</span></div></div>",

She kept thinking this as she walked down the road, noticing already a difference in the  neatness of the violet-grey gravel. \"Well...whoever did this might be able to help me...\" Fluttershy sniffled with the guilt fresh in her mind.

The smell of freshly baked blueberry muffins and pies hung around the air and the 'sky' above seemed bright and cheerful without a real sun to speak of.

But, what really got her attention was how large she was. She was easily bigger than people here and even most of the village. Fluttershy couldn't even see her head or limbs due to her sheer size. Then Fluttershy saw four of those little blue fairies appear from behind the large berry including the one that looked like her (which was a huge burden off her chest and she thought what she heard earlier was just that dark path playing tricks with her mind) and began to roll the large berry person forward so that she was at Fluttershy's eye level. Fluttershy then noticed that the other citizens stopped what they were doing and immediately bowed their heads in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you poor thing look at you so small, skinny and discolored.\u201d The woman said in a worried tone. \u201cThis will not do, this will not do at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closer observation Fluttershy noticed that the person\u2019s face was very similar to Principal Celestia minus the skin color but her voice, personality and mannerisms were closer to that of her friend Rarity. Just then Fluttershy heard finger snapping and four more fairies appeared before the giant berry woman and then woman started to talk to the fairies in a language she couldn't understand. Then she was done talking, the four fairies who just arrived circled around Fluttershy and proceeded to lift her up and carry her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For such small creatures they sure have a lot strength.\" Fluttershy thought to herself. \u201cUm, excuse me miss-.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh where are my manners, I forgot to introduce myself.\u201d The woman said in realization. \u201cI am the ruler of this land, Queen Blissful Blue or Queen B for short.\u201d \u201cSo what is your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Fluttershy.\u201d She replied. \u201c So um, what are your little friends doing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I told them to take you with me so I can treat your ailment.\u201d Queen B stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I don't feel sick.\u201d Fluttershy said, confused by what the queen told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you do sweetie.\u201d Queen B replied while giving a royal chuckle. \u201cBut fear not, for I know just how to treat it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the first four fairies began to roll Queen B out of the village with the other four that were carrying Fluttershy following close behind.

Then the fairies rolled Fluttershy into an upright position and looked at the vanity mirror and saw that she was enormous. Fluttershy was almost as big as Queen B being about two-thirds her size and felt like she could barely do anything on her own anymore.

The faires around the large Queen giggled and cheered about, as if the Queen had performed some mighty deed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Fluttershy/Flutterberry twitched about, feeling and hearing the juice inside her sloshing about. It just felt so strange and unnatural, barely able to even move her head. Her blue body began rocking back and forth, constantly reminding Fluttershy of her new ball shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing dictating the documents, Queen B was turned back around to her new daughter. \"Well Flutterberry, once those documents are recorded in the royal family archives and presented to the berry folk, you will officially be my sweet little princess.\" Fluttershy attempted to speak out, once again trying to catch the Queen's attention with the truth, but the Queen's faries shushed her with the queen following suit. \"Oh dearie, I know this must be exciting for you. Being adopted by your healer and all, but we have much to do now. I mean we must fit you into some clothes better suited to your status. And then there is having our royal portrait painted after all is made official. And no doubt a cornation service is in order so that the people know in no uncertain terms that you are my daughter.\" Turning the Fluttershy and watching her wiggle, she gasped. \"Of course! You'll need a royal fairy or two by your side as well. Us rulers have better things to use our bodies for than making us roll of course. And I can just imagine....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Queen B continued her rambling, Fluttershy was at a loss. She had no idea what to do or think anymore. This woman clearly wasn't listening to her and the fairies she wanted to help were only making things worse.

She probably figured that they were getting the castle ready for her coronation. After a few minutes of being rolled, Fluttershy saw some of the royal fairies opening a door and then was rolled into the room along with Queen B. Fluttershy noticed that the room was filled with rolls of different fabrics which reminded her of Rarity\u2019s boutique. Then in the middle of the room there was a woman who was slightly bigger than the average citizen and was wearing a customized maid outfit who had a royal fairy of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings your highness.\u201d The woman said as her fairy rolled her into a bowing position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Azure how are things at home?\u201d Queen B asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wonderful.\u201d Azure replied while noticing Fluttershy. \u201cI take it that this is your new daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy, my word does travel fast around the castle.\u201d Queen B said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you know that the fairies love their gossip.\u201d Azure replied before turning her attention to Fluttershy. \u201cGreetings Berryshy I am Azure the castle\u2019s royal seamstress.\u201d \u201cAll the outfits ranging from castle staff to her royal highness Queen B were made by yours truly with help from my fairy assistant.\u201d \u201cNow how can I be of service to you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy daughter needs a line of outfits befitting her new royal status.\u201d Queen B stated proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny particular style you had in mind your highness?\u201d Azure asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRound and regal, just as a royal blueberry should look like.\u201d Queen B replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Azure bowed once again before the fairies started to roll her and Fluttershy to the back end of the room while Queen B waited. Two of the fairies pulled down a thick curtain for privacy and for focusing on the task at hand. While Azure was gathering fabrics for the dresses alongside the fairies, she noticed that Fluttershy looked like she had a lot on her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there something wrong, princess?\u201d Azure asked while examining one of the pulled out fabrics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*sigh* I\u2019ve been trying to speak to the Queen all afternoon, but most of the time she keeps interrupting me.\u201d Fluttershy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHer highness can get like that sometimes.\u201d Azure replied. \u201cOnce she gets an idea going through her mind she almost never listens to anyone else, but she does everyone\u2019s best interests at heart.\u201d \u201cYou will get the chance to say what is on your mind soon enough princess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cI sure hope so.\u201d Fluttershy sighed. \u201cSo what do you think I\u2019ll be doing next Azure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I had to guess Berryshy.\u201d Azure pondered.  \u201cI would say that her highness would\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

In a matter of minutes Fluttershy noticed that she stopped rolling and saw that she was at the corner of dead end hallway on the ground floor of the castle. Then she noticed one of the fairies pressing a stone brick that was sticking out of the wall which caused the floor beneath them to shake slightly. The floor began to sink into sink into the ground as Fluttershy saw that the surrounding area was tunneled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's all right Berryshy.\u201d Queen B said in a motherly tone. \u201cThis magical stone elevator leads to the secret fairy grotto which is located underneath the castle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator soon arrived at its destination and the fairies resumed rolling the two royal blueberries to wherever they were going. Within a minute the rolling stopped and Fluttershy saw an impressive grotto which featured a small garden, a little spring and there was a medium sized hole on top of the cavern ceiling that had light coming out which lead all the way up to the surface. Fluttershy also saw a large number of fairies flying all over the cavern and some of them look rather familiar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my it's evening already.\u201d Queen said as she looked at the ceiling hole. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to do the portrait and the rest of the coronation prep tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a fairy appeared from out the spring and she was about the size of Fluttershy before turning into a blueberry. What\u2019s more is that Fluttershy was actually able to understand what the fairies were saying compared to last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreetings Queen Blissful Blue.\u201d The large fairy said as she bowed in respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Serena, I\u2019m here to pick out some royal fairies for my new, precious daughter.\u201d Queen B said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this your new daughter that the other fairies have told me about.\u201d Serena said as she examined Fluttershy. \u201cWell she certainly has the potential to become even bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm..what are doing?\u201d Fluttershy asked curiously, unable to move her head to due round body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, forgive me Berryshy for not introducing myself properly.\u201d Serena said in realization. \u201cI am Serena leader of the fairies.\u201d \u201cOur people have been supporting the royal berry family for countless generations to help the kingdom prosper.\u201d \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated previously, not only do you have the potential to become bigger but you also have the potential to help continue the kingdom\u2019s prosperity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh..thank you?\u201d Fluttershy stated, unsure whether to take Serena\u2019s statement as a compliment or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour welcome princess.\u201d Serena replied. \u201cNow let\u2019s see how many fairies will come to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Serena rolled Fluttershy to the center of grotto where the light from the ceiling was and then Serena went back to where Queen B stood.

The trees were seeming larger and larger as she walked down the path and the scared squeaking got louder and louder. Despite the darkness and her fear, Fluttershy attempted to brave on with hopeful thoughts bouncing in her head. \"Maybe she didn't mean to bring me here. I probably scared the poor thing and it just wanted to get away......ohhh....I do hope the poor little fairy thing isn't in too much trouble. Who knows, it might help me out of here if I help it.\" As Fluttershy walked along the path, she noticed the webs becoming thicker and thicker as the voice grew. Fluttershy gulped again, fearful of just what all of this was leading up to. Sure enough, Fluttershy entered a small clearing and her eyes fell upon her blueberry fairy lookalike. This poor thing was caught in a spider's web that hung over several berry bushes that were healthy yet larger than any berry bush should.

With the safety of the fairy in mind though, Fluttershy managed to work through her worry and continued ripping the web. \"I do hope whatever made this web won't be too upset.\" The girl thought to herself as she pulled the last few connecting strands off her miniscule doppleganger. The fairy shook itself off as it entered flight. Instead of fleeing, it flew right up to Fluttershy's face. \"Thank you...thank you so much. But it is unfortunate you have come to this land.\" Fluttershy nodded. \"I know I shouldn't have follewed you. But I thought you were hurt and...\" \"No, I mean....just follow me home.\" The fairy sped off, leaving a trail of bright violet dust for Fluttershy to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light of the sun flashed once again in Fluttershy's face, though undoubtibly it was a false light meant to seem like the one above ground. \"The poor girl has no idea what she is in for if she stays.\" Hearing the high-pitched voice of the fairy, Fluttershy looked to a gathering by a small pond. The fairy, (which Fluttershy thought of naming Flutterberry) was surrounded by other fairies with resemblance to some other people she knew. She could pick out Rainbow Dash's face and another one looked like Celestia and a few shared resemblance to the Dazzlings. All of them were blue and round like Flutterberry anyways. The Rainbow Dash fairy saw Fluttershy come closer and motioned the others to her presence.</span></div></div>",

In the very tips of her fingers, she could see sploches of blue forming. \"The process is already forming. Don't worry, it's quite slow and won't get severe unless something else affects it.

Follow me!\" As Fluttershy and Flutterberry ran off, the Celestial berry sighed. \"Such a shame, she would have made a cute berry to play with. I know we were all thinking it.\" The group nodded except for Rainberry who agreedwd with Flutterberry. With a smirk, the doppleganger of the above world principal looked to the path the two went on. \"Hmmm...I think their going to pass some beings that might just agree....\"</span></div></div>",

She was expecting to be standing on a rocky outcropping or maybe some sort of underground grotto. What she saw however was flora and fauna similar to what one would find in a swamp. Part of the surprise came from the fact that she had lived in Canter lot for a long time and never had she heard of any nearby swamps. Then again, she also never heard of magic portals, pony princesses or blueberry-bodied fairys that bear a striking similarities to herself and they all turned out real. Taking a closer look around, Fluttershy took notice of the odd substance surrounding the many little isles of ground. It seemed to be an odd thick substance with a deep blue coloration. What made this stuff even worse looking was that there seemed to be no way to cross over it. Fluttershy looked to the trees, hoping to find some animals that might help her, but instead found only blueberries. \"Great, now how will I find that fai....wait...blueberries don't grow on trees!\"<br>\r\n\"They do in BlueberryLand.\"<br>\r\nFluttershy jumped at the sudden yet sleepy sounding voice. \"Who said that?\" After a loud yawn, the voice said in a more direct voice, \"Over here.\" Fluttershy looked in the voice's direction and saw.</span></div></div>",

She would have done this earlier but what stood before her was good enough reason to do a full reality check. Standing in the blue muck was a woman with a stomach size only slightly less round then the fairy was. That wasn't what really caught Fluttershy's attention though, it was that the woman seemed to be covered in...no...MADE OF the very muck she was standing in. \"Hello young one...\" The being lazily waved over before taking in another yawn, \"...welcome to BlueberryLand.\" Throughout the current events of today, Fluttershy had tried to keep a relatively level head. With what that was happening now though, all Fluttershy could do was slightly stutter. \"B...blue...BlueberryLand?\" The woman nodded and  began to lay down. As she did, Flutter shy began to see that she was not alone. There were multiple females just like this one, all either sleeping or curiously looking  to the girl. \"This is a...*yawn* magical place of blueberries, they can go anywhere and can be anywhere...even you.\" Fluttershy's curiosity peaked as this being now fell asleep. \"What...what do you mean?\" \"Few ever come to BlueberryLand, but in time everyone became a blueberry. The land can do things that...make you change.\" \"There is no point in resisting....\" The first one said \"...no one can you will become a blueberry girl before long. Fluttershy involuntarily yawned, the tired vibe these women were giving off becoming contagious. Something was just making her want to sleep, and for some reason the muck was looking like the perfect bed. \"You look so tired...\" the first woman continued with a gleam in her eyes, \"...let us take care of you.\" Fluttershy's eyes began to close as she took a step toward the ground's edge. A few other girls joined the first, outstrechinf their arms to catch their new prey.</span></div></div>",

The others took hold of whatever their hands could grasp hold of, their bodies seeping into the fabric and skin of their prey. With wicked grins, they finished lulling Fluttershy's mind to sleep before placing her neck deep into the blueberry muck below them. They swirled about the body, encasing her in reeds and slime and all things of the marshlands around them. Their sluggish voices chanted, echoing softly to her ears in a language still unknown to her. A rich nd soft bubbling began to stir beneath Fluttershy, but she had not a care in the world as she dreamed sweet pleasantries without a care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Each of the murky ladies of the marsh laid a kiss upon her lips, leaving a little trace of each of them within her.

On the outside, the work was becoming quite clear. Fluttershy's skin began to change color, first to a light green and then into a vapid blue that made her almost camouflage with the blue muck she slept in. Her body was taking on another change as her stomach slowly began to blow up. If Fluttershy was awake, she would easily understand what was happening. Those odd women had begun her transformation into a blueberrygirl! Just like they said she would become! Then again, she wasn't awake so she couldn't see what was happening. At the rate she was growing, it wouldn't take long before her size and color matched those of her captors. That wasn't the end of it though. Fluttershy's hair began to get an odd sheen in the light. After a few moments, this sheen became full and a few drops of the new muck hairstyle began to drip down. The girl's entire body began to follow suit, going from becoming just a blueberry girl to a blueberryMUCKgirl.</span></div></div>",

At first, her arms seemed to refuse to leave the saftey of the strangely comfortable muck. After a few tugs though, Fluttershy managed to pull them out. When she did however, it was obvious there was something wrong. Both her arms were now a rich shade of blue almost identical to that of those muck women. Taking a closer look at her arms, it seemed that wasn't the only thing similar to them. Poking her arm, Fluttershy took notice of how sticky it seemed, almost as if.... \"No, it couldn't be...\" Fluttershy drowsily said, her sleepyness still evident even after her nap. \"...how could they have....*yawn* ...wait what did they say?\" <br>\r\n<i>You will become a blueberry girl before long. You can't resist it.</i> \"Ah, your awake!\"<br>\r\nFluttershy did a quick double-take, that one sounded oddly close. Looking in the direction she thought it came from, her eyes beheld one of the women, eyes half closed but with a smile. \"Did you...*yawn* do something to me?\" The mucky bodied being got down if only to be eye level with her. \"We said we would take care of you and we are. We have given you a home and soon a new body.\" A sticky yet smooth hand caressed Fluttershy's cheek as the muck lady whispered. \"We all know you'll love it.\"</span></div></div>",

Without another second wasted, Fluttershy's lips now eagerly awaited each kiss that was laid upon them. Even as Fluttershy's stomach kept expanding, she used her hands to hug what little she could of those around them. Kiss after kiss and hug after hug it all happened until Fluttershy felt it, the last of her humanity fading away. All of it being replaced by the body of a blue muck woman.

With the concerned tone of their voices however, it wasn't hard to think what they might have been discussing. Despite trying to focus on the rock, Rainbow was also having her own worry session. Fluttershy had been lost for days and the thoughts of what was going on made her stomach churn. A million thoughts ran around her head and the inclusion of this hole in the mystery only made it worse. Maybe she was lost in a cave-in or maybe she was too scared to want to move. She could be hungry, tired, confused, hurt, anything could be happening to her down there. \"Fluttershy!\" Rainbow called out with worry in her voice, \"Fluttershy!! Can you hear me?! If you can, please tell me you're alright! P..please?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it Pinkie, yer bein as jumpy as a fruit bat in a pest control center!

I want to save Fluttershy from whatever is going on but we won't if we get*DOOFF*\" Rainbow's sentence was cut off by a falling body knocking her out of place. Before Rainbow could even react, she had lost her grip and was falling down like the others on top of her. All five girls were now falling down the shaft screaming and unable to grip the rope well enough and unable to reset the belays due to disorienting velocity. Rainbow closed her eyes, waiting for the moment of unbearable and possibly fatal pain of come. It never did though, at first she thought it was because they kept falling but no, they had stopped. Opening her eyes, Rainbow saw that they had landed on some kind blueberry bush. Rainbow didn't know what kind as she had never seen blueberries with such a slimy complexion. \"So*huff*help me *huff* Pinkie....\" Applejack said, \"...Ah ain't*huff* gonna let yah*huff* near any cliffs anytime soon.\" The girls all recollected themselves, looking around at what they assumed was the bottom of the hole. \"Hey, girls....\" Twilight said pointing to a path through the cave. \"Looks like we might be close to Fluttershy after all!\" The girls began walking, hoping that Twilight was right and that everything was gonna be fine.</span></div></div>",

We don't *yawn* know anyone by such a name. Names are *yawn* irrelevant among muckberries.\" \"Fluttershy, quit fooling around and get out of that dreadful ooze. I'd assume your clothes must be soaked to almost unusability by now and I know how nervous you get.\" \"You must have me mistaken with some*yawn*one else. I don't know any of you, nor any life*yawn* outside the marshes we muckberries call home.\" Rainbow, the thought their friend was playing such a joke now annoying her, stepped forward. \"Come on Fluttershy, enough of that 'muckberry' stuff and get over here. We've been worried sick about you for days. The lead muckberry moved her way in front of 'Fluttermuck' and gave an understanding smile. \"Like our dear one said, we know not of *yawn* any Fluttershy. Names have*yawn* no meaning here, however if you all prefer, you can call this one *yawn* Fluttermuck. She must remind you all of someone important to you if you believe she *yawn* is that being.\" \"Well if you..'muckberries' must know, our dearest and closest friend Fluttershy went missing a few days ago. The poor dear is most likely scared stiff by now and we have to find her. We believe that she came through a hole above and is here somewhere and that being bears too much of a resemblance to be a coincidence.\" Throughout Rarity's explanation, Twilight's body began to sense a familiar magic coming from this odd blue muck and the so-called muckberries. It felt so much like the friendship magic her fiends shared but.....something was wrong....it felt different. Noticing Twilight's tensity, Fluttermuck said. \"You all must have had an exhausting journey*yawn* here. You can stay and relax with us if you all want to.\" \"Ah don't know....ah mean we...\" \"We insist, not many visitors *yawn* come through here but all enjoy *yawn* our hospitality.

We need to *yawn* do something first.\"  A small number of the muckberries sleepily held out their hands as they glowed a deep violet. The girls on the shore looked in amazement as a small patch of the muck in front of them began to harden.  Twilight was especially curious, letting her scientific side geek out over the science of this process. \"You can now walk on our land without *yawn* worry. We wouldn't want *yawn* those pretty dresses and lovely faces *yawn* to get dirty.\" The girls all blushed different amounts at the unexpected complement, not noticing a few of the muckberries were giggling. Rainbow stepped out first onto the hardened muck, another patch in front of her hardening. \"Come on girls, everything seems fine.\" Pinkie was next, curiosity inching her to try just how far this magic would go. She quickly rushed onto the blue gunk and stared with fascination. She then proceeded to rush around, with the muck becoming non wolid as she left it. \"Pinkie wait!\" Rainbow said as she darted after her, \"We gotta stay together!\" Fluttermuck giggled as the two raced around. \"There's no need to worry, we would never do anything to harm any of you.\" Twilight frowned and leaned over to Sunset. \"I just know it somehow Shimmer. I just know that girl is Fluttershy.\" Shimmer nodded and said \"Rainbow might be right, it may be best to stick together here. Something about this muck and these mucky ladies gives me the creeps.\" The rest of the group made their way onto the muck and started to make their way over to Fluttermuck.</span></div></div>",

None of them knew what this stuff was none of them seemed interested in finding out the hard way. Rainbow tried her best to catch up to Pinkie, but the party girl seemed to turn quickly right before her more athletic friend caught her. \"Come on Pinkie! Would you at least slow down!\" The group of four watched the two race around with little worry, if something was wrong then they had each other. For the group however, they all could feel that Sunset was right about sticking together. They needed to know what happened to their friend and they were determined to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA singular muckberry whose hair was in a more fancy style then the other made her way towards Rarity. \"Excuse me, but *yawn* I must say you have such elegant hair.\" Rarity smiled at the comment, but tried to keep her focus to the group despite the muckberry pushing further. \"*yawn* Your clothing, few travellers I've seen have worn anything close to your wonderful style.\" Rarity slowed down slightly and turned to the kind muckberry. \"Oh, well....this is just a little number I had made awhile ago. It's nothing really.\" \"Oh but to beings like I it seems like a true piece of *yawn* beauty. You know us muckberries are able *yawn* to slightly sculpt our muck-based bodies. It would be a *yawn* delight if you could try and give me a look even half as *yawn* beautiful as yours.\" Flattered by the flurry of complements, Rarity now turned her whole body to the being. A hesitant look to her face showed as she inched her fingers towards the surface. \"Under most circumstances, I would never dream of touching such an unclean seeming surface....however sacrifices must be made in order for one to truly know fashion. Now let's see, given you height and...unusual size... it might take a moment to figure out the right lengths and.....\" Unaware to Rarity, the muck she was standing on was moving, bring her and her subject of fashion need into a deeper part of the swampy marsh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApplejack rolled her eyes as Rarity's voice became farther and farther away not even bothering to look at her. \"Darn it girl, there are more important things right now then fashion. Ah swear she can just....tarnation! Just how long have we been walking?\" Applejack looked back and saw the ground placement did indicate they were moving, yet looking forward made it seem 'Fluttermuck' was no less far away. Before she could alert the girls of her suspicions though, the cowgirl's eyes found their way to a tree just standing in the muck. The fact it was able to stand in the deep muck was odd enough but on it were the weirdest looking apples she had ever set eyes on. In all her life of farming, she had never seen such a rich and natural shade of blue-violet on an apple in her life. \"*yawn*\" Started a muckberry laying close to the tree. \"I see you are taking interest in *yawn* our appleberry trees. I doubt you could find *yawn* these anywhere else.\" Applejack's pace slowed dramatically as her farmer's mind tried to think up something to say other this. Eventually, all she could say was: \"How..in...tarnation....\" The muckberry picked one  of the blue apples off and rubbed her gooey hand across it, leaving a shining blue sheen to the fruit. \"Beautiful isn't it? Sometimes it can *yawn* just seem like such a tantalizing treat, wouldn't you *yawn* agree.\" The sheen the fruit was giving bounced a few times into AJ's eyes, each one leaving her speechless for a reason she couldn't understand. The muckberry proceeded to spin the appleberry, the light changing into different shade of blue. Before AJ realized what was going on, rings of blue and many shades of said colors filled her eyes. The muckberry carried the fruit off to a clearing filled with the trees standing strong in the muck, the entranced AJ following without a word.</span></div></div>",

Don't you remember us at all?\" \"*yawn* No...but there seems to be something about you all*yawn* that I find familiar.\" Unaware muckberries were creeping behind her and Sunset, Twilight asked. \"Well what would that be?\" Fluttermuck held out her hand and a blue ball of light came into view. \"You six seem to hold a *yawn* magic my kind have recently discovered. Our leader *yawn* suspects it was always in us, it just took some *yawn* time.\" Twilight and Sunset watched the ball, neither understanding why they were quickly getting tired.

With eyes half-closed, Sunset yawned out. \"What?...\" The muckberries were now rubbing the girls in a massaging motion, relaxing them even further then before. Between the hypnotic light, the tired vibe of the marsh, and the wonderful massaging, neither felt like staying awake. Fluttermuck watched as the two were carried off slight and put through the she process she remembered being put through.

Run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Okay!\" Fluttershy replied, booking it out of the blue goo and next to her saving grace beside her, ducking behind the newest face in the marshes. \"wh-who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Name's Firefly, part of the first graduating class of CHS.

All that matters is...\" \"Tell me please, did they mean what they said?\" Firefly still kept acting like she was hiding something, prompting Fluttershy to pull out her main tactic. Within seconds, a cold hard stare began to pierce right into Firefly. \"Well? Were they lying or not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirefly wanted to be quiet, but the stare she was receiving just couldn't be beat. \"Well.....at first......back when I thought I had a chance to go back...I...may have offered to help.\" Fluttershy's increasingly disapproving look only added to Firefly's guilt as she continued. \"I had resisted thier change, but they were closing in on me. I offered my assistance only to save my sanity. At first, I thought maybe if I could find my way back then I could save those I lead mistakenly. After a while though, I realized what happens when one becomes a full muckberry. The transformation is bad enough, but it gets worse. You forget your name, you forget your past, you could easily forget what happened an hour before. All one would care about is sleeping, enjoying the company of other muckberrys, and converting others. When I found you, you......you reminded me so much of me. I....I wanted to do the right thing for once.\" Fluttershy stared at Firefly with a look of anger and distrust she only gave to the worst of her morality compass, and that's a short list. \"So....how do I know I can trust you now that I know your little secret?\" Firefly kept silent, unable to say anything. \"Is there even a way out? Am I stuck here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you girls*yawn* hear something?\" Fluttershy's tone was beginning to attract some of the muckberries that were still on land.

We'll go there to discuss our plan of action.\" Fluttershy nodded as she followed quickly yet cautiously. Cautious because she still wasn't 100% trusting of Firefly, but also of the fact that the ground was so far away whenever she looked down. \"Relax Fluttershy, there's nothing to worry about falling. Even without our muck bodies, our juice-filled guts would just bounce us back.\" Fluttershy gulped, but still kept scared. After a few minutes, Firefly declared. \"Home sweet home. There she is!\" Fluttershy looked and gasped in awe at the marvel before her. It was a large treehouse settled with the thick branches of multiple trees to the point that it would seem invisible from the ground. \"Yeah...I prefer to keep hidden even from 'them.'

Why the heck was it in her image in the first place? Why did it seem a little too coincidental the same fairy would have led them both here? After yawning unintentionally, Firefly brought her fellow muckberry hybrid from her thoughts. \"Well...I have seen this one shaft of light before. I guess I just took it as the idea that I couldn't go home no matter how hard I reached. Darkness is usually what rules aside from whatever keeps all of us from being blinded by it so that must lead some way back to the surface.\" \"Great!\" Fluttershy said as she got off the chair, leaving a new blue imprint to the many others on it. \"If so, then what are we waiting for?\" Firefly fidgeted before letting loose her words. \"Well...the reason I can see the shaft...well....just come and see.\" Firefly pointed to the window and motioned Fluttershy to go to it. Going across it as such, Fluttershy stood in fear. She could see the light...and it was surrounded by a thicker shade of darkness. Not only that, but the jungle seemed more sense and foreboding and she could see more blueberry sludge perfect for a muckberry to melt into and have a wonderful rest, forgetting whatever worthless cares of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>FLUTTERSHY!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Firefly, I just couldn't focus.\" \"Anyways, even though I haven't strayed far from this part of Blueberryland, I can tell you darkness is not good. There's no telling what we may run into. We might meet more powerful muckberries or other blueberry freaks waiting to make us like them...or lunch.\" Fluttershy shook in fear over the thought, her body reacting as such. Noting her body was jiggling as so however only heightened her resolve to say....<br>\r\n\"We don't have a choice...we have to leave.\" Firefly nodded before looking around the hit. \"I don't think I'll miss this place either way.

She tried to look at something else, only to see the muck below her. It seemed thicker in this part of the swamp....\"probably a lot more comfortable too.\" Fluttershy shook her head, trying to fight off her muckberry urges.

The way down is a long drop so we need a way to climb out. 2.The entire entrance to the hole is surrounded by the blueberry muck! We'd be caught again and they wouldn't let us go easily.\" After suppressing a yawn, Firefly began to think over the possibilities. Being here for so long, she had begun to understand the muckberrys sleep patterns. Wake-up and sleep times were somewhat random, but they had an average of 33 minutes per nap and they took a lot of them.</span></div></div>",

She looked back to the tunnel, knowing perfectly well just what is was that she heard. \"Oh no....\" she whispered as she took hold of the vine-rope. Being in her slimey state, it was naturally hard to get a good grip on the vine and her current fear wasn't helping her focus. \"What's up Fluttershy?\" Firefly called down, noticing her partner's frantic pace. Then she heard it too. \"Oh great, they're waking up! Hurry Fluttershy before they realize what's going on!\" Down below, Fluttershy kept trying to get what she thought was a good grip. As she kept fumbling around, her fears kept getting the best of her and her mind began to create pictures in her head of failure. She began to whimper at the thoughts, hoping that the Muckberries couldn't hear her. Much to the delight of her fears however, the slimy sounds of semi-solid footsteps echoed through the base of the cave. Fluttershy began to shiver in fear and Firefly wasn't too far off. \"Just get some kind of hold Fluttershy so I can pull you up!!\" But it was too late, they were already at the end of the cavern and staring poor Fluttershy in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlanked by at least four others, the lead Muckberry took a step towards Fluttershy. \"Why dearie....*yawn*..what are you doing being so physical? Haven't yo*yawn*u learned by now that it's just better to rest and not worry?\" Fluttershy's not-so-solid back was now up against the wall of the cavern, the hybrid seemingly forgetting about the rope. The lead took a look to the bushes and gave a frown, even though her naturally tired face often made it impossible to tell otherwise. \"You didn't even *yawn* bother to have a little blueberry snack beforehand. Slime blueberries, a *yawn* true delight in an existence of endless delight.\" Other Muckberries began to enter while the leader gave a waving finger to the hybrid. \"You must be so tired after all*yawn* that running around. Why not come back and take a little nap? *yawn* We know you'll *yawn* love it.\" The tired vibe once again began to reach Fluttershy and her already mucky body intensified it. From up above, Firefly called down to the group. \"I'd leave her alone if I were you, I don't think you want any of this again!\" A few of the muckberries looked up and began walking to the rope before the lead stopped them. \"Why would you need to worry about us anymore dear?*yawn* You've finally gotten what you wanted all this time, a way back to the surface. You no longer need to*yawn* worry about us or anyone that stumbles to us. Then again, you never did in the first place. Just let us have this one and we'll*yawn* let you go. However...if this girl really means so much, then you can take her place. So many*yawn* of us have been wanting you a part of the muck for so long. You come down, she*yawn* goes free. We can't take away the gifts we gave her, but I*yawn*think she'll be happy with them.\" Firefly looked down to Fluttershy, who was taking a tired step towards the waiting arms of the leader. \"Fire....fly...\" The mumble from Fluttershy was all Firefly heard before  she made her decision.</span></div></div>",

Seems we...*yawn*...have to welcome our friend to her destiny.\" Firefly stepped back in shock, her face taking on a much paler coloration. <i>Shoot! She's out cold! Darn...I've got to save her!...</i> she thought before turning her attention to her vine rope. <i>If Daring Do can pull it off...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Not on my watch you slimy creeps!\" Firefly bellowed from the top of the cliff as she gathered a chunk of vine into her hand. With a jump and a swing, she took to racing alongside the walls of the drop, building momentum. The muckberries simply looked on in confusion, the lead grinning in the hopes of claiming both girls under their collective sway. Her dreams were sadly broken as Firefly's foot caused any muck between her and her friend to splatter and scatter into the floor of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You can't stop what...*yawn*...we've started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Not like you can resist either!\" Firefly cheered as her foot slammed heel-first into the leader's mucky face, causing it to splash and splatter into the rocky ground below. With a graceful flip, Firefly landed onto the ground beneath her, scooping up her friend. \"What am I gonna do with you...\"</span></div></div>",

Making sure her grip on her fellow escapee was as tight as a slimy surface could make it when gripping another slimy surface, Firefly made her way back to the rope. I was going to be difficult, no doubt, but she had to climb out now or all would be lost. With careful concentration, her free hand took hold of the vine and began climbing up. She grunted as she slowly lifted the pair off the ground and to the light above. With only one hand that was free while the other gripped her friend, it wasn't exactly easy to climb up. This in itself was a bad sign as the muckberries below them began to reform. Watching the horror under her though gave the hybrid an idea, she just had to hope that they were muck enough. \"I really don't want to do this but if it can free up my other hand.....\" After a minute of wiggling around, Firefly's plan worked! Fluttershy had now been partially sunk into her body just enough to free up her other hand. Needless to say, the experience was uncomfortable and rather disturbing but it had to be done. With both hand now usable, Firefly was able to pull the two up and out before the lead muckberry was able to reform. \"*Yawn* Oh well.....it's too late to stop it anyways......The newer one has nearly finished her conversion. Anyways.....*yawn* I could use a nap.\" The other muckberries nodded and followed their leader as she made her way back to the muck. None of them noticed a small blue light passing over their naturally tried heads, flying straight in the direction the two hybrids left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirefly pushed Fluttershy through the hole first, taking a deep breath in before poking out herself. The first response was brightness, having become accustomed to the darkness below. Once her eyes adjusted, Firefly looked at the world she had left long long. \"Wow.....I....it's just how I remembered it.\" A murky tear fell from her eyes as she looked upon the green vegetation - not blue with a green tint- full on green. In a nearby tree were apples, now blueberries or blueberries shaped like apple, but the real red deal. Firefly looked to Fluttershy, who was still sleeping but peacefully. Firefly sighed, \"Sleeping...not worrying about what it will do to you. For once, a nap sounds like a good idea to me.\" Allowing herself to yawn for the first time in years, Firefly layed her head on the green grass and soft, brown dirt.</span></div></div>",

Unsure of how to deal with the slimy mucks, RD whipped out her phone and sent a mass text to her friends:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <i>Hey!<br>\r\n   Think I found Flutters!<br>\r\n   There's something wrong with her though<br>\r\n   She's all slimy and mucky</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Carefully sneaking forwards, she grabbed a long stick and began to poke at the mucky surface of her friend. Sure enough, a very thin trail of goop came off of her. RD screwed up her face, thoroughly creeped out by the strange rendering of her friend, Thankfully, the remainder of the cast were hot on her heels, equally gasping in surprise at the state of their friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You weren't kidding Dash!

We couldn't find anything in their blue slime and....ohhh..\" Despite her best efforts to try and convince herself it wasn't her fault, tears were beginning to form in Rainbow's eyes. \"Some friend I am.....if only I knew what the heck happened to her and that Firefly girl....\" RD put her hand into her pockets, only for a soft squish to sound in them.

By now, it seemed that there was no fully solid part of transforming girl left. Fluttershy didn't care though, a blueberrymuckgirl didn't need to be solid to be happy.

This time, Fluttershy could feel the piece flowing into her and reaching into the one part of her left to transform: her soul. After awhile, the two pulled away as Fluttershy's body was now as big as any other muck girl. \"You are *yawn* now one of us. This is now where*yawn* you belong.\" Others began to rise up from the muck to welcome their new girl, all yawning instead of saying anything. Fluttershy yawned along with them and one by one, the muck women began to merge back into the muck. Fluttershy joined them, loving the feeling of sinking away, becoming one with her new life.

Fluttershy never did figure out how long she had been there, or if anyone ever came to look for her, but neither seemed to bother her. If anything, she could barely remember much of what it was like being a regular human. There was the odd memory here or there, something about saving some school with people she could barely recall. Anytime it came to mind, she would simply shrug it off, the last visages of her humanity slipping away into the voids of the marshlands she called home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was true thather friends had searched high and low for her days after she had disappeared. Princess Twilight had searched hardest of all, still coming back weekly to the human world in the hopes to find her friend.

It was sad for some to watch their friend seemingly evaporate from the public conscious, but evidence proved that her reappearance was somewhere between never and dead. And for their sake, they left it on never to remain at least somewhat positive about it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   For what it was worth, Flutterslime was at least very happy where she ended up and had all the loving company she could ever ask for.

Sensing the increase of resistance to their intent, the vines called out to their brethren, releasing a sweet aroma into the air and attracting more vines to their cause. Fluttershy gasped at the swarm of waving, wriggling vines snaking their way across the ground and latching onto her. She screeched in desperate fear, forcing all her might into bolting as far away from this vicious assault on her as possible. Unfortunately for her, the vines had sensed her shift in energy and latched tightly about her legs, tripping her and swarming over her body. She sobbed as the limited light around her disappeared behind a wall of plant life. Despite the darkness about her, she could feel a strange warmth radiating about her body, making further struggling far more difficult. Not only that, but the aroma around her smelled stronger, her mind finding it more and more of a struggle to fight against her captors. </span></div></div>",

The transformation she was undergoing was now unrestrained and began acting as such. The blue color on her had not only began spreading faster, but was getting darker.

The beautiful halls became abuzz as students began rushing about to collect thier things and make it to class. Lockers were opened and closed like clockwork with the ticking of combinations adding to the feel. The faces of the multi-colored students ranged from the average 'As long as I don't stay forever' look to the even mkre noticeable 'bored from heck and back' expression. In all of this chaos, one girl was prancing through the thick of it. A particular girl with poofy pink hair and an attitude that could brighten almost anyone's day. This girl, know as Pinkie Pie to her friends, was happily skipping to class with her backpack hidden away in her nearly bottomless hair. No one would question this as......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Hey!! Can we speed this up already?! I'm certain the readers want to get into this fascinating story arc. By the way, Happy 1000th Chapter Goldscout! I'd love to throw you a party but I have a story to star in! </span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....alrighty then....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyways....Pinkie walked into what was mostly likely her favorite first class: Baking! The stoves all nicely placed at the back of the room with all the ingredients stored in cupboards and shelves all familiar to the happy, pink girl. As she sat at a table, she noticed an odd container on the counter of each station. Pinkie went to examine it as students began coming in. Each container was a blue cylinder with no distinct label except for an inscription on the cerulan cap reading BE-14. The bell signaling the beginning of school was in the last seconds before ringing when Pinkie zipped into her chair. After the ringing ended, intercom box clicked on and the calming voice of Principal Celestia came through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning students. It's great to see all of you back from your undoubtibly exciting weekends. For morning announcments, I only have one announcement although it is important. As of today, a new dietary rule is being implemented into the school. From now on, all foods cooked, baked, or otherwise in school must be made using a new supplement: BE-14 given to us by an undisclosed source. Also, all food brought to school must be laced with the supplement. There will be no exceptions to this rule, even for baked goods in bake sales and cooking class. Students or faculty found not following this rule will be sent to me for a.... discussion. I hope  I have made myself clear. Anywho, have a pleasant day students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie' s eyebrow raised at the notice but shrugged it off as the intercom clicked off and class begin. Pinkie rushed to the freezer and quickly pulled out the cupcakes she had been making. They were baked already, she just need to pour on the frosting, which was also freezing. Pinkie brought both to her station and began mixing. Glancing over to the can of BE-14, Pinkie wavered at the thought of putting it in.<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Yeah. I mean I didn't even know what was in it, it could have been some sort of monsters has or some evil force of evil. However, Principal Celestia said it was mandatory and if she said it was fine then it must have been so I put it in. It made the frosting a nice blue tint with it's pink color.</span><br>\r\nAhem...Pinkie wisked away at the thawing froating even as she poured it onto the cupcakes. They just looked so good, she wanted to try them so much......</span></div></div>",

Sure enough, the only label on the container was the top label of BE-14. \"What the heck was in this thing?\" Pinkie continued to examine the BE-14 holder, unaware of the other students putting the supplement into thier recipes without question.

There was no doubt that the new additive has something to do with this flavor change. For a moment, the though passed through her head that there was something wrong about this. However, this wasn't the first time she had to deal with things being added to food for dietary purposes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Like that one time when my doctor told me I was eating too much sugar and needed to take some little pull whenever I ate. It gave the most nasty aftertaste but all I needed was more sugar to get rid of it.

Cut it out!</b> Oh...my apologies....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yes, Pinkie set the container down with the idea this was just something she needed to work over. Besides, Principal Celestia said this was for dietary purposes. \"I'll just leave these cupcakes in freezer for later. After all, blueberries are still a good flavor of cupcakes.\" As Pinkie walked over to the freezer, her eyes passed over to some of the other students in thier stations. She watched as a few short sprinkles turned a cake mix into a dark violet shade and as Trixie downed a peanut butter cracker coated in the blue dust. Pinkie' s grin faltered, something just didn't sit right about this situation. No matter what she thought, the feeling wouldn't sit well in her stomach. Upon each counter was a cylinder of BE-14, each one without any sort of ingredient list of health facts. \"Maybe that's it....\" Pinkie thought to herself as she grabbed another cupcake before putting the rest in cold storage, \"Maybe I just don't know what's in them is the problem. I bet Principal Celestia might tell me.\" Pinkie bit into the cupcake, the strong blueberry taste sticking to her mouth.</span></div></div>",

She would just work around it like everything else in her life. As she walked to the office, she could hear a few students from cooking discussing their own first thoughts of BE-14.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The taste is still on my tounge.....\"<br>\r\n\"No dietary information....\"<br>\r\n\"Trixie's crackers tasted fruity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie shook her head as she walked along. Already the office door was in full view. \"Alright, just ask Celestia, there's nothing wrong with that. Just a question about the supplement and that's it.\" Pinkie continued to think to herself, unaware she was at the door and perpetually walking into it. \"Ummm...miss Pinkie?\" Pinkie Pie was pulled from her thoughts by Vice Principal Luna, standing beside her with a rather worried look to her face. \"Hi Miss Luna. Have you seen Celestia anywhere? I need to talk to her about this new supplemental thing.\" Luna nodded with an understanding look. \"Ah yes, my sister has developed an odd interest in this BE-14. She's actually confessed to me she's been putting it in my food. Now I do like blueberries but as a side or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Now normally I listen to what the school-higher ups have to say but those were some things about Vice Principal Luna that caught my attention.

Also, normally her stomach doesn't reach out more than a low fraction of my little finger but she seemed to stick out slightly. </span>}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...as for my sister, she is nowhere in her office.

Pinkie herself went ahead of the pack and her eyes fell to an interesting if not slightly unwanted sight. Every single speck of food on the trays all had the telltale signs of BE-14 in them. Grabbing a tray and rushing to her seat while her friends were only just getting in line, she tasted each item. Carrots, hamburgers, the jello, even the milk was indistinguishable from each other's blueberry taste. Rainbow was the first to sit down, munching on a carrot stick. \"You weren't kidding Pinks, it tastes like a blueberry.\" Each of the girls came back with similar expressions of surprise. However, none of them actually stopped eating the additive-infested lunch. Even Pinkie herself chugged her milk while Rarity looked over her cerulean burger. \"If anything, this strange supplement makes this food look odd to say the least.\" Each of the girls nodded heads, though still didn't think of halting thier feast.</span></div></div>",

(And this is the important one) I'm in control here.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's head dropped at the knowledge that what the Narrator  was saying was right. There really was no way out of this situation. On the plus side, she always did enjoy blueberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Alright....I won't fight it.

It wasn't painful but she could definitely tell it was happening. A taste was flowing around her mouth, slowly but surely sensing the influx of BE-14 into system. Her arms began to grow heavy as the full feeling in her stomach increased. Wiggling slightly in the grip of her friends, Pinkie noticed how her stomach jiggled as well. The full feeling soon spread upwards to her top side and the growing soon began. As her shirt began to strain, the more mind numbing effects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\">Girls...help...slipping....</span><span class=\"clblue\">away...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Pinkie...\" Rarity said as she patted her friend's straining skirt. \"Just relax and join us...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">Mmm...yes....joining...what was I thinking fighting this?</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie's shirt began to tear from both the bottom and top, the blue skin showing clearly. Her skirt soon joined this tearing, making her clothing a cross of Rainbow and Rarity. Her body kept growing round her arms as they slowly sank into her blue body. As the growing ended, Pinkie smiled at her new form. Sure it wasn't as big as anyone else, but some helpings of BE-14 would quickly change that. Pinkie's thought was interrupted by the door opening as Celestia led the rest of the humane 7 into the office. \"Ah...I see you two have brought Pinkie around. We'll work out your reward later, now that I have all if you here...\"</span></div></div>",

This just..doesn't seem right...</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rarity pulled the snacks from the desks and began putting them into her blue friend, Celestia sighed. \"Of course Pinkie would be the hardest of you girls to bring under. She should understand by now, I'm doing this for the good of my people.\" Having long fallen under the sway of the mythical powder, each of the girls looked to thier friend with a rather upset face.  Rarity and Rainbow especially seemed hurt as Pinkie's bellybutton popped under the streching shirt. \"Mistress Celestia, if you don't mind I would like Pinkie to have my liquid reward given to Pinkie instead.\" \"Yeah,me too.\" Rainbow nodded \"Both for her and you.\" The Principal smiled at the kindness of her little blue servants. \"If that's what you want, then very well. You two can have all you want from my storage, that goes for the rest of you. Pushing a section of the wall of her office, Celestia revealed cakes and crackers with a large jug of the Buruberi secret. All six girls crowded around as Celestia pulled open a drawer in her desk. A few clunking sounds came before Celestia pulled out two large soda bottles filled with a glowing blue liquid. \"You should feel proud Pinkie. Your friends gave up thier rewards to you, now you get to enjoy two bottles of the most closely guarded secret of the Buruberi.\" Pinkie could feel the urge to open her mouth as Celestia opened the bottles, but the last stretches of her conscious mind kept them shut. Her legs could not help her much in running seeing as they were enveloped slightly by her round form. All she could do was watch as Celestia approached her and waved the thick scent of blueberries and whatever else was in the bottles under her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpblue\">Can't fall to this...must...open mouth...NO can't....</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We were just over this Pinkie, you said you wouldn't fight it anymore. Well, if you want to be difficult than THE TROUBLE SHALL INDEED BE DOUBLED!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie had no idea how, but suddenly her mouth opened wide. Unable to control herself, all she could do was witness as the two bottles were turned over with thier contents spilling into her gaping mouth. The liquid slid down her throat without fail and the girl's form instant grew even more. Her skirt was ripping down further as her lower side puffed up. Her top side also grew, her neck all but gone and only her fingers showing on the sides. The full feeling from before intensified as her stomach gurgled over the magical liquids inside her. As her height pushed over the principal, the effects of her mind took route. The substance powered through the bloodstream into the brain, dousing Pinkie's mind in a sea of blueberry deliciousness.  All thoughts of fighting against her Mistress was now doushed, this time with permanance in mind. Pinkie's eyes and hair finally tinted themselves true blue, a sign that her body was now fully under the spell of Celestia's plan.</span></div></div>",

Each of thier stomachs jiggled with a bubbling noise before a glowing light began to show. Celestia took a step back, having a good idea about what was happening. \"Yes my sweet little berries, your magic is working just how I expected it would eventually. The power of my people's powder has finally reached the magic you girls have.\" <br>\r\nThe glowing became more and more pronounced, the side door to Luna's office opened with the large bellied Vice Principal squeezing through. \"Sister? What's going on?\" \"What's going on dear sister is the beginning of our people's revitalization. With my planning and control, our dear students our going to be the seeds of the return of the Buruberi!\" After a few short moments, the glowing subsided and the seven girls emerged anew. Each of the blue girls were wearing blueberry based tribal versions of thier magical clothing, which fit to thier rotund bodies like gloves. \"My dear students, your magic has rebirthed you into Buruberi mages. With my command and your power, soon the world will be ours.\" Turning to her sister, Celestia added \"And I do mean all of us.\" Her current state telling her of her heritage, Luna nodded much of Celestia's delight. \"Wonderful, now my sages, please strip me of the curse of this human form and give me the form of my people.

The lunch for today: Violet Chicken sandwiches with indigo mashed potatoes and sky gravy all taking like blueberries. As she ate this meal, Pinkie noticed two things in particluar. The first being that her good friends were nowhere in sight. In fact, she hadn't seen or heard from them all day. The second factor (and the one Pinkie paid more attention to) was that when she didn't care, the blueberry taste was that much sweeter.  Not currently worrying about the blue skin and slightly pushing bellies of her peers, Pinkie continued to eat without a care of what she was doing to herself.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, Twilight was just about to head through the door of the library when Pinkie showed up. \"Twilight!\" The pink girl shouted, spooking the studious girl. \"Gah!! Pinkie Pie!?

Touching the tube however, Twilight's eyes went wide. \"Oh....oh my goodness.\" \"What?\" Pinkie managed to muddle through the zipper as Twilight checked her notes again. \"There's two things in this...I can't seem to identify them but....it's not right....some kind of suggestive drug and....something involving a blueberry's gentics.</span></div></div>",

This was worrying enough, but she began to notice Twilight's clothes streching out. The girl's face was beginning to turn more of a violet shade as she slowly fell. \"No, Twilight!\" Pinkie shouted over her fallen friend.

You girls putting on such a panic yet here you girls are for me.\" \"This is for for your safety more than anything else.\" Fluttershy gulped as she hid behind Sunset, who was looking over exactly what had given them entrance. The what being said because instead of a person, the girls were looking at a bizarre load of gears, pulleys and rusted dust with fake eyes and hands connected to the doors. \"How reassuring...\" Rarity mumbled yet not focussing the enthusiasm of Pinkie, who ran to the desk in front of them and waved her shining ticket about in the air as moths swirled around it. \"Alrighty! Any moment now! Where is that tour?\" The girls all stayed silent, watched as Pinkie's bouncing perpetually slowed as she leaned into the cobweb coated desk.

On each screen she could see many varieties of plants with tons of information about them on the screens beside them such as harvest rate, amount of water they needed, all the kinds of things that any real farmer should know about their crops without the use of all this technology. As much as Applejack hated to admit it, this command center did have quite a few advantages and she almost felt a sliver of respect for such meticulous research (but she would never admit it to her friends or family by any means.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back to the view of the gardens, AJ saw her frends seeming to seperate slightly as they made thier own investigations of the garden. Fluttershy seemed to be looking for any animals or insects in the trees with her slightly disappointed face showing her current failure. Twilight and Sunset were discussing amongst themselves by some bushes about the science of it all no doubt. Meanwhile, Rainbow and Raity were on oppisite sides of a watermelon patch. Rainbow was talking over at Rarity who was (huge suprise) checking her makeup. AJ put a hand to her chin, unaware that Pinkie was looking over the vast amount of shiny, jolly, candy-like buttons around the console.

It was filled with plants that the farmer could recognize, bu on particular intest was a short section of button put under the labeled <i>X.</i> \"What in tarnation is that x doing there?\" \"Well...\" Pinkie had her eyes set back into the screens. \"...the tour voice did say that some of these plants were experimental....and those look as experimental as any pie I've made in the last two weeks.\" Applejack looked to the screen Pinkie was pointing to and had to admit she found some interesting plants. Although one could easily mistake them as ferns at first glance, thier unusual orange speckled look would give the closer examination cause for pause. They stood straight and tall in thier own area of the garden, a ways off from everything else and under a dark purple lamp. \"Now what do yah'll suppose those plants are for?\" \"I don't know Jackie, but these X plants got thier own set of buttons along with the water. Watch!\" Pinkie pressed a few buttons on a seperate console and watched as the purple light turned green and thier speckles turned while. \"Uhh, Pinks, ah don't know if we should be fiddling with that stuff....\" Pinkie glanced to her friend with a smirk as she pulled a lever and two gloves poppede from the console as two metal hands came from the celing above the plants. \"You sure you ain't curious AJ? I bet these plants would like to be handled with a 'real farmer's touch?\" \"But that's a robot with mah hand movements....\" Pinkie said nothing as she changed the light to pink and the speckles to blue and slipped her hands into the gloves. AJ shivered as Pinkie fillded with the plant leaves between the robotic finger, such nere uncaring nature......any plant had to be handled with respect.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me those!\" AJ growled as she pulled Pinkie's arms away from the gloves. \"Yah'll are using too much pressure! Yah gotta be gentle...like this....\" AJ cradled the leaves, amazed that she could somehow feel them through the gloves. She lighty brushed the smooth greenery, feeling the soft areas of the spots almost tickling her.

Thank you and have a good weekend.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA new video Game!?\u201d Pinkie thought, \u201cOh I wonder what that could be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the announcement ended, Pinkie tried to quickly glance at out classroom door.  Thankfully, her class was rather close to Canterlot High\u2019s entrance, and she could already see a game poster.  It was trio of large, round, heroric blueberry-like women. The first one dressed as sorceress dressed in a violet cloak and whose weapon, a golden rod, held by projected hands as were the other two. The second blueberry was a ranger taking aim with a bow taller than her inflated body, and the last one was an armored knight with an oversized sword and shield, battling an army of killer war cyborgs with chainsaws for hands and shoulder mounted missile launchers.  One look at that poster had the party girl on board with the VR game immediately.  Everything Pinkie imagined she could do for the weekend was now thrown out, and she could already see it what was taking its place: Spending the whole 4-day weekend with her friends on an epic science fantasy virtual adventure. There was only one thing standing in the way, time.  Pinkie took another look at the clock again impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on. Come on. Come on. Why does that final bell always take forever?\u201d  Pinkie Pie pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie immediately cheered as the class\u2019s final bell rang and instantly got out of her seat, leaving her supplies at her desk, and busted the classroom down with charging shoulder tackle.  The pink teen quickly made an immediate beeline towards that game booth so fast it looked a pink dust storm was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi-is-this-where-I-can-that-great-Berry-Quest-game?\u201d Pinkie said very quickly, catching the woman at the table, the game developer\u2019s founder and namesake, by surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. Yes mi\u2026\u201d Cobalt Code answered, before Pinkie interrupted her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><b>\"PERFECT!\"</b></font>  the pink teen quickly grabbed a whole column of game copies and VR equipment needed for her friends.  The pink teen was too caught up in the moment to remember if her or her friends\u2019 computers were up to the game\u2019s requirements, but if they weren\u2019t she knew it was nothing a little magic couldn\u2019t fix.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The teen decided on a test run of the game and had gotten an instruction booklet out from one of the game copies.  The equipment was one Blueberry like helmet and back unit (which according to the manual had the processing equipment and software to allow players to livestream their game, and a pair of blue gloves with a LED crystal-like cluster blueberries on the back of each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkie Dokie Lokie, \u2018VR Equipment Setup in 3 Easy Steps\u2019: Step 1,\u201d Pinkie read the instructions out loud, \u201cUse the official Berry Quest App on your smartphone to create your player account by entering your username, email, and account password.  After that, set the phone camera to yourself.  The facial recognition software of our phone app will create your avatar for the game for you. Hey! That\u2019s nifty!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie inserted phone into a yo-yo and slung it forward to take a full body selfie. Once the yo-yo reeled back, Pinkie had her free hand remove the phone and finger from the yo-yo and then put said finger on the manual\u2019s next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cStep 2, After installing Berry Quest onto an internet connected computer, insert your smartphone into the official Berry Quest Virtual Reality Helmet to allow voice chat.  The slot will be located on the inside of the helmet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie tilted her helmet 180 degrees and quickly found the slot, and once she found the slot she quickly inserted her phone into it, hearing a resonating click. Afterwards, she went back to the manual to read the last step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStep 3, Connect all 3 of the official Berry Quest equipment to the back unit.  Make sure that each piece of equipment has 3 D*teeheehee*-Cell Batteries inserted in each battery compartment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie did one final inspection of her game equipment: the blue helmet held her phone, the gloves felt charged, and she had just plugged each of them into the back unit with the components\u2019 wires having the perfect amount of length to give the pink high schooler plenty of movement but not trip up on them.  Pinkie strapped on the back unit onto herself like a backpack, then put on the gloves second.  She got her on computer and began running the game.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBerry Quest Login:<br>\r\nUsername: PinkPartyGirl<br>\r\nPassword: *********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the password was entered, Pinkie Pie was officially logged in, and ready to enter the world of Berry Quest.  Pinkie slid the blueberry shaped VR helmet on to her head, attaching the helmet strap, and finally turned on the helmet\u2019s power button. The lights of the gloves turn, signaling the equipment was in use. In a blue flash on the helmet's lens, Pinkie had found herself in the game at\u2026</span></div></div>",

She seemed to have been placed in a small village, with astectics similar to  textbook pictures of rural towns from the medieval age. She seemed to be standing right beside a well glowing a dark blue hue with a small garden in her general vicinity. Taking a few steps forward, Pinkie took in the sights of the village itself. Despite the simplicity of their designs, the houses along the street all had signs or some design feature that helped them stand apart from the others. What really helped catch Pinkie' s eye however were the folks going in and out of said houses. Thier stomachs were far greater than any Pinkie  seen in the real world, with skin color ranging from sky blue to dark indigo poking from their dresses. From the facial and bodily features, they all seemed to be women. \"Wow!\" Pinkie exclaimed as she brought her hands to her face, \"That Cobalt must have worked so hard on this...\" Although Pinkie was gushing hard, it did not stop her from noticing her game hands were blue as well. Taking a look at her chareter's body, Pinkie found she was a rather quaint shade of cerulean, though not as big in the belly as many of the folks around her. In fact, it seemed she was still using her legs as opposed to all the other berrywomen about her. \"Maybe just a leveling thing...\" Pinkie thought as she wondered what to do next. This well seemed to be glowing from one reason or another, so that was an option. Then again, there were all these little shops and people to converse with. And there seemed to be a bakery a few houses down anyways.</span></div></div>",

Heading out to the square of the village, the first building that caught Pinkie\u2019s eye was a weapons-and-armor shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould be nice to \u2026 hey!\u201d The teen said before felt a pouch on the left of her cerulean belly, she grabbed it and examined it.   It was pouch containing 3,000 Berrays, the game\u2019s currency.  There was a note attached to it, reading, \u201cThank you from The Berry Quest Developer for volunteering for Beta Testing our game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie immediately went to the store, where she was greeted by a blueberry woman, whose size would have equated to around what Pinkie guessed to be 3-5 months of playtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWelcome how can I help you?\u201d  the shopkeeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi, I just started on my adventure, and I would like to buy plenty of equipment. A whole lot of equipment since I\u2019m going to have my friends over for a while, and then we\u2019re going to be spending the entire weekend here on an epic blueberry adventure!\u201d  Pinkie had answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy certainly milady, feel free to help yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blue teen had purchased a good number of weapons and armor, ranging from swords and shields, staves and robes, and both leather and metal armors, for herself and her friends with her Berrays, with one set of which she immediately changed into.  They were set of furs of what Pinkie guess would be the game\u2019s equivalent of a big cat.  For starting weapon, Pinkie had chosen a decently sized Hand Axe, its blade made of iron while the handle was wood with a reddened finish. Holding that much equipment was easy since Pinkie used her belly like a basket.  When she was ready to check out, she handed all the armaments on to the table, then got out her pouch of Berrays and emptied it on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank for your patronage Miss\u2026?\u201d The Armorer blueberry woman asked, never getting her recent customer\u2019s name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie replied boisterously \u201cPinkamena Diane Pie of the Order of the Rainboom!\u201d </span></div></div>",

The rest of the girls (having walked out of school and to their homes at an average pace instead of jumping on the Pink Rocket) had gathered around a chatroom with their laptop cameras to discuss the large boxes that had somehow managed to get carefully stuffed into their backpacks. \"Isn't it obvious AJ\" Sunset claimed as she opened up the package, \"Looks like Pinkie's wants us to try out that game Luna told us about.\" The girls all nodded in understanding, knowing full well only Pinkie had the skills to put something so large into their backpacks without knowing until the weight became obvious. Rarity and Fluttershy both glanced to one another before the fashionista spoke out. \"As much as Pinkie would be understandably excited, I never really was one for games. Especially not such violent seeming ones.\" \"Yeah, that warlock thing from the cutout at school seemed scary.\" Rainbow and Twilight said nothing as it was painfully obvious that their attention was focused on setting up the device. When Rainbow realized she could weigh in her two cents, she laughed with her usual can-do attitude. \"You girls can do what you want, but I've got no practice or homework today and I ain't letting a gift from Pinkie go to waste.\" \"Besides, it would be interesting to see what that Cobalt Code woman has put into such an experience.\" The enthusiasm of those two seemed to sway over the rest, each putting on the readying the headset and gloves at their own pace.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After the blue flash, Rarity had found herself in the same garden and thankfully the other girls were there as well.  The fashionista\u2019s friends there as well.  They had looked at the environment and were in awe at the game\u2019s graphics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, these graphics are incredible.\u201d Sunset said.<br>\r\nWhen the girls looked at themselves, the girls then noticed that they were blue, and their game characters\u2019 midsections have bloated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in tarnation?

It was a clear turquoise crystal shaped like a blueberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you know how it work?\u201d Twilight asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 we just say the name of who want to invite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we just say \u2018we want to invite Pinkie Pie\u2019?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Pairing-Winkle began to glow a blue light then shot itself into the sky, exploding in a burst of cyan light.  Pinkie then appeared in blurring streak of blue and magenta, seemingly accepted the invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi girls! You just caught me as I was leaving the armory.  I\u2019m so excited you all! I\u2019ve all of this equipment for you.\u201d She yelled excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends took a good look Pinkie, whose namesake who could now could be applied to her hair.  In fact, Pinkie\u2019s belly looked slightly bigger than theirs. Before the girls could say a word, the pink haired warrior was already unloading the equipment she bought onto her friends.  Applejack received the metal shield and armor of a paladin. The Armor disappear in a flash of data when it reached AJ\u2019s phthalo hands and then reappeared on the farm teen\u2019s body, the appearance readjusted to fit AJ\u2019s rustic look, even her hat looked like a cross between her Stetson and a knight\u2019s helmet.  Sunset found herself in the robes of a sorceress with magic rod in hand.  Twilight took notice of her new clothes\u2019 pockets fill with vials and guessed her class would be an alchemist. The first thing Rainbow Dash were the ragged cloak and two new daggers in her, from the athlete\u2019s experience she knew she was a rouge.  Fluttershy\u2019s new tunic look sylvan in design and had a longbow and a leather quiver arrow of mounted on her back.  Rarity examined the white robes of her priestess class and admitted they somehow complimented her new skin tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is so awesome.\u201d  Rainbow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the only words Pinkie\u2019s friends could say before the pink hair teen cut them off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd so, the adventures of the Order of the Rainboom begins!

Another thing that caught her attention was the wonderful aromas in the air. Baked goods, juices, and who nows what else, all it connected to the scent of blueberries. What really caught Applebloom's attention though were those she saw out and about. They were all matching the blue and violet hues of her new friends, and some were just as blown up. One last thing was while she was looking at them, a few were gazing at her. \"Don't mind them.\" Juicy said, \"It's not too often we get such a visitor.\" Applebloom nodded again, though taking one astute observation: there was not a single male in sight, only girls.</span></div></div>",

The sunshine from her window streamed down onto her face, warming it with a gentle glow and signalling the arrival of the morning. Clutching her chest with an open hand, Applebloom breathed slowly, trying to regain her composure before glancing down at herself. Everything seemed normal, no weird colors or abnormalities of her form. She swished her tongue about her mouth, nothing but the taste of morning breath. Sighing in relief that the dream had passed and she truly was in the real world, she leaped out of bed and made her way down the stairs to the kitchen. Something smelled particularly delicious this morning, the hot scent of sweet maple and fruit hung in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Reaching the base of the stairwell, Applebloom clutched the edge of the wall, peering cautiously around the corner. There, standing before the stove with a griddle in hand, was her dear sister Applejack, perfectly as human as ever. Overcome with emotion, Applebloom streaked across the kitchen and tackled into AJ with a vice-tight grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Woah! Easy there Sugarcube!

Her smile waved slightly as she felt an odd gurgle coming from her already large berrybody. Berrybloom could feel the juice inside of her going through an odd reaction and was now curious at where this was going. It started with a bit more growth in her body, obvious to a fault. With the growth came a sheen across her whole body, making her seem like a true blueberry. Berrybloom could feel the magic coursing through her and decided to see this for herself. Taking a slight leap of faith, she focused her energy until she could see a small mirror in front of her. Berrybloom gasped as she looked at her face, the visible sign that the magic had matured her into a teen face. At first, she thought that was the end of it. But soon, an odd tingling came from the clothes she had been wearing. The mirror had disappeared with Berrybloom's loss of focus. Doing her best to look down, Berrybloom tried to see what the heck was wrong. When she was finally able to see it, Berrybloom's eyes opened wide. Her clothes were changing right in front of her. They were changing from the work clothes she had on from the farm into some sort of royal attire and that wasn't the end. A waxy sheen came upon the clothes, giving off the feeling of actually being a part of her body. \"Oh mah....\" Berrybloom whispered, questioning how beautiful she looked now. \" Ah can tell ya like it.\" The voice said with a giggle, \"Now yah'll look even more like a queen, fitting since ya are one now. Ah do hate to cut and run, but now that yah'll have proven herself ah don't need to stick around.\" Berrybloom nodded and went back to rolling towards town, more excited then ever to show Violet and the girls.</span></div></div>",

They then began to blow, blue, juice-filled bubbles began forming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir juice-addled brains managed made them understand. With their lungs practically filled with the blue juice, a strange film began to form in them. Mixed with the magic in the original gum, this film could be blown into bubbles similar to the one that had rebirthed them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Twilight realized what was going on, the three bubbles had almost fully encircled her. \"What the....!!? Girls!!?\" Twilight tried to get out of the circle but it was too late. The three bubbles had already begun to touch together. Twilight kept trying to struggle, but it only served the three a signal to blow harder. Within no time, the three bubbles had formed into one, with Twilight floating in the juice-filled center. Twilight opened her mouth to scream, but ended up drinking a good amount of the juice. The three smiled as they disconnected from the bubble. \"Now we wait.\" Scootaloo said, \"Soon, she will become a blueberry like us. She will never need to worry again.\"</span></div></div>",

Once the juice had hit her tongue, she was perfectly and utterly hooked to the blue juice, slurping up huge gulps of juice into her belly. The three outside the bubble giggled with glee watching how happy Twilight was becoming, her skin shifting from its normal hue to the blueberry blue they were so used to at this point. It was hard to imagine Twilight stopping her delightful assault on the juice surrounding her, but it did come to pass that she halted and merely floated upon the juicy surface of her container. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The peace lastly shortly before Twilight's face lit up with an unbridled registry of bliss as the juice began to seep into her, filling out her already engorged belly to greater proportions. Once it was decently bulging past a foot, her other prime sources of holding began to balloon out, primarily her butt and breasts. The girls on the outside of the bubble ogled Twilight enviously, loving how the juice filled out her womanly curves so well. As the spherical shape took hold of Twilight, the juice paused for a few moments. In that small window of time, Twilight's brain tried to have her register the danger she was facing, being as stuck as her young friends, but the juice once more started its flow, and the thoughts of escape were washed away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The second phase came in an excellent rush, the juices gushing into every part of Twilight, filling her mind and lungs until all was perfectly consumed in the juicy glory the original bubble had once contained for the previous three. She simply grew and grew, expanding upward and outwards until she peaked out at around twelve feet in diameter or so. At that point, the bubble popped and out came a beautiful blueberry Twilight Sparkle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Twilight, how do you feel?\" Scootaloo asked as the three surrounded her.</span></div></div>",

Stepping inside, she found herself witness a much more medieval architecture than she last recalled, with long, violet banners and sweeping rugs emblazoned with the image of three large spheres.

She soon came to a door that had her own mark on it, which was coincidentally the room the room the music was coming from. Fluttershy peeked in, and saw what appeared to be a small spa. Blue candles were lit around the room, giving a delicious scent of blueberries. There was a massage table in the center and a hot tub filled with...something.

It was a lovely indigo onepiece made of a form fitting latex-like material. She couldn't help but smile, the color contrasting nicely with her natural complexion.

Before long, her entire body was submerged, head and all. The swimsuit, enhanced by the magic of Twilight, created a bubble of air around her nose, allowing her to breath. The warm blueberry essence began to cause a reaction, beginning the work it was created. As Fluttershy slept, the juice flowed in and out of her mouth constanly. This, coupled by the juice surrounding her, began to turn her the same shade of blue as her swimsuit. Her hot tub soon began the rest of it's work, slowly blowing her up. The suit kept streching and streching but thanks to the magic in it, not only did it not rip but it grew along with her. Fluttershy kept growing until her stomach stuck slightly out of the tub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow passed over the light, causing Fluttershy to wake up from her sleep.

All that matters to me is the happiness of my three queens.\" Twilight smiled, the music she had put on played the subliminal messages perfectly.\"</span></div></div>",

If only you'd understand...\" Applebloom replied, the ast of her words filled with regret of not having her sister yet under the sway of her collective power. AJ looked down at her predicament: the juice was rising to becoming chest deep and her stomach was out by a decent foot or so. Worse yet, she could feel her butt and breasts taking on liquid plumping and growing with a grand force behind them. She gritted her teeth in frustration, mentally pushing herself to keep everything together, to not let into the voices she could hear calling out for her to join. She wished desperately to cover her ears and concentrate, but between trying to keep herself afloat in the rising pool of juice and her own body beginning to rob her of mobility, she was hard pressed to do much else but try and relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Closing her eyes to focus, Applejack breathed deeply, letting her negative energy flow out with her breath. She cringed as her breath took on a distinct taste of the fruit juice she floated in, and a mere swipe of the tongue confirmed her saliva had indeed changed. Still, her mind was set on focusing her thoughts on a singular idea, the one treasure int he world that could not be tainted: a perfect, shining apple. In all its glory, AJ envisioned the majestic red sheen it had and its sweet, yet clean taste and the wonderful crunch it made between her teeth. It was truly something to behold. But, why did it look so...blue? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Forcing her eyes open in shock, Applejack shook her head and tried to collect herself and her bearings. But things were getting harder to remember, especially why she was so...resistant? Yes, that was the word she was looking for, resistant. She was fighting against something, but what was it now? She closed her eyes again to envision her goal. There, in her mind's eyes, appeared something like what she seemed to think was what she had seen: a large blue fruit that glistened in the light, a sweet and clear flavor with a soft smush when bitten. Yes, that exactly what she remembered! And wiith that, Applejack's body relaxed into a perfectly serene state, allowing her to complete her inflation and, as Twilight had said, everythingwas becoming so clear: the plans, her queens and her purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Is she ready yet Twilight?\" Applebloom asked, anxious to see her sibling as wonderful as herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I sense she has joined us. We shall prepare for the draining,\" Twilight nodded as she pulled a lever, the juice flowing coming to a halt before draining away into unknown stores below. One side of the vat swung openwith a blue AJ rolling forth and greeting the rest with a gentle grin upon her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Greetin's my queens. I am ready to serve with y whole heart and my apologies for takin' so long to see y'all's light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Worry not Applejack, all is forgiven and now,\" Applebloom turned to Twilight, \"we can finally put our plans into motion.\"</span></div></div>",

She crinkled her brow in confusion until she saw the berries blow blue bubbles in her direction.

It wasn't long until the entire town now bowed before their fruit-shaped monarchs. Something that seemed odd was the difference in how males and females reacted to the magic. While females underwent the transformation as normal, it seemed to affect males differently. They still turned blue but they seemed to grow less then females. Twilight had guessed it had to do with the fact that the spell affected females first, but had no real clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig or not, the area of the queens rule had begun to spread like wildfire. Applebloom and Applejack had sunk magic into the ground of the family's farm. So much as biting an apple now ment blue color to the face. They also began shipping seeds of the blueberry infused crops to other Apple family members. As soon as townsfolk bit in, their minds belonged to their queens. There was surprisingly little resistance to the spread as by the time anyone realized what was happening, it was quite late. Those who did not join into the berry way of life were immediately 'convinced.' Eventually a comprise was made though, as long as residents pledged thier loyalty to the three blue queens then berrying would simply be a choice. Needless to say, people quickly agreed. It wouldn't matter anyways, so much positivity about being a blueberry that transformation was a nice option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three queens sat upon their thrones, overlooking the school turned castle that they now called home. They felt so invincible, they practically owned most of the world after all. Twilight, who along with the other 6 had become princesses now, rolled up to her queens.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it had very...complicated side-effects on test subjects and well...to say the least, I'm happy it came into our queens' possession in the end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Indeed. But, enough of our origins to power. We wish to wholeheartedly welcome you to our realm Twilight of Equestria.

What the heck is that?\" A few rays of sunlight had come into the area, much of it landing on the girls. Even from her far vantage, she could see that a waxy sheen was beginning to form on most of the girls.

She watched as their auras surrounded her and began her pwn transformation. Her skin swiftly turned a rich sapphire blue before her belly rapidly took off and swelled outwards to fill her hands. The swelling just blossomed all over, her hands reaching and rubbing everywhere in an overwhelming sense of pleasure as her body filled out and rounded out, casting her into a beautiful sphere. The process didn't stop, as she took on the princesses newer properties like the waxy sheen and curled hair. She moaned out happily, her senses climaxing over the final sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Goodness...\" she half-moaned, half-whispered as she tucked her skirt in place.

Aside from the shelves now fitting the castle's residents, there was almost nothing here that was changed from when the castle used to be a school. At the tables, next to stacks upon stacks of books and scribbling away was Cheerile. \"Hey Cheerile..\" Sunset said as she rolled towards her, \"...How's our visitors report coming along?\" \"Don't worry, tell their majesties I will have it ready by the end of the day.\"<br>\r\nIn truth, Cheerile had finished a report of the Kingdom's history last night.

Without even realizing it, she had veered from her friends and was now following the wonderful aroma. Rarity, who had been watching the girl this whole time said \"It appears the garden is beginning our work for us.\" Fluttershy and Applejack grinned darkly as Fluttershy said \"After all the care we put into this place, it'll do everything.\" Sunset nodded \"Well, she'll want us to watch her. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost everything else around Twilight2 had been shut out, all that mattered was the scent she was following. She now knew what it was of course, the familiar aroma of blueberries. The thoughts just kept coming in, becoming a berrygirl, helping the queens with whatever they wanted her to do, maybe she would convince her pony friends to join her. Soon, Twilight2 found herself at a dead end in a hedgerow of large blueberry bushes. The aroma kept coming though, and she wanted to follow it until the bitter end. She kept looking around until she noticed a large blue bud of a flower. A blue mist was coming from it, clearly the scent she was following. The bud began to open up, now three times as large of her, spraying evenmore mist around for Twilight to breath in. Her mind was halting at the overfill to her senses and just stood there, breathing in the entrancing aroma. Something was beginning to gently push her towards the flower. Twilight2 closed her eyes and imagined vines from the flower were drawing her closer, begging her to come to it. Her body went lax as she let the 'vines' push. \"That's it dearie, come to the flower. Give yourself up to the berries.\" The calming voice whispering in he ear sounded quite a lot like Fluttershy. With Twilight2's mind in the fog it was in though, she imagined the garden was somehow alive. Alive or not, whatever was holding Twilight  now set her down on the flower. The petals began to close around her, becoming a hard cacoon. With nowhere else to go, the pollen began to fill the space the flower made. In the center of the flower, a blue nectar began to bubble. Twilight smiled and fell asleep, letting her new life as a berrygirl begin.</span></div></div>",

The nectar rose still, penetrating deep into Twilight2's flesh, altering and mutating the cells it touched, sending tendrils and spirals of blue flourishing up and across her body. The spirals flared out, engulfing great portions of the purple flesh and draining the red away, leaving only a rich, oceanic azure to be present in the fleshtones. With the skin coated in blue and the innards prepared as well, the nectar made itself far more known wth a surge of itself, reaching waist deep levels and flooding into all available orifices. Twilight2 merely twitched once in her quiet slumber, the fluid bulging her out and expanding within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Back outside, the princesses carefully watched the cocooned flower, each grinning widely in anxious anticipation of the arrival of what was likely to be the next princess in the line. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ooooooo! I'm so nervicited! A brand new princess and everything!\" Pinkie cheered with glee, rocking back and forth with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ah' know sugarcube! We're all mighty excited to see what 'ole Twilight2 is gonna be like,\" Applejack nodded, grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Any estimates on her expected size Twilight1?\" Sunset asked, bringing an ear close to the bud to listen to the process in work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"hard to say right now, this is the first time we've used this method. Theoretically...\" she paused to think it through, \"we could be seeing her outgrow us by a fair potential. And that's with considering that she still has yet to go through the ritual...\" The others stared n shock or disbelief and the thought that any one princess could get that big. Why that was starting to rival the Queens' size...</span></div></div>",

Her arms and legs were quickly disappearing under the round shape that was her body. She wouldn't care when she woke up, witu the new mahi that came with being a berrygirl, they weren't needed. Her new clothes lucikly grew with her, making certain no malfunctions were soon. Twilight2 kept growing and growing, the amount of space in the flower diminishing until there was barely any left. The necter kept filling in nonetheless, Twilight2's body now fully covered in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the flower, the princesses could see the necter beginning to leak out. Applejack was the first to speak. \"Well now, ah don't think it'll be much longer now. Anymore growing and she just might burst.\" The girls chuckled collectively except for Twilight1, who was staring at the bulb in curiosity. \"Is anyone else but me seeing a glow coming from her?\" The girls all looked at the closed flower and noticed Twilight1 was right. A blue glow was coming and it was getting brighter by the second. Pinkie was practically bouncing she was so excited. \"SHE'S ALMOST READY!! SHE'S COMING!\" The bright glow soon became too much for the berrygirls to take and they closed their eyes. When they opened them, they were all amazed at what layed before them. The flower was opened, revealing the new berry it had created. She was certainly bigger then the princesses, but barely. Her plant-based clothing gave a.natural look to her that gave at least Fluttershy cause to squeeze. All traces of her arms and legs were gone, not that they mattered. What really blew the girls away though were three specific changes in Twilight2's form. Her ears now resembled pony ears and her wings and horn were on full display. They seemed to have undergone the same changes as the rest of her body, so they wouldn't give her mobility problems. Twilight2 opened her eyes and gave a satisfied smile. \"Fellow berrygirls, presenting Twilight: The Equestrian Princess of Friendship and Blueberries!\" Twilight2 giggled at her personal intro.</span></div></div>",

As the two guards began to close the door, Celestia noticed another sphere heading her way. This one was larger then the guards by quite a bit. The sphere had a waxy sheen that Celestia couldn't help but feel she knew from somewhere. She would occasionally see hair coming from where the head possibly was. It was quite a long length and seemed to curl up at the ends. Eventually the sphere stopped in front of Celestia, who stared at the face in shock. The skin color had changed and this new shape gave problems, but there was no denying it. \"T...Tw...Twilight?!\" Was all Celestia could stammer out. The large blue figure smiled at her former teacher. \"I'm suprised you've recognized me so quickly Celestia. I can tell you're quite suprised at least.\" \"Suprised? This.....what happened to you? You've blown up like some kind of balloon!\"\"Correction, a blueberry.\" Twilight2 sighed in happiness as she looked to herself. \"Turns out you were right Celestia, we have nothing to fear. This world is now under the rule of a group of kind queens and princesses that you might find familiar. Thier berrygirls and they encourage all under their rule to join them in their shape. I know it may seem like something one of our villians would do, but this truly is a gift. Enhanced magic, never feeling thirsty, so many positives.....\" Twilight trailed off for a moment before bringing herself back. \"Also, the berryqueens only want peace between our two kingdoms. I have their proposals in my room, but I know you'll want to speak with them yourself. Both them and the princesses are in the throne room right now.\" Celestia just looked to Twilight, still trying to process what she was seeing. Being a blueberry explained the sheen, but this still made no sense. Every fiber of her was telling her something was terribly wrong.</span></div></div>",

One by one, the royal berrygirls left their seats and went to the door. The only one left was Twilight1, who was now deep in thought of Pinkie's idea. It was good without question....but something felt missing. There was just some angle in the berry's mind that just wouldn't sit down. \"Hmmmm....Sunset did tell me about....maybe....\" Still deep in thought, Twilight rolled out of the room and to her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sweet scent of blueberries brought Twilight2 out of her slumber. With a yawn, she felt around herself and took notice of her hands. \"Right...so that wasn't a dream. That is both relieving and disturbing at the same time. With no one around her, Twilight2 now felt it was safe to vent her uncertainty about this new development. \"Okay...so this world is filled now with big...blueberry girls. I know they seem to only want peace, but I just can't get over the way some of the princesses were looking at me.\" The scent was once again caressing Twilight2's nose, calling out to her. With a deep breath, Twilight2 got out of bed and put on the blue ensemble of her average human clothes played out for her. \"I'll just stay on my hooves...err..toes. I won't let any sugar-coated speeches get the better of me. I will stay completely focused.\" Twilight2 made her way to the door and walked through it, only to be bounced back by someone already at the door. \"Oh I am so sorry.\" \"No need Twilight....\" Came a very familiar voice that made Twilight blush. Twilight looked in front of her and saw a berry figure not as large as the princesses but he seemed fairly large. His body seemed to have a mix of armor and cloth as clothing. His face though was what really sold it for our dear equestrian. \"F...fl.fl..Flash Sentry?\" The being smiled upon Twilight2 chuckled. \"Yeah...been awhile...hasn't it? Twilight2 was hesitant what she was feeling, she still remembered what had happened during the whole 'Battle of the Band' fiasco. Despite that though, she still had feelings for him and had made the assumption that the Dazzlings had something to do with his outburst. \"Our Princess Twilighthave requested that I accompanyyou while in our world. Flash rolled closer, \"All I can say is that I don't mind.\" Twilight2 blushed even more so, her mind made up over what feeling she was experiencing. She giggled as she stood beside Flash, \"Well, we better not keep them waiting. It seems they already started breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Twilight!\" Scootaloo called out as the girl came through the door. \"We're so glad you could join us for a little morning feast.\" Applebloom nodded as she gulped down a few blueberry tarts. \"Ah think yer really gonna enjoy what we have fer ya today.\" Twilight2 noticed how some on the princesses snickered and began to feel uneasy again.</span></div></div>",

Either way, once we reveal ourselves and begin the spell there will not be a single student here who won't become our blueberry subjects.</i> The two snooping girls looked to each other in fear. \"Those two want the school to be like.....them?\" Bon Bon whispered as quietly as possible. \"What is it wit this school attracting hypno-crazed evil-doers anyways?\" Bon Bon lightly slapped Lyra and pointed out, knowing they needed to get this out. \"We need Vinyl, with the usual heros seemingly involved in this, she is the only way to get the message out.\"</span></div></div>",

Applebloom had little trouble rushing ahead, blazing her own path through the hoards of fellow fair-goers. Sweetie wheezed somewhat as she struggled to maintain even footing with her more athletic friend. In spite of their differing physiques, the two found themselves reaching the grand stage in short order. A small table was set up before the staircase leading up to the main platform being manned by one of Rarity's classmates, Berry Punch. The girls spoke to Berry and transcribed their signature to ensure their participation.

At first, Berry just wanted to roll them off, but looking to the crowd just watching and enjoying this humiliation gave her a better idea. Taking a look and pretending to examine them, Berry nodded. \"Well, this certainly isn't just some stage magic. This is the real deal right here.\" Sugarcoat giggled as she prodded Sweetie slightly, \"They make the cutest sounds when they slosh their liquid, wanna see for yourself.\" \"No, in fact knowing this is real makes this so much worse to watch.\" Berry turned to the crowd with a cold glance. \"These two girls, possibly scared and confused and you are all letting these girls use them like springboards! What's worse is how you all seem to revel in the humiliation these poor berrygirls have to go through. Berry's rant was beginning to cause mixed feelings throughout the crowd, either annoyed of ashamed. It was only made worse when Berry turned to the group of girls. \"And as for you, putting these girls on stage and treating them like some sort of freak show?! You all should be ashamed of yourselves!\" The crowd began to disperse away, the wonder of it all lost in this woman's tellings. The shadow bolts were somewhat annoyed by these events but scurried off, leaving Berry and and the blueberries alone. Alone at least until AJ came running by. \"Oh thank Twilight yah'll are safe. Now let's get going and get yah all juiced and normal.\" With the truck and keys close by, the four now made their way to Sweet Apple Acres...unaware the shadow bolts were not about to let the humiliation slip by.</span></div></div>",

The light seemed to ebb ever so slightly as a new sound came in, a strange resonating sound that could have come straight from a Science Fiction film. For a few minutes the sound kept coming along with a strange fruity smell. The light began to away, though Luna debated wether or not to open her eyes. After a minute, an unfamiliar Voice spoke out of the darkness. \"Oh no...I think the poor dear is blinded.\" Curious as to who said that, Luna opened her eyes and found two beings in front of her. The one to the left had the body of a teenage female, jade hair in a bun and soft crimson eyes.  Her green skin had dark lines around it and had an oval shaped roundness around it all. The one on the right had the form of an adult around Luna's age with violet skin and blue hair in a small stem like structure. Her indigo eyes looked over Luna and nodded, her hands resting on her large stomach. \"She looks fine to me sis, I don't think we did any damge.\" The blue figure smiled at Luna before turning to the green being. \"Now let us make a proper introduction.\" The blue figure stuck her hand out and her sister did likewise. \"Hello, my name Berrona and this is my sister Meloni. We're sorry for the sudden arrival but all will be explained soon.

Already her  nose was covered in red and at that moment, Luna had no clue what to say anymore. There was still that part of her that wanted to think this was a dream but all of this was seeming just too real. Keeping her had in the mirror, Luna watched as the red began to spread to more of her face, visually filling it with....something. When the red reached her mouth, she could feel a taste beginning to manifest. As it grew with each passing second, she began to realize the taste was..\"Fruit punch? Okay...now I'm starting to think this is a dream again.\" Meloni, already becoming tired out this particular thought, was prepared to show the Luna this was no dream.</span></div></div>",

Luna shifted about, not really wanting to get up at that moment. As she moved about though, she could feel something was in her mouth. The Vice Principal slowly opened her eyes to see something she was not prepared for. In front of her was the blueberry of the two aliens from last night, with a strange tendril sliding from her top and into Luna's mouth. From there, Luna could taste a diminishing shower of blueberry juice. Needless to say, Luna flipped and floundered about at this notice while Berrona simply sent the tendril back into her own body, which seemed to now resemble a rather chubby human. \"Forgive me for my intrusion, but I thought I could stop before you woke up.\" Luna, wiping a bit of juice from her mouth, cried out. \"What in the world did you think you were doing!?\" \"I told you last night madame, my sister and I needed help staying low for awhile and as such we needed to let off some juice. Do not fear, I only put enough in you that it shouldn't cause too many physical issues. Luna looked to herself and while she couldn't see any physical difference at the moment, she knew her sleep pjs were tighter than before. \"You and your sister might enjoy this even. Now into the sub...\" \"Wait....what do you mean my sister?\" \"Oh, Meloni juiced herself into your sister. It should have the same effects. Now, we understand most humans have an occupation and from what I've seen you are a school worker. Are there any positions opened we could fulfill?\" In the same style of confusion as last night, all Luna could put out in her stunned state was a simple awsner. \"Our lunch lady had called in sick and we need a replacment...but....\" \"Wonderful! My sister and I know so much about earthling cuisine!\" As Berrona ran from the room, Luna got out of bed and held her actually large gut. \"What have I done?\"</span></div></div>",

I need to check on our little captives to see if anything happened during this little mishap, notify me when the DNA reaches 100% or juice starts coming.\" The Juicers all saluted and returned to studying their prize while Juicer Twilight headed out .</span></div></div>",

Her room still looked normal, but when she opened the window she was greeted to the sight of a bright, blue, and futuristic city.  For some reason Vice Principal Luna didn't seem to panic, it was like she was reliving a past event or something.  Her room was mostly empty of her possessions with the sole possession she had was a helmet that looked like a metallic blueberry with a clear crystal visor attached to it on her nightstand. The helment  Luna grabbed it and put it on.  With a simple telepathic command from her mind, a drone was ejected and activated a recording camera. Luna cleared her throat and began to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #1: Launch Day: Today is a proud moment for the planet of Blue-Berriea!  My sister, Captain Celestia, and I will be leading some of the Blue-Berrien Federation's greatest scientists and engineers on a mission to colonize our first extraterrestrial planet!.  This will be the greatest highlight of our careers in the Blue-Berrien Space Force keeping both the peace and diplomatic relations in the Fruictus System. To think for millennia, our spherical single gender species has developed so fast in the fields of science, culture, and prosperity, the possibility of Intergalactic travel is now but hours away. The colonization mission will be a brave undertaking since the planet my sister has chosen is outside our home galaxy, the Juicy Way.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then paused to take a look at her body, currently not a juice filled sphere, and had to address that, \u201cSpeaking of juice... I had juiced myself last night.  Just to give the ship's reactors some extra energy as a precaution. Hopefully I can inflate back to size in time for the briefing, a full round body is a sign of good faith in the mission.  Lieutenant Captain Luna out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the recording ended, a bright light forced Vice Principal Luna out of her vivid dream.  Shielding herself from the bright light with her forearm, took a look at her surroundings. She wasn\u2019t in her bedroom back home. The room Luna was in looked a large guest room, with a pair of circular beds with dark blue colors, a nightstand between the two, and a table on the far end with a pair of chairs, designed to seat something bigger than herself, and of course that bright fluorescent lighting on the ceiling which her eyes finally got adjusted to.  The aesthetic of the room was clean and metallic blue, and generally looked like something out of one of those science fiction shows on TV.  When Luna took a look to her right and she gasped when saw the planet Earth and outer space in view of the large window.  Luna ran to gate and began to pound with her two fists. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! Is anybody here? Where am I? Where are you taking me? What have you done to me?\" asked she loudly panicking. She didn\u2019t get her answer, but her voice seemed to have activated a panel nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cgreen\">Voice recognized: Welcome back to the Starship Cyanocus, Lieutenant Captain Luna.</span>.\" The panel spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant!? That doesn't make any sense! I\u2019m a Vice Principal, not some space captain.\" Luna said worryingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway slid open, leading to a hallway as the scent of blueberries emanated in the air.  As Luna wandered out into the hallway of her abductor\u2019s ship, something strange was going on in her mind. The ship looked abandoned for decades but everything was starting to look familiar for some reason the vice principal couldn\u2019t explain.  It was as if something deep within her subconscious was guiding her to something.  She started to wonder if that dream was more of a flashback.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As much as Luna thought about pushing that idea from her head, there was just this feeling of calm homeliness around her that she couldn't shake off. Luna nevertheless continued to walk along the dusty hallway as it began to slowly light up as if her very presence was giving it life. Blue and white lights streamed across the sides while dark blue lighting came from the ceiling. Taking a deep breath of the blueberry scented air around her, Luna couldn't help but ease up some of the tension she was feeling. As the confused vice principal walked by a new doorway, she had to stop and look at the design. Specifically, she noticed two insignias of the sun and moon that she and her sister had been so strangely fond off all their lives. \"What is this?\" The panel to the side of the door shot sparks as an indistinguishable voice echoed through the halls. The door slid away, creaking and squeaking to reveal a rather uncomfortable scene. Large computers lined the rounded room, some screen blank while others were showing signs of static. Metal shavings littered the floor while almost invisible burn marks coated what few tables remained. Multiple chairs, rounded and large like the ones in the bedroom were either overturned or still together  with two particularly large ones in front of a giant window showing the vast reaches of space. Luna glanced at the seat on the right and rushed over to see if she was indeed seeing what she was seeing. Lifting the object from the chair, Luna was certain it was the same helmet from that dream she had. In fact, it was almost in perfect condition save for a little dust on the visor. Without even thinking, she placed the blueberry-shaped device on her head and was soon enveloped in the colors of the visor. Two small pangs came to her head, but Luna showed no worry. The feeling of familiarity was slowly becoming greater and that only fed her curiosity to mentally request to view the previous recordings. The helmet made a ding sound before a screen popped from the device and grew to the size of a small television. To a lack of surprise, Luna saw her own self with her cheeks slightly pudgy and blurred workers behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #2: Launching the ship yesterday was a success. Within minutes we had passed through our planet's gravity pull.  Our ship has brought us right outside the Juicy Way. As I speak, the rings of planet Wato-Mela are a mere speck from the view of the cockpit. A few of our ship navigators have yet to directly find our target planet's current position but that is to be expected due to it's distance from us. Once we are in range, I will notify. Further more, our energy supplies are keeping a steady pace thanks to my extra fuel add-on. The crew, my sister and myself included just need to juice ourselves every once in awhile and we will have more than enough fuel. Nothing further to report. Lieutenant Captain Luna out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no denying in Luna's mind that, at the very least, the being certainly looked like her. However her mind just refused to believe it. So many things just didn't add up. Nevertheless, Luna found it difficult to resist looking into more of her....these diary entries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #3......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A few crew members and I questioned the captain on why she had chosen that planet for colonization.  My sister's answer was that the planet has many similarities to that of Blue-Berriea: It is capable of harboring life without the need of expensive terraforming; the planet has roughly the same rotational and orbital pattern as home, with twenty-four hours in one day and 365.27 solar days in a year; and while 71% of the planet is water, Celestia has assured everyone that there will be enough space for establishing a thriving colony. The Cyanocus is preparing for its first in a series of hyper-speed jumps which will make the voyage last as of now, 3 weeks.  I looked at the stars of my galaxy one last time.  As a young berry, I loved spending the weekend nights staring at them, and being amongst the stars was my main reason for joining the Space Force alongside my sister.  Now I'm going to be leaving them, but I know the new planet have beautiful new stars to gaze at. Lieutenant Captain Luna out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had noticed that the counterpart's skin was now a more darker blue, her hair seemed to have a dark blue neon glow to it, but most importantly, the being's belly had grown to the size of an exercise ball. She was also wear a blue and silver spandex like uniform, that had a golden badge of a blueberry with a pair of space rings around it near the bottom of uniform's neck ring and a personalized moon emblem on both shoulders. Some of the content about the entry had Luna curious, the planet that was just mentioned almost sounded like Earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #4:  We've just completed our first hyper-speed jump. We have to wait for the spatial Warp capacitor to cool down and recharge.  The Cyanocus is not designed for prolonged use of hyper-speed or else we'd risk the ship breaking apart.  We aren't in total deadlock as we still have our all engines engaged and the ship is still moving forward to the destination planet. Nothing else to report, Lieutenant Captain Luna out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next couple of diary entries after the space jump seemed to pace slowly, mostly about time spent in Cyanocus's Amenity Deck, participating in drills with the security officers, or overlooking the ship maintenance while preparing for another hyper speed jump.  The vice principal could see some of the other crew members in better clarity this time, and they started to look familiar. Luna swore some of the alien berry women resembled...  teachers at school and the other members of the Cyanocus crew were the mothers of the students attending Canterlot High.  Her mind was still hazy due to what has happened to her so she couldn't put any names to the faces at the moment. The more she studied the entries, the more a part her of mind was opening up, but Luna was still anxious and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are we really... aliens?\" She had asked her self, as she put a darkened blue arm on top of the growing bulge of her abdomen.   </span></div></div>",

Mentally, she passed over a view entries feeling like they were going to be more of the same and instead reached the last few entries left. Mentally clicking on the video file, Luna was greeted by the sight of her very blue and visibly worried counterpart in what seemed to be the guest room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #23: Sadly, the asteroid belt we had to blast through last week has indeed set us behind our suggested timetable. It certainly would have been worse had we decided to fly around it but I digress.  Furthermore, I am beginning to suspect that we are being followed. Although it is most likely a stray asteroid caught in the path of our ship upon exiting hyperspace, something on the scanners triggers The Cyanocus' protection field and we swerve off course for a moment. But it is most likely paranoia. The real importance is that the galaxy that holds our captain's target is almost seeable on the main radar. What did she call it....'The Milky Way?\" The entire crew has become excited as have my sister and I. I cannot wait to see what wonder await us on the planet's surface, what foods and spices and beauty are on that rock waiting for us to discover them? Look at me, I feel like when I received my first telescope. I need to head for the lounge and relax. Lieutenant Captain Luna out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Milky Way......the answer was becoming more and more clear to Luna as she put herself in the chair the Visor Berry was resting on. Despite this, there was still that part of her that was still questioning this. Everything she knew was coming into question and there was still no definitive answer to this. As the next video began, Luna's stomach was beginning to show through her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Entry #24: We have just exited hyperspace and the planet is now on radar! While we still have a few more days before we enter the Milky Way, our crew is now ecstatic as am I. Our technicians are preparing the scouter pods for the moment we will be able to send them to the surface and mark our landing site. My sister and I already have our personal saucer ready in the docking bay, we want to make sure the first steps on that planet's soil by our kind are documented.

For a moment it almost sounded like the ship was saying those words just now. As her mind clicked on the last entry, her body shivered and jiggled with the sounds of juice. The screen was opened to a view of Luna in her seat whizzing past metal tubing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Lieutenant Captain Luna of The Starship Cyanocus, Last Entry: Our ship has been attacked by some unknown scourge, a near ethereal force that looks like that line of equine toys sold back home yelling to go back. Whatever it was, it seemed to want us gone. Our security fought it off with no casualties, but the engines have been exhausted and the juice converter appears to be either broken or stopped. We should have enough energy to make it to something but the crew has already entered the escape pods. What little of our scanners are left indicate that the target planet is the only livable area in galactic miles so we can only hope they are heading there. My sister and I are worried as much as the rest, our pods were not built for space travel of the distance required. Noberry could even imagine the possible effects on our mental and physical states. But we have no choice. With limited space, I am afraid I must leave the Visor Berry behind to bring along more essential supplies.

The ship was losing energy and soon the lights went out, with the Blue-Berriens with only thier glowing hair as the sole source of light. As they arrived they took a look at the equipment, those beings did some irreparable damage to it, with Celestia thinking it could only be fixed that stuff of young girl's tales known as \"magic\", and a good portion of it was now space debris when they forced the attackers out of the airlocks.  She notice Luna staring at the wreckage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Her sister asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, it's just...\" Luna replied, trying to hide her tears of juice. \"We were so close, and now the effort our planet has put into is gone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Luna,\" Celestia assured, hugging (more like squishing their bellies together) her in attempt to comfort \"we'll make it through<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think those... things came from the planet?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain gave it some thought, but then shook her head answering, \"No, I don't think so. They must of followed us from that Asteroid field from when we exited hyperspace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Escape Pods were not ideal at all, looking a large blocky rectangle (her future self would of identified it as a van).  It appeared fine from the outside and didn't look too damaged.  Celestia opened the small cargo trunk and loaded whatever was left salvagable into a footlocker.  After she put that into the trunk and closed it, Celestia then got into the pilot side, while Luna entered the passenger side and she could tell space would be cramped. Their bellies already began to chaff against the furniture of the cramped cockpit, and their heads started rubbing the cockpit ceiling.  The only equiment was basic piloting, a guidence system, and no form of communication. The pods guidence system had set its coordinates to Earth and to meet up with the other evacuation pods.  The escape pod's speed was good enough to catch up to ther others, but nowhere as fast than the Cyanocus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, we can see the others!\" Captain Celestia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would be great if we could communic...\" Luna replied, before spotting something,   \"Wait a minute, what's that light? Is that a cosmic ray? We need to take evasive action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, the shields will... oh, crap! The shields aren't activating, they must of been damaged in the attack!\" Celestia yelled, recognizing they were powerless to protect themselves from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cosmic ray shined it's bright light into the vessel on to the two Blue-Berriens, and it overwhelmed them.  Luna and her sister tried to keep thier eyes closed, but instead, feeling light headed. Celestia was the first to pass out, and as Luna saw when she opened her eye, her sister's skin was changing color from a blueberry blue to a pinkish color. Luna unfortunately passed out into a coma soon after, not knowing her skin tone was changing as well, though not as radically as her sister. The glows from their hair was also vanishing. Worst, their minds also were also tampered with, making them lose their memories of their beloved home planet of Blue-Berriea.  Every escape pod from the Cyanocus was affected by the cosmic ray beam with the inhabitants suffering the same fate as thier captains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe escape pod flew towards the destination planet. It was a slow pace, and the only thing keeping the unconscious space travelers alive was their juice, slowly being drained into their bodies, losing their roundness. One and a half weeks passed and Cyanocus escape pods have reached the Earth. The pods were quickly pulled into the earth's gravity and began theier descent into planet in a spread, burning in the atomosphere in what the people of earth thought was a meteor shower in the night sky. The pods would normally extinguish after a while, but Celestia and Luna's pod had a fuel line malfunction that eject the footlocker and kept the vessel a burning fireball while crashing into the planet surface.  When Luna awoke, the vehicle she and her sister were in had crashed into a ditch in the side of the road, and was now a smoldering pile of scrap.  Two good Samaritans had gotten both Celestia and Luna out of the crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Celestia asked disoriented and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That crash must of done a number on you. We can't even find the tires to your van.\" One of the humans replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crash?\" Luna replied hazily, \"Yeah, it must of been that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest was history, Luna's human memories from that point on flashed before her eyes in quick succesion.  Any human memory before that point in time must of been artificial constructs based on her alien ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's flashback had ended. She could feel it within her as the juice started to slowly fill her legs and arms, Vice Principal Luna had finally remembered and accepted she was an alien blueberry woman known as a Blue-Berrien. She still had fear and anxiety as she realized there was now some serious implications this revelation has brought forth. A majority of an entire gender of Canterlot were secretly an extraterrestrial life. The students of Canterlot High would most certainly panic if they found out their mothers were aliens, especially the female students... who had Blue-Berrien DNA in their bodies completely dormant their whole lives.  Luna wasn't sure what was the apporiate choice of action to take, but she had the feeling this truth would soon come out one way or another.  With a mental click, Luna's Visor Berry deployed a familiar probe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Virtua Diary of Vice Prin... I mean, Lieutenant Captain Luna...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Twilight already had the result printed out and was comparing it to the DNA to her own and Sunset's results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should be human, obviously, but the identifier software we made last night is saying she's not.  I can identify similarities in Celestia's DNA in my own but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong?\" Principal Celestia asked, getting out of the two teens' machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Nope!\" SciTwi lied, not wanting to freak her principal out, \"We just need to uh... put some polish to the results and we'll be ready to present it tonight at the science fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll look forward it.  I actually enjoyed what your machine did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school bell rang, signaling class was beginning to start.  Thankfully Gym Class didn't require the actual gym today, so Sunset and Twilight were free to leave their invention where it was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, see you later.\" Sunset thanked quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two teens headed to thier classes, they agreed to meet at lunch to figure out what had happened. Principal Celestia started to head for her office.  Getting a smell of the fresh blueberry muffins from the Home Ec room,  Celestia never realized how comforting that smell was. All that magic in made her feel so refreshed like never before.  Granted she was still worried for her sister's whereabouts.  Once she entered her office, she sat down at her desk.  There wasn't any forms or paperwork to fill, so the principal had plenty of time to think about things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope Luna's okay,\" Celestia said to herself, \"It isn't like her to worry... everyberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about that last word she said confused her, she wondered why it just felt normal of her to say all of sudden.  Celestia closed her eyes to think about that, and some new instinct inside her was telling her it could lead to finding Luna.</span></div></div>",

Instead she now sat at the high quality desk fit for one of the best captains in the Blue-Berrien Space Force. Celestia showed no signs of worry towards her now huge, rounded belly and blue complextion. After all, it was only natural for her. A small drone dropped from an opening the celing, stopping at the foot of the desk and opening to show the face of someone Celestia strangely couldn't recognize. \"Captain Celestia. As you are aware, you and your sister are highly decorated leaders for our forces and few other Blue-Berriens have managed to match your skills in bringing a ship out and home. Sure there were a few times we were jiggling in our juices but you two truley are the best. With that being said, you both should understand that this is a mission unlike anything taken before you. This planet rests far beyond the reaches of the Juicy Way and therefore will be highly unpredictable. We have understood and excepted your coordincoordinates ate and the planet does seem capable of sustaining other life. If that will be so, they will no doubt be of a primitive species. Why, they might actually believe that magic exists...\" Celestia rolled her eyes jokingly, such a ridiculous notion. \"Nevertheless, the key to a peaceful and simple colonization will rely on how well we can attract the natives to our ways. Now if anyberry is to have a chance to teach the inhabitants our ways, they must be prepared with all of the information they can contain. We are all aware you two graduated with top honors from Brightwell University but it is better to patch the bucket before juice spills. \"And so, we have prepared a small presentation for you to show to the natives. You'll be able to access this anytime on the ship when we install it into the system. Please inform us if you have anything to add to it.\" The screen faded to black for a moment before changing colors and shapes to resemble a retention swirl. Celestia herself often used these to study for exams back at the university. As Celestia began to stare into the floating spiral,a calming voice began to speak. \"A quick announcement before I begin, this is not meant as a communication screen. If you are a ship worker, please recall the teleportation code for your ship. Just punch it into a transponder and an person aboard your ship will bring you up shortly.......\"</span></div></div>",

Something has to be clogging the circuits or...artggh!\" Sunset! \"Thr purple girl turned her head to her partner, who currently had her head stuck in an open panel on the machine's backside. \"How is everything over there?\" \"The calibration isn't off on the scanner, the energy levels are stable, and every bit of hardware is in perfect working order.\" \"But that still doesn't explain this!

There must some issue with the software we're not seeing.\" Sunset pulled her head from the panel, slamming it shut and turning to her friend. \"Okay...let's see if we can think of some other way this could happen.....\" The gym fell silent as Sunset walked about, leaving SciTwi to continue her self rambling. \"Okay...so we've tested this on ourselves right?\" \"Yes.\" \"Now when I tested it, the machine showed not only my human DNA but my pony self as well right?\" \"Correct...where is this going?\" \"I'm getting to it, now you said that there was some kind of similarity between your readout and Celestia's.\" \"Probably just the human components we share.\" \"Exactly! Maybe there's something in your DNA that just threw the sensor a curve. I mean Celestia isn't magically enhanced like you or I so maybe the sensors flipped when they couldn't find it. We'll just dig through the readout and link the similarity and the computer should adapt.\" SciTwi smiled at the thought of getting this headache over with and pulled her printout from her pack. As the terminal accepted the copy, SciTwi put her finger to the board. \"Just need to have the machine cross reference the two scans, searching and isolating all forms of the similarity....okay...now to process the full scan and we should get......\" \"Sunset chuckled to herself, it always was amusing whenever this girl got into 'the zone' like this. Probably similar to the Equestrian twilight as well. \"What....th...Sunset...come have a look at this....\" The two girls stared at the monitor, curious at what thru were seeing. It was a similar setup to Sunset's readout with having two different strands but now instead of the multicolored lines of pony dna, the girls were looking into fractured codes, pieces of foreign DNA being scrambled up and fitting into the human strand like a jigsaw. \"What are we looking at exactly Twi?\" As if to awsner her question, the machine slowly printed out a new sheet of paper. Bringing it to her face, Twilight read aloud. \"Twilight Sparkle. Main DNA: Human, Untapped DNA:....Blueberry Alien....\" \"Untapped? What's that mean? It's the computers word for dormant.....call one of the girls over. We may need a little more testing....and tell them to bring some blueberries....I want to see how accurate this really is.....\" \"You think we should inform Celestia?\" \"No....we aren't certain about anything yet.

Luna had finished her growth was now a proper shape, a round blueberry with her head, hands, and feet sticking out.  Both of them changed out of their earth clothes and back into their officers' uniforms. Celestia's outfit was blue and silver like her sister's, but the captain's Blue-Berrien clothes had sun emblems instead of moon emblems.

We have answered your distress signal but The Blue-Berrien Federation has befell crisis of its own. One that has resulted in the large displacement of our people.

If you are watching this, then our probes have succesfully contracted the ship and have sent a retriever ship to summon you.

In fact most of them had kids.  However just juicing themselves and act like nothing happened was offically out of the question, because soon Earth will be having its first contract with alien life.  <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You want the truth to come out don't you?\" Celestia asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as you do captain,\" Luna answered, \"but we can't just waltz down and announce we and a majority of Canterlot's females are aliens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True Lieutentant, if anyone found people they've grown up with are aliens they would freak...

Hopefully some adult wisdom will help us figure out what to do next.\" \"Where is Celestia anyway? None of us have seen her or Luna at all today.\" While the girls continued thier conversation, Applejack looked to herself. \"A blueberry alien....ah never knew.....but...ah can't help but feel it's true.....</span></div></div>",

The girls (with SciTwi still in possession of the tablet)  went back to Canterlot High with the exception of Rainbow Dash.  Rainbow had the photograph with her when she came home, but she never got a good look at it.  The first thing Rainbow did was take a quick shower to clean herself.  Sunset Shimmer had caught up to her when gym class was finishing up and asked to come to the gym immediately, preventing RD from cleaning her after an intense track session.  Rainbow brought some extra clothes with into the bathroom and she changed into them when she got out of the shower.

Be on the lookout for any Blue-Berriens awakening.  Because of Twilight and Sunset's machine,  I have a feeling a mass awakening of Blue-Berriens crew will happen tonight.  And... you are going to have to be the one that reveal the presence of the Blue-Berriens.

When Luna approaches the entrance, she saw Windy Whistles, Rainbow's mother, was at the entrance. Her skin complexion bluer than normal, and sporting a growing belly.

Having found the visor berry and a separate version of her mother's research notes, Applejack couldn't stop herself from pouring over the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>....integrating into the family itself was rather easy.  While the very act of hiding my true colors and nature from most of the town was difficult, repeated exposure to a very specific sequence of my DNA through modified aromatherapy candles created an accepting effect from this family itself. They said they would only let me stay for a few days to repay the damages my crashed 'car' caused, but within a week I was the daughter they never realized they had. I knew they would fall for it, the family seemed so large that it would be easy for members to be forgotten. Even now, I cannot deny the guilt of dishonesty sickens me but there really was no other choice. Most of other crew members have either vanished right out of existence or were messed up mentally that they can't even remember who they are. I was heart broken when my daughter Applejack came in and told me about her new principal and vice principal. The greatest commanders of the Blueberrien Space Force reduced to school leaders, so unbecoming. Speaking of my children, I find it rather curious how they do not appear to show any signs of their Blueberrien heritage. I suppose it must be because I had spent so many years repressing mine. I had taken a small sample from each of them while they were sleeping and thankfully found there was still some form of my DNA inside them, but how to let it out I have no idea. Especially from Macintosh, a male Blueberrien is almost unheard of. My biggest fear however is what the public will do to them or me if the secret ever gets out of hand. These humans, even with their cultures being more intelligent than first expected, are still vastly primitive when compared to my glorious home planet. Even worse, they seem to fight amongst one another daily purely being of differences in appearance. I pray that someday this from of issue will be lessened long enough for our kin to be accepted, but I fear it is only a prayer. While again the very idea of dishonesty and lying go against all my moral standings, it would seem I must be given no choice. For the past few days, I have been developing a <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">weapon</span> <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">gun</span> device with the rather simple materials found around my family's farm plus some scrap I kept from my old escape pod. It will blast out a smoke similar to the aromatherapy candles I used once before, but this time a more concentrated and pressurized gas. While testing is yet to be completed, it's initial purpose is planned to be to put the humans into a dazed state and making them susceptible to the words of Blueberriens. Plus, there may be the chance that exposure to their native DNA will reform my former crewmates back to their true forms. If any of my old crewmates or more likely my family are reading this in the event of my continued absence or worse, my lab is in the cellar under the boxes near where you found my trunk. If it is indeed my family, please understand that I was afraid of what would become of me would the truth ever be revealed. If you think less me, I will not blame you and instead blame myself. All I ask is that you do what you believe is right for yourself, your family and your kind....whichever side of you that you decide.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStaying silent but her eyes showing fear all thier own, Applejack ran down into the cellar. It didn't take her long to find the boxes, sure enough one of them was hiding a secret panel with a button behind it. One press was all it took and a large section of the cellar walls opened up to a blue corridor. \"Mah.....\" As the country teen walked through the fruity scented hallways, her mind began thinking over every secnario should the truth be revealed. Sure maybe the school would be fine considering the constant magic events happening but wht about the rest of the town? Once word of the incident at the theater got out, the place was closed down for a serious investigation. Guys in dark coats and bullet proof vests, all carrying heavy looking weapons.....there was no way any peace was going to be hand under any circumstances. The metal doors slid open, revealing a small lab that would make SciTwi blush in suprise. In the center, sitting in a glass case, was a large canister connected to several large nozzles almost like a bug sprayer. As AJ stepped towards her mother's work, she began to shake. There was no way lying was going to get her and the girls out of the current situation they were in, and it seemed like the truth by itself wasn't going to hurt any less. She opened up the case and put her hand on the central nozzle, gripping the trigger as she pulled it slowly to her face. The uncertainty of the situation was finally reaching her....AJ had to make a choice.........<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n......<br>\r\n......a small click sounded as she squeezed the trigger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The farmgirl inhaled as much of it as she could through her nostrils and mouth.  Afterwards, AJ wiped the dust off a nearby mirror.  In her reflection, Applejack could see her face quickly becoming a blueberry-like shade of blue and was starting to spread to her neck and down to the rest of her body.  She smiled as the color just felt right.  She then felt her body begin production of juice as her stomach began growing, pushing her abdomen outward.  AJ felt what she guess was juice her mom mentioned in her paper was beginning to fill her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Applejack then noticed some round clothing, blue and silver and figured it must be what mom wore when she came to Earth.  The alien hybrid went behind one of the canister to change.   She took off her country attire and changed into the space spandex.  The suit fit Applejack like a glove despite the teen\u2019s stomach blowing up to bigger than a beach ball and still growing.  Applejack was able to strap the blueberry device on to her back, wrist, and her bulging waistline.  Lastly, AJ took her Stetson off briefly, and put the Visor Berry on.  The alien helmet briefly sent a pang into her skull but the pain only lasted for a hundredth of a second.  Applejack could tell her arms and legs were beginning to fill up as she put her hat back on top of the visor berry.  AJ took another look at her reflection, and developed the feeling her mother would of been proud of her.  She knew what had to next: the truth will come out tonight, and the world would know about the existence of the Blue-berriens.  Applejack then turned around but saw her younger sister Apple Bloom at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cApplejack!? What goin\u2019 on?

Applejack sighed, realizing she was going to have to explain everything to Applebloom. Setting thier mother's work down, Applejack told  her sister everything she knew about this situation. Everything from the principals disappearing to the DNA machine to finding moms trunk and finally to this. As AN would have guessed, Applebloom found it a little hard to believe, questioning it only a moment or two and holding her breath once to see if she was dreaming. \"...and ah found this all here. Sis this stuff has been here get longer than any of us realize and ah...ah just wanted to let the truth out fer me. Now ah know her gonna think differently about a lot of things but I can assure Yah'll of this: alien, human or whatever, our mama loved all her children the same. An yer still mah sister, that don't change fee nothin. However ah can think of pleanty of folks that are gonna freak out once this truth gets out. \" Applebloom looked to her billowing sister and closed her eyes, seemingly think over what to say. \"Applejack....all may life ah wanted to be like our mom...at least what ah thought was her. With only stories from granny about her, ah needed someone to follow physically. From everything ah'd learned, ah guess ah always followed you and her probably the most honest person a ever met. If Yah'll say this is our fate then ah believe yah...\" Applebloom stood straight and held her face out. \"....give me the gas Sis, ah'm ready to be what mah momma wanted me to be. \"Applejack could help but smile at the trusting loyalty of her sister as she picked up the gasser and shot a big puff into Applblooms face. Already the visor berry was picking up the blueberrien DNA within Applebloom overshadowing her human DNA. From all of the commotion, a small buzzing came from Applejack's discarded pants. \"Mah phone!\" Applejack saddled over to her phone and opened it up to see Fluttershy was calling her....for the tenth time. As AJ loomed to her arms however, there was no telling how long she was able to hold the phone. Sensing this delema, the visor berry took to work scanning the 'primitive' device and quickly added the connection to its list. AJ sighed as she mentally awsnered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Applejack! Thank everything you've picked up! What have you been doing all this time? I've been...Pinkie!\" \"Sorry Flutters, this has got to be fast. AJ, whatever you think you're doing stop doing it and get ice here right now. Flutters and I are at the school and trouble is beginning to really brew up here. Luna is here and she's spreading some chemical through the school that's turning the faculty blue. We've followed them to Luna's office....which is a lot bigger than I remember I could swear this was smaller. Anyways thier having some kind of meeting here and Rainbow's mother is a blueberry now so just get over here!\" Applejack couldn't get a word in as the connection gave out. All this moment did was simply reinforce her fears. If even her friends, who based so much on friendship could be afraid, then the commoner was going to be even worse. \"Applebloom, ah think there's a spare suit in here somewhere. We've got a science fair to hit.\"</span></div></div>",

The only two aliens they could see were Luna and Cheerilee, but Pinkie's senses told her there were more. Luna looked normal at first glance except the outfit she was wearing, but Cheerilee was blue, wearing the same outfit as Luna, and her belly was growing larger and her arms and legs were becoming thicker. The two teens could see large monitors all over the room and a large table containing a 3D topographical map of Canterlot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Captain madam, Comm systems are established.  Our network is officially connected to the Science Fair.\" Cheerilee said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good send our first transmission to the ship.\"  Luna ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mam.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nCheerliee pressed a few a buttons on the keyboards to the left and right of her, and seconds later a large, round, Blueberry Celestia was on the main monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Lieutenant Captain Luna,  I take it progress has been rolling smoothly?\"  She said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed captain, We've established the Blue-Berrien colonial office here in the high school, and the factuly has been awakened. I've just received word that Windy Whistles has also awoken some of the mothers outside the high school. We're all set to annouce everything to the people of Earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent work lieutenant,\"  Celestia, flapping her hands as a sign of approval for short, \"There is one more thing however, we need to conscript the girls. Thier magic will be vital in bringing order and stability to the colony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I understand Captain. Lieutenant Captain Luna signing off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, Fluttershy, and Pinkie all knew which seven girls Celestia was referring to, and the latter fled to warn the other girls.  Fluttershy tried to flee as well but ended up tripping.  The timid teen wasn't hurt as she landed on her hands, but Flutters ended up overhearing something Luna was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Canterlot's infrastructure is far too primitive,\" Luna said \"But with Blue-Berrien urban planning, we'll more than enough efficent space and housing for the Blue-Berriens who have lost their homes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lost their homes?\" Fluttershy asked herself, wondering if things weren't as clear as she thought they were.

Chances were that the girls were over at the DNA reader in the gym, or at the very least somewhere nearby. As she wandered the silent halls, the teen couldn't help but think about what she had overheard from Luna. What had she meant when she said that those Blue-Berriens had lost their homes? If the readouts from Twilight and Sunset's machine were anything to go by, then it seemed those blue aliens had made a home here for quite awhile. But then again it was becoming very clear to Fluttershy that she didn't understand the whole story. What little she did know however was enough to create a small feeling of sympathy for the creatures. If they had indeed lost their homes than maybe there were just trying to establish a new one here on Earth. Although more interested in Biology, Fluttershy could recall several horrible atrocities of history that had resulted in the displacement of entire peoples and even worse that came when others didn't raise a finger to help them. \"They must be afraid of that inactivity,\" Fluttershy thought as her already slow speed began to slow down, \"Thats why they're using these creept tactics.....\" It was also rather hard for Fluttershy to forget that she was one of those aliens if only by DNA alone, and her mother as well. That last fact especially hit hard for Fluttershy as this inadvertently meant that by denying the Blue-Berriens, she was denying herself and her family.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna opened the door with a crooked smirk, having seen Fluttershy's approach. \"Why Miss Fluttershy, what a suprise to see you.\" Fluttershy stood tall with clenched fists as she stared ahead into the eyes of the alien woman she had known for so long as human. \"Vice Principal Luna, I want to talk with you to better understand what is happening.\" Luna stepped aside invitingly, though not without a loss on her smirk. \"Come on in Miss Fluttershy, but please either call me Leuteniant Captian Luna or just Luna.\" Fluttershy stepped inside, seeing Cheerliee and so many other female members of the school staff walk, wobble and even slightly roll about the office. A few of the monitors previously noted seemed to show various areas of the schools, with two larger screen focusing on the gym/science fair. \"So, Fluttershy, you wish to join our cause to prepare this school and furthermore the town for the coming of our species?\" Fluttershy turned to Luna, who was walking over to a chair by the table holding the map of Canterlot. \"Sit down dear, you seem rather tense.\" Fluttershy could feel all of the eyes in the room fall on her for seconds at a time as she sat down, Luna never giving up her smirk. \"Luna, we need to talk about...well.....maybe....there must be a better way to announce all of this to the world than just this....I mean.....\" Luna quickly replaced her smirk with a near motherly smile, taking in a deep breath. \"It's alright Fluttershy, take your time.\" \"Well.....this is just all so sudden. And...I know I heard something about your peole being misplaced and....\" \"....don't forget Miss, you're a Blueberrien yourself.\" \"Well.....I've only found DNA connection recently and....you either knew all along or just found out yourself.....\" Luna sighed, \"Miss Shy, our people are in the process of a mass exodus and this planet is the only planet we could find that has the requirments for us to live here. And yes we are rushing things slightly, but surely you must understand the fear one can feel for being different. You and those seven magical friends of yours. Just think of all the fear and distrust our sudden apperance will cause. That is why you and your friends especially must help everyone see we are worthy of trust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Typing the commands into the nearest monitors, Luna knew the signal was bouncing towards the Cyanocus and back into as many communication networks as possible. On the non-security monitors whatever channel they were on were replaced by Luna's stern face and glowing hair. Taking one deep breath, Luna began her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreetings people of Earth. I am sorry to interrupt whatever you were enjoying but this is a message of dire importance to all of us. My name is Lieutenant Captian Luna of the Blue-Berrien Space Force, for those who are unaware, I am indeed an alien. At this moment, my people have been forcibly ousted from our home and we are in desperate need for a new planet to live on. Your planet is seemingly the only one capable of sustaining our kind for untold lengths of space. I can understand that this is sudden, but you must understand that we are at a desperate point in our kind' s time. There is no need to panic, we are a peaceful people and only wish to coexist without causing harm. There will be fear we understand but we can hope that our two people can easily learn to be together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna nodded to those who had taken control of the signal, indicating it was time for the personal message towards Canterlot itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo those living in Canterlot, this message is especially towards you. As the truth is coming out, I am afraid I cannot put this off any longer. Several years ago one of the best ships in the Blueberrien Federation at the time,  the Starship Cyanocus, suffered a heavy attack. It's crew was forced to abandon it, taking escape pods towards the only planet capable of sustaining us. In the process of coming here, a cosmic ray hit the pods causing an unusual reaction to our alien bodies. We had begun to morph and devolve into a more earthly form, with our memories of our true lives all but gone. These surviors, along with myself and mys sister Captian Celestia, easily integrated into your society and have spent the past years among you unaware of the truth. It is only though a chance entering onto the ship and the work of some of Canterlot High's brightest students that we have realized who and what we are. We would apologize for the deceit if it was intentional. This will not be the last time I make such announcment to you as I will be reviewing our society as the first of many ships of refugees come to Earth, starting with here. That is all for now.\" As the monitors turned back to what they were before, Luna slumped down into the nearest chair. \"That was wonderful Luna.\" One of the office workers stated, not that Luna could see who. \"I do hope the people understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom high above in the Cyanocus, the alien Captian chuckled causing her round body to jiggle. \"Brilliant sister, not the greatest of speeches but doable. The humans will learn more of thier ever approaching intellectual  superiors soon enough.\"</span></div></div>",

The two of them were in the truckbed, and AJ was using the visor berry to command the vehicle telepathically, since trying to drive conventionally would have put the two blueberries in a cramped spot.  When the truck came to a stop, Apple Bloom was the first to roll herself off the truck, and then Applejack followed suit, carrying her mother's invention in her hands.  Not too long ago, Applejack had heard of Luna's announcement through the visor berry, but she knew there would be panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Apple Bloom,\u201d Applejack said, \u201cAh'm gonna go talk to mah friends, why doncha find Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo, and tell 'em everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Sis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0AJ activated a feature on her mother's invention.  The Blueberry Gasser split itself into two with one half staying with Applejack, and the other half ejected and attached itself to Applebloom's body, with canister on her back and two grips found their way into her hands.  The two Blue-Berriens then split up.  Applejack herself wobbled forward towards the high school as she guessed her friends were all inside.  She was correct in that assumption, in fact the five of them were at the high school.  It was because the Blue-Berriens had the doors sent into lockdown when Luna had made her speech. Inside, students were panicking at the reveal with comments ranging from \u201cThis is too far out.\u201d to \u201cMy mom\u2019s an alien?!\u201d and \u201cTrixie doesn\u2019t want to be a want to be a blueberry.\u201d.

Did\u2026 you change your hair Applejack?\u201d Sunset asked, nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa\u2019ll wonderin why ah\u2019m like this?\u201d Applejack answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Rainbow replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll just not and said we-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe farmgirl just cut her off, \u201cWe can\u2019t just hide the truth.

Just think about it, the government is gonna barge in here, put everything in lockdown, and take everyone in chains.  We havta show solidarity.\"  The conversation ended right then and there as Applejack pulled the trigger on the gasser, blasting\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She knew that if there was anyone who could stop what she and whatever else her fellow Blue-Berrians were going to do, it was going to be the duo that was now slouching and coughing with the blue mist around them. With the trigger still pulled on the gasser, AJ continued the spray of blueberry gas until her targets were almost obscured. The sounds of the two girls breathing were soon all that there was to prove they were there as Applejack turned to RD, Rarity and Pinkie. The trio glanced to one another with worried faces as they realized AJ was really serious about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden burst of energy, Rainbow rushed to the big alien and slammed into her rotund body, causing her to spin about. With the Gasser on her back however, she was still keeping upright, seeing no other course of action, Rainbow shouted out \"SCATTER!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity and Pinkie wasted no time in following Rainbow's orders and the three girls ran off in different directions through the parking lot. Before AJ could reorient herself, they had all vanished with the Visor Berry  showing faint footrails and nothing more. \"Yah'll just don't get it, do ya?!\" AJ shouted towards the cowards. \"Well, when the suits and government of this planet come to make yah 'vanish' don't say ah didn't try to give yah a chance yah cowards!\" For a moment, Applejack stopped herself as a sudden pain in what was once her chest became clear. Her friends, she just called her best friends cowards. AJ could feel tears beginning to form up before shaking her head. \"No....it's like ma said. Folks just ain't gonna understand, ah guess that stems to even mah own kind. That's why ah gotta make em' understand.\" Applejack turned towards the open town and snorted before turning back to the dissipating cloud of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scene had been going on, Twilight had been trying to hold her breath against the cloud. But it was no use, Applejack's suprise attack had given her enough of a wiff. A prickling feeling crawled through the nerd as she could feel the DNA within her unlocking and replicating itself. Already, Twilight could see the color of her skin beginning to meld with the dark blue of the cloud surround her. Trying to keep it out of her mind, she waved her arms about in an attempt to find her fellow victim. \"Sunset?\" Twilight called out inbetween coughs, \"Where are you?\" Twilight could hear coughing coming from her right, as well as a sloshing sound beginning to echo from within her body. She could alreaday feel her abdomen pushing and some weight being placed into her limbs. \"AJ....please!\" Sunset's voice! But, something was wrong. It sounded strange, slightly monotone. What was even happening to her anyways? Sunset didn't have any of the alien DNA inside her, so why was the gas being sprayed at her? Twilight's vision began to spin, the amount of force and pressure being put into her head coming closer and closer to the edge. Before Twilight could say anything more, she began to black out, feeling a bouncy pressure keeping her from hitting the ground as she fell over.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin had already turned back to the way it was and her body had begun swelling with juice. She also appeared to be in the teacher's lounge with the some of the awoken staff members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight Velvet.\u201d Luna said contacting her through the visor berry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Lieutenant?\u201d Twilight Velvet responded immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour daughter's Blue-Berrian DNA has awoken thanks to Buttercup\u2019s daughter using the invention she had created and is in the school parking lot.\u201d Luna stated. \u201cI want you to help Applejack bring her and Sunset Shimmer into the school where it's safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lieutenant.\u201d Twilight Velvet replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlso I want you to stay your daughter when she regains consciousness.\u201d Luna added. \u201cI can only imagine that when she was up, she will be rather shocked by her new appearance and it would best if her mother was there for emotional support.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Twilight Velvet replied with a slightly nervous tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Luna ended the transmission and then pressed a different button on the visor berry and this time Windy Whistles appeared on her screen and noticed that her belly was even bigger than it was when they previously met and noticed that she was outside of Pinkie Pie\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWindy Whistles.\u201d Luna said using the visor berry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Lieutenant?\u201d Windy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGather Cloudy Quartz and Betty Bouffant (or cookie crumbles depends on which name you would like to call her) you three need to find your daughters for a little mother-daughter talk\u201d Luna stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight away.\u201d Windy said with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Luna ended the transmission and began to sigh with nervousness as she noticed that her body was beginning to fill with juice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow where did Applebloom wander off to?\u201d Luna said curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna then looked at the monitors on her desk and saw that Applebloom was heading toward the soccer field where Scootaloo and Sweetie Belle were. Apparently before the science fair got started ,Scootaloo wanted to show off a new scooter trick she learned and wanted to show to Sweetie Belle. Scootaloo was going to text Applebloom as well but when the Blue-berrian madness started the two girls went under the bleachers and used them as a hiding spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think Vice-Principal Luna\u2019s announcement about blueberry aliens was real or was it just one big elaborate joke?\u201d Sweetie Belle asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Sweetie Belle she seemed pretty serious to me.\u201d Scootaloo replied anxiously. \u201cAlso Luna has not been know to be the joking type.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe blueberry aliens are real alright girls.\u201d Said a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo then came out from under the bleachers and saw a giant blueberry with a familiar looking face was approaching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApplebloom!?\u201d The two girls said simultaneously shocked at what they were seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep, its me.\u201d Applebloom replied calmly. \u201cNow before you two ask about the device that is attached to my back, I just want to talk things out so that we are all on the same page.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSweetie Belle and Scootaloo glance at each other looking a bit nervous about everything that is going on and they decide to...</span></div></div>",

While things have not escalated to full blown riots, Pinkie could see the panic and confusion in the expression from the citizens because just like them, she has know idea what will happen next. Just then Pinkie felt her hair vibrating and pulled out her cell phone from her hair to see that it was Rainbow Dash texting her and Rarity in a group chat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash: Are you guys okay? Where are you currently at, I\u2019m by the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity: I\u2019m okay and I'm by the amphitheatre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie: I\u2019m on the roof of the Sweet Shoppe and fine for now.

We really messed up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie: Wait a minute if I have Blue-berrian DNA within me, then that means my sisters must have it within them too I gotta get a hold of them before it's too late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash: Okay we\u2019ll rendezvous by Sunset Shimmer\u2019s apartment and figure out our next plan of action, be careful out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity: Same to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie Pie: Ditto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the text chat ended which left Pinkie Pie alone with her thoughts\u2026 for about fifty seconds.

Uh\u2026\u201d Pinkie answered sheepishly, trying to protect her friends, but when Maud gave another glare to her, she quickly squealed, \u201cWe were going to be meeting up at Sunset\u2019s apartment and possibly skip town!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRarity is going to be running away!?\u201d Cookie Crumbles said, motherly fear in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainbow Dash would never run away!... but\u2026\u201d Windy Whistle said, having the same fear but quickly resolved into courage, \u201cCome on! All aboard everyberry! We got some daughters to rescue!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie Crumbles and the Pie family entered the aeroconvoy. Once the entry hatched closed, the aeroconvoy hovered off, its destination was Sunset\u2019s apartment. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rainbow pinched the blinds back, having seen all she needed to from the outside world. Having gotten to Sunset's apartment first, she had self-appointed herself the lookout, keeping her eyes open for Rarity or Pinkie along with whatever those blueberry aliens back at the school were doing to chase them down. Pulling herself away from the closed window and  onto the recliner against the wall, the athlte tried to make sense of the scenery going on outside. Offhand, it seemed that not a lot of people actually believed the broadcast, what few words she heard in her rush over here led her to think they believed it was a simple play or trailer for some homebrewed television the high school was making. Loyal as she may have been, the teen couldn't bring herself to ruin their fantasy and hopes. Besides, a few people seemed to buy it as a few of the shops and houses seemed to be shut down and locked up tight. Rainbow glanced abut the room, trying to take her mind off the situation. Her eyes ran across the somewhat humble decorations and furniture of the apartment, nothing new but nothing really dirt worthless. Upon a coffee table being balanced by an old encyclopedia, Rainbow's eyes fell onto a picture of the group and sighed. This whole blueberry alien crisis was tearing the group of friends apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow had no time to think further as a loud banging echoed from the door, causing Rainbow to flip the chair in fear. \"Uhh, housekeeping is already in here.\" \"Rainbow Dash you open up this door right this minute! This is no time for one of your jokes!\" \"Rarity!\" Rainbow rushed to the door, hissing through her teeth as she pulled the fashionista inside. \"Don't scare me like that. I thought you were one of those blueberry freaks!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freaks! Have you already forgotten that our friends and technically us are among those 'freaks?\" Rainbow facepalmed in realization of Rarity's retort. \"Sorry, I'm just freaking out right now. Here we are hiding out and preparing to ditch town while aliens are invading and controlling everyone in the school and town. I'm trying not to loose my cool here.\" Rainbow pushed against the chair, setting it back up before looking back in Rarity's direction. \"Do you know where Pinkie is? Was she behind you or something?\" \"Darling, if Pinkie was alongside me or behind me, she would gave been first through the door. Besides, the sweet shop is practically on the other side of town.\" \"Never stopped her before.\" Rainbow said as she rushed about. \"She should be here by now regarding her ability to appear at the most unusual of places.\" Rainbow's body began to tense up as her irises shrunk down. \"You don't think...she couldn't have...\" Rarity shook her head. \"Considering our parents are involved with this in one way or another, I don't know. Pinkie always was touchy with her family.\" \"I'm touchy Rarity, Pinkie loves them as much as Applejack would. And y that logic maybe she's given herself up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity watched in amazement as the normally cool and collected athlete broke down the way she was. She had to admit that Pinkie was often weak willed on subjects like family, but the way Rainbow was carrying on was so unlike her. Clearly the stress was beginning to get to the poor dear. \"Never the less Rainbow, we have to wait for her. She would have done the same for us!\" \"I know, but what if she...\" \"Look, Pinkie has a good idea where we'll be going anyways. I say we wait a few minutes more and if she doesn't show up, we run and hope for the best.\" Rainbow nodded, rocking back and forth as the idea set in.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash was still near window, prepping their emergency exit and looking for any sign of Pinkie Pie.   \u201cPinkie!  Where are you!?\u201d Rainbow quietly groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t answering her phone!\u201d Rarity said, giving her missing friend the fifth voice message in the last hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the Aeroconvoy, Pinkie\u2019s phone was going off.  Pinkie could guess that her friends were trying to reach her but couldn\u2019t tell due her belly obstructing her view. Unfortunately, she was leading the Blue-Berriens straight to the apartment and they were awfully close.  When the blue inflating teen caught sight of said apartment, she pointed to it \u201cAlright, they\u2019re in that building!\u201d She said.\t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCopy that.\u201d Windy Whistles replied, her bravado she once had beginning to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinkie noticed the moms seem anxious about their daughters running away. She guess that was to be expected, alien or not. Pinkie tried to say something to break the tension, but her mother beat her to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Cloudy Quartz assured, sensing her fellow Blue-Berriens' anxiety, \u201cThe sooner we act, the less likely they will be able to run off and risk getting captured.  My family and I will form a security perimeter and get control established; you two go talk to your daughters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie Crumbles and Windy Whistles both nodded, leaning their round bodies forward slightly while Maude and Marble placed the Blue-Berrien mothers\u2019 visor berries on their heads.  When the Aeroconvoy touched down a few blocks down the road, the two aliens rolled up to Sunset's apartment building while Cloudy Quartz and her daughters got outside to establish Blue-Berrien order.  Opening the front door and getting inside was obviously difficult for aliens shaped like large blueberries but the two of them managed.  The hallway was tight but had enough space for the two to not smush each other.  Rarity\u2019s mother mentally commanded her visor berry to activate an X-Ray visor to locate their daughters within the apartment complex.  \"The scanner's results says are above us,\" she said, \"and I don\u2019t think these Earth stairs were built for us in our current mass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d Rainbow\u2019s mom replied, \u201cWe\u2019ll take the elevator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWindy Whistles turned her berry visor towards the apartments\u2019 elevators.   Much like with Applejack\u2019s phone, the berry visor scanned the elevator and the Blue-Berrien pilot had the system under her control.  Without pressing a button, she had both elevators summon the cars down to their level.  Cookie Crumbles and Windy Whistles both waddled into each car. Once the women got inside carefully, the elevator doors closed, and the elevator went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*A few seconds later*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Sloosh! Sloosh! Sloosh!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that!?\u201d Rainbow Dash gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounded like it came from\u2026\" Rarity answered, quickly panicking when she realized, \"oh no\u2026 the hallway!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRarity gulped and summoned her courage to investigate the peephole. In the field of vision, the fashionista saw two blueberry women in space suits, wearing blueberry shaped helmets, and by just looking at their faces, she easily identified both of them as her mother and Rainbow Dash\u2019s mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainbow!\" Rarity yelled in terror, \"They\u2019re here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRarity!\u201d her mother answered, \u201cWe just want to talk honey!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Rarity blinked and blinked, her right hand reaching her left arm and pinching at the skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...yeow...still in the apartment.\" Her hands continued to move up her arm, but still the nightmare continued. \"Rainbow, please tell me you have some sort of plan. Our mothers combined seemed to fill up the entire hallway. Busting through the door certainly isn't an option.\" Glancing back, Rarity saw that her friend was still sitting beside the upturned chair biting away at her nails. \"Rainbow Dash!\" Rarity hissed, \"Get ahold of yourself and check out the window to see what kind of use the fire escape is in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been years since Rainbow had felt her heart through her chest the way she had now. Maybe it was during Sunset's 'undesirable' years or after, but all Rainbow knew was that, as she slowly slunk back towards the window, it was in fear. Moving her hands to the blinds, Rainbow uncovered then to find a very unwelcome sight. A tubular vehicle she could only describe as a Subway train was blocking the alleyway and an even worse sight was Pinkie standing outside the thing and almost completely blowing up into a Blue-berrien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we know what happened to Pinkie now.\" Rarity didn't bother to guess what Rainbow meant, sighing as she continued to back away. Down to two and with the bold of them becoming more afriad then she had any right to be. And it didn't help that a half sloshing, half knocking sound was coming from the door. \"Girls, please open up. We're your mother's. Can't you trust us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rainbow, is Pinkie... sufficiently rounded shall we say?\" \"Pretty much a big ball of blue.\" Before Rainbow could even ask her own question, Rarity rushed towards the window and opened it up. The thin scent of blueberries, reminding them of thier adversaries below and elsewhere. Rainbow, quickly catching onto what Rarity was doing, took a deep breath in an attempt to regain her composure. \"We can't take our things if we do this.\" \"As much as I will hate myself for saying this, I don't need it.\" The door handle (along with the door itself) jiggled about, a clarification sign the Blue-berrien parent we're ready to come in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a running start, the two girls jumped out of the window just in time for the door behind them to give out. The two aimed themselves right for Pinkie's body and slammed against it. (Thankfully neither had cleats nor high heels.) As Pinkie's physics reacted, the two springboarded back up and over the Aeroconvoy into the street on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two girls hit the pavement, they wasted no time in rushing past the crowd that had gathered and into the town. \"Alright Rares.\" Rainbow glanced to her compatriot as they dashed through. \"Here's how this is going to work: we keep running, we don't separate, we don\"and't look back, if we see any berry blues then hit overdrive.\" Rarity nodded, though already she was feeling the air being dragged out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie and Windy rolled towards the window, breaking down the wall. Down below, they could hear and see Pinkie crying against the Areoconvoy. She didn't appear bruised but more likely hurt emotionally more than anything and Maud was rolling alongside her. \"Your visor berries should inform you the basics of how the Aeroconvoy works. Cookie and I will go after them. Tell your mother to inform Luna about this.\" Although more cautiously then thier daughters, the two berries jumped out of the hole and bouced onto the street to roll of towards thier children.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash\u2019s eyes widened with surprise as she realized that it was their blue-berrien mothers catching up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay we got to go now.\u201d Rainbow Dash said in panicked tone. \u201cLegs don\u2019t fail me now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash then activated her geode and took off at super speed and Rarity hung on to Rainbow Dash for dear life. But even with Rainbow\u2019s enhanced speed the sloshing sound did not get farther away, in fact it sounded like it was getting closer. Rainbow dash figured that since she was carrying Rarity on her back, the extra weight was slowing her down so she couldn\u2019t run as fast as she normally does. Rainbow Dash also began to notice that the scenery was becoming less urban with more greenery appearing meaning that the two were getting close to camp everfree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRainbow Dash please stop, you're making this harder than it needs to be.\u201d An approaching voice said which Rainbow Dash recognized as her mother\u2019s voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash then noticed that two large spheres were rolling up right beside her. Rarity saw that it was the moms with Windy Whistles on the right side and Cookie Crumbles on the left side. As the two were rolling beside her Rainbow Dash couldn't tell which was more impressive, that the moms were keeping up with her at this speed or the fact that they were able to roll for so long with any sign of dizziness or nausea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis may come as a surprise to you mom, but not all of us are all okay with being turned into fruit.\u201d Rainbow Dash stated in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, even less so about being involved in an alien invasion.\u201d Rarity added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIts not an invasion Rarity.\u201d Cookie Crumbles said correcting her daughter.\u201d \u201cIf you two would just stop and listen, you'd see that the Blue-berriens have a lot to offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thank you, I rather enjoy being able to fit through small spaces and not having juice sloshing around in my body.\u201d Rarity replied uninterested in what her mother was saying. \u201cAlso mother, those outfits leave a lot to be desired.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rainbow Dash and Rarity engaged in a high speed argument with their mothers...</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash and Rarity then noticed that Pinkie Pie had a sad expression on her face and her normally poofy hair was flat which is never a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026 hey Pinkie Pie.\u201d Rainbow Dash said awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPinkie Pie darling, we\u2019re sorry about the whole using you as a springboard thing.\u201d Rarity stated trying to apologize. \u201cIt was one of those in the heat of the moment kind of deals you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d Pinkie Pie replied in a depressed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen Pinkie if you were in me and Rarity\u2019s position and one us was a blue-berrien, you probably would\u2019ve came up with the same idea as us,\u201d Rainbow Dash said trying to explain their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that\u2019s true.\u201d Pinkie Pie replied nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBy the way Pinkie do you know where are geodes are.\u201d Rarity asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour moms have them.\u201d Pinkie Pie replied. \u201cThey said that they will give them back when you are willing to embrace your heritage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the doors opened again and the girls saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

She was certainly larger than Pinkie and even then mothers, Rarity silently amazed that her suit wasn't tearing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...if Luna is presenting herself as some sort of semi-leader, you're supposed to be the big girl on campus?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct Rainbow,\" Celestia said \"The big and juicy woman on campus.\" As if to accentuate her claim, she used her almost non-existent hands to slap at her body, causing it to jiggle vigerously. The Blue-berrien captain let out a sigh before pulling herself back together. \"Now girls, I realize this has all been something new. But the time to be shocked is over, how about you two stop this fighting and just let this work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reasons we told our parents, who I know have told you.\" Rarity said as she stood up in anger and annoyance. \"We are refusing for our own personal reasons and thoughts of self and we are not going to be swayed by whatever false promises you or anyone else will make.\" Folding her arms, she sat back down with a 'humf.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelestia said nothing, only keeping her smile as she turned to Rainbow. \"I assume she speaks for you too?\" The silence that followed her statement gave Celestia the impression that regardless wether or not, Rainbow wasn't saying anything. \"Well, I don't blame you girls. Here you are all alone with no one to help you or comfort...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rarity said cut it out.\" Rainbow gave one more angered glance before turning to the wall the same as Rarity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that was just rude. Honestly you girls are acting like spoiled brats at this point. Why can't you just...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Celestia...if I may...\" Pinkie interrupted, rolling beside the large Blue-berrien. \"I think the girls may finally hush up when they see how peaceful things are starting to fair with thier <i> remaining</i> friends.\" The strange, cold inflection Pinke gave that word caused the two hold outs to turn thier heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Pinkie. Seeing thier friends in thier new natural lives may help. How about you girls come and join me on a little tour? I mean it's not like you have much to do in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if we get away from you then?\" Celestia chuckled at Rarity's claim, only saying that she wouldn't and rolling towards the door. Pinkie followed right behind, giving the two another depressed glance on her way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the girls hated to admit it, Celestia was right. The bare, almost colorless room with nothing but the blankets the two were sitting on would not be a great place to stay for long periods. Plus, this would probably be a good chance to see what these aliens had done so far to the school and thier friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so with nothing more to say, the two followed thier jailers out into...</span></div></div>",

The two students couldn\u2019t help but stare at the strange changes that were being made to the high school along with the Blue-berrien teachers that were making said changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou're probably wondering about the changes to the school.\u201d Celesta said as she rolled along. \u201cWe\u2019re making some renovations in order to make the school and eventually the town more spacious for the arrival of our fellow Blue-berriens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean your Blue-berriens.\u201d Rainbow Dash remarked. \u201cAlso how come you look bigger compared to the others including your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLuna had to juice herself for the science fair in order to avoid drawing any unnecessary attention.\u201d Celestia replied. \u201cAs for me, I think its due to the fact that my body has gone so long without making juice that my system went into overtime to compensate hence my bigger appearance.\u201d \u201cThough I may need to juice myself pretty soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of walking through the hallways, Rainbow Dash and Rarity saw that Celestia and Pinkie Pie led them to the cafeteria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don't you take a look through the glass.\u201d Celestia asked with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Rarity and Rainbow Dash peak through the windows of the cafeteria doors and their eyes widen shock as the cafeteria is filled with blue-berrien students.The two saw some familiar faces who were turned into round fruit like Trixie, Octavia Vinyl Scratch, Derby, Lyra Heartstrings and Bon Bon. Most of them had uncertain and anxious expressions regarding their new looks (except for Derpy who is just rolling around aimlessly and Vinyl Scratch who is just listening to her music) while others were still panicking like Diamond Tiara and Silver Spoon. What was even more shocking was that the male students like Flash Sentry, Bulk Biceps and Micro Chips were not round at all and only had a blue skin color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was rather surprised myself with what happened to the male students.\u201d Celestia admitted. \u201cThe Blue-berriens were an all-female race so when the blue-berrien DNA awoke within the male students, me and Luna had no idea how to react.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, if the Blue-berriens were all female then how do they-.\u201d Rainbow Dash said curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is a subject for another time!\u201d Celestia interrupted while blushing slightly. \u201cAs you can see most of the students have embraced their heritage, some willingly while most needed some convincing either by us or their mothers.\u201d \u201cFluttershy in particular was one of our earliest students who decided to embrace who she really was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Fluttershy is a Blue-berrien now?\u201d Rarity said in shock and confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, she agreed when she heard how the juice within our bodies can be converted into environmentally friendly energy.\u201d Celestia stated proudly. \u201cApplebloom and her friends have also embraced their heritage, so why don't you two stop resisting and join the rest of your families.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Twilight had much choice with what happened to her.\u201d Rainbow Dash rebutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll admit Applejack was a bit forceful with her approach, but it was for the best.\u201d Celestia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure about that?\u201d Rarity asked sarcastically. \u201cEver since this whole Blue-berrien mess happened Twilight has been freaking out non stop.\u201d \u201cSo forcing her to become a giant fruit could cause an emotional breakdown.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere is Twilight anyway?\u201d Rainbow Dash asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s still unconscious.\u201d Pinkie Pie replied. \u201cShe is the teacher\u2019s lounge and her mother is looking after her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about Sunset Shimmer.\u201d Rarity asked with equal curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is still unconscious as well.\u201d Pinkie pie. \u201cShe is in the music room and Cheerilee is keeping watch over her.\u201d \u201cSince she doesn't have any Blue-berrien DNA in her, she was unaffected by the gas.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince you two are still acting stubborn, how about I show you two something that will change your mind in a heartbeat.\u201d Celestia said with an even bigger grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Celestia and Pinkie Pie rolled to the eastside of the school with Rainbow Dash and Rarity reluctantly following unsure of what they were going to see. But whatever it was the two knew it would not be good. </span></div></div>",

The potent gas Sunset was forced to inhale was of a rather strong dosage, leaving her body with several side effects.  She sluggishly got herself up while clutching the left half of her aching forehead.  She felt disoriented and tired, her eyes struggling to decipher anything out of the light.  Sunset guessed she was having one of those \u201cHangovers\u201d she had heard about in health class a few weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you regained consciousness, Sunset?\u201d Cheerilee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019m just feeling dizzy. That\u2019s all.\u201d  Sunset answered calmly once she caught sight of the Blue-Berrien supervising her. <br>\r\nSunset Shimmer was seemingly unafraid of the sight of an alien blueberry woman in contrast to how acted hours ago, but she struggled to keep herself balanced.  Whatever she inhaled was still making changes to the teen\u2019s body.  The gasser was designed by Applejack\u2019s mother to make humans\u2019 mind more accepting of Blue-Berriens.  The machine did so by inhibiting the brain\u2019s fear reactions while forcibly activating the brain\u2019s trust sensors.  Vital scans of Sunset Shimmer from Cheerilee\u2019s Visor Berry showed good progression in teen\u2019s body, and the adverse side effects would be wearing off shortly.  Once Sunset\u2019s eyes finally adjusted to the light, she could see clearly taking notice that she was in the music room, and she now wearing the type of spacesuit that she saw Applejack previously wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean\u2026?\u201d Sunset asked, tugging the right sleeve of her space spandex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Sunset,\u201d Cheerilee politely answered, \u201cCaptain Celestia has conscripted you and your friends into the Blue-Berrien Federation.  We will be needing your abilities, to make sure order and harmony can be maintained between nations of Earth and the refugee Blue-Berriens that will have to make this planet their new home.  Our actions may seem extreme right now, but we were short on options at this moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cheerilee\u2019s explanation, Sunset heard the music room door open before she could answer. The door itself now much larger, and she soon saw two of her blue and round friends, Applejack and Fluttershy enter the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Sunset!\u201d Fluttershy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey girls,\u201d Sunset replied and then nervously apologized, \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry for us trying to run earlier\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry about it, sugar cube.\u201d Applejack assured her, \u201cIt was all for the best in the long run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSunset smiled and hugged both teen blueberry aliens, she couldn\u2019t help but admire her friends so big and round, proudly displaying their alien heritage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to break up your reunion for now,\u201d Cheerilee politely interrupted, \u201cbut since you\u2019re awake Sunset Shimmer, Captain Celestia has asked your friends to escort you to the\u2026</span></div></div>",

Sci-Twi\u2019s vital scans appeared to be normalized according to her mother\u2019s visor berry.  While Twilight Velvet couldn\u2019t be anymore proud of her daughter for such an exceptional growth level, the Blue-Berrien knew how scared to death her daughter must be, from what has happened recently. All she could do right now wait as own her body filled with juice for her daughter to awaken and it wouldn\u2019t be for much longer.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle\u2019s eyes groggily opened.  She had no idea where she was or what happened to her after Applejack had gassed her.  All she could see was  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTwilight, dear?\u201d Her mother asked, trying her best not to frighten her blueberry daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Sparkle recognized that voice was that of her mother\u2019s.  Sci-Twi soon realized what that meant and panicked, trying to get her absorbed legs to get off whatever she was on. Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s when she had remembered that Applejack had gassed with that invention of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! What do you want with me!?\u201d Twilight asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetie, there\u2019s no need to be afraid.\u201d Twilight Velvet tried to assure her, rolling her blueberry body forward so she would be positioned face to face with her daughter, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be afraid sweetie.  I\u2019m still your mother. I\u2019ll admit the situation leading up to this has been out of anyberry\u2019s control, but we Blue-Berriens are not a violent race.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen\u2026 who are you really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwilight Velvet understood the question, knowing that her daughter was referring to her past. She answered, \u201cMm\u2026 I am one of the scientists selected for Blue-Berriea\u2019s colonization mission.  I was a professor of astrophysics at Brightwell.  My discoveries had helped locate this very planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou were a scientist?\u201d Twilight was surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!  Where did you think your passion for science came from?\u201d Twilight Velvet answered proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two\u2019s conversation was interrupted when Twilight Velvet\u2019s berry visor received a transmission. It was Sunset Shimmer, Fluttershy, and Applejack at the door to the teacher\u2019s lounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm Ms. Velvet, can we come in?\u201d Sunset Shimmer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doorway opening was all the confirmation the girls needed to enter, and they made their way inside.

Inside there were some massage tables, mud baths, a sauna room, a manicure/pedicure station and other items which made Rarity and Rainbow Dash realize what this room was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A spa.\" Rainbow Dash said in a little dumbfounded tone of voice.\" \"Your big plan to turn us over to your side is a spa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even Blue-Berriens enjoy a good spa to help relax the body and mind.\" Celestia said. \"I think that after a little rest and relaxation, you two will be more open-minded to what we have to say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normally I would enjoy a free spa day as much as the next person.\" \"But this has \u201cits a trap written\u201d all over it.\" Rarity said suspiciously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two Blue-Berriens rolled in from the back end of the room and Rarity instantly recognized two women as the owners of the spa downtown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is every female in town a alien blueberry?\" Rarity thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Aloe Vera, Lotus Blossom.\" Celestia said, greeting the two Blue-Berriens who were apart of the medical staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Captain Celestia.\" The two women said simultaneously while giving a Blue-Berrien salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Aloe Vera's visor berry started to vibrate slightly so she checked the incoming data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my.\" Aloe Vera said with a surprised look on her face. \"Captain it looks like you are well overdue for juicing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does look like she's ready to burst.\" Lotus Blossom added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've been putting off my juicing for a while now.\u201d Celestia admitted. \u201cI just wanted to enjoy the pleasure of being full and round for as long as I could before I had to get juiced.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the conversation could go any further, the group heard the sound of two more Blue-Berriens rolling towards them. The sounds came from Applejack and Fluttershy as they entered the spa room. While Fluttershy was happy to see that Rarity and Rainbow Dash were unharmed, Applejack was trying her best to avoid eye contact with the pair as she had a gut feeling that they had not forgiven her actions from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApplejack.\u201d Rainbow Dash and Rarity said in the same deadpan tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowdy girls.\u201d Applejack replied with a slight tone of guilt in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou called for us Captain Celestia?\u201d Fluttershy asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I did.\u201d Celestia said. \u201cApplejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie it is time for your first juicing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you wanted their help with something else.\u201d Pinkie Pie said as her mood started to improve a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can wait until later.\u201d Celestia replied confidently. \u201cFor now you three need to get into the routine of knowing when to juice yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not going to be painful is it?\u201d Fluttershy asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Blue-Berrien's first juicing is always the toughest, but it gets easier over time.\" Lotus Blossom explained. \"You'll find the juicing station in the back, Captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Lotus Blossom.\" Celestia said. \"Follow me girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Celestia rolled towards the back of the room with Applejack, Fluttershy and Pinkie Pie following her. Which left Rarity and Rainbow Dash alone with the spa duo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about we start off your spa treatment with a massage?\u201d Aloe Vera asked. \u201cI guarantee you'll feel you more like yourself when it's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat actually sounds divine, I could really go for one right now.\u201d Rarity said in a somewhat exhausted tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I could go for one as well, but no funny business got it.\u201d Rainbow Dash stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe promise.\u201d Lotus Blossom replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Rarity and Rainbow Dash went and laid down on the massage tables with Aloe Vera near Rarity's table and Lotus Blossom near Rainbow Dash's table. Once Rarity and Rainbow Dash got comfortable, the two heard a weird sound coming from up above them. Just then a pair of robotic arms appeared from the ceiling and lowered themselves about the massage tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Rainbow Dash asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese robotic arms are what we use to give massages to Blue-Berriens.\u201d Aloe Vera explained. \u201cThey are controlled through the visor berry similar to an RC car.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the spa duo didn\u2019t tell Rarity and Rainbow Dash was that the robotic arms are capable of mimicking the touch and sensation of anyone\u2019s hands as long as they have the DNA of the person they wish to imitate. This unique feature of the robotic arms was Captain Celestia\u2019s plan. With Rarity and Rainbow Dash being stubborn, both Celestia and Luna came to the conclusion that it was better to ask for forgiveness than permission. So while the two girls were still unconscious, Nurse Redheart collected a few strands of hair from Windy Whistles and Cookie Crumbles and inserted the hair into the DNA holder which was located in the elbow of the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know for these arms being made of metal, they actually give great back massages.\u201d Rainbow Dash said in a relaxed tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree, and the foot massages are divine.\u201d Rarity added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spa duo continued to work their magic hoping that being in contact with their mother\u2019s DNA would awaken the girl\u2019s dormant Blue-Berrien genes.</span></div></div>",

Rainbow Dash said with a bad feeling in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRainbow Dash then pointed her phone towards herself to see what issue was, but couldn't due to the limited space of the air duct. She was able to see her arms and what she saw caused her heart to skip a beat.

With Luna seeming to have taken her visor berry, this was the only real way to contact Madame Azuris. Taking a minute to check if she was juicy enough to be truley presentable, Celestia waited as the machinery whizzed and vibrated. Before long, a screen popped up from the machine and the stern, yet soft face of Chairwoman Azuris came into view. \"Ah, Captain Celestia. I assume you have a reason for calling.\" \"Yes madam. Forgive me for asking but my sister and I never had the chance to ask. What was it that happened to our empire to cause the mass displacement of our kind?\" Azuris sighed, her blueberry earrings leaning against her violet body. \"It all began when we had first sent out a squadron to find your ship. After so many years without a word, we assume something must have gone wrong. Our rescue team wasn't even halfway through our galaxy before they found a ship from Wato Mela under attack by mercinaries. Mercenaries that, we would later find out, were hired by those unworthy cretins at Tomaterria.\" Even after so many years, those planets' names painted very clear pictures in the space captian's head. Wato Mela was a rather primitive planet compared to the rest of the planet's in the Juicy Way but were nonetheless important in the making of most of her home world's machinery. Tomaterria.....that planet was rather despised in the Federation. After somehow getting launched from orbit in the Vegitery system, the planet latched onto the gravity well of the Juicy way, throwing the whole gravity of the planet out of wack. \"Just as we were prepared to confront Tomaterria on the matter, it attacked our own planet and used what resources they stole to create some strange device that blew our whole planet out of the system. Without the warmth of our sun, the planet quickly began to freeze. We had no choice but to leave. Unfortunately, the blast knocked us so far away that we can't tell where the Juicy Way is anymore. And without that knowledge, we can't even contact our allies to bring us back. It was only through the slimmest of chances that our flagship managed to find your signal.\" Celestia couldn't help but tear up. Her home planet ruined, all the while she was sitting down on that rock acting like she was just a simple school berry. If it wasn't because she had lost her memory and heritage during this.....oh.... \"Anywho, the first of our dropships are a little ahead of schedule actually. In a few days you will have quite a few Blueberrians on yourselves. Which reminds me, how is the whole colonization mission coming along?\" Celestia decided there was no use lying given the circumstances and just needed to explain. At first, Azuris chuckled as if it was a joke. But as Celestia continued to explain the issue of DNA to her leader, the smile of the chairwoman became a mix of confusion and intrique. \"Interesting....and your sister is down there preparing to convert those into thier 'true forms?'\" \"Yes Chairwoman Azuris. Now I know some of what I have explained to you sounds preposterous.\" \"From a less trustworthy pilot maybe, but I believe every word out of you. I must say these magic girls sounds interesting. And if they are Blueberrian, then they might make colonization easier. Bending the wills of those earthlings better than any number of retention spirals.....\" \"Excuse me? What was that?\" \"Oh don't worry your little blue head Celestia. And speaking of retention spirals.....\" In a flash, half of the screen was covered by a blue and purple spiral. Celestia couldn't help but look into it as Azuris smiled. \"Don't worry Celestia. I'm doing this for the good our our kind, your kind....all you need to remember is our superiority.....\" \"Superiority....yes....\" Celestia mumbled as her eyes began to match the spiral.</span></div></div>",

It just didn't seem right, along with a strange tightness coming from her pants and shirt. Looking to herself, Luna found that her clothes did indeed seem tighter and while this did alarm her, it didn't as much as it should have. Luna took another whiff of the fruity smell as she came upon two doors. Both clicked in her mind as rooms of importance, but which one to go into......</span></div></div>",

Even considering most of the problems were simple, their were just too many to count easily. Being the smart little alicorn that she was though, she created a clear schedule for her to show between work and relaxing. Looking to her timer, she realized it was about time for her to relax and she knew exactly how. She teleported over to her nightstand and picked up what appeared to be comic books. The last time she was in the human world, she had managed to find these beauties that sparked an otherwise nonexistent interest in comics. The comic appeared to be a similar set up to the Power Ponies comics of Equestria, same costumes and everything. In her ever growing curiosity of human society and culture, she had bought these comics and brought them home. \"Okay, where was I in my readings?\" Twilight flipped the books around until she spied a cover she hadn't seen before. On it were figures similar to what her friends had worn in that enchanted comic all running towards what appeared to be a blue sphere. When Twilight looked closer however, she noticed clothes and a head on the sphere. Curiosity now peaking, Twilight opened the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was quiet within the usually bustling streets of Maretropolis' night scene. Most folks had either gone off to bed or were out of town on business. On the edge of town however, lights were still beaming in the scientifc research facility 2Day. This building was the workplace of scientists who pledged to decicate their lives to the pursuit of medical and scientific research. One such scientist was standing over by her window, breathing in the crisp night air. Miss Blueberry Blossoms gave a sigh of pride as she turned back to her work bench. Multiple beakers filled with blue liquids were either bubbling over burners or frozen. Three pots with small blueberry plants stood in the center, gaining sunlight from a lamp in the middle. Berry put a finger to her chin as she picked a blueberry from each plant. Picking the most clean of the three, she put it under a microscope and focused the lens. Her free hand reached over to the nearby computer and typed in a line of code. \"Umm...Miss Blossoms?\" Berry swirved her head around at the sudden voice to see the head scientist poking his head in. \"Ah, Mister Beaker, I was just finishing up for the night.\" Berry was about to give her superior a handshake but stopped when she saw his face. It seemed...distraught to put it simply. \"Miss Blossom....The president of the facility told me to give you this.\" Berry took hold of the red envelope with a trembling hand. \"Red envelope......\" She said in an equally trembling voice, \"......Only two reasons that would be.....\" Mr. Beaker turned away solemnly, knowing well what it ment, there were two reasons but both mwnt the same thing.  Berry didn't even open the thing before she teared up. \"I'm fired? I can't be....\" \"I'm really sorry Berry, he told me that he thought of your experiments as 'budget consuming' and 'worthless'.\" Berry dropped the envelope and turned to her desk. \"I'm so close though! I just need a few more weeks to certify my serums!\" Berry took hold of the closet blueberry plant. \"If it would work, people wouldn't need to worry about drought or famine. Blueberries would soon become the easiest and quickest produce to ever produce!\" Berry looked back at her superior, now crying into the plant's soil. \"The motto of 2Day is \"2Day can make a better 2Morrow. Well this would make it perfect!\" Mr. Beaker put a hand on his former workmate. \"You'll need to clean up before you leave. The boss doesn't want anything left in this lab. I'm sorry....truly I am.\" Without another word, Mr. Beaker left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a hasty setup, being on the short notice that it was. This greenhouse had been abandoned for years though, so no one word interrupt her work. \"Worthless.....well, we'll see. Berry held one of the beakers of blue and mixed it with an odd violet substance. \"When I perfect this serum, that stupid dirt bag will beg me to come back.\" The beaker now glowed a dark blue, it was ready. Berry turned to a plant pot filled with dried up soil. \"A single blueberry seed in soil from a typical drought environment. A little of my new formula should make it grow like it was hit with an instant growth formula....which is pretty much what it is.\" Berry carefully poured a small drop onto the dirt and watched it soak into the dirt. She set the beaker down on the table and eyed the dirt carefully. After a few seconds, she saw some of the dirt beginning to sift. A small sprout was already beginning to form. Berry squeed with delight...until the sprout quickly wilted. Normally Berry was a patient woman, but that was the finall straw. She fulng her fists about in rage shouting horrible phrases that wouldn't possibly fit in this story's' rating. Her rage quit when she hit one of the large columns holding the place up. Her surprise made her lose her valence, falling to the hard floor. As she hit the ground, she also bonked her head on the table. The serum, which had been placed on the edge, tipped over. The dark blue liquid was now spilling over into the unconscious woman's mouth.</span></div></div>",

Berry Blossoms could feel the light hitting her eyes and groaned in pain over a new headache. \"Ohhh...how long was I out for. Berry opened her eyes and attempted to pull herself up. I say attempted because she realized instantly that something was wrong. She could feel like weight had somehow been blasted right into her, causing making it hard to get up. Also, while she felt her arms and legs move, they didn't seem to be moving anywhere. Berry looked to herself, curious at what was going on. Her eyes opened wide at what layed before her. Her body had now blown up into a large, round shape and her asking was a darker blue then usual. \"What.....how?\" Looking above her, Berry took note of the beaker that was on it side and pieced it together. \"Okay....so this is what my serum can do? Make me....\" She looked at herself again, \"...a blueberry? What good can that do?\" Taking advantage of her knowledge in sphere movement, Berry rolled her body around until she was now upright. As she did, she heard the sounds of juice sloshing around in her body. Berry signed as she looked back to the wilted plant. \"So I grow into this freak and you just shrivel, wonder how got the better deal.\" Out of anger more then anything else, Blueberry spat at the plant. Before the liquid sunk into the dirt, Blueberry took notice of the blue color and juice-like appearance. Blueberry gave another sigh as she wondered what to do now. Before she could begin feeling sorry for herself though, the plant once again caught her eye. Just a few seconds ago, it was a shriveled thing. But now it was healthy, large , and already producing blueberries. Blueberry gasped in delight, her formula DID work....just not how she had planned. Using as much of her legs as possible, Blueberry began to waddle towards the door, needing fresh air to think this through. \"So...it seems I am capable of growing quick and sustaining blueberry plants like I wanted. Now to get rid of this odd blueberry forrrr.....oh my.\" Blueberry's sentence had faltered as she stepped out into the sun. As the rays hit her blue body, she could feel it being turned into energy like she was some kind of living plant. It felt so calming...so peaceful.....so....heavenly. \"Mmmmm.\" Blueberry let out as she took it all in. \"Able to grow blueberries, full of juice so I can't get thirsty, able to do some odd form of photosynthesis for energy, and feeling sooooo good. Best...accident....ever.\" After a few minutes of 'sunbathing' Berry realized something important. \"I can't keep this to myself! Everyone needs to know about this! Everyone needs to become a blueberry!\" Her smile and prideful face dripped down when she realized the only way for her to get this out had been crushes last night by her company. Then there was her new form in general. How the heck would anyone not be freaked out by the large blueberry she now was? Blueberry looked to the empty beaker that once held her concoction. \"Hmmm....Making the serum isn't too hard, I just need blueberries and a few herbs. Who knows? Maybe my new blueberries already have the stuff in them?\" Blueberry leaned to the plant and took a fruit. She munched it down, seeing her form growing rounder and larger. Definitely had the serum in them. \"So...I could mass produce my serum and find a way to get others to drink it or I could mass produce my blueberries to sell to the public. Either way might get me in trouble so I'all do it under a new name. Hmmmm....what was the last name of that girl from that story....oh yeah. I'll do my work as Blueberry Beauregard.\"</span></div></div>",

Consider your next path carefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPath 1 - Years have passed since Velvet walked away from her role as Songstress and partner of the wonderful, whimsical Celly Wonka. But, her loving daughter Twilight has won a Golden Ticket into the illustrious factory and has asked Velvet to venture in with her.After all, it would only be right to allow Velvet a chance to catch up with an old friend. But old flames are easier to stoke than she believes, and perhaps the wily charms of Celly are enough to convince her to play with an old favorite i the back~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPath 2 -  Life couldn't be sweeter for esteemed writer Twilight Velvet, as her latest entry into the long running Velveteen Mysteries pre-teen series has been doing nothing but cashing in royalty checks for many years. But when she decides to reach back into the old writing well, she finds a nw story on her heart, a story that guides failiar faces in her life into new, bold and blue directions no one could have seen. And it's funny how often life reflects fiction...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPath 3 - What was supposed to be a delightful vacation on a coastal Maine town has become yet another world-saving mission for Agent T. Velvet. Between family activities and soaking up the New England rays, Velvet has her hands full dodging lasers, gathering intel and catching a bio-terrorist ring before they can spring their latest scheme on the world. Hopefully Agent Velvet hasn't gotten too old for this kind of mission...</span></div></div>",
