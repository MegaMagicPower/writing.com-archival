She landed in front of Sonic\u2019s home and knocked on the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBe there in a millisecond!\u201d, shouted Sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door and to surprised to see a very chubby looking bat girl that looked just like Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026 hey there. Are you related to Rouge the bat by any chance? Like a\u2026 big sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge rolled her eyes and sighed, \u201cNo, blue boy. It\u2019s me, Rouge. For someone who is the fastest thing alive, you are pretty slow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Rouge? Why are you so fat?\u201c, at this point, Sonic was even more confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLong story short, I recently found out Knuckles has a thing for bigger women. I gained all of this weight thanks to some special chocolate I found. I want to gain more weight to keep red head\u2019s attention. That\u2019s where you come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic put his hand over his face and shook his head and said, \u201cOh no, not you too.

Okay \u201cHuge the bat\u201c, what can I do to help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to give me a list of all the restaurants and buffets you visited around here.

Here, take them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouges eyes widened as Sonic gave Rouge a big stack of menus. From seafood to Mexican food, the pile was stacked with all sorts of menus with tons of food. She placed them underneath her arm, she winked and blew Sonic a kiss, causing Sonic to wince a bit. She flapped her wings and started to float away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, blue boy. Next time I you see me, you may find me as a whale!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood bye, fatty batty.

Her mouth began to drool just thinking about stuffing her chubby face silly with all the foods at these places. The closest buffet she was near was an \u201cAll-you-can-eat\u201d Chinese buffet. She flew up again and got there no time flat. She walked in and the waiter inside saw how big she was knew she was going to eat for sometime\u2026 but longer than he expected. He brought Rouge to her table and gave a plate and utensils. Rouge then put her hand into her now bigger cleavage and took out her purse stuffed to brim with rings and paid the man. The waiter took out his paper and pen prepared to write down her first meal. She noticed and gave him a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney, put that stuff away and my plate away. Bring me all of your food pans.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 are you sure you don\u2019t mean-\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo, my dear. Bring me all of the food in this establishment. I\u2018ll pay extra if necessary.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe waiter paused for a moment, but put his paper and pen and said, \u201cOf course, ma\u2019am. Please wait a moment and I\u2019ll bring your food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the waiter and a half a dozen other workers brought rolled in food carts stacked high with pans filled with delicious smelling Chinese food. They covered Rouge\u2019s table with food and she dived into the food face and ate like a wild animal. She ate nonstop with out a break for several hours stuffing herself with all the foods. Everyone at the buffet were either disgusted or in awe at her eating. Soon all the pans and food carts were emptied without a single crumb left. Her belly was enormous and rubbed it slowly. The bat girl\u2019s belly expanded so big, it covered her entire table. The cat suit was on her so tightly, it caused her same pain. She closed her and sucked on her fingers trying to eat up all the grease she had on them. Her waiter walked up to her told her the chef wanted to greet his happy costumer. The chef skipped out of the kitchen and was an old Chinese man that he had the biggest grin on his face. This was the opposite expression on Rouge\u2019s face. Her massive belly was gurgling, sloshing and was aching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAw, hungry young bat lady! You must really loved my cooking! Please tell me your name so I can remember you fondly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood right next to Rouge, as he waited patiently to her hear. Rouge was about say her name, but only a loud belch escaped her mouth and scared the old man to near death<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUUUURP!! Excuse me, my dear. I am way too full to talk at the moment\u2026 hic. My name is Rouge. Remember my beautiful name well\u2026 urrp!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a burp louder than a gong, I will never forget you Rouge, hahaha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon an odd ripping noise can be heard. The sound came from Rouge\u2019s cat suit. The poor tights couldn\u2019t handle the girth of her stomach anymore and ripped apart in matter of seconds exposing her large tan skinned belly. Her belly sloshed and jiggled intensely, finally free from it\u2019s cat suit prison. Rouge moaned in relief as the pain slowly went away and rubbed her belly proudly. She let out another wet belch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUUUUURRRP!! Ah\u2026 that\u2019s better. Can someone help me out of this booth? I\u2019m ready to go home and sleep of this feast.\u201d she winked at blew a kiss at the chef and waiter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later, Rouge waddled her way through the buffet bumping and pushing people over with her stuffed belly and was a bit embarrassed. She apologized to all the folks as she carried her elephant sized belly was knocking into. She finally made it outside, Rouge flapped her bat wings and slowly took off. She struggled trying to fly with that massive belly of hers as it sloshed and swayed from side to side. She started sweating up a storm and burp consistently until she made it home, Club Rouge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her hips and ass alone took up the entire aisle as waddled down. She was extremely obese, every bit of her body was heavy and wide. She resembled a bloated hippo with her massive ass and belly that was touching the floor. As soon as she meet up to Knuckles, they both kissed each other and then Knuckles shoved an entire slice of cake into her mouth having cream drip down her multiple chins and her massive drooping boobs. Fast-forward 20 years, Knuckles and Rouge bought an enormous mansion with massive pools of milkshakes and gravy. Fountains of gooey cheese and spaghetti noodles. In the middle of the mansion sits Rouge, completely nude weighing in thousands of tons. The bat girl was trapped under all that blubber with a golden pipe going straight in between her massive fat cheeks and into her mouth. The pipe is connected to all the fountains and pools of food, mixing all together and Rouge sucks on the pipe hard with her massive lushes pink lips drinking up all the grub, slowly growing even fatter. Knuckles looking much stronger and bit taller, walks into her room, places his big paws on her stadium sized belly and started to massage it. There was so much of her, she barely even felt his rubbing. 20 children of Knuckles and Rouge walked into the room as well, all either an echidna or a bat, climbing on their mother\u2019s blubber, playing games on her. Bouncing on her rolls causing massive waves of flesh that throw the kids up in the air and landing safely back down on her soft lard. Playing hide and go seek in her folds. Some of the other kids just take naps in her warm and comfy flesh. Rouge moaned in bliss as she sucked harder and harder on the pipe, eating as unnaturally as possible, growing fatter by the second. She was the queen of her world fattening world. Rouge was in absolute paradise, but alas, it was only a dream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her legs widened so much until her boots tore to pieces. Her new weight was too much to handle and began to have trouble standing. The doctor held on to her hands and bingo wings for arms and slowly laid her to the ground. Sally began to moan in pleasure due to how great she felt growing so much fat. She gained two extra chins and her fat cheeks got rounder and softer. Sally's fat started spreading across the floor. Her rolls wouldn't stop expanding.

More and more fat grew as now her belly touched the walls. Within minutes the whole room was filled Sally's tan and brown blubber. She moaned because of how sexy she felt having fat filling up the room. Her folds reached the ceiling and soon after her thousands of pounds of softness caused the walls to crack. Her fat wouldn't stop expanding further and further. The now blob of a princess let out another loud burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BUUUUUUUUUUURP!! More... I need more!

Her fat finally freed from it's prison. She now weighed over 5000 lbs. An enormous blob of a women, completely immobilized. Her limbs sunken deep into her fat, not a single toe and finger in sight. Her belly was now a mountain of soft jiggling rolls. One small poke can send her body into a non stop jiggling mountain of jello. Sally couldn't be happier. Underneath her dozens of chins and whooper sized cheeks, Sally smiled. Her belly let out a loud rumble that sounded like thunder. She was hungry!

Sally weighing as much as an average whale, just laid there, her soft delicious blubber spread across the grass of the now destroyed lab building. Her cheeks puffy from fat, dozens of chins, her massive boobs sagging on the sides of her belly, touching her love handles. Her ass was almost as large as her belly, going pass her back fat and touching her head. Limbs sunken deep into fat, with no sign of her hands and feet.

Her mother turned to daughter, scolded at her for saying something so obscene, grabbed her by her hand and dragged her upset child home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took an entire day, but Sally was ready to be brought home where an enormous feast was waiting for her.

The heavy princess was slowly lifted off of the ground, her entire body began sagging and drooping just as much as her massive boobs, as the helicopters were gaining altitude.

There was also a big keg of buttermilk by the table to drink. Blaze almost started to drool over the feast only felines have dreamed of, but she quickly wiped her mouth.\"Big! Where did you get all of this?\" She asked in surprise. \"I do a lot fishing and I'm a really good cook.\" Blaze sat down at the other.\"Do you always make this much food for yourself?\" she asked him as she looked over all of the delicious food.\"No,I wasn't sure how much to make so I made a lot so you can eat as much as you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze couldn't help herself she grab a fork and knife and dug right in.

She licked her lips, Just looking at the delicious food made her hungry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 maybe a little breakfast wouldn\u2019t hurt.\u201d She said as she walked into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig pulled the chair out from the table. \u201dHere have seat .\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze sat down and picked up a fork and knife. \u201cDamn it! Why did he have to be such a good cook?\u201d She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze Once again began to eat. She started with a plate of pancakes and waffles. Big put butter on them and pour lots of maple syrup over them. Blaze cut into them and ate. After she finished them she moved on to the sausage, bacon, hash browns, and eggs. Half way though them she look up to see big wasn\u2019t eating, he was just sitting there watching her eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat some too?\u201d She asked him with a piece of bacon in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo thanks, I already ate. I just enjoy watching a beautiful woman eat.\u201d He said to her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze blushed to this. \u201cDid he just say I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d She thought about this. Then she just remembered something, He wasn\u2019t eating anything last night either. \u201cDid he make a this food just for me?\u201d She thought to herself as she finished the last bit of eggs on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast thing on the table was the donuts and milk. She started dunking donut left and right in the pitcher of buttermilk ,eating them after each dunk. There were custard filled ones, jelly filled, peanut butter donuts, devil\u2019s food donuts and cake donuts each had there own frosting on them. After finishing the last donut, she pick up the pitcher of milk and drank what was left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaahh.\u201d She said with a smile as she sat the now empty pitcher on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her body. She was now fatter then she was that morning, she guessed about 600 pounds now. But she didn\u2019t feel sick like she did last night, she felt full and happy. She started to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you like to take a nap on the couch?\u201d He asked her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze looked at him with a smile.\u201d Yes please.\u201d She said holding one hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig took her hand and helped her to her feet. She followed him to the living room and sat down on the couch. Then big pulled the lever on the side of the couch making it recline. Blaze laid back and relaxed. Suddenly big started to massage her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Big what are yo\u2026.Oh that feels good!\u201d She said as she started to enjoy the belly massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs big continues massaging her belly\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Is that you?\u201d Blaze slowly turned around to see Sonic the hedgehog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026hi  sonic.\u201d She said a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked her over, he couldn\u2019t believe it was her.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sonic continued to lead blaze to the restaurant. Blaze looked around and realized people were giving her weird looks. Maybe it was because she was dressed in a toga or maybe it was not everyday people see a blue hedgehog dragging a 400 pound purple cat along with him down the sidewalk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic wait!\u201d She said as pulled him to a stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201caah!\u201d Sonic yelped as he fell to the ground. Blaze looked at him shocked. She didn\u2019t realize how she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.\u201d She said with a sad look in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked up at her. \u201cIt\u2019s ok. So why the hold up beautiful?\u201d He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blush came across her face. \u201dBeautiful? \u201c She thought to herself. \u201cWell sonic I don\u2019t know if you noticed, but I\u2019m wearing a bed sheet like a toga.\u201d She said as she pointed to her make-shift dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo?\u201d He said to her as if there was nothing wrong with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to walk around in toga all day! I need to get some real clothes!\u201d She said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Ok! Ok! But can I treat you to breakfast after you get some new clothes!\u201d He asked her hoping she would say yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess.\u201d She said wondering why he was so eager to treat her to breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked across the street to see a clothing store called \u201cLarge and Wide\u201d. She ever thought she would be shopping at a store like this before. She walked across the street to the store with sonic following her. The two looked at different clothes from dresses to t-shirts and jeans. Blaze grabbed a large pair of dark purple stretchy sweat pants and a sonic got her a big t-shirt he thought she would look great in. The T-shirt was black with white letters on the front that spelled \u201cNeko\u201d. She didn\u2019t care what it said as long as it covered her. She grabbed some panties and a bra and walked over to the fitting room. While she was changing, she explained how she got so fat to sonic while he waited for her outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo big fattened you up?\u201d he asked seeing if he heard her correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, apparently he\u2019s a very good cook, and gives his guests very generous portions of food. Too much if you ask me.\u201d She said a little angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnce I had lunch at his house, I had to lie to him saying tails needed me for something to avoid eating anymore.\u201d He said with his hand behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I wish someone told me about this before I went there. Anyway sonic I have a question for you now, why do you want to treat me to breakfast and why did you call me beautiful?\u201d She asked him a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026you see\u2026I had this crush on you sense the first I met you and I kinda have this thing for big women.\u201d He said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a moment of silence. Sonic felt he may have upset her. But suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic\u2026I\u2019ve had a crush on you too. I would love to have breakfast with you.\u201d She said  a little excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came out of the booth in the fitting room. Sonic looked her over. Her clothes were a little baggy, but sonic knew with a few meals he could help fit them better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked him make a little pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look great!\u201d He said wagging his tail a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze bent down and hugged sonic. She could tell sonic enjoyed this very much. After that the two walked up to the register with some other t-shirts, sweat pants ,a dress, panties, and another bra. After they paid for blazes new clothes, the cashier put the clothes in some bags for them and the two left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo were do we go for this breakfast you promised me?\u201d She asked him now very hungry.   </span></div></div>",

I got to lose this weight, the guardian of the sol emeralds can\u2019t be walking around looking like this!\u201d She said jiggling her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really doubt your going to eat a bowl of oatmeal and be satisfied.\u201d He said to her laughing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah! Watch me!\u201d she said has she walked inside. Sonic followed her as he watched her swing her tail on her big kitty butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(One hour later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and blaze were being run out of the restaurant, with the owner of the restaurant chasing them out. He was a rooster wearing a apron and a chef hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet out and stay out!\u201d Joe yelled at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! The sign say\u2019s all you can eat, you stupid chicken!\u201d He said pointing at the sign angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it does, but at doesn\u2019t mean eat it all! You and your fat friend are forever banned from Joe\u2019s Breakfast buffet!\u201d He yelled as he stormed back inside, closing the door and putting a sign in the window. (Closed!) and written under it in marker (Because someone ate it all!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic shook his head and walked over to blaze, who was sitting on a bench near by. She didn\u2019t seem to upset about what the hot headed rooster was screaming about. She was just sitting there rubbing her big belly and licking the leftover donut icing off her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happened to just a bowl of oatmeal?\u201d He asked with his arms crossed and smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze frowned \u201cAs soon as I smelled all of that food at the buffet, I caved in. Sonic I got to do something this is getting out of hand!\u201d She said really upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just except it and enjoy being fat.\u201d He said giving her kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! That fox friend of yours ...um..tails!, Maybe he can help me with one of his inventions! She said happily to her idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear a single word I just said did you?\u201d he asked her a little annoyed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go ask tails if can help.\u201d She said as she grabbed her bags of clothes and started walking to tails workshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic just shrugged his shoulders and followed her. When they got there they walked in and found tails working on something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey tails, I was wondering  if you can help blaze with a little problem?\u201d He asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure sonic.\u201d The little fox turned around and suddenly had a shocked look on her face. \u201dB..Blaze?\u201d He asked the big cat standing in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s me tails.\u201d She said a little embarrassed <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then explained to him about what happen to her. After a few minutes of thinking tails had a idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere is this one project I have been working on for a while. I haven\u2019t tested it yet but it should work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails ran to the back of his shop and came back with what looked like a simple cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is a experimental weight cookie, it should help you with you problem.\u201d He said as he handed her the cookie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze didn\u2019t wait a second, she popped the cookie in her mouth, chewed it up and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! That was delicious, the best cookie I ever eaten!\u201d She said licking her lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach started to growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n I think I can feel it working!\u201d She said in excitement <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly instead of losing weight, her body started to swell up with fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHH! Tails!\u201d She screamed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe soon stopped after gaining 150 pounds, bringing her current weight up to 650 pounds. Her new clothes were no longer baggy, they seemed to be the right size now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTails I wanted to lose weight, not gain it!\u201d She yelled at the little fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLose weight! I can\u2019t make anything like that, its scientifically impossible. I thought you wanted to gain weight. Scientist have tried for years to make an instant weight loss formula, but have failed.  If I could make that I would be a billionaire.\u201d He said with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy you!\u201d She  formed a fireball in her hands in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAaaahhh!\u201d Tail yelled as he ran away in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze chased tails around the workshop as sonic just stood there and watched. He couldn\u2019t help but watch blaze run around after tails. He loved watching her body jiggle around as she chased the little fox around the shop. Tails was jumping over crates and ducking under tables trying to escape the her wrath. But blaze just picked them up and threw them aside as if they were nothing. Apparently her new size has given her amazing strength.  Eventually she got tried of chasing him, and walked back up to sonic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to sit down for a few minutes.\u201d She said to sonic as she wiped some sweat off of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic walked blaze over to a couch  in the workshop and they sat down,. Blaze kicked off the sandals she was wearing, and relaxed. Sonic then started to rub her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh that feels nice!\u201d she said as she purred. She then started to think about her new body size and how sonic loved her being this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic?\u201d She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes blaze?\u201d He looked up at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really like me like this?\u201d She asked him while she jiggled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think your beautiful!\u201d He said looking into her lovely yellow eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze smiled and pulled sonic into a hug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell ,I guess I\u2019ll stop trying to lose this weight then.\u201d She said as she laid back on the couch with sonic in her arms. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to help me guard the sol emeralds from now on!\u201d She told sonic. Sonic nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you blaze!\u201d He said looking her in the eyes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too so\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze was suddenly cut off as sonic leaned in and kissed blaze. It startled her at first, but then she kissed back. The two laid there kissing each other for almost ten minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this mean you won\u2019t try and hurt me now blaze?\u201d Tails asked a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze and sonic suddenly stopped and looked at tails, wondering how long he had been standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise not to hurt you, if you give us some alone time!\u201d She said with fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes of course! Sorry!\u201d He said as he backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what should we do now?\u201d Sonic asked her lovingly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where\u2019s your house?\u201d She asked looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight over here!\u201d He said as lead her over to a waterfall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t going get wet are we?\u201d She asked a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then reached behind a tree by the waterfall and pressed a hidden button. A slide like object came out of the middle of the waterfall. Forcing the water to pour to the side, making a clearing behind the waterfall appear revealing a door. Blaze was speechless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight this way my love!\u201d He said letting her go first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze walked into the hidden house with Sonic following her. After they walked inside and closed the door the slide went back and the waterfall went back to normal. Inside Blaze looked around the place. It was amazing. It had many rooms in it ,a living room, game room, etc. After Sonic showed her around the, he turned to Blaze and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what do you want to do now?\u201d He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShow me your bedroom. I wanna lay down and take a nap!\u201d She said tired from walking around all morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic took her to his bedroom. When they got there Blaze sat down on the bed and took her sandals off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSonic do you wanna take a nap with me?\u201d She asked him sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later, I gonna go play some video games, and maybe some\u2026ah!\u201d Sonic stopped in mid sentence as he looked over at Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze had taken her sweat pants off. She was sitting there on his bed wearing just her t-shirt, and her panties. She sat there rubbing her big belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t wanna take a nap with me? I\u2019d love to cuddle up with you right now.\u201d She said giving him a seductive smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK!\u201d Is all he said as he jumped into bed with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The two cuddle up and kissed each other. Blaze wrapped her arms around Sonic  and they went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Blaze and Sonic were awaken by a loud growling sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Sonic asked a little shocked .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2026that was my stomach, I\u2019m hungry!\u201d She said a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic looked over to the clock, It was 12:03 pm. He then looked back to his love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for lunch! Do you want  me to make some lunch for you or would you like me to go get some fast food?\u201d He asked her.</span></div></div>",

Blaze was fortunate to have friends who shared her newfound gluttony. The three girls patted their tight tummies once they finished, but were interrupted when they heard a pinging noise. Blaze's pants button flew off and landed in one of her empty dessert cups. Amy and Cream tried stifling giggles, but Blaze let one out that encouraged the younger girls to laugh with her. They continued their laughing as they slowly exited the buffet, their bellies so weighed down with food they practically waddled out. Amy and Cream's had ridden up their dresses, exposing a small bit of their white panties. Blaze's own underwear peeked out from the gap in her opened pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stuffed trio made their way to Cream's house, where Amy and Blaze would sleep over. Cream's mother Vanilla greeted them when they arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back, girls. Oh, Blaze, wonderful to see you again!\" Blaze smiled at the older rabbit's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you again, ma'am.\" Blaze then noticed something was different about Vanilla. While Cream had just stuffed herself full, her mother had definitely been putting on weight. Her face had gotten rounder, her skirt rode a bit higher on her legs (which looked thicker), and her belly poked out from under her blouse. The cat turned to the kitchen table and saw an empty carton of ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the girls treat you to a nice meal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, very much so,\" the princess replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did you decide you were going to gain weight with them?\" Blaze realized she hadn't thought about what Vanilla might think about her daughter fattening herself up, but if Vanilla herself was getting fat, she must've been fine with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, yes. I felt it was time to grow.\" Vanilla smiled at this response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. I had the same idea, cooking so much and feeling I should enjoy it as much as I can.\" She turned to her daughter. \"Cream had told me she always wondered why girls had to watch what they ate, and I started to wonder, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mama started to eat more and more and she let me eat more so we could get fat together.\" Cream led the girls up to her room. \"We're hoping more girls can do that with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the morning, I'm going to help Vanilla make a big breakfast for us,\" Amy chimed in. \"You're going to love it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure I will,\" Blaze said. She lowered herself to the floor of Cream's room to rest her stomach. She liked the fullness but the aching from overstuffing it didn't help. Still, she'd be getting used to it on her journey into fatness.</span></div></div>",

The second one consisted of two large pizzas, Sonia once again easily cleared it but the first, second and 8th contestants  had to drop out.  Everyone else made it through the next round as well which was a large ice cream cake.  At the end of the third round Sonia felt her belt around her dress snap as her belly got bigger.

In the final round only her and another guy, contestant number 7 was left.  They were each given a large chocolete cake with jimmies, hot fudge, whip cream and 3 scoops of strawberry ice cream.

Even before Sonia could start shopping, several people were asking her and Aleena if they could buy food for them. Sonia did not mind, she was enjoying the free food, and the respect she had received from the crowd of people, as Sonia's belly had gotten bigger some of the butons on her dress almost popped off, and finally after all the extra food she had, her dress was much tighter than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia and Aleena spent hours shopping for dresses, until they finally found some dresses they liked. Sonia bought lots of dresses, and she also bought lots of dresses for Aleena, she bought some more vests for Manic, and some gifts for Sonic. <br>\r\nWhen they were going home Sonia asked some questions. <br>\r\n\"Hey Manic, do you miss the old life we had?\" Asked Sonia.<br>\r\n\"No I don't said Manic, I like being chubby, and I like how much softer and rounder my belly has gotten.\"<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with you on that Manic. I don't miss my old life at all.\"<br>\r\n\"I agree, I also like being fat, and I liked getting all that free food, before we even went shopping, If I was so worried about being skinny, I would not focus on the better things in life. I like how soft my tummy is, and I don't want to lose the weight I gained, even if it means having to buy more clothes all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Next week:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a week sense Sonia won the contest, and she had outgrown a lot of her dresses, but it did not matter, because she liked being chubby, she liked having a bigger belly, and she loved the food. She then bought a extra large chocolate cake and she at it. After she finished eating, she licked her lips and then left. As she was walking home, her dress she had bought, had felt more tighter around her tummy, but she did not seem to mind. She went back home and Aleena had gone to see a friend, but she left some food for her children. Sonia feeling hungry again ate the huge plate of cookies and brownies and left the kitchen. She then took a long shower and then dried off, and she wondered. \"How much have I put on over the last week?

After he left she looked at herself in the mirror,  her gut was rounded and stuck out a good 25 inches and had several fat rolls on her side. Her arms were about as wide as sausages.  Her rear was about as big as a bench(think mobian bench, remember they are smaller than humans and chest was a DD.  Finally her legs were so thick her thighs rubbed together.  \"Man  I look wonderful,\" Sonia though to herself.  She went downstairs and sat down in the living room and picked up a novel and started to read it.  Sonic and Manic were playing a new video game.  While their activities were different after the meteor hit and caused the population to gain weight.  Their personalities had not changed.  After an hour or so Sonia sat up some more to reposition herself and dropped her book on the floor.  She got up and went to bend down to get it but couldn't  at first.  Her belly seemed to be stopping her so she tried agian bending over even farther but lost her balance and fell flat on her face.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Manic turned their heads over and saw Sonia on the ground and asked, \"What just happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed her self up slowly but had grabbed her book before getting up.  She dusted herself off and said, \"I was trying to get my book off the floor but I bent over to far and fell.  Maybe we should watch how much we weigh, I mean we may be health with our insides and stuff.  But this might be a sign of future mobility issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia, your being parinoid, you gained a lot in the past week you just need to adjust.  Also the only thing we can't do is run, I heard of someone in the Downunder continent who weighed a good 600 pounds and could walk easy.  Only thing we need to get ready for is replacing the chairs and other furniture.\"  Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your right.  Well I'm gonna go start making dinner, it will be a nice surprise for mother.\"  Sonia said and turned and walked into the kitchen.  About 2 hours later after Aleena got home Sonia called everyone to the Dinning room.  She had made a four course meal that looked like it was Thanksgiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you shouldn't have, thanks sweetie.\"  Aleena said.  Sonic and Manic also thanked Sonia afterward.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down in their chairs there was a creaking noise from the chairs.  They didn't pay attention to it and started eating.  After finishing her third plate Aleena's rounded belly burst through her dress that had already grown too small and her chair crashed too the ground in pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we need to get new chairs,\" she said embarassed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, by the way did anyone notice we gained weight just over the corse of the meal?\" Manic inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude that's been happening for weeks.\" Sonic replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Manic said lowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia got up from her chair and helped her mother up and started to get the plates and take them. Later on the night just before the triplets went to bed Aleena said, \"Oh yeah I'm going to change the planet's dress code tomorrow for girls, bikini's are completely acceptable all the time.  The whole dress and regular clothes is getting out of hand.  I've been noticing other people are buying ten diffrent sizes per shopping.  Just wanted to let you guys know, good night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Mom.\" The triplets said and headed upstairs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you want to do tommrow,\" Sonic asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm how about we go for a hike in the woods.\" Manic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about the beach.\" Sonia suggested. </span></div></div>",

Knuckles was in the front, he was relatively small he had gained weight evenly over his body and looked to be only about 290.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonia long time no see, you look beautiful.\" Knuckles said and kissed Sonia on the cheek gently making her blush.  She stepped aside and said, \"You're looking nice too, come right in and hi Cyrus, how are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, thank you.  Only thing is this extra weight is a little annoying, I can't really reach my feet that well so parden the flip flops please.\" Cyrus said, he pointed at his large gut.

Sonia guessed he weighed about 270.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic, Manic we have some company.\" Sonia called out as they walked into living room Sonic and Manic got up and saw Cyrus and walked up to him and shook his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude how's it hanging?\" Manic asked Cyrus who replied, \"Pretty much great.

Mom cooked up a good meal for us all.\" Sonia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else nodded and they headed into the large elegant dinning room.  On the table were two turkeys, stuffing, corn and bottles of milk and soda.  Cyrus and Knuckles bowed to Aleena in a sign of respect for the Queen and then sat down at their seats opposite Sonia,  Manic, and Sonic.  Everyone started eating their food.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes Cyrus spoke, \"So anyone see the baseball match the other day, it was kind of funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, what was funny about it,\" Aleena asked politely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since everyone is so fat now, no one could really run except for a one or two people so it took so long that they cut it down to five innings and then there were a few batters that over swung and fell on their face.\" Cyrus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's one sport that seems to be on its way out.\" Sonia said with a grin on her face and ate some more of her turkey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate in silence for the next ten minutes before Knuckles said, \"Hey Sonia there's a play next Friday, want to go see it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"if its alright with my Mom,\" Sonia said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAleena nodded for a yes, she didn't say anything because she had her mouth full of stuffing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, then I'll pick you up at 6 PM next friday,\" Knuckles said with a happy tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey ate the rest of their meal in relative silence.  After finishing Knuckles got up and helped Aleena with the dishes as did Cyrus.  Aleena said,\" Thank you but you really don't need too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You highness its the least we can do after that excellent meal and for you having us over.\" Knuckles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they finished clearing the plates Sonia asked, \"So what do you guys want to do now?</span></div></div>",

The next thing he did was disguise himself, and it was very, very, hard to see threw it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic then show off his skills, with his guitar, and Manic joined in as a singer, the masked magisian had been very tough to beat and they needed all the help they could get. Finally Sonia played her piano for hours, performing many classical numbers. In the meantime Knckles and Cyrus watched, Knuckles keeping his eye on Sonia. \"She is so beautiful, I hope she can take first place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was very hard for the judges because everyone tried hard, but they could only pick so many out of the hundreds that were there. \"The first prise goes to: The Masked Magician, Second prise goes to Sonia, for performing well on so many classical music numbers, and third goes to Manic and Sonic, on their musical number.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later Knuckles congradulated Sonia. \"I'm wished you could have taken first in the contest, but the Masked Magician, he was amazing.\" Said Knuckles.<br>\r\n\"That man had to have been at least 43 or 44, considering how long he had been performong escapes.\" Said Manic <br>\r\n\"I have to agree with you on that bro.\" Said Sonic<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you won Sonia, how about victory dinner?\" Asked Knuckles <br>\r\n\"I'm for that, but let's go find mom.\" Said Sonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just bought some new furniture, and I'm glad you won Sonia.\" Said Aleena <br>\r\n\"If you plan on replacing your old furniture, then do you think I could take some of it for my house? I could use some.\" Answered Knuckles <br>\r\n\"Go right ahead.\" Said Aleena <br>\r\n\"Aleena I was wondering if I could take Sonia out for dinner? Would you mind if I did that?\" Asked Knuckles.<br>\r\n\"Yes you may.\" Answered Aleena <br>\r\n\"Now where should I take you Sonia?\" Asked Knuckles <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

The rest of their meal was peacefull, they talked about what they did recently and about various things.  After they finished up their meals Knuckles walked Sonia home.

She then got out of bed and showered, a newer and bigger bathtub was put in the bathroom, because of how Aleena, Sonic, Sonia, and Manic were putting on weight, but it did not matter to Sonia or any of the others, for that matter, and Sonia enjoyed it when the warm water went down her big belly, and all around the rest of her body. She then got out of the shower, dried off, and went down to have breakfast with her family. <br>\r\n\"Hey Sonic, Hey Manic, are you guys planning on going down to our summer home for a week?\" Asked Sonia.<br>\r\n\"We'd like too, but we can't.\" Answered Sonic.<br>\r\n\"Why can't you come with us.\" Asked Sonia.<br>\r\n\"Cyrus, was asking us if we could help him in his research on the meteor, and we said we would help him, and who is going to take care of the kingdom if all of us are at our summer house?\" Answered Manic.<br>\r\n\"You two will make great kings, and you Sonia will make a great queen, I'm glad to see that all of you are becoming more responsible.\" Said Aleena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Manic stayed around at home to take care of the Kingdom and to help Cyrus with his work. Sonia and Aleena the got on board the families private ship, and in three days they were down at their summer home. The waters were shallow, there was no people for miles, there was no noise, and everything was peaceful and quiet. Sonia and Aleena had fun swimming in the blue lagoons for hours, and they enjoyed taking long walks on the beach, and they dined on the native fruits, that grew in the island. The sun was setting and Aleena nor Sonia did not want to go swimming after dark, so they went back to the house and called it a night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia was having a good dream about Knuckles, and he was feeding her .<br>\r\n\"Knuckles, this is some of the best food I have ever tastes.\" Said Sonia, who was happily eating. \"Can you bring me anymore food, or is that it?\" <br>\r\n\"There is plenty more where that came from Sonia.\" Knuckles answered. <br>\r\nThen, Knuckles left the living room, and went into the kitchen, and got Sonia two plates filled with mashed potatoes covered with gravy, and two plates of corn on the cob, and she began to eat all off the food, and again she asked him. <br>\r\n\"Can you bring me anymore, that was great.\" As she licked her lips. <br>\r\nThe food kept coming and Knuckles continued to feed Sonia, until finall it came down to two chocolate covered layer cakes. \"For me, you shouldn't have done that Knuckles.\" Then Sonia ate the two chocolate covered layer cakes. <br>\r\n\"You sure are a good cook Knuckles. I only wish I had room for more.\" Said Sonia.<br>\r\n\"As long as you're happy Sonia, then I am happy.\" Said Knuckles .<br>\r\nSonia then woke up, and she found out that is was only a dream.<br>\r\n\"Sonia, breakfast is ready.\" Said Aleena<br>\r\n\"Okay mom.\" Said Sonia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home, Cyrus was able to find more information on the meteor and it's good effects on the body, and the results that he found were very pleasing. <br>\r\n\"There is more good effects in the stored fat than I thought, not too many people are getting sick as often, and there is a less of a need for cold medicine, drugs,  and surgery. It seems that if it is a small cut your, the cut will heal faster, if you are sick, your body can better fight off infection, and there is no high blood pressure.\"<br>\r\n\"So why am I finding it harder to gain more weight?\" Asked Sonic. <br>\r\n\"I would not worry Sonic, soon will start gaining weight like Manic and Sonia.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, and I'm glad we were able to help.\" Said Sonic.<br>\r\n\"But right now, I'm wondering how mom and Sonia are doing now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the summer house, Aleena and Sonia, continued to have fun, swimming, relaxing on the beach, and eating lots of the fruits that grew on the islands, After a week of living at the summer home, the returned to home and Aleena asked.<br>\r\n\"Was there any trouble while we gone.\" Asked Aleena.<br>\r\n\"No, there was no trouble at all, but I'm glad your back, and I have some good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

Sonia got some popcorn and sodas while Knuckles bought the tickets.  After they went into the auditorium showing the film and found a seat in the middle.  The chairs were somewhat tight due to the fact that the theater hadn't gotten their new seats yet.   The movie ended up being good for the first half hour but then got worse.  It was one of those movies where the commercials show every funny part in that movie and the rest sucked.  After the movie Knuckles bought Sonia an ice cream cone and they sat down near the beach for an hour and looked at the sun set and the reflection of it on the calm blue water.

She felt very comfy and full as she patted her belly.  Later on in the night she noticed that she was gaining weight faster than even her mother and was wondering why.   She realised this when she found herself having a cake as a snack.  \"I must be eating a lot between my meals\" She thought and went on eating her snack not really caring about that and then went up to her room and washed up and read a book for a little while and then went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up the next morning at about '7am and then got dressed and looked at herself in the mirror, she had gained a good 5 to 10 pounds over the night and had mostly gone to her rear and thighs.  She went downstairs to find only her mother was up at that time.  She had already made breakfast so Sonia joined her for breakfast.  They had a large stack of waffles with syrup and orange juice.  Just as Sonia finished eating her chair legs snapped in on themselves and she fell backwards.

They had steak, baked potatoes corn and carrots for dinner.  Aleena had assumed they would eat a lot so she made extra ahead of time and was right.  Sonia ended up having two medium sized steaks and three baked potatoes along with two servings of carrots. Sonic had three medium steaks, and three baked potatoes with a serving of carrots.  Finally Manic had two of each.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had dinner the three split a very large frosted chocolate cake along with a cherry cheese pie.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow you three ate a lot tonight.\"  Aleena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was great food.  Also we're all trying to put on some more weight.  We're also gonna be eating more to prepare for contests like Alice and Maggie do.\"  Manic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that sounds nice.\" Aleena said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four then headed into the living room and watched some TV for a few hours.  Before getting ready for bed Sonia and Sonic had a bag of cookies and milk for a snack.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore going to sleep Sonia was thinking about how great the last two days had been and how participating in more contests will be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

As they were still eating Aleena got a call from Maggie, and she asked if Sonic, Sonia, and Manic, could come over, and Aleena said that it would be okay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, Sonia went to her room and changed into a new dress, she was well over sixhundred pounds and so were Sonic and Manic, but none of them were bothered by the weight they had gained. Soon after they left the house, and they were on their way to see Maggie and Alice, but they also ran into Cyrus and Knuckles.<br>\r\n\"Hey Cyrus, hey Knuckles, what have you been up too?\" Asked Sonic. <br>\r\n\"Nothing too exciting, and how have you been.\" Asked Knuckles.<br>\r\n\"I'm doing just fine, and we plan to see Maggie and Alice today.\" Said Sonia, judging by the way Knuckles looked Sonia estimated that he weighed  fivehundred and thirty pounds, and Sonia could not take her eyes of of Knuckles belly, and knuckles could not take his eyes off of hers. <br>\r\n\"I may have to keep replacing my clothes every week, but I enjoy being fat.\" Answered Cyrus, as placed his hand on his big belly, and judging by the way he looked, he weighed five-hundred-and-forty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived at their friends house Alec said. \"There are more guests than we expected, but come on in.\" Said Alec<br>\r\nWhen Alice saw Manic, she gave him a big hug, and kissed him on the cheek. <br>\r\n\"How are you feeling Manic?\" Asked Alice.<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad I'm here.\" Answered Manic.<br>\r\nMaggie also gave Sonic a big hug and a kiss. and she spoke to Sonic. <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are here Sonic, and I'm glad you bought more friends over.\" Said Maggie.<br>\r\n\"I'm very glad too see you Maggie.\" Answered Sonic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey played games for a while, and watched movies. At around Noon they were all feelign very hungry. Maggie and Alice had made plenty of extra food in advance, and no one went hungry, they then went into the living room to relax. Manic sat next to Alice, Sonic sat next to maggie, Sonia sat next to Knuckles, and Cyrus and Alec sat in chairs. <br>\r\n\"That food was good, I mean really good.\" Said Manic <br>\r\n\"I'm glad you liked it.\" Answered Alice.<br>\r\n\"Well Knuckles, do you have any plans for today?\" Asked Sonia. <br>\r\n\"I'm so full, that I don't even want to get up.\" Answered Knuckles <br>\r\n\"I don't mind sitting her, I can put on more weight now.\" Said Sonic.<br>\r\n\"I can tell Sonic, and the belly suits you very well.\" Said Maggie.<br>\r\n\"You have been very good to us, but what happenned to your parents.\" Asked Sonia.<br>\r\n\"I'm hoping they did not wind up robotisized.\" Said Cyrus.<br>\r\nAlice and Maggie were still worried about there mom and dad, but one of them had to tell what happened.

There were two packs of the resistance that whent on a mission together and our's was part of it.  While most of the Adults and teens were on the mission the encampment was discovered and we had to scatter quickly.  Maggie and I were taken by some of the people from the mountain resistance and Alec was on the mission with Mom and Dad.  A few months later he finally tracked us down, he had been with our parents for a while until they go separated during another raid near the great sea.  We never could find our parents after that.\"  Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we've tried contacting former members of all the resistance groups but we were never succesfull.  After all it was hard to even find former members let alone leaders who would know everyone in their group along with how to contact them now.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, I've heard about that stuff happening...\" Sonic said sounding sad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least we have each other and Alec.  So its bad but not to horrible.  We hope we can find them one day but with each year it seems more likely that they died and weren't robotized, if they were we probably would have found them by now.\"  Alice added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room fell silent for five minutes.  After they turned the TV on agian and watched some more TV.  Alice got up a half hour later to get a snack and asked if anyone else wanted anything.  Sonia and Sonic said yes so Alice walked into the kitchen and gabbed a couple of large containers of chocolate icing(stuff you put ontop of cake.), spoons and milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You making a cake?\" Sonic asked surprised at first to see her just bringing containers of icing and milk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just felt like having something chocolate, if you want anything else I'll get it for you.\" Alice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks sounds good, just odd.\" Sonic said.  The three then ate the chocolate icing over the next twenty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sonia you have some chocolate on your mouth.\" Knuckles pointed out a little while after they finished eating.  She quickly rubbed it off with a napkin, embaressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry it was cute you couldn't have known.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then relaxed talked some more for a few hours.  At around seven they werre starting to get hungry agian so they headed out to a local buffete after Alec headed back to his house.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey six teens had to sit at a long table instead of a booth that  they would have perfered because of their size, they couldn't fit in the booths.  Sonic sat across from Maggie, Alice across from Manic and Sonia across from Knuckles.  Sonia had 3 steaks, three potatoes,  two jumbo sodas as well as corn, and carrots.  Sonic had four steaks, three chicken wings and peas.  Manic had two steaks, 3 chicken leggs,  stuffing and a large salad.  Knuckles had four steaks and some corn.  Alice had two chicken legs, 4 medium thickness slices of ham and corn.  Maggie had some roast beef, ham and carrots.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man that was some good food.\" Sonia said as she patted her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed, I still think I'm gonna have dessert though.\" Manic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHey lets make things a little fun since most of us here like the eating compitetions, who ever can eat the most dessert doesn't have to help pay for the meal.\" Maggie suggested.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in,\" Sonia said, \"Same here Alice and Manic.\" said at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll sit this out.\" Knuckles said and Sonic nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlice, Maggie, Manic and Sonia all went up and grabbed some cake, ice cream  and doughnuts.    Alice,  Manic and Sonia plowed through their first helping while Maggie was only able to eat about half of her helping and gave it to Alice.   After that Sonia and Manic made it through three more helpings while Alice only made it through two.  Sonia and Manic were feeling very full so they called it a draw and Alice, Maggie, Sonic and Knuckles all paid for the meal which was only about five dollars for each person due to it being an all you can eat buffete.  Alice and Maggie had to head to the clothing store quickly before it closed due to their extra weight stretching their clothes so Knuckles walked to the triplets home and kissed Sonia goodnight gave her a hug and headed back to his home.  They looked at the clock it was about ten at night and Aleena had gone to bed so the triplets all headed to their rooms  and got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting changed into her pajamas was actually a bikini she found more comfortable than her night gown Sonia looked at herself in her thee view mirror.  Her belly was huge and her arms were about a foot wide and her hips were about 3 feet wide.  Her butt was 3'3\" and stuck out a foot behind her. Her face had also filled out and had a double chin still.  After that she got into bed and fell asleep with a smile on her  face about how beautiful she seemed to herself and most defiantly Knuckles as well.</span></div></div>",

It was held in a better part of the food court with five long tables and benches where three constestents sat on each side giving room for their size. The first course was steak, corn and carrots over two plates.  All the contestants easily ate it.  The second was a large chicken leg bucket with potatoes and soda.  The third was a fish meal where a couple of contestants dropped out.  The fourth course was a sheppards pie, by that time several contestants were starting to show weight gain as their stomachs digested earlier food.   As the compitetion went on the  meals started to repeat but got larger in serving size.  By course 12 Sonic had dropped out along with several other competitors.  Sonia's dress was being strianed but she kept going on.  By the end of the fifteenth round Manic had dropped out and had gotten a much larger belly from the contest.  At that point it was only Sonia and two more people left.  Course 16 consited of 2 large hams, a large bowl of corn and five carrots.  The next three rounds were similar in content only changing what meat and sides were there.  In the 20th and final round they were given 8 large pizzas and five mozzarella sticks.  One contestant dropped out almost immeditatly but Sonia and the other, a female, orange cat held in.  In the end Sonia held out long enough to finish the last pizza, that the cat couldn't.  After  taking the last bite her dress tore off from the fifty pounds she had gained, luckily her bikini held up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't really embarresed after all it was her bikini and it was common for people to wear swim wear should their closes ever tear. Her belly stuck out two feet and her arms were at least a foot and a half thick.  Her thighs and rear were almost three feet wide and her legs about a foot thick near the ankles.  She walked up to the overseer to collect the prize money.  Sonic, Manic and Sonia then headed to the clothes store to get new clothes.  Sonia got  a dress that was five sizes larger than she needed as well as some new bikinis and Manic got some new vests.  Sonic was about a quarter the size of Sonia and Manic was about half.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did incrediabe Sonia.\" Cyrus said patting her on the back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Sonia replied after walking out of the changing the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I can't believe you put away that much.\" Manic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It takes a lot of will power and practice.\" Sonia said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what do you guys want to do now?\" Sonic asked.</span></div></div>",

Deryl then told how he and Alec were Snipers and how far they traveled into enemy held positions to save to rescue rescue fellow members of the restance and to take out the enemy loyal to Robotnic. <br>\r\nSonia began to tell how she was hipnontised into giving away thir base, and Maggie told how she was not to even enter Robotroplis, and how she was almost captured. <br>\r\nThe thing Alice and Manic had in common with each other is that they both knew how to pick pocket, pick locks, and steal things, it was not as easy as it was back in the day of the restance, but the skills still came in handy once in a great while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey visited and played games for a while and then it was 5:00 in the afternoon.

The girls also tended to be slightly fatter than the boys.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then all headed to the food court where the contest was being held.  The food court was huge, it had plenty of tables all large enough for 2 people to sit side by side comfortably.  There was a large stage at the center with a very long wooden table and wooden benches that were reinforced with steel.  There were already half a dozen people there registering for the contest.  Aleena went up and asked how many spots where avilable and there only 4.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who's gonna compete?\"  Manic asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should draw straws.\"  Aleena joked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea your highness.\"  Alec said and whent over to a food shop to get some straws.  Sonia, Knuckles, Alice and Aleena all got the longest straws so they went up and entered just in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck\" they could hear their friends and family shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the contest began.  The first course consited of dough nuts, muffins, and bagels.  There were a dozen of each.  Everyone ate them easily.   After that came the dozen pancakes with syrup and coffee milk.  Only one kid couldn't make it through that round.  After that they were all given large vanilla cakes with icecream.  Sonia,  Alice, and Aleena put it down no problem.  Knuckles however was having a little bit of difficulty.  During the following round that was made up of 5 ham and cheese sandwiches, a bag of potato chips and a soda Knuckles dropped out along with another person.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the seventh round it was only Sonia, Alice, Aleena and another female fox.  They all were very stuffed but kept putting down the food.  They were all starting  to get fatter from the digested food from earlier in the contest which was about 2 hours before.  The 8th round consisted of a large ham, stuffing, corn, carrots and some turkey slices.  Aleena was able to put down the ham and corn but then dropped out.   Alice was only able to finish the corn.   Sonia and the other contestent were both able to finish it.  Then for the final round they were each given a large ice cream sunday.   Sonia....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The addition to the house was starting to really take shape and Alice, Maggie and their family had taken a vacation to the mountians for those weeks as well.    So as a result the Royal family along with Knuckles had pretty much hung out at their house most of the time.  They all had gained a good amount of weight over the three weeks and people all across Mobius had pretty much adopted fourth meal as a true meal and was usually had either just before bed or around 11 at night.   Aleena also made a new law that no one item of food can cost over ten dollars so people never have to worry about not being able to afford food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was about eight in the morning and the family was having breakfast.  Each family member sat on one side of their new more square table in the kitchen due to their size.  Manic and Sonic all around were larger and a good two feet wider.  Aleena was about as wide as their old couch that could sit her and Sonia barely a few weeks ago.  He  neck was even starting to get fat along with her arms.  However her belly and hips were the fattest part of her body.    Sonia was almost as big as Aleena, maybe 50 or so pounds less.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So aren't Alice and Maggie coming home today?\" Aleena asked Sonia after eating another doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they are.  I wonder how they've been the past few weeks.\" Sonia said grabbing another box of doughnuts.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should go see them later.\" Manic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, they just got back after three weeks, I  think they'd like to have some down time before visitors though.\"  Aleena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I agree.\"  Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe family then finished up their meals and headed into the living room to watch some TV.   They had gotten two new sofas that very snuggly fit into the living room, which was a good sized room but not huge.   Sonic and Manic sat on the old one while Aleena and Sonia needed a sofa each to themselves.  They watched some news stories about local events and some sport events like vollyball, sumo wrestling and small eating contests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much we weigh.\"  Sonia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets go see.\" Aleena answered and got up off her sofa.  Sonic, Manic and Sonia all followed suit and walked to the master bath down the hall were there was a scale.  Sonia stepped on the scale first and Aleena did her best to lean down to read the scale numbers.  It read 980.   Sonic took his turn and it read 620, followed by Manic at 650.  Finally Aleena stepped on the scale and it said 1020.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you guys aren't that heavy.\"  Sonia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,  you guys do eat more and it does seem that girls seem to get fatter easier for some reason.\"  Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know before, any number over 110 would have bothered me but I feel proud of my weight now.  Aleena said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here Mom.\"  Sonia said.   As they left the master bathroom Aleena's hips brushed agianst the side of the door frame.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should get those builders to widen the doors Mom.\"  Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do Sonic, there's a high demand for remodeling of houses.  Its not fair to take carpenters away from already paying customers to work on our house just because we are royalty, that would look bad.\" Aleena said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then decided to head out so they had to put on their sandles.  Due to their bellies One had to help another put the sandels on.   Which took a little while seeing as moving on their knees wasn't  very easy for them due to their extra fat.  After about a half hour or so they had finally got the sandals on everyone perfectly.  They were feeling hungry so they decided to have lunch.  Sonic and Manic had ten ham and cheese sandwiches,  Sonia and Aleena had had a couple of cans of soup with a few grilled cheese sandwiches.  After lunch they decided to...</span></div></div>",

Aleena couldn't find one so the servents got her a portable mattress to provide a comfortable sitting surface.  Sonia noticed a few poles near each bed and asked what they were for.  Sonic said they were for helping them get up if servents weren't around and they had to get up quickly, like to go use the bathroom.  He admitted it was still hard but made it a lot easier.  It was mainly for Maggie and Alice since Sonic and Manic were lighter than them and seemed to be less mobiliy impared with getting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow this is comfortable.\" Sonia said relaxing back agianst a bunch of large pillows, \"Its not cramped at all, even on my butt.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic and Alice nodded in agreement.  The group talked for a while and watched Some TV.  There was a news report about the sudden issues with people getting up and getting dressed.  The news cast resassured people that its perfectly fine and walking won't become impossible ever, at worst it might seem more like a waddle or a slightly slower walk but mobility they had nothing to wory about in the long run.  They advised people to help out friends and family and to install poles near beds, sofa and in bathrooms to help them stand up.  Also they said people were working on things to help overcome the dressing issues for those who live alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours they were getting hungry so they decided to get some lunch and infomred the servents to begin preparing food.  Instead of having them go to the ktichen the servents thought they'd surprise them by bringing the lunch meals into the living room.  They all thanked the servents, they felt the should.  The servents always tried to stay around one ton or a ton and half so they would be mobile enough to help  in any way, yet be healthy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone dug in. Sonic had 10 large pizzas, five cakes and a bucket of deep fried chicken wings.  Manic had 15 tripple cheeseburgers, a dozen doughnuts, french fries and a bag of M &amp; Ms.   Sonia put down three large buckets of chicken wings,ten tripple cheeseburgers, two foot long hotdogs, a medium pizza(size of a large pizza from before meteor hit), and big bowl of pudding.  Maggie put down ten large pizzas, five foot long hot dogs, 3 tripple  cheeseburgers and a huge amount of fries.  Alice had 15 tripple cheeseburgers, french fries, and  three foot long hot dogs.  Aleena had what Alice had except a box of doughnuts and a medium pizza along with it.  They all had soda and plenty of it with their food.   It took them about an hour and half to eat all the food and they felt bloated after they finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great, I can't  believe you ate so much Maggie,\" Sonia said suprised, though they had diffrent food Maggie ate almsot as much as Sonia which was rare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was hungry and I wanted to pack on some pounds.\" Maggie said patting her enormous belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very very good.\"  Sonia said, thanks for letting us eat lunch here guys.\"  Sonia said laying back more, stuffed form her lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, any time sis.\" Sonic said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey talked for a while as they digested their food.  After they talked for a while they decided to head to the mall for clothes shopping, their underwear and swim wear was beginning to get tight on them, especially after their past couple of meals.  getting up was interesting to say the least.  Sonia and Maggie tried rolling off the beds but only landed up on their massive bellies showing off their large rear ends.  Sonic blushed a little bit as he helped his girlfriend up and Manic and Alice Helped Sonia up.  After that was all overwith the helped Aleena up, she had nothing to help her up seeing as the poles were only near the permanent seats and since her's was impromptu she lacked anything to help her off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the mall they found clothes rather easily.  Sonia picked up a violet, yellow and blue pair of panties and bras along with a few bikinis.  Alice preffered bikinis only because then she was always ready to swim if she wanted to.  She picked up some blue, red stripped, poke a doted white and red two piece bikinis.  Maggie picked up a mix of bikinis and traditional underwear, mainly shades of orange, pink and white.  Aleena decided to pick up a few one piece swim suits with stripes, and two piece bikinis' of various colors, like Alice she prefered bikinis.  Sonic and Manic just picked up some gloves, sandles and sunglasses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they......</span></div></div>",

They all started eatting chicken and pizza first first , and then they went on to have steak and BBQ ribs. After eatting that, they ate fish, Pork Chops and the other foods at meal. For dessert they all ate Ice Cream which included all the flavors, and the were given five cakes each, covered in frosting, Sonia wished she could have more, but in order to be fair, they were all given five each.

The living room doubled as a good guest room and Maggie's fat made it perticularly annoying walking up stairs she used it many times if she was very tired and didn't feel like making the difficult climb up the stairs.  Sonia sat up and noticed she had put on a good fifty pounds from the huge meal all going to her butt, sometimes it was hard to tell when they gained weight because of the buildings and planet scaling up.  The others woke up and Alice, Sonic and Manic all came downstairs to have breakfast in the living room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor breakfast they had ten courses.  pancakes, waffles, bacon, sausages and eggs alogn with milk and coffee.  Each course was pretty big too.  Sonia thanked them for the meal agian, she also began to realize how much weight she would probably gain in this one month.  After the servants helped them get changed before they headed out to Alec's house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a very good\" Sonia said patting her huge belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the servents are great cooks.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half hour of walking they got to Alec's house there they were greeted by Marie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, what a wonderfull suprise.  How are you?\" Marie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, you?\"  Sonia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.  Kyle's been crying a little bit lately.\"  Marie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they got in they sat down on the sofa's in the living room and talked for a while about movies and TV shows before playing a game of Risk.  The game lasted a few hours and Sonia won, it was pretty close though.  After that they played a game of life while talking about their time in the resistance again.  They after that realized they hadn't had lunch so they got the servents to make them a big lunch of many cheese burgers , fries and hot dogs.   After that Kyle was starting to cry a lot and Alec was tired because of lack of sleep the night before so the friends decided to head back to let Alec, Marie, Kyle and Aleena have some rest and time to calm down Kyle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got home they decided to have some sumo matches which was interesing.  Especially for Maggie when she fell onto her huge belly and couldn't get up untill Sonia, Alice and Sonic went over to help lift her up due to her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys, that was kinda embaressing.\" Maggie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, at least you have that big belly to soffen the fall.\"  Sonic said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie agreed, they then decided to watch a movie till dinner, as they waited for the meal to be made they saw that there was going ozone a high heat alert day the next day so it was recommended everyone stay indoors the next day and only go out side for emergencies and as breifly as possible.

Its the best place to go and the sooner we find out what the issue is the quicker we can get back to relaxing and having fun.\"  Alice said as she brushed by another person.  Even with the expansion of the planet they were still pretty packed at time the planet seemed to be scalling at just barely the right pace for the public's weight gain.  It took them a good forty  five minutes to walk to the weather station.  When they got there it turned out most of the people working there hadn't gotten there yet so they had to wait outside for half an hour until the head meteoroigist got there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we were wondering why is the tempurture so hot lately?\"  Sonia asked the Meteorogist politely.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked puzzled for a moment and directed them to a FAQ sheet on the desk, he apologized for not having the time to explain it to them personally but he was very busy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what does it say sis?\"  Manic asked as Sonia read it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apprently since the planet is getting bigger its absorbing more of the sun's rays so its heating up a bit.  It does say that this is temporary and by next summer the planet will start having normal summer temperatures again.  The same is said for winter of this year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting.....I wonder how much we'll weigh then.\" Knuckles said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably at least double what we weigh now, heh getting up should be fun then.\" Sonia said with a chuckle.  .  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then decided to head to the ice cream shop to get something to eat. they ended up eating 30 gallons of double chocolate ice cream covered with hot fudge and artificial sweetened cherries.  After finishing her 'snack' Maggie's bench broke and she fell on her enormous butt.  Knuckles' bench suffered at the same time too.  Sonia and Alice helped up Knuckles who was hard for even them to lift up and Sonic and Manic helped Maggie up which required a lot of work, just because she was so fat and their arm fat did make it some what difficult bend them all the way.up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tottally worth it that was great food.\"  Maggie said, \" So now what do you guys want to do?\"</span></div></div>",

They woke up at 6:00am the next day.

Sonia, Manic, Alice, Maggie and Sonic all entered the contest.  Knuckles decided to sit it out and Aleena couldn't make it due to supervising the work on their house.  The contest went on untill the final contestant dropped out and the rounds all had a lot of food.  One round was like 3 courses for Sonia's regular meals.  There were fifteen competitors and each time one dropped out their remaining food was broken up evenly among the others.  So by the time it was down to Sonia, Maggie and another person the courses were absolutely huge.  This was after 40 rounds and most of the contestants didn't forfit until the late round 20s.   Maggie ended up winning by continuing for one extra round after Sonia and the other contestant dropped out in round 48.  She was so full and bloated she had a hard time walking home afterwards.  They all went home after and spent the rest of the day relaxing digesting, and later eating like normal.  Due to how much she ate Maggie had put on a lot of weight by the time they had went to bed and most of it went to her belly.<br>\r\nlike the night before they slept on the mattresses in the living room.</span></div></div>",

After that they got dressed into their snow gear and had a couple of snow ball fights.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonia and Aleena were on one team and Sonic and Manic were on the other.

The other times they won out of shear luck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that they made a few snow men that complete with pebbles for eyes and a carrot for a nose.   After that they went inside and had a large lunch of sandwiches, Sonia and Aleena had  6 and Sonic and Manic had 7.  After that they played some card games inside for a better part of the afternoon.  Sonia later decided to soak in the hot tub outside for a little while  Aleena started to make dinner.

Mighty looked at all of the different types of sushi, he wasn\u2019t sure switch to try. So he picked up the ones that looked with shrimp and tuna on them, he also got a bowl of Tuna Steak Rice. (Teriyaki tuna slices topped on Japanese steamed rice) He then walked over and got a table for him and honey.

She got over to the table sat all her food on the table and un-stacked all of the dishes. After she sat down mighty started to clap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh? Why are you clapping?\u201d She asked him a little confused <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing!

After awhile mighty finished his food and just watched honey eat all of the food she got for herself. After finishing her sushi she started on her curry, then she went on to her oyakodon , then she ate her donburi bowl. While she was eating her kushiage she looked over at mighty, he was just watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Is there something on my face?\u201d She asked him wondering why he was looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I just love watching you eat\u201d he said with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bet your wondering why I\u2019m eating so much? \u201cShe asked him finishing her last kushiage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.yeah!\u201d He said now a little curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Honey was standing there wear a red bathrobe, looking over him with a look of worry on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ok mighty?\u201d she asked him as she rubbed on of his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI had the greatest dream ever, it about a me helping a beautiful angel.\u201d He said  with a smile looking up at her while taking her hand into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney blushed that what he said. \u201cStop your making me blush.\u201d She said as she been down and gave mighty a kiss on the cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty I remember you were telling me about yourself at dinner last night, while I was eating and..\u201d She started to ask him a question, when suddenly mighty sat and  spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou could hear me though all that eating?\u201d He asked her jokingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a stern look at this remark. Mighty then sat back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! I\u2019m listening?\u201d He said with a look of apology on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I was saying, you said you live in the forest. Right?\u201d She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, why?\u201d He asked wondering about her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do you sleep in a small house or a cabin or something?\u201d She asked another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually I live in a tent.\u201d He said a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA tent! What do you do during a storm?\u201d She asked him a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell sometimes I hide out in caves and then after the storm I have put my tent back up.\u201d he said a little embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s horrible! Mighty how would you like to move in with me?\u201d She asked him feeling sorry for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ..I don\u2019t know honey, are you ok with me moving in?\u201d He asked her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we can pretty say were boyfriend and girlfriend now right?\u201d She said as she laid down beside him on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 when you put it that way\u2026.OK!\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYay!\u201d She giggled as she rolled over on to mighty and started to kissing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty felt her fat body press against him. She felt soft and warm. She then rolled off of him and got off of the bed. She then walked back over to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna take a shower now. Do you want to take one when I\u2019m done.\u201d She asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure!\u201d Is all he could say as he laid there looking at her lovingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney  giggled to herself as she went into the bathroom and closed the door. Mighty Then thought about breakfast. Should he make her a big breakfast or take her out somewhere to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He then remembered a donut shop that delivers donuts to your house or workplace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up and picked up the phone on the nightstand by the bed ,looked up the number in the phone book, and dialed it. He listened as it rang, until suddenly someone answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood morning! Suzie\u2019s donut shop, this is lucy, may I take your order?\u201d asked lucy in a sweet voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I would like to order your sunrise special.\u201d He said as he looked at the ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! Is this for a broad meeting or something?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d He wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we usually make these for broad meeting or other a events. The special comes with 80 donuts and 2 gallons of chocolate and regular milk.\u201d She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm\u2026yeah were having a meeting ..with a lot of people.\u201d He lied <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right we\u2019ll have it delivered in no time.\u201d She said cheerfully <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter mighty gave her the address and a thank you, he hung up the phone. Honey then walked out of the bathroom in her bathrobe and her hair up in a towel wrap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe showers all your\u2019s mighty\u201d She said as she winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, after I finish I got a surprise for you for breakfast this morning.\u201d He said to her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCool, I\u2019ll start getting dressed then, my sweet armadillo\u201d She said as she bent down and gave mighty a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their early morning kiss, mighty went into the bathroom and took a shower. A few minutes later he walked out of the bathroom drying  himself off with a towel. He then looked over at honey who had just finished getting dressed. She was wearing a red t-shirt with a big black cat paw print  shape on the front of it, a pair of blue jeans and some red and white sneakers. She was sitting there waiting for him, while she finished brushing her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d She asked him as she sat down her hair brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeautiful!\u201d He said throwing the towel into the clothes basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s this surprise you were telling me about? She asked as mighty was putting his shoes back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to go into the living room for this! It\u2019s gonna be here any minute now!\u201d He said as he walked over to honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty then did something that took honey by surprise. He picked her up, sweeping her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Your really strong!\u201d The feline said a little shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey don\u2019t call me mighty for nothing!\u201d He said as he carried her into the living room without breaking a sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty rushed to the living room and sat honey down on the couch. Just then the door bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Mighty said as he ran over to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what were having for breakfast?\u201d She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty came back with 8 boxes stacked on top one another, with two bottles of milk sitting on top of them. He then started to set the boxes on the coffee table and opening them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonuts!\u201d She squealed with joy. She started grabbing donuts left and right, stuffing herself with the pastries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty quickly grabbed one chocolate donut for himself and poured himself a glass of milk. After eating his donut and drinking his milk, he just sat there by honey as she continued to go thought the boxes of donuts. She stopped once and a while and drink some milk, but then continue eating. When she got to her 5th box of donuts, mighty climbed behind honey and wrapped his arms around her waist, (Well half way around her waist, considering how wide she was!) and started kissing her neck. Honey stopped eating for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha ha! Mighty stop I\u2019m ticklish!\u201d She said giggling.  \u201cLet me finish eating and then we can play!\u201d She said as she stuffed another donut in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, she had finished eating all of the donuts. All that was left on the coffee table was some empty boxes and two empty bottles of milk. She was now just sitting there licking her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you enjoy your breakfast?\u201d He asked her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep! Thank you mighty!\u201d She said as she rubbed her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to play now?\u201d He said jokingly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney then looked over at him and gave him a evil smirk. This sent a chill up his spine. Without warning she pounced him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAck!\u201d is all mighty could say before honey came down on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe showered him in kisses and nuzzled him sweetly. Mighty was overwhelmed with joy and not to mention her huge belly. After a few minutes she rolled over with him in her arms. The two laid there for sometime until honey looked over at the clock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh it\u2019s 9 o\u2019clock! I got to get going or I\u2019ll be late for work!\u201d She said as she sat up and sat mighty on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty looked at her in confusion.\u201d You have a job?\u201d He asked as he grab the boxes on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell yeah! Gotta make a living somehow!\u201d She said as she grabbed the empty bottles on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked outside and stuffed the trash into a trash can she had by the backdoor. She then locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou wanna come with me and see what I do at my job?\u201d She asked her boyfriend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! What do you do for a living anyway?\u201d He asked her curiously  </span></div></div>",

Today me and the others are going to have a photo shoot for the \u201cEXTRA\u201d clothing companies winter apparel \u201d She explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEXTRA? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of that company before.\u201d He said after thinking of the name for a sec.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big and tall store, you would probably know more about it if you were big or tall.\u201d She said as she bent down to look mighty in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I see! But what do you mean by the others?\u201d He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere are other models other than me, some are big like me and some are tall like Thomas.\u201d She explained as she stood back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhose Thomas?\u201d He asked while walking along side his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s a male model I work with. Trust me you\u2019ll know which one he is when we get there.\u201d She said as she looked at her watch. Her eyes went wide for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of getting there, we need to get going or I\u2019m gonna be late!\u201d She said as she started to walk a little faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, just give me directions on how to get there!\u201d He said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoney gave him a confused look. \u201c What do need directions for WAH!\u201d She yelped as mighty lifted her of her feet once again with the greatest ease. He then started running down the sidewalk into the city carrying her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI never seam to get used to this!\u201d She giggled as her boyfriend carried her off to their destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout twenty minutes later, they arrived at the studio. At the front door mighty let honey step back on to the ground and the two walked in. Inside they saw some of the big male models and some tall female models were leaving, as they have finished their photo shoot for the catalog . Mighty watched as some of the m a orange bear, a blue penguin, and a green elephant waved at honey as they left. He than saw some of the tall and thin female models walk by. One was a red flamingo and the other was a purple horse, they too waved at honey on the way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo where\u2019s this Thomas guy you were talking about?\u201d He asked looking around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would be me.\u201d Said a voice out of no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty looked around the room, but still didn\u2019t see anyone. Honey than pointed behind mighty. Mighty turned around to a pair of long legs wearing black pant\u2019s. He looked up to see the legs belonged to a yellow giraffe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh\u2026Hi!\u201d he said holding out his hand for a hand shake nervously. The giraffe  bent down and shook hands with mighty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty this is Thomas, he\u2019s one of the other models that work here, Thomas this is my boyfriend Mighty!\u201d She said as she introduced the two to each other.<br>\r\n\u201cNice to meet you Mighty. I\u2019ll see you guys later!\u201d He said as he stood back up and walked to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk! See ya later Thomas!\u201d She said back to Thomas as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! You didn\u2019t tell me he was a giraffe!\u201d Mighty said still a little shocked by how tall Thomas was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you didn\u2019t ask!\u201d She said as she walked into the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked inside, where three other female big models were waiting. They waved at honey as they walked up. The first one was an white artic fox with blue eyes and blonde hair. She was wearing a black dress with black shoes. She was the same size as honey. The second model was a red bunny with blue hair red eyes. She was wearing a blue t-shirt with a carrot print on the front, a pair of blue jeans and white shoes. She was about 100 pounds heavier than honey. The last model was a regular colored panda with pink hair and brown eyes. She was wearing a red dress with sandals. She looked like she weighted about 650 pounds, making her the biggest of the models there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMighty this is Crystal the fox, Ruby the rabbit, and Lily the panda!\u201d She introduced him to the other models. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi I\u2019m Mighty the armadillo! Nice to meet yo..aahh!\u201d Mighty yelped as Ruby and Lily pulled him into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoney he\u2019s so cute!\u201d Ruby said as she hugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe looks really strong too!\u201d Lily said feeling one of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMighty was trying his best to get free from the grip of the two large and lovely ladies as he was starting to blush. Crystal then walked over and rubbed one of his ears. This made him blush wildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs this cutie your boyfriend Honey?\u201d Crystal asked smiling at honey to see if their over welcoming to mighty was starting to make her angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes he is, and he\u2019s with me so hands off!\u201d She said angrily as she grabbed mighty to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry!\u201d Ruby and Lily said together with a sad look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Honey, we were just messing with ya!\u201d Crystal said teasing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just don\u2019t do it again.\u201d Honey said claming down a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe promise!\u201d The three said together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a blue ocelot walked in wearing black running shoes and white gloves. He was carrying a box with camera equipment in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like were about to get started, Mighty how about you go sit on that couch over there and watch.\u201d Honey said pointing at the couch over by the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but who is that?\u201d He asked pointing at the ocelot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Snap the ocelot, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to take are pictures for the catalog, he\u2018s also are boss.\u201d Honey said  as she and the other ladies went into the dressing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh ok, well I\u2019ll just go over here and watch.\u201d He said as walked over to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sat down he noticed there was someone else sitting on the other side of the couch. He was a big yellow polar bear wearing a red ski cap, green scarf,  brown gloves and boots. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi are you a model here?\u201d He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear gave him an angry look and growled a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a no. Anyway I\u2019m Mighty the armadillo, what\u2019s your name? He asked now hoping the bear wouldn\u2019t kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBark the polar bear!\u201d He said with a gruff voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo why are you here?\u201d He asked  quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy girlfriend works here.\u201d He said as he crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh! Which one is she?\u201d He asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrystal, you know the fox who was rubbing your ear earlier!\u201d He growled at him as he stood up and walked over to Mighty ready to snap him in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook man, I not trying take your girlfriend, I promise. She did that to tease my girlfriend Honey\u201d He said trying to clam Bark down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBark looked at him for a second, thinking about what he just said. He than sat back down and relaxed a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright. I believe you.\u201d He said as he crossed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! You\u2019re just gonna take my word for it?\u201d Mighty asked him shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! She loves to joke around with Honey all the time.\u201d He said as he laughed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see!  Well anyway, let\u2019s start over then!\u201d He said as he held his hand out.\u201d I\u2019m Mighty the armadillo, nice to meet you!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBark shook Mighty\u2019s hand.\u201d I\u2019m Bark the polar bear! Nice to meet you too!\u201d He said a little bit nicer tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the girls came back, wearing clothes you would wear in the winter. Coats, jackets, warm hats, etc. Snap had his camera ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right ladies let\u2019s get started. Ruby, Honey we\u2019ll start with you two first.\u201d He said motioning over to the background they had set up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls would walk up and pose, then go to the dressing room, change into different outfits, come back out and do a different pose, while Snap shot pictures of them. Mighty and Bark just sat back and watched as their ladies did their job. After a few hours they finished all of the winter clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnap look over to the women \u201cAll right ladies were almost done. You just need to model\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Bark the polar bear is also from \"Sonic the fighters\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Bark_the_Polarbear\" target=\"_blank\">http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/Bark_the_Pol...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

People began to leave her Tributes, these tributes were usually food, savory and fattening, and each came in larger portions with every good deed she performed as Queen, making life easier for the masses while keeping them safe, safe from both the hostile powers such as the Eggman Empire, and the Dark Legion on the outside, and the criminals among them on the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore, physical activity had been cut to a minimum, her newfound busy schedule signing orders, attending dinner parties with the elites of both her own new kingdom and foreign dignitaries, these parties became as lavish as they were frequent. Lupe didn't really have as much time for herself as she used to. Certainly not enough time to exercise away all the unwanted calories she acquired from eating the tributes which she loved for she insisted on being benevolent to her wolves, and the lavish dinners, which she felt an obligation to enjoy given the important matters discussed at such events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously these combined features resulted in her gaining a considerable amount of weight. Prior to the beginning of her reign as queen began after she was chosen by the entire tribe to be the queen, she weighed in at about 150 pounds, which by wolf standards and for a woman standing 6 feet tall is actually not very much, quite normal even.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the 15 months since she had been made Queen she had gained 75 pounds, bloating her up to 225 pounds. Enough to make her a certified BBW by standards that those who are not Mobian wolves would consider \"normal\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupe is still indecisive about how to feel about this change in lifestyle so she has done her best to maintain her figure. At first it was easy, but with each passing policy measure that brought joy to her subjects, and fancy dinner with an ambassador, the task became increasingly difficult as tributes flooded in and her daily routine became increasingly languid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently Lupe is resting on the throne, a modest by most standards made of Wood and furs for the closest analogy to the aesthetics of her kingdom was what could best be described as Viking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was poking her now pudgy belly, wondering how much harder it was going to get to not put on weight, when one of the guards interrupted her thoughts with an announcement. \"My Queen, some citizens have arrived to offer tribute.\" At hearing this Lupe sighed this was the 2nd time today, oh well what at least whatever it is will make a decent... no wait make that decadent lunch. \"Very well, show them in.\" she commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe citizens offering tribute were...</span></div></div>",
