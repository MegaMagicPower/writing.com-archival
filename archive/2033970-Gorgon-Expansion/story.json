Now, what story would you like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever Anger a Succubus - Jen is a easily pissed off, loner hybrid (of a diamondback rattler and a cobra) gorgon living in a city of monsters. One day, she gets into a fight with a succubus and ends up making fun of the succubus's large breast. Angered, the succubus puts a curse on Jen as revenge. Now Jen's breasts are getting bigger and heavier by the day. The only way to stop them is to apologize. But the succubus has vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScience Happens - Laura is a king cobra gorgon who works at a laboratory. One day, while working, she accidentally spills a mixture of chemicals onto her breasts. Later that day, she discovers the chemicals are making her breasts grow. Realizing the potential, she sells the mixture to a group trying to end world hunger and becomes a millionaire. She is now living the good life, but has one problem: her breasts won't stop growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Island of a Single Wish - Victoria is a black mamba gorgon on a flight to Hawaii. The plane's engines fail and it crashes into the ocean, killing everyone except Victoria. She washes up on a deserted island, alone and hungry. While trying to survive, she discovers that the island grants her one wish. She wishes for her breasts to grow and fill with milk, thinking that it will end her thirst. But there's one problem: the wish wasn't specific, and now not only will her breasts not stop growing, but she can't lactate. Now she must try to survive on the island with her ever growing bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuxom Sonata - Julia is an anaconda gorgon and a lounge singer in 1920's London. One night, after a show, her boss approaches her with bad news. The club she works at is not drawing in more patrons, and if things don't pick up soon, the club will close for good. Desperate to save the club, Julia looks for an answer. She learns of an amulet that grants the user incredible singing abilities, but at a random cost. Finding it, Julia's singing becomes incredible and the club's popularity skyrockets. But she soon learns what the cost is: every time she sings, her breasts get bigger and fill with milk that she can't lactate.</span></div></div>",

Whenever something negative happened to her, she got into a fight with somebody. She was grumbling to herself and along the way, she didn't see a sign that said \"Don't Walk\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn nearly got her run over by a gargoyle on a motorcycle. \"Watch where you're going dickhead!\" yelled Jen. \"Stupid rock for brains gargoyle! I oughta punch that beak in.\" On the other side of the road, Jen was slithering down when entered a grocery store where she wasted no time in arguing with the minotaur clerk. \"Five skulls for a damn melon! You rip off artist!\" \"I don't make the prices ma'am,\" said the minotaur man. \"Please calm down.\" However the minotaur grunted because Jen grabbed him by the shirt collar and had her snakes hiss in his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen here, buster,\" said Jen. \"I didn't come here to get ripped off! I'm gonna take my business elsewhere dumbass!\" With that Jen was just out the door when she bumped her face against something big and soft. She rubbed her face and saw a tall red skinned succubus woman with gold eyes, silver hair, large E-Cup breasts with a massive butt. Jen had bumped her face into the succubus girl's breasts and instantly became enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going you walking udder! Look at those things! You could poke somebody's eye out with those things. I mean, it's disgusting how people leave those things hanging about. Try reduction surgery you freak.\" Jen pushed the succubus to the side and then left the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus got up and rubbed blood off her lip before she gave a glare. \"What a rude and unpleasant gorgon,\" said Antala. \"I'll fix her.\" The succubus chanted as she started to cast a spell. At that moment, Jen was in a diner and tossed her order into a werewolf waitress's face. \"I said no mayonnaise you jerk! Everybody in this city is an idiot except...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jen grunted and held her chest as her breasts started to throb. \"What the?!\" she yelled. \"Ack!\" Jen's breasts throbbed and soon they were the size of...</span></div></div>",

The memories came flooding back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on a plane to Hawaii when all of a sudden, the engines failed. The plane went into a nose dive into the ocean. Victoria was thrown from her seat and landed in the water. She saw the island and swam for it. She saw that everyone else on the plane were dead, so she was alone. She reached the island shore when she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the memories ended, she stood up to her full 6'2'' height. Victoria was not a normal person. She was a gorgon based on the Black Mamba snake. She was covered from head to toe in shiny, silver scales, and had Black Mamba snakes for hair along with black eyes. The inside of her mouth was inky black (which is how the Black Mamba gets it's name) and she had sharp front fangs. She had an hourglass figure, but she was bigger up top. She was wearing a blue tee-shirt that was ripped and black shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked around the island, which she guessed was fairly big, she realized something: she was both thirsty and starving. The swim from the plane wreck to the island drained her. She would have to try and find food soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could start, however, something weird happened. The sand in front of her started shifting. As she watched it, she realized it was making words. When it was done, it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Welcome to the Island of a Single Wish. Here, you may make one wish and one wish only. You may not take back your wish.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was surprised. Wishes shouldn't be real. Then again, she was a gorgon, so she believed anything. She could wish for anything. But as she thought, her thirst got to her. She looked down at her breasts, then had an idea. She said her wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my breasts would grow and fill with milk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the wish left her mouth, she had a realization: she could have used her wish to get off the island. As she cursed herself for being stupid, a warmth came over her. Her wish was being granted. Suddenly, she felt her breasts begin to grow. She could also feel them filling up. Eventually, they reached the size of...</span></div></div>",

Her shirt had completely ripped apart from the growth. Each breast was the size of a bean bag chair. And they were extremly heavy. She could feel the milk sloshing around inside them. While she felt stupid for wasting her wish, she was a little happy. At least now, she had something to drink. So she sat down to begin lactating so she could drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n45 minutes later, nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria was confused. She had done everything she could think of to lactate, but nothing worked. The milk just refused to come out. She sat there thinking. Why wasn't this working? Then she realized: when she had wished to fill with milk, she forgot to specifiy that she wanted to lactate it. She smacked her palm to her forehead. She now had massive breasts filled to the brim with milk, but she couldn't lactate them. And she couldn't take back her wish, so she was stuck with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she cursed herself, she saw something out of the corner of her eye. There was a small spring to her left, and it was filled with clear water. Finally, something to drink. Slowly, she got up. It was much more difficult with her heavy breasts. She made her way over to the spring. Kneeling down, she scooped up a handful and drank. The water was heavenly. She drank from the spring until her thirst was finally quenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith difficulty, Victoria stood back up again. With her thirst dealt with, she now had two tasks ahead of her: find food so she doesn't starve to death, and build a shelter that will fit her. But what to do first?</span></div></div>",

She chose that for her main shelter location. It offered protection from potential rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, she had to find branches for the foundation. She didn't have an ax, so she had to find branches on the ground. Searching wasn't easy. It got harder to see, and her now massive breasts made it hard to move and bend over. But she did manage to locate several large branches. She brought them back and set them up so that they made a crude framework for her shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she needed something to act as covering. Looking to the sea, she could see that some supplies were floating to the island, but they were still a ways away. So she had to make due with what she had. She managed to locate some loose bushes and was able to use those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she was done. Looking over her crude shelter, she was satisfied. Climbing in, she lied down on her now massive breasts for support (at least they were good for something) and, using a leafy branch, went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she woke up with a backache from her uncomfortable sleep.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was an average day in Screamtown. Screamtown was a town that was inhabited by monsters of mythology that were as big as skyscrapers. However, unlike other parts of the monster world, the monsters of Screamtown lived in peace with humans that would've been eaten anywhere else. Curiously Screamtown was split into five parts. Besides the center of town, there were four corners that were locked in only one season regardless of the time of year. Our story takes place at a bakery in Springtime Street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe proprietress was Maddie Thurman, a 915ft tall long gorgon girl. Maddie was a chubby gorgon with purplish skin and lavender colored rattlesnakes for hair. Unlike most gorgons, she had a 1000ft long rattlesnake's tail where her legs would normally be, making her look more like a naga than a gorgon. Because she was a gorgon, Maddie had to wear a special pair of gorgon proof sunglasses or she'd turn anyone who looked into her eyes to stone. Madeline was at the time working with some bread dough as her human assistant Rick was gathering blueberries to put into the mix. It was a rather slow day and Maddie's pet gargoyle beast was asleep right near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the beast quickly woke up as somebody entered the shop. It was Latanya Bull, an 1110ft tall and obese green furred minotaur. Latanya had a hunched over back and brown hair that was going gray prematurely. While she wore a black shirt and purple jacket, her massive udder made it impossible for Latanya to wear pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Maddie,\" said Latanya. \"What's up?\" \"Oh,\" said Maddie as she looked up at the ceiling. \"There's three light bulbs, some wallpaper...\" \"Maddie,\" said Rick. \"She means how are you doing.\" Maddie was sweet but she wasn't exactly the smartest monster. \"Oh,\" says Maddie. \"Well, things could be better. Haven't had much business today. I highly doubt dieting has anything to do it. This is Scream Town. The monster girls are either amazons or the size of sumo wrestlers.\" \"I see,\" said Latanya. \"Listen, Maddie. I found something growing in my garden that I thought you'd be interested in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLatanya reached into her jacket pocket and took out a weird piece of fruit that looked like two orbs stuck together. It was bright pink in color and had strange swirl marking on it and white patches. \"That's a fruit?\" asked Rick. \"It looks like a pair of boobs.\" Latanya adjusted her glasses to take a closer look as Latanya instinctively closed her eyes. \"It's okay, Latanya, I'm not taking my sunglasses off. That is a nice fruit. What is it?\" \"Hell if I know,\" said Latanya. \"Freya's the one  in the family who specializes in fruit. I grilled that sister of mine and she said she never saw a fruit like this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm,\" said Maddie. \"I wonder how it would taste in a pie. How much do you want for it, Latanya?\" Latanya shrugged her shoulder. \"I don't know? Twenty skulls?\" Maddie opened her cash register to take out a 20 skull bill and handed it to Latanya in exchange for the fruit. However, the moment Latanya handed Maddie the fruit, Maddie's gargoyle beast stared at the fruit and growled. \"What's wrong, Caliban?\" asked Rick. The gargoyle beast barked loudly and hissed at the fruit. \"You might want to take him to the vet, Maddie,\" says Latanya. \"Crazy gargoyle dog. Barking at fruit. See you later, Madeline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie however just looked at the fruit with a smile and took out a knife. \"I wonder how this would taste in a pie.\" Maddie took a slice as big as Rick was and Rick saw a strange white juice come out of the fruit. \"Are you sure you should eat that, Maddie?\" asked Rick. \"It could be poison.\" \"Rick,\" said Maddie. \"I'm a gorgon with venomous snakes for hair. Poison can't hurt me. And besides, I'd be the first to know if it was poison.\" Maddie bit into the slice of fruit and ate it while Rick watched for the verdict and Caliban looked on and growled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It tastes a little too sweet,\" said Maddie. \"But otherwise it's not bad.\" Maddie then cut away at the fruit to extract a few seeds. \"I think I'll try to grow it myself so I don't have to keep bothering Latanya.\" \"I don't know, Boss,\" said Rick as he stood on Maddie's thumbnail. \"I don't think Caliban likes you eating that fruit.\" Maddie but the fruit into five pie pans before mashing it up and pouring the batter on for the crust. \"I'm not eating all of it, Rick. I'm going to sell it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick knew that arguing with his skyscraper sized boss would get him nowhere, so he shrugged his shoulders as Caliban let out a whimper. \"I think you're trying to tell your master something,\" said Rick. \"Aren't you, Boy.\" The giant dog-like creature let out a moan and nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie had exactly five customers that day and each one bought one of the five pies. The first was the mail carrier, Estelle de Quimper. Estelle was a 975ft lou carcolh, a hybrid monster of a dragon and a mollusk. She had the head of a dragon but the body of a giant violet snail with arms and legs and a spiked shell on her back. \"Thanks, Maddie,\" said Estelle. \"You don't know what a pain it is to have to be the one who chips in for pie and cake for everyone at the post office. Can't they bring their own damn sweets. What kind of pie is this anyway?\" Maddie shrugged her shoulders. \"Heck if I know.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's second customer of the day was Cassidy Voltaire, a 925ft tall vulture harpy with pewter gray feathers and grayish brown hair. She wore nothing but a pair of leg warmers because she ran the Screamtown gym with her daughter, Libby, a pigeon harpy. \"I never thought I'd see you buying a pie, Cassidy.\" Said Rick. Cassidy shrugged her shoulders. \"Maddie's been having such a slow day, I thought I'd pet the dog.\" Maddie smiled at that. \"There he is.\" She said pointing at Caliban, obviously taking Cassidy's words literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third customer was Rangiku Urameshi, a 985ft tall and pear shaped red hellhound woman with hair reaching down to her rear, spikes running down her back and a skull like face. Rick was a friend of Rangiku's daughter, Manami and knew for a fact that the Urameshi's were a mixed family of humans and hellhounds. \"Thanks, Maddie,\" said Rangiku. \"This pie smells otherworldly.\" Maddie smiled and nodded her head. Perhaps that strange ingredient would improve her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's fourth customer was Angel Bauza, a 1050ft tall apple-shaped and gold furred weretigress inventor who lived in Autumn Avenue. \"I'll try anything once,\" said Angel. \"I came here because I heard from Freya about this strange fruit that Latanya sold you. I just hope it tastes good.\" Maddie nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie's last customer was Pauline Pride, a 1000ft black furred Nemean lioness who ran a restaurant in Winter Way. She held up and sniffed the strange pie. \"I'll be the judge of this pie,\" said Pauline. \"I might put it on the menu if it's good enough.\" \"That's nice.\" Said Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pauline bought the last pie, it was closing time and Maddie had locked up the bakery to go home. \"See you tomorrow, Rick.\" Said Maddie. Rick waved goodbye as he walked up to the human sized terminal to wait for a monster taxi to pick him up. As Maddie was slithering home, Caliban followed her and had a slight scowl on his canine face. He did not trust that weird fruit that his master had bought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Maddie was getting in bed with Othello, her gargoyle husband. Othello was a muscular blue skinned gargoyle one head taller than his wife with a long beak and white hair. He was already fast asleep as Maddie yawned and slithered into her bed, putting her glasses on the table. She didn't have to worry about petrifying Othello or Caliban since both gargoyles and gargoyle beasts were immune to gorgon eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Maddie was the first to wake up and let out a yawn, albeit she took more effort than normal to get up. \"Geez,\" she said. \"I know I'm on the heavy side, but I couldn't have put on weight over night could I?\" Maddie turned on her lamp and then she looked down and had to put on her glasses (they weren't just to protect people from her stony gaze. She really needed them to see). Once Maddie could see what was in front of her, she let out a scream that woke up both Caliban and Othello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maddie!\" yelled Othello. \"What's wrong!?\" \"Othello,\" said Maddie to her gargoyle husband. \"You're not going to believe this.\" Othello looked in surprise because Maddie's breasts were the size of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Othello would've called Desdemona but then he remembered that Desdemona was out of town tending to patients in Yellfleet and wouldn't be back until tonight. Not wanting to pull his sister away from another patient, Othello decided to phone the next best thing. \"I hope you're not disturbing Desdemona,\" said Maddie to her husband. \"She did say that she had to tend to an outbreak of Phthalo Fever in Yellfleet.\" \"I don't know if modern medicine might be able to help you, Maddie. I'm calling Gabriella.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthello was referring to Gabriella Gallops, the local sorceress. Gabriella was a 1500ft tall and big-bellied silver furred unicorn with long blonde hair, a pink horn and pink feathered wings. It was rumored that the strange weather in Screamtown with the four sections of the town locked in different perpetual seasons was due to a spell that the unicorn giantess cast a long time ago. It was said Gabriella was the Sorceress Supreme of the monster world. At that moment, Gabriella was still in bed snoring away when she heard the phone ring and got up. The naked unicorn got out of bed, taking a bit of effort due to her enormous paunch and then took off her sleeping mask to answer the phone. \"Hello?\" asked the unicorn in her British accent. \"Gabriella,\" said Othello on the phone. \"Oh thank goodness you're awake.\" Gabriella gave a yawn. \"For the last two minutes that is correct, Othello. For what reason do I inquire you are calling me so early in the morning.\" \"It's Maddie. Her breasts are as big as wrecking balls. Something made them grow overnight.\" Gabriella raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Othello,\" said the sorceress. \"I will admit that I am a sorceress and not a scientific-minded medical doctor like your sister, but I do know that if you believe Maddie to have lactose overload syndrome, it is just not possible. If she did, it would have already affected her as soon as she reached adulthood and while Maddie behaves like a child, she has been an adult for quite some time. Besides, the only species that can be afflicted with that unusual condition are succubi, werewolves and gargoyles like yourself and being married to a gargoyle doesn't count. But if what you are saying is true, I must arrive at your door immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Gabriella hung up and went to get dressed. First, Gabriella put on a blue thong and a bra before looking at herself in the mirror and lifted up her huge gut to get a good look. Then, Gabriella put on her long and pink gown that resembled the kind worn by a sorceress queen. Next she put on and tightened her corset, although this still made her look fat, it made her look somewhat less obese than if somebody saw her without the corset on. The unicorn giantess then walked up to her nightstand to put on her silver tiara. The unicorn then held out her hand and used telekinesis to bring her wand forward before she teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a puff of pink smoke, Gabriella arrived at Othello and Maddie's home. \"Good day to you, Othello,\" said the sorceress. \"And where might... Great Camelot!\" Gabriella looked in surprise at Maddie's large breasts. \"Hi, Gabriella. How is Eris doing?\" Gabriella then poked the gorgon giantess in the breasts before scratching her chin. \"My word. This is an odd case.\" Gabriella then chanted strange words and then looked through the lens on her wand to examine Maddie. \"Hmmm. You don't appear to be cursed. Hmm. If memory serves, certain plants can have strange effects. Did you eat anything odd yesterday.\" \"Well,\" said Maddie. \"Yesterday, Latanya came in and sold me a strange pink fruit that looked like a pair of breasts. Milkyberry.\" Gabriella then rubbed her chin. \"I see. Did you made it into a dessert by any chacne?\" \"Yes, Gabby,\" said Maddie. \"Estelle, Angel, Pauline, Rangiku and Cassidy all bought a pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabriella nodded her head. \"I see. My first bit of advice would be to not call me \"Gabby\". I abhor that nickname. Second, I would suggest you call those 5 and warn them not to eat the pie. I don't know for sue, but I believe that fruit might have something to do with it. I am going to pay Latanya a visit. Cheerio.\" With that, Gabriella teleported away right before Caliban could walk up to her and the gargoyle-like dog sniffed the ground where she vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn giantess arrived at Latanya's house and Latanya walked out and looked in surprise. \"Gabriella?\" asked Latanya. \"What are you doing here?\" \"Latanya,\" said Gabriella to the minotaur giantess. \"I understand you sold an unusual fruit to Madeline Thurman yesterday. May I please see this fruit.\" Latanya nodded her head and then handed the milkyberry to Gabriella who could only stare at it. \"Something wrong, Gabriella?\" asked Latanya. \"Good Heavens,\" said Gabriella. \"This is an odd fruit indeed. In centuries, I have never seen anything like this fruit. It doesn't even look like one of nature's own design. It is as if somebody bio-engineered an artificial species. Such an irresponsible use of science. It does look quite delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking Gabriella bit into the fruit and then licked her lips. \"And it tastes quite delicious. This fruit produces milk in a way no coconut could. Almost as if it was....\" Gabriella then grunted and then the fruit's poison took effect. In seconds Gabriella's breasts begun to expand and soon they were...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Othello thought that the best idea was to call his sister, Desdemona, under the logic that a doctor would probably be able to tell exactly what was wrong with Maddie. Desdemona was a 1225ft tall and very muscular pink-skinned gargoyle with white hair. Like her brother, she was a gargoyle with a long beak for a mouth. For in-laws, Desdemona and Maddie got along very well, especially considering their contrasting careers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was still early in the morning and Desdemona was asleep in bed when she heard the phone and tried to answer it. It took a few minutes because her yes were half closed and she then held the phone up to her face. \"You've reached the address of Dr. Desdemona Weisman,\" said Desdemona with a yawn. \"It might take me a few minutes to get started but....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desdemona! It's Othello.\" Desdemona let out a yawn before responding to her brother's words. \"Othello? What's wrong, bro?\" \"It's Maddie. Something happened and now her breasts are as big as wrecking balls.\" \"Wrecking balls?\" asked Desdemona. \"Impossible. Gorgons can't get Lactose Overload Syndromes. Only succubi, gargoyles and werewolves can.\" \"Tell that to my wife.\" Desdemona let out a sigh and put on her lab coat. \"Don't panic. Big Sis is coming.\" Desdemona herself was rather curious. After all, she had seen her sister-in-law yesterday and knew she was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona soon walked in the Thurman residence and Caliban walked up to greet her. Desdemona stroked her sister-in-law's dog before walking in as Othello came up to her. \"I appreciate you coming so early in the morning, Desdemona.\" Said Othello. \"Where's Maddie.\" \"She's still in bed. She can't move.\" Desdemona raised a, well gargoyles don't have eyebrows but you know what I mean. \"Are you saying her breasts have gotten so big that....\" Suddenly there was a loud crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona and Othello walked into the bedroom and saw that Maddie's breasts had gotten bigger, so much in fact that they were too big for the bed to support and the rattlesnake gorgon was flat on her back immobilized by her now monster minivan-sized jugs. \"Good morning, Desdemona.\" Said Maddie. \"Holy slate!\" yelled Desdemona. \"You weren't kidding.\" Desdemona felt Maddie's breasts and even took a stethoscope to them to hear the milk inside and then stroked her chin. \"This is an odd-case. There is surprisingly little milk in these breasts. Well, not completely surprising since she isn't pregnant, at least not that I can tell yet. It would appear that these breasts are mainly fat and air. I've never seen anything like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthello bit his claws. \"So I take it you can't fix her?\" \"Not if I don't know what caused this. Maddie, did anything happen yesterday.\" \"Well, Estelle was delivering the mail, it was a slow day at the shop, Alala was jogging. Oh and when I went to return my library book, Ororo was arguing with Grey.\" Desdemona rolled her eyes and let out an annoyed sigh. \"Anything that might have caused your breasts to swell.\" \"Not really. Although Latanya did show up yesterday and delivered a rather strange fruit.\" \"Strange fruit?\" asked Desdemona. \"What did it look like?\" \"Well,\" said Maddie as her breasts rippled and she had to push them out of the way of her face. \"It was pink with swirls and white marks and looked like a pair of breasts. I made it into several pies. I wonder if that was what was responsible.\" \"You wonder?\" asked Desdemona sarcastically. \"Maddie, eating flora you can't identify is a very bad idea. I'll bet it was that fruit that did this to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Desdemona realized something. \"Did you by any chance sell any of those fruit pies?\" \"Well, only to Estelle, Rangiku, Pauline, Angel and Cassidy.\" Desdemona let out a gulp. \"Oh no.\" That's when there was a knock at the door.\" Othello went to answer it and saw that one of Maddie's customers was in the same state as Maddie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which one?</span></div></div>",

Desdemona gave a grunt. \u201cOh for goodness sakes, Othello,\u201d said Desdemona. \u201cDo you think that somebody is going to slam the door on you as soon as they enter?\u201d Desdemona was about to open the door but before she could do so, the door opened on its own and pushed Desdemona into the wall as she grunted. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d said a voice. \u201cI thought I heard Desdemona in here. Maddie! Look what your stupid pie did to me!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t look, Pauline,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cMy breasts are in the way. And my pies are not stupid. They don\u2019t have brains but they don\u2019t have souls either. Unless they\u2019re fish pies but I don\u2019t sell fish pies. Oh my.\u201d Maddie saw that Pauline\u2019s breasts were wrecking balls just like her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPauline,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cYour breasts are enormous.\u201d \u201cSo are yours! I talked to the Bull Sisters and to Gabriella and they agree that they never saw a plant like that in their life! It\u2019s a good thing that I warned everyone else not to eat their pies.\u201d Desdemona came out from behind the door and shook her head in pain. \u201cSlapstick should know gender differences,\u201d said the pink gargoyle doctor. \u201cWell, obviously, that fruit doesn\u2019t discriminate between species of monsters.\u201d Pauline\u2019s breasts were brushing against Othello who closed his eyes and grit his teeth. \u201cI\u2019m a married man,\u201d muttered the gargoyle rapidly to himself. \u201cI\u2019m a married man. I\u2019m a married man.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me, that,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cI\u2019m the one who married you and Pauline and Desdemona already know too.\u201d Desdemona rolled her eyes and slapped herself in the face before lifting one of Pauline\u2019s breasts and shaking it. \u201cHmmm,\u201d Desdemona then took out a strange device and put it to Pauline\u2019s breast. She turned it on but nothing happened. \u201cHmm, nothing coming out. Same symptoms as Maddie. And it doesn't seem like it's going to go away anytime soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline gave a roar and then grabbed hold of her head. \"This couldn't have happened at a worse time. Rick's parents are coming over tonight. Kate is going to have a heart attack if she sees me like this.\" Pauline was dating Rick and she had recently met Rick's parents. Rick's father Jake was easy enough to get along with but Rick's mother Kate Rowling scared Pauline half to death. And surprisingly, even though Rick was human and Kate was his biologic mother, Kate was <i>not</i> human. She was a 1200ft tall harpy, but unlike Cassidy who had a human-like face, Kate had a bestial face with leather ears, a large beak and sharp teeth like an archaeopteryx and had the rainbow-colored wings and tail feathers to match. Kate was also very fat and pear-shaped with clawed fingers and talons and long red hair that reached to her butt. She also always wore a pair of dark glasses most of the time that hid her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally harpies don't give birth to male offspring but Rick came to exist due to a genetic fluke of nature that caused Kate to produce an egg containing a human offspring. The reason Rick came out human was because Kate came from a species that was exclusively female. Personality-wise, Kate was stern, stoic and really hard to approach. Somewhat overprotective of her human son. To make Kate even more intimidating, she was a lawyer. So far, she and Pauline got along well, but Pauline was no less afraid of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline let out a groan. \"If my boyfriend's mother sees me like this, I'm doomed. Desdemona, there has to be a way to reverse this.\" \"What do you want from me?!\" yells Desdemona. \"I'm a doctor, not a witch!\" Pauline gave a growl. \u201cMy breasts are bigger than Aunt Cattleya\u2019s ass. Desdemona, you need to find an antidote. Desdemona let out a sigh. \u201cPauline, do you have a sample of that strange plant?\u201d Pauline shook her head. \u201cNo. I... I threw it away.\u201d \u201cYou threw it away?\u201d asked Othello. Pauline gave a growl. \u201cIf you tell anyone I wasted food,\u201d said the lioness in a warning tone. \u201cYou and Maddie will have no choice but to adopt.\u201d Maddie adjusted her sunglasses before Desdemona pushed her up. \u201cWe already have a dog, Pauline. But you bring a good point. I wonder if Caliban\u2019s been lonely lately.\u201d Caliban let out a whimper and the gargoyle dog beast put his paw over his face in embarrassment at his owner\u2019s ditziness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cI saved one of the seeds.\u201d \u201cWhere is it?\u201d asked Desdemona. Maddie pointed into her cleavage and Desdemona reached into it and snatched it to the surprise of Pauline. \u201cYou just reached into your sister-in-law\u2019s cleavage?\u201d Desdemona plucked out the seed and gave a glare. \u201cPauline. I\u2019m a doctor. I\u2019m used to this. I\u2019ll run a few tests on this seed. In the meantime, you two better be careful.\u201d As Desdemona left, Pauline gave a pout and then she heard a stretching sound. Sure enough, hers and Maddie\u2019s breasts expanded and hit the floor. Othello gave a gulp. \u201cOh boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter much struggle, Maddie and Pauline head to...</span></div></div>",

He was accompanied by his older sister Olga, a fat pear-shaped 1100ft high rainbow-haired hippogriff. Unlike Rick who was surprisingly Kate's biological son, Olga was adopted as an abandoned egg by the Rowlings before Rick was even conceived. Olga had to let Rick in because he couldn't reach the door. \"I wonder what's taking Maddie so long?\" asked Rick. \"She's an hour late for work. This isn't like her.\" Olga just leaned forward. \"Be careful, little bro. You don't want to be made into baked Alaska do you?\" There was a stomping sound as Rick's archaeopteryx harpy mother Kate walked in. \"You're right, son,\" said Kate. \"Maddie's usually in before you are. I hop something didn't happen to her.\" Olga let out a laugh. \"Come on, Mom. Maddie probably just set her clock to 5:00 pm instead of 5:00 am by mistake again.\" Rick stopped to pour in more meringue. \"I hope I'm doing this right. Pauline loves baked Alaska and I don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a crashing sound. \"Out of the way, chowderhead!\" shouted Pauline's voice. \"Pauline?\" asked Rick upon hearing the noise. Olga turned her head and dropped her beak as she spotted Pauline and Maddie stuck in the door, both of their breasts leaving them stuck as they were trying to inch their way in. Rick turned and saw his girlfriend and boss and gasped. He even fell into the vat of baked Alaska before Olga reached in and pulled him out. When Kate spotted her son's girlfriend and boss, she was caught by so much surprise her eyes burst through her sunglasses and shattered them. \"Good grief!\" yelled the harpy lady. Kate took off her destroyed glasses before she fainted head first into the vat of baked Alaska and then fell to the floor with a crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Pauline?\" asked Rick. \"M-Maddie? What the... how the... what in the...?\" Pauline let out a sigh. \"It's a long story, Ricky.\" Maddie moaned and tried to squeeze herself in through the door. Olga was dumbfounded but then grabbed Maddie by the arms and pulled so hard that she managed to get Maddie out, but in the process, caused herself to land butt first on a large frosted sponge cake and also caused Pauline to fall through and shattered the window. Pauline's indestructible skin was the only thing keeping the glass from bloodying her. She stood up and shook off the glass as Olga stood up and looked at the cake smear on her horse-like booty before Maddie fell and pinned her between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick shook baked Alaska off of himself before Kate stood back up, her face and breasts covered with the rest of the batter right before she took off Pauline's glasses and put them on her own face. She stepped forward and poked Maddie in the breasts before she felt Pauline who was completely embarrassed and blushed bright red on her black furred cheeks. \"Pauline?\" asked Kate. \"Maddie. Your breasts are enormous. Maddie, what happened?\" Kate stopped herself and then waved her hands. \"By that, I mean; what happened that would've made something like this happen?\" \"Well,\" said Maddie. \"Latanya sold me a strange fruit and I made it into a pie and sold it to Pauline. Though I had some of it myself to make sure it was good fruit.\" Kate let out a groan. \"You mean to tell me you ate a fruit you had never seen before and didn't know whether or not it was safe to eat? Maddie, you bubble brain. It could've been poison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline took her glasses back and then she held up her breasts. \"In a way,\" she said. \"It was.\" Pauline leaned back and accidentally buried Rick under her left breast as Rick moaned underneath, forcing the lioness to pull out her minuscule boyfriend. Olga was so stunned that her mother had to close her break. \"Hoo boy,\" groaned Kate. \"Rick, just wait'll your father sees this. He'll be laughing like a werehyena all night.\" Maddie then slithered up towards the counter. \"Oh,\" she said as she looked at the splattered baked Alaska. \"You were making baked Alaska.\" Rick let out a sigh as both Maddie and Pauline's breasts covered up most of the table. \"Well, I was. But now it's all over Mom's face and neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPauline bent over to kiss her boyfriend. \"Don't worry, Ricky. I have a better idea. Maddie and I will take over.\" \"I don't think that's a good idea in your condition,\" said Olga. \"I mean what if...?\" \"We're not too top-heavy to cook,\" said Maddie. \"I have an idea for tonight's desert.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what idea is that?</span></div></div>",

I think that that asshole Antoinette had something to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel was referring to Antoinette Curry, an evil nuckelavee scientist who was the previous owner of her workshop. Antoinette was a monster resembling a skinless anthropomorphic horse with exposed muscle and walked with a cane due to a human tank shooting a sharpnel too deep into her leg to be removed. Antoinette was the most hated monster in Screamtown because she conducted cruel experiments on humans and monsters that were too grizzly to describe. For her crimes she was banished from Screamtown and locked up in Under Gloom. It was thought that Antoinette died in an explosion from a breakout attempt gone wrong but nobody ever found the body and some citizens of Screamtown believe the fiend to be out for revenge on the town that kicked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngel,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cAntoinette hasn\u2019t been seen in Screamtown for 20 years. She could be dead for all we know.\u201d \u201cOh no,\u201d said Angel just as she finished her wagon for Maddie. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure that she found that plant... nay, she genetically engineered that plant to do this to us.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Desdemona. \u201cTo suffocate the male population to death in their wives and girlfriends\u2019 bosoms?\u201d Othello then screamed in pain as he held up Maddie and placed her breasts first onto Angel\u2019s new wagon. \u201cWell,\u201d said Othello. \u201cIt sure isn\u2019t doing my back any good.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Othello honey,\u201d said Maddie to her husband. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. Thanks for the wagon, Angel. This will make it easily to move around.\u201d \u201cBig fat hairy deal,\u201d said Angel. \u201cSo what do we do now, Doc.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUntil I can even figure out how to make an antidote for this development,\u201d said Desdemona. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to continue your lives and jobs, except with much bigger boobs.\u201d Angel gave a growl and grabbed her ears.\u201d Maddie just gave a smile. \u201cWhatever will be will be.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who's P.O.V. should we continue now?</span></div></div>",

She was getting stares from every monster and human that she passed. She just smiled nervously and rolled her wagon. Up ahead was the mayor of Screamtown, Phyllis Gacks, a gigantic orange skinned Lovecraftian resembling a muscular female version of Cthulu. Phyllis had bent over to the ground in order to pick up a dropped contact lens before she saw Maddie in the wagon and was slightly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did Halloween sneak up on me already?\" she asked. \"What's with the Oboroguruma costume, Maddie?\" Maddie turned her head and looked at Phyllis. \"I'm not wearing a costume, Mayor Gacks. My breasts are too big.\" Phyllis looked at Maddie's breasts and was even more confused. \"What on Earth happened?\" \"Well,\" said Maddie. \"Where should I start? Hmm. Oh my, that could take thousands of years to explain. Do you want me to start with the Mesozoic Era or the Dark Ages.\" Phyllis let out a groan. \"I meant what happened that made your breasts grow to an enormous size. \"Oh. Well, Latanya found a strange plant in her garden that made this happen to me and Angel.\" \"Uh-huh. I better have a word with Latanya. For all we know this could be an invasive species.\" Maddie then looked around before whispering into.... whatever Phyllis's species have for ears. \"Don't worry. I'll let you know if I see any aliens.\" Phyllis shook her head as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat nobody knew was that there was a van nearby that was painted violet, red and blue with poisonous flowers and had \"The Misery Machine\" written on the sign. The windows were also painted black so nobody could see inside. The van appeared to have a satellite dish on top of it and inside of it, there was a figure that was watching Maddie through a monitor. This was none other than Antoinette, Screamtown's most hated former resident and she didn't appear to be pleased with what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit!\" yelled the nuckelavee to herself. \"What the hell is this shameless display? That plant was supposed to cause the eater to rapidly dehydrate. Instead it appears to do the opposite.\" Antoinette turned to a potted plant growing the breast growing fruit and proceeded to smash it to a pulp with her cane. \"The experiment was a complete and utter failure. Drat! You may have humiliated me today yet again, Screamtown but mark my words, what doesn't kill you makes me stronger.\" Antoinette then turned to the shadowed out figure at the wheel of her van. \"Change of plans. We're leaving town.\" With that, Antoinette's driver begun to drive away from Screamtown so Antoinette could rethink her evil plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Rick had already arrived at work and was trying to make a pie crust out of dough. Not an easy task considering the rolling pin was much larger than he was. As Rick was grunting, he slipped and fell into the dough before the rolling pin fell on the floor. Fortunately for him, Maddie came in and pulled him out of the dough. \"Rick,\" said the gorgon to her tiny employee. \"I appreciate you getting an early start, but that pin is too big for a human like you.\" Rick looked down in surprise because all he could see was his boss's mountainous breasts. \"Maddie?! What the... did that fruit do this?\" Rick was so dumbfounded that Maddie just rolled her eyes. \"You've been working too hard, Rick, I think it's time you went on break.\" Maddie then dropped Rick who landed with a grunt in the chasm that was her cleavage and begun to sink between his skyscraper-sized boss's breasts. Rick tried to move but he was completely stuck and could only listen to Maddie's humming as she got to work herself.</span></div></div>",

She was groaning as the weight of her breasts took its toll on her back. As she was moving, she passed by Ororo Parker, the cobalt skinned wereboar who ran the library. The pig giantess turned her head and looked in surprise at Angel. \u201cSo they\u2019re breasts,\u201d said Angel somewhat defensively. \u201cBig fat ****ing hairy deal.\u201d Nearby, a mother kappa plugged her son\u2019s ears to prevent him from hearing Angel\u2019s acidic tongue. \u201cOh, give it a rest,\u201d said the weretigress. \u201cHe\u2019s going to learn that word eventually, lady.\u201d Angel let out a hiss as she rolled back to her workshop. \u201cI hate mondays.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, was Angel\u2019s neighbor and Latanya's younger twin sister, Freya Bull, a strawberry pink skinned and red-haired mock turtle, an animal resembling a cross between a minotaur and a turtle. Freya being part cow was very bulky with a large udder, breasts and butt but she had the shell of a tortoise that had spikes on it. Freya took note of Angel\u2019s bad mood. \u201cSomeone\u2019s grumpier than they usually-doodley are. Huh?\u201d Freya noticed Angel\u2019s big boobs and dropped her rake on the ground. \u201cGood gracious me!\u201d she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Inside of Angel\u2019s workshop, the weretigress giantess had the television on as she was busy trying to draw blueprints while using her breasts as a table. Of course, the blueprints weren\u2019t coming out right due to the squishiness of the \u201ctable\u201d and it was making Angel mad, prompting her to focus on the television. \u201cThis cartoon about art is so stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cLook at that idiot that passes for a villain. Every single ****ing plan the dumbass comes up with involves bringing paintings and sculptures to life and for what? Raising an army of gargoyles to drop pizza on everything? Winning a beauty contest to make a planet out of yarn? There\u2019s so many reasons why that shouldn\u2019t work. And look at his henchmen; a kid in a skunk suit, two fat guys who speak through singing and a mad scientist who looks like she\u2019s still in pre-school? And look at his face. What happened? A plastic surgery experiment gone wrong. Human pop culture. I\u2019ll never understand it.\u201d Angel then saw that she drew all over her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d said the tigress as she chugged a whole bottle of beer and threw away the bottle with a crash. \u201cLooks like this next project is going to be freehand.\u201d There was then a tap on the door. \u201cOpen the freaking door!\u201d yelled Angel. Freya opened the door and the giant cow-turtle woman walked in. \u201cYou know,\u201d said Freya. \u201cI wonder why your parents named you Angel with an attitude like yours.\u201d Angel gave a scoff. \u201cIt beats Freya, strawberry head.\u201d Freya then took a good look at Angel\u2019s breasts. \u201cSo that\u2019s what that weird fruit from Latanya\u2019s garden does.\u201d Angel gave a hiss. \u201cDon\u2019t flatter yourself, Freya. Next time you see that Wonder Twin of yours, kick her big green ass for me. Now, I need to decide what I\u2019m going to do today? I\u2019ve got two inventions I have to build but I can\u2019t draw blueprints in this condition. I\u2019m gonna wing it.\u201d Freya noticed Angel\u2019s breasts again. \u201cShould you really be building anything in your condition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngel hissed and showed Freya her claws right before she reached into her cleavage and pulled out a coin that had an image of the Flying Dutchman on one side and the face of the captain on the other side. \u201cStay where you are, Freya. I might need help on this project. Now, heads I start work on that rocket I\u2019ve been wanting to do and tails I do the steampunk submarine.\u201d Angel flipped the coin and it bounced off her breasts a few times before it finally landed on....</span></div></div>",

Rangiku came in and her breasts actually seemed twice as big as Georgia\u2019s, so much that it was a wonder the humongous hellhound housewife was even capable of moving. Rangiku also wasn\u2019t along. Rangiku as it was known around town was one of many monsters to be married to a human. However, she had two human children as well as her hellhound oldest daughter, Manami. As Rangiku walked inside, her human children Kotaro and Koyomi were giggling and jumping on their giantess mother\u2019s red fleshy breasts as if they were a giant trampoline, much to Rangiku\u2019s discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d said Rangiku. \u201cI thought that I heard Othello in here.\u201d Rangiku then grunted as Kotaro and Koyomi kept bouncing on their mother\u2019s chest. \u201cI\u2019ll bet I can jump higher than you can, Koyomi!\u201d \u201cIn your dreams, Kotaro!\u201d Rangiku gave an annoyed growl as her children kept jumping on her and her bony skull-like face clearly looked in discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona couldn\u2019t help but laugh at Rangiku\u2019s predicament. \u201cHi, Dr. Weisman.\u201d Said Kotaro. \u201cHi, Mrs. Thurman.\u201d Said Koyomi to Maddie. Maddie smiled and waved to the Urameshi children as Desdemona just kept on laughing. \u201cLooks like you have your hands full there, Rangiku. I\u2019ll bet Takeshi is tickled pink with your situation.\u201d \u201cYou may think this is funny,\u201d said Rangiku in between grunts as her kids kept jumping on her. \u201cKotaro and Koyomi may think this is fun. My husband may think this is sexy, but look at this.\u201d Rangiku turned around to show Desdemona and Uma her huge \u201cmom\u201d butt. \u201cSo?\u201d asked Maddie. \u201cYour rear looks as big as ever.\u201d \u201cBut until I ate that weird (ouch!) pie, it was the biggest (AIE!) part of me! Now my cheeks can\u2019t compete with breasts as big as... (ow!)\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRangiku was quickly becoming annoyed as Koyomi and Kotaro continued to use her chest as a bouncehouse. The hellhound giantess snorted flames from her nostrils out of annoyance. \u201cIf you two don\u2019t stop that right now, you\u2019re spending time out in mommy\u2019s nose.\u201d Koyomi and Kotaro got the message and stopped, both of them standing on each of their humongous mother\u2019s breasts. \u201cDon\u2019t be too hard on them, Rangiku,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cSo, did you enjoy the pie?\u201d \u201cThankfully,\u201d said Rangiku. \u201cI was the first to take a slice and that\u2019s when the pie had immediate results and I threw the rest of it out the window. I couldn\u2019t let Manami eat it. Teenagers have enough problems.\u201d You should\u2019ve seen what happened when I tried to take a soak in the lava tub this morning. The plumber is still cleaning up the mess.\u201d Maddie then tried to help herself up as Desdemona helped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Desdemona,\u201d said Rangiku. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to help me out. I can\u2019t have a bust bigger than my butt. I come from a species of monster that evolved in the opposite direction.\u201d \u201cNow, now,\u201d said Desdemona. \u201cJust calm down and return home. I\u2019ll see if I could find some way to make this more bearable.\u201d Rangiku sighed and stormed off, her breasts momentarily getting stuck through the doorway before she managed to get out. She closed the door to reveal Othello holding his crotch in pain as the doorknob was meant. \u201cRight in the lasaga.\u201d The male gargoyle groaned.</span></div></div>",

What had crashed was none other than Cassidy and her breasts looked like they were actually larger than Maddie's. Given that she was flat on her back at the time of the crash, she was obviously trying to fly with those enormous breasts only to lose balance. \"Sorry, Othello.\" Said the vulture harpy. Othello just let out a groan. \"Not a problem, Cassidy. We gargoyles have really hard skin. Ouch.\" Cassidy however, unlike the overweight Maddie, was very muscular and meaty and all it took from her was a little effort in order to hold up her big bird breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me that Angel, Rangiku, Pauline and...\" \"Don't worry, Doc,\" said Cassidy with a grunt as she waddled forward, unable to see past her own boobs. \"I'm... whoa!\" Cassidy accidentally knocked over Maddie's lamp with her breasts and made it shatter. \"Oh, darn,\" said Maddie. \"I liked that seahorse lamp.\" Cassidy let out a groan. \"Look at me. I own and run the Scream Town Gym and now I've got two built in medicine balls. It's a good thing I belong to the amazon half of Scream Town's ladies and not the morbidly obese half, or this would be trouble.\" Then, Cassidy turned and accidentally smacked Desdemona in the face with her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesdemona groaned as Cassidy helped Maddie up but Maddie grunted because she was still having trouble holding her breasts. \"Maddie,\" said Cassidy. \"You're out of shape. You've been spending so much time in your sweetshop tasting what you bake that you've gotten weak and chubby. I heard that a snake is one big muscle.\" Maddie just blushed as she held her eyes completely closed so as not to turn her harpy friend into stone and then she shook the rattle at the end of her serpentine tail. \"Now that you mention it,\" said the gorgon giantess. \"I have been getting chubbier than usual lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthello sprung up from under the destroyed door before handing his wife her sunglasses. \"I like you a lot when you're chubby, Maddie. I grew up around amazons. You don't have... ouch!\" Maddie slipped and accidentally slammed her big breasts down on Othello's foot and caused Othello great pain. Othello moaned and held up his foot as Maddie was trying to hold her breasts up. \"I'm sorry, Othello honey,\" she said. \"I guess my breasts are a little more than I can carry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Othello could say another thing, he found himself plastered to the wall by Cassidy's large breasts as she bent down to speak with Maddie. \"That does it, Maddie. You can't live like that. Okay, so you're probably going to be stuck with huge breasts for the rest of your life, but I can at least make you strong enough to carry them. We start your training in one hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie knew that Cassidy had a point. Years of running a bakery had made the gorgon giantess very fat. Of course, in Screamtown, all women over age 18 were either morbidly obese or amazons with enough muscles to make the Hulk look like a 90lb weakling. So, Maddie decided to slither off to the closet in order to fish out something. She took out a black leotard and a purple sweatband. Her snake hair hissed as she squeezed them with the sweatband. Then she tried to put on the unitard only for her breasts to be pushed out through the neck hole. Thankfully she had a bra on. The gorgon then slithered out to meet with Cassidy. \"Okay, Maddie. For your first exercise, let's try....</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m a rattlesnake gorgon.\u201d Cassidy gave a scoff. \u201cNice try, lazy breasts. I read somewhere that all snakes can swim.

We\u2019ll take our workout to Summer Side.\u201d Cassidy jogged off, shaking her oversized melons as Maddie followed more slowly, slithering all the way. Maddie then tapped herself in the face. \u201cI can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m forgetting something very important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick at that time (who was completely unaware of his boss\u2019s condition) was waiting at the foot of the front door to the bakery and was waiting for Maddie who had completely forgotten to call him and tell him about what happened. \u201cWhere\u2019s Maddie?\u201d asked the human waiting for his skyscraper-sized gorgon boss. \u201cWe were supposed to open half an hour ago.\u201d Rick let out a sigh and decided to sit by the door and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, both Cassidy and Maddie arrived at the beach in Summer Side. There were a lot of monsters and humans sunbathing on the beach who stared at the big breasted harpy and gorgon as they made their way to the water. One human man sunbathing on his obese centicore wife\u2019s left butt cheek took off his sunglasses to get a closer look while the centicore herself bore her sharp teeth at Maddie. Cassidy made a threatening gesture at a male tengu who made eyes at her. \u201cMy friend is married,\u201d said the harpy. \u201cAnd I\u2019m a widow. So back off!\u201d Maddie gave a blush and felt her training bra tearing apart because her breasts were getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCassidy,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is...\u201d Cassidy opened up her wings and then pointed to the water in front of the two of them. \u201cAlright, Maddie. See that red bell buoy out there?\" Maddie adjusted her sunglasses before putting goggles on them to make sure they didn\u2019t fall off. \u201cYes, I see it, Cassidy.\u201d Cassidy nodded her head. \"We're going to swim to that buoy and back.\" Cassidy dove into the water but then gagged because her breasts prevented her from going any deeper. Maddie let out a laugh as the grumpy harpy swam out on the water. Maddie followed but let out a yell because she wasn't used to swimming and her breasts were causing her to swim clumsily. However, Maddie inhaled and started to slowly paddle as she caught up with Cassidy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming through the water right up to the duo was Joanne Xever, a chubby 1480ft tall mermaid with the lower-body of a yellow-green whale shark with white spots. She had tan skin like that of a Hawaiian woman, long blonde hair and a giant starfish at the side of her head like a hair decoration. Joanne was an artisan who unlike other mermaids who usually didn\u2019t want anything to do with land-dwelling monsters, partially lived in Scream Town and interacted with the land walking populace by use of a harness with a pair of mechanical legs that she attached to her waist when she wants to go topside. As Joanne was swimming, she looked up and spotted Maddie entering the water with her buoyant breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the name of Poseidon is that?\u201d asked the mermaid. Joanne swam up to investigate and caught Maddie by surprise, causing the gorgon to let out a yell and accidentally splash her. Joanne gave a glare and then spat out some water. \"Oh,\" said Maddie. \"I'm really sorry about that, Joanne.\" Joanne shook her head and then she noticed Maddie's breasts. \"Maddie?\" she asked. \"What happened to you?\" Maddie gave a giggle. \"Let's just say it was something I ate.\" \"Maddie!\" yells Cassidy. \"Hurry up!\" Maddie swims after Cassidy and then Joanne nods her head and swims back under the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maddie and Cassidy continue to swim...</span></div></div>",

I am a 23 year old Australian Copperhead gorgon. I have purple scales, orange eyes, and snakes for hair. I am fairly muscular, but my breasts... I'll get to that in a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn case you were born into this world and do not know or care about history, allow me to explain: in 2114, a strange plague hit our planet, which was populated by many monsters. Only female gorgons over 18 survived: other species, and all men and people under 18 did not. The female gorgons over 18 lived because the plague affected them in a... strange way. It made their breasts grow to insane sizes, and filled them to the absolute brim with milk that can never be lactated. And they never stop growing. I myself have beach ball sized breasts, though I have not measured in some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time this plague happened, a solar flare hit the planet, turning the majority of it into a desert. Crops were destroyed and the oceans dried up, so food and drink are hard to come by. Surviving is hard. There is still some technology, but not a whole lot. Just some communication devices, screens, and medical equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome gorgons became bandits, roaming the wastelands looking for people to kill and resources to steal. Others make their own kingdoms to rule. Most are like me, scavangers just looking to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is still a population over a million, but as I said, it's all female adult gorgons. And even then, it's hard to find anyone. The population is spread so thin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm nearing the ruins of a city. I'll update you later.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

One was a gold scaled Diamondback with slightly smaller breasts then me, the other was a red scaled Asp who was equal to me in cup size. The two thought I was Spitting Cobra and tried to rob me. I corrected them on my species, before I introduced their faces to the sandy ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asp ran away. The Diamondback started begging me to forgive her. She said that she and the Asp were kicked out of a bandit group after the Asp got shot while trying to get food. They've been starving ever since, so they go after anyone who may have food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begged me to let her join me. Since I was a scavenger, I would find more food and water. Eh, why not? Gets lonely. So I let her come with me. She was very happy. She introduced herself as Lara. Apparently she's a year younger then me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was talking, I saw a hospital in the distance. Looks old, but maybe it has some supplies we can use. Never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAddendum: I've decided to keep a track of both mine and Lara's breast size (measured in size, for simplicity sake) and supplies on me and Lara.

This old hospital was stocked with supplies. There wasn't much water, but the cafeteria was LOADED with food. And we managed to get some great medical supplies. I don't think we have to worry about eating for a while. We split the food between us. I held on to the medical supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe found something really bizarre on the 8th floor. Apparently, some gorgons went insane and started a cult on this floor. There was an anatomy statue decked out to look like a god surrounded by torches. The scary thing was that the flames were still lit. That made the two of us think the cult was still here, so we grabbed what we needed and bolted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana found an old letter before we left. I'll have to check it out later.

Some kids arrived with high fevers, a centaur woman was covered in red spots, and one male werewolf said he could feel his bones fusing. That must be horrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only people who have consistant symptoms are female, adult gorgons. All of them are getting giant breasts, and they're filling with milk. But from what I've heard, doctors can't getting the milk out. And the weirdest thing is, apart from that, they're healthy. Lucky!

I forgot to introduce myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy name is Sierra Vennick. I'm a 31-year-old Forest Cobra gorgon. I'm 5'11'' and weight 380 pounds. I'll explain that in a second. I'm covered in yellow and black scales and have green eyes. My hair is made up of Forest Cobras.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I've been told I'm slim and pretty. If that's true, why is my weight 380? That's because of my boobs. They started growing when I was 19 and haven't stopped since. If I didn't have them, I'd be around 180 pounds. Yep, my boobs are 200 pounds, 100 pounds for each boob. They're about 5 feet in diameter and height, and yet perfectly spehrical. Due to their weight and size, I have a special bed shaped like a chair so I can actually get up, and a clockwork walker so I can move around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, right. You're probably wondering about the \"clockwork\" thing I keep mentioning. Well, I live in an area with two towns. One is a town that uses steam powered machines, and the other is a town that uses clockwork machines. I live in the clockwork one. It's name, get this, is Clockburg. And yes, the other town is Steamburg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a resident of Clockburg, I am an inventor. My shop sells all my inventions. I even invented Mara, the woman from earlier. She's my only real friend (most people are freaked out by my boobs). Her outer shell is made of copper, is about 6 feet tall, and so I'm not alone in my plight, I made her boobs as big as mine. Though she has the strenght to carry them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, enough introductions. Time to get up. Even in my chair-bed, it takes me ten minutes to get up. Getting dressed is a little easier, since my clothes are tailor made. Today I go with green underwear, a black shirt, and my lucky grey work overalls. Then I get my walker and set my boobs on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my usual morning routine done, it's time for breakfest. I leave my room, head down the hall, and turn into the kitchen (my house is one story. I can't see my feet, and my walker doesn't work right on stairs). When I get to the kitchen, I see that Mara...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But this woman has evil plans for the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in a lab underneath the villa, several scientists are working on a device when they hear the elevator descending. They all turn to face the person they knew was coming. The elevator arrived and opened, and out rolled the owner of the villa: Maria Maruqan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was an Egyptian Cobra gorgon. If she were standing, she'd be 6' in height. She was covered in tan scales and had Egyptian Cobras for hair. Her eyes were blood red in color. She wore a tight, sky-blue robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was confined to a specialized wheelchair due to one massive issue: her breasts. They were truly enormous, being the size of yoga balls. They were also extremely heavy, rendering Maria unable to stand or walk under her own power. When she moved, one could hear the sound of liquid sloshing in her breasts.<br>\r\nMaria wasn't always like this. She used to be normal sized. She was the CEO of a medical company that specialized in body modification without the need of plastic surgery. She was looking over a breast growth formula when it exploded, covering her in the formula. It caused her breasts to grow incredibly large and filled them with milk. The doctors she saw confirmed that there was no way to get the milk out. And worse yet, according to the doctors, she was still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnraged, Maria devised a plan: if she had to spend the rest of her life like this, then every woman in the world would. She had her scientists make a massive machine that would make every woman's breasts enormous and full of milk they can never lactate. Then she would pose an ultimatum: if they let her rule the world, she would fix every woman. She had no plans on doing that, but the world didn't need to know. She even gave herself a new moniker: Madame Mammus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is the device coming along?\" Maria asked a scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slowly.\" The scientist, a female werewolf, replied. \"Well, the giant one is, anyway. The hand-held versions are finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excelent. Let me see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist then handed Maria the device. It looked like an orange revolver with a bulb at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it work properly?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should, but we haven't had a chance to test it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's test it now.\" Maria said, before aiming at the scientist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Maria, please don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist didn't get a chance to finish before Maria fired. The device produced an orange beam and hit the scientist square in the chest. Maria saw that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As such, she also had skin that was bright red with yellow stripes and a strong hourglass figure. She wore a pair of black khakis and a purple tank-top with a pair of black fingerless gloves. Also she wore a pair of blue sunglasses so as not to accidentally petrify anybody with her petrifying gorgon eyes. Of course, that was not the only function of her sunglasses because they had a computer built inside of them that allowed her to speak with her direct superiors. In reality, Jenny was a secret agent for M.A.C.E., the Mystical Agency for Crime Elimination. She was at the mall looking at a pair of jeans when her glasses begun to beep. Realizing that her chief was calling her, Jenny retreated into a fitting room and then pressed a button on her glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny\u2019s sunglasses projected an image of what looked like an obese female manticore with bright brownish gold skin and green eyes with long golden brown mane, a pair of red leathery wings and a scorpion\u2019s tail along with a mouth filled with hundreds of razor sharp teeth. \u201cAgent J212,\u201d said Jenny\u2019s boss. \u201cYour latest mission is of the utmost importance.\u201d \u201cWhat is it, Big Sigma?\u201d Big Sigma projected an image of a gorgon with tan scales and Egyptian cobras for hair with blood red eyes in a sky-blue skin-tight robe. From the looks of it, she had breasts as big as yoga balls and was in a wheelchair.\u201d \u201cYikes,\u201d said Jenny. \u201cThat\u2019s going overboard with the plastic surgery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Sigma just let out a growl. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh. This is Maria Maruqan.\u201d \u201cMaruqan? The monarch of medical goods?\u201d \u201cShe was,\u201d said Big Sigma. \u201cBut one day, she was working on a formula that would allow for breast growth without the need of implants. However, the experiment went awry and exploded, causing her breasts to grow and fill with milk that could never be removed. And her breasts are still growing. Being a prisoner of her own body didn\u2019t sit well with Maruwan. Now she calls herself Madame Mammus and she wants revenge on the world. I\u2019ve received word that she is currently working on a ray that will put every woman in the world, regardless of species under the same spell.\u201d Jenny let out a hiss. \u201cI can\u2019t believe some people want others to suffer for their own misfortune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Sigma let out a sigh herself. \u201cI will be sending an agent to meet with you and help put an end to that evil scheme.

Not the cars, not the birds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...not the Gorgon superhero being punched through a wall into a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShakily, the gorgon got up. She was quite a sight. She was a Coral Snake gorgon, standing 6' feet tall. She had red and black scales with yellow rings. She was wearing a purple leotard and a purple, full-face mask with tinted goggles and and a space for her mouth. There was a hole up top for her Coral Snake hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the Buxom Crystal, superhero. And currently, she was facing two of her foes. Stepping out of the building was an 8 foot hulking mass of muscle, and behind him was a man in a black raincoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Stormy Days, what got you and Amalgamation together? Whatever hiring site you use deserves a refund.\" BC joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laugh now, Buxom Crystal, but I will destroy you once and for all, then I will take my revenge on the people who fired me.\" Stormy Days said. \"Amalgamation! Break her bones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crystal lady die now!\" The mass called Amalgamation yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTensing up, Buxom Crystal activated her powers. She had the ability to change her breast size: the bigger she was, the stronger and more invulnerable she became. She could also turn into living crystal. In an instant, her breasts suddenly grew to beach ball size. Then, her entire body turned into solid diamond.<br>\r\nAmalgamation ran to her and punched her right in the jaw. While she did spin, she felt no pain. She turned and delivered and uppercut to the hulking beast. He fell over, but immediatly got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! That no hurt me!\" Amalgamation yelled. But then her saw BC lift up a car and slam it down on him, smashing him into the pavement. Before he could react, BC ran up and delivereed several punches to him, eventually knocking him out. She then turned to Stormy Days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, SD. You need a refund.\" BC said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSD growled and summoned a lightning storm to strike BC. She shrunk her breasts down to normal size, remaining in diamond form, and started dodging. She managed to avoid 7 bolts before one hit her and knocked her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHA! You're finished BC!\" SD yelled. But then he looked and saw BC grow her breasts back to beach ball size, then punch the ground. The ground cracked and knocked SD on his feet. Before he could get up, BC ran up to him and, after shrinking her breasts again, slammed his head into the ground, knocking him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBC smiled. \"Prediciton: Sunny.\" She joked.<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\nAfter delivering the two bad guys to the police (and dodging the press), The Buxom Crystal returned to her apartment. She ran into the bedroom and quickly removed her costume, changing into a red tee shirt and green slacks. Where The Buxom Crystal once was, now stood Nicolette Matthews, geologist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left her bedroom and was about to sit on the couch when the doorbell rang.

She tried to get a little closer, but the deer saw her and ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' She thought. 'I'd run too if I was a deer and saw a Gorgon.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaryn was an Eastern Green Mamba gorgon. She was about 5'8'', was covered in bright green scales, had yellow eyes, and Eastern Green Mamba's for hair. She possessed an athletic figure from her years of track running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaryn was vacationing in Greece. She had saved up enough vacation weeks during her job as an IRS agent to do so. She mainly took pictures in the forests and visited the local sights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at her camera and decided she had enough pictures, and started back. As she walked, however, she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. She turned to see it proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, next to a large tree, was a statue. It was a gorgon. She seems to be screaming in rage. Intrigued, Taryn walked up to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'How did I miss this?' She thought. She quickly snapped a picture of the statue. Then, she got up closer to it. For some reason, she wanted to touch. So she got up real close, and touched the statue's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat proved to be a mistake, as almost immediatly the stone exploded off the statue. Taryn covered her face to avoid getting stone in her eyes. When she uncovered her face, she was surprised by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn place of the statue was a beautiful gorgon. She was 6 feet tall and was covered in dark green scales. She had red eyes, and various types of snakes for hair. She was very curvacious, with G cup breasts, wide hips, and a huge butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new gorgon looked around, and laid eyes on Taryn. \"You,\" She said in a silky voice. \"What year is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2015?\" Taryn said, a bit freaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nearly 2000 years since I was trapped by her.\" The strange gorgon said to herself. She looked at Taryn again. \"Do you know who I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaryn shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should! I'm the reason gorgons exist. I am Medusa!\" The gorgon yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, THE Medusa?\" Taryn asked. \"The one who was a priestess of Athena, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the lie she decided to spread?\" Medusa interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lie?\" Taryn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me tell you the truth. I used to be human with great magic powers. I ruled a nearby island. I was worshiped by my people. But Athena was upset. She said I was a tyrant, that my people were suffering. I responded with war. Unfortunatly, I lost. I lost my kingdom, and Athena cursed me into this form. When I learned of my stone power, I tried to use them on Athena, but she used a mirrored shield and turned me to stone. But now I am free, so it's time for me to enact my revenge, by taking over Olympus!\" Medusa explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Olympus is real?\" Taryn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you will help me.\" Medusa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" Taryn replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedusa simply smiled and fired a green bolt at Taryn's chest. Taryn was confused, until she felt her chest get warm. She looked down and was surprised to see her breasts growing. Not only that, but she could also feel them filling up with something.

The owner was a female werecow. She was about 6' tall, was covered in black and white hair, had short red hair, green eyes, horns, a tail, and cloven hooves for feet, but lacked an udder, which wasn't uncommon for werecows in this area. But what caught Audrey's attention were the werecows breasts. They were huge, easily the size of yoga balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" The werecow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey looked up. \"I'm so sorry, Ms., um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stein. Holly Stein. And don't mock mah name.\" She said in a thick Texan accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you even manage to bring down that old barn with one tiny pebble?\" Holly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey shrugged. \"I was born unlucky.

Good.\" Holly said as she set breakfast down. \"Come on, breakfast is ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat down and started eating. Holly looked up at Audrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah want to apologize for mah behavior yesterday. That barn's been here since my grandad had this farm. Seein' it go down...\" Holly trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey frowned. \"I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok.\" Holly said. \"Anyway, today's your first day workin' here. Ah have two things ah need you to do. First, tend to the sheep. They get testy this time of year. Two, clear at least some of the rubble from the barn. Got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAudrey nodded. \"I'll do my best. Especially like this.\" She hefted up her boobs for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sorry about that. Ah was mad, and ah got defensive. Mah rules still stand. If you leave before the year is up, you spend the rest of your life with those hooters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, ah have to take off. Head into town to buy and sell some stuff. Ah'll be back later today.\" Holly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Audrey said.<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\nAbout an hour later, Holly had left in her truck. Audrey was still in the kitchen, absent-mindedly rubbing her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do first?\" Audrey asked herself.</span></div></div>",

She was covered in grey scales, had blue eyes, and Water Mocassins for hair. She had a normal build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara lived alone in her apartment and worked from home as a webmaster for a repair company. She had two friends. One was Hina, a massivly obese 26-year-old Onryo, and the other was Lauren, a 27-year-old Succubus bodybuilder. Things were, overall, normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today would change that.<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\nClara woke up happy. Today was her first day off this month. She threw off her covers and attempted to get up. But she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara was confused. She tried again, but she couldn't roll off the bed. She could feel a huge weight on her. Worried, she managed, with great effort, to move herself into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd was stunned by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, overnight, her breasts had grown enormous. They had to be as big as bean bag chairs. They completely covered her legs. Her shirt and bra had burst off, leaving her topless. When she tried to move again, she heard a sloshing sound come from her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara couldn't believe this. She looked at her night stand and grabbed her phone. She started to dial her friends.<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\nFour hours later, Clara's friends were in the room with her along with a female werewolf doctor. The doctor was examining her breasts, along with trying to use a milk pump to drain them. But after four hours, nothing happened. The doctor turned off the pump and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't know what to tell you, Miss Mencano. Except for this,\" She said, motioning to her breasts. \"You're perfectly normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Normal, my massive ass.\" Hina yelled. \"Boobs don't just grow overnight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but my tests say she's healthy. Which is more then I can say for you.\" The doctor said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This is 700 pounds of beauty!\" Hina yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, what about me?\" Clara asked.<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry. Well, I can take some blood samples back to the hospital and see what they can do, but it will take a while.\" The doctor replied.<br>\r\n\"So, Clara's stuck like this?\" Lauren said, poking one of Clara's giant boobs.<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately. And since the pump did no good, I can only assume that she cannot lactate. Furthermore, it seems that they're so heavy, she's pinned to her bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Clara yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you when I have something.\" The doctor said. Then she turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed. \"Great. I'm stuck in bed with these monster boobs.\" She said. She then laid her head on her boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, we'll help you all we can.\" Lauren said. \"We'll be like your maids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I have some French Maid outfits at home!\" Hina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren and Clara looked at her. \"Why?\" Lauren asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHina blushed. \"No reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara sighed again. \"You want to help?

Clara blushed and moaned as Hina's hands continued their work. She could feel the milk slosh around in her boob. After a little while, Lauren pitched in and started rubbing Clara's left boob. Clara's moans got louder as their hands continued to move. After about 20 minutes, they had finished massaging. Clara sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" She said. \"That felt really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" Hina said. Then she looked at Clara's front. \"Hm.

It helped her to clear her mind of the annoyances of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was an interesting sight to see in the park. She was a Blood Python gorgon. She had red scales with white spots, red eyes, and Blood Pythons for her. She had an athletic build, and rarely for her species of gorgon, a tail. On top of that, she was a Goth. Today, she wore a black tee-shirt with a white skull, tight black jeans, black high-heeled boots, black eyeliner, and black lipstick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria had many dreams, one of which was to be rich. She hated her job at Temerton's Outfitters, and wanted to get rich so she could leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she daydreamed about wealth, her foot kicked something. Snapping her out of her daydream, she looked down and saw a bottle. It looked like a purple glass flask with a stopper that looked like a beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm. Bottles that look like this in ficiton usually have a genie in them.' She thought. Smiling she picked up the bottle and opened it. To her disapointment, there was only a puff of purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn it!\" Maria said out loud. \"I was hoping for a genie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to see where the voice came from, Maria saw an incredible sight. Floting in front of her, cross-legged, was a ghost woman. She had chalk white skin, purple eyes, and violet hair in a ponytail. She was incredibly voluptuous, with huge boobs and an even bigger butt. She wore a purple belly dancer's outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a genie?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Well, half-genie, half-Onryo.\" The genie replied. \"My name is Kya. Since you opened my bottle, you get wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many?\" Maria asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The typical three. Oh, right, rules. One, no wishing for love. Two, no wishing for someone to die or come back to life. Three, no wishing to be a world leader. That one never turns out good. Finally, no sex wishes. Those turn out bad.\" Kya explained. \"So, mistress, what's your first wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria smirked. This made Kya nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like that grin.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kya, I wish for infinite wishes and that you could only grant my wishes.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SON OF A-\" Kya yelled. Sighing, she snapped her fingers. \"There.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't think you'd do that.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Higher ups forgot to make a rule where you can't ask for that.\" Kya said, annoyed. \"Any other wishes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I wish that I had bigger boobs. These girls are to tiny.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKya grinned. 'Fine, I'll do that, but I'll add a little genie revenge. Everytime you wish from now on, they get bigger and heavier.' Kya thought. She then snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Maria's breasts shot up 3 cup sizes. This made her grin. \"Nice.\" She said. \"That's all for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Kya said. \"Since you now have infinite wishes, take my bottle. Whenever you want to wish, take of the stopper.\" With that, Kya returned to the bottle.<br>\r\n\"This is going to be fun.\" Maria said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe it will. For me.' Kya though in her bottle.<br>\r\n-----------------------<br>\r\nAlright, what now?</span></div></div>",

She legitimatly wants to be friends with the other islands, but some are less receptive then others, mainly Mervanas, the dragon island Drago, and the Harpy island Harparius.

In this adventure, Georgia is conned into buying a failed perfume from Shelly, but in the process, accidentally sits on and breaks the bottle, causing her ass to slowly swell at rapid rate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Fang in the Ass- Barbara is a gorgon with 2 big problems. First of all, she's a total klutz, which leads to her second problem. One day, during a rather nasty spill, one of the red vipers that makes up her hair accidentally bites her and injects her own venom into her butt. However, since venom can't kill a gorgon, the venom stays stuck and accumulates, causing her rear to swell as the snakebite continues to accumulate poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Feat of Clay- In this story, Jade, a gorgon model for a monster fashion magazine finds herself a victim of a strange type of revenge when her ex-boyfriend uses a magic clay voodoo doll that causes her rear to expand whenever the clay doll gets bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Lifetime on the Hips- In this story, a python based gorgon named Skyla gets a job at a donut shop, but helps herself to some of the merchandise when nobody is looking, developing an unusual addiction due to the strange ingredients used for the donuts being addictive to reptilian monsters. Suffusive to say, it changes her body and makes her fat accumulate in only one specific area.</span></div></div>",

Zeus damn you, Shelly.\" Georgia then let out a sigh and went to dig out more clay from under her sink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia was an artist, one who specialized in sculptures. However, unlike other artists, there were two things about her that were unusual. First was that Georgia was a gorgon. A scaly silver skinned gorgon girl with black cobras for hair. The other thing that was unusual was that Georgia was 550ft tall. She lived in a world where monsters of mythology were as big as skyscrapers. Georgia lived in the Monster Arms apartment building in Horrorville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason Georgia was so angry was because her neighbor, Shelly, had sold her a bottle of perfume that didn't smell at all pleasant. Because of that, Georgia had returned from a disastrous date. \"That perfume that stupid kappa sold me smelled worse than a skunk ape on drugs! So much for my date with that hot Gashadokuro guy. Next time I see her, I'm going to make her into turtle soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia let out a sigh. Her romantic life wasn't going so well. It was known as a fact by the rest of the all female (except for one male human) population of the apartment that Georgia was bisexual but all her recent dates had ended in complete disaster. That was one of the reasons she stayed indoors all day working on her projects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia took out a big lump of blue clay and then she sniffed at it. \"Haven't used this in a long time. Now, if I could only think of the concept. The client told me she wanted a work of art that captured the living incarnation of horror. I think I'll make it look like Nefernina.\" Of course, Georgia was referring to her landlady, Nefernina-Su-Ancknamun, a gigantic pear-shaped mummy who ruled Monster Arms with an iron fist. With the except of Lupa, a werewolf who lived on the second floor, nobody in the apartment could stand Nefernina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia laughed as she laid the clay on a pedestal. \"That's what I'll do. Only I'll make her look absolutely repulsive.\" At this point, Georgia forgot all about the perfume bottle on her chair and as she sat down to mold the clay, she accidentally broke the bottle and jumped up with a yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the splattered perfume and broken glass on her orange jean-covered backside and grumbled to herself. \"Damn you Shelly.\" What Georgia didn't notice was that the liquid seemed to be making her ass ripple and throb. But before she could even think about it, there was a knock on her door. \"Now who could that be?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia walked up to the door, her butt seemingly swelling with every step.

Nefernina looked like a dark skinned Egyptian woman with slightly dry skin, wrapped up to her neck in gold-yellow colored gauze. She had black hair worn in a bob-cut and was wearing a sapphire anti-eyebrow with a matching necklace and golden earrings shaped like scarab beetles. Nefernina was also very pear-shaped body wise with an ass that had to be at least a third as wide as she herself was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia let out a groan as she looked the scowling mummy woman in the face. \"What do you want, Nefernina?\" \"What do you think I want, snake brain?\" asked Nefernina abrasively. \"It's the first Tuesday of the month, you know what that means.\" \"Rent day.\" Moaned Georgia. Georgia let out a sigh and started to walk away. However, as she walked to get her payment for Nefernina, Nefernina looked at Georgia in curiosity because it looked like Georgia's butt was getting bigger and the back of her jeans seemed to be ripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina took out her eyes briefly and polished them before putting them back in her head and then the mummy looked to Georgia's half finished clay sculpture of her face. \"What is that?\" asked Nefernina. \"Is that supposed to be me.\" \"No.\" Said Georgia lying through her teeth. Nefernina just gave a glare. \"It better not,\" said Nefernina. \"If you were thinking about mocking me, then you're as good as evicted.\" As Nefernina was saying that, Georgia was moving her lips to mock her, outside of Nefernina's sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia got her rent money and handed Nefernina a roll of skulls; by this, I am not referring to actually skulls, but the money Georgia handed Nefernina resembled black dollar bills with the Vault-Keeper printed on them. \"Here you are, Cleofatra,\" said Georgia calling Nefernina by her least favorite nickname. \"Now shut up and take my money. Georgia was going to walk away but the mummy giantess grabbed her by the shoulders. \"Not so fast.\" Nefernina grabbed hold of the gorgon giantess and both skyscraper sized monsters pressed their but tcheeks against each other. Georgia grunted as her ass touched Nefernina's. Surprisingly both their asses were the same 175ft wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm,\" moaned Nefernina. \"Have you been putting on weight.\" \"Look who's talking.\" Mumbled an offended Georgia under her breath. Nefernina rubbed her chin and then Georgia walked out. \"I was just about to get the mail anyway. Goodbye Nefernina\" She said. Nefernina would've normally gone to collect rent money from everyone else but she could've sworn that Georgia's ass was getting bigger and decided to follow her to get to the bottom of this (sorry, bad joke, I know).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia walked up to the mailroom with Nefernina following behind and it looked like Georgia's ass was swelling with every step as Georgia made her way to her mailbox. \"Wow,\" said a voice. \"That's some serious junk in the trunk.\" \"Who said that?!\" yelled Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the mailroom walked another skyscraper sized monster girl.

Patsy was a cat with, a fairy/female type monster. In her case, she resembled an hourglass shaped Siamese cat girl. Patsy belonged to a biker gang called the Firecats and as such wore a leather skirt and a jacket with flames painted on the back with a cat's eye logo and the words \"BAD KITTY\" written on the back. Now, Georgia and Patsy didn't exactly get along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away, Patsy,\" said Georgia. \"I don't have time for your minotaur **** today.\" \"I didn't think snakes had butts before I met you, Georgia,\" said Patsy with a smirk as she bent over to stair at bulging booty. \"And it looks like yours is getting bigger.\" Georgia gave a glare that was visible through her sunglasses as her hair hissed. If Georgia wasn't wearing her glasses, Patsy would become a giant lawn statue. \"You know, Patsy,\" said Georgia. \"I don't have time to put up with you, today and I'm not exactly in a good mood. Cleofatra already busted my ass about my ass not even five minutes ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina was still watching and gave a glare. \"Cleofatra?!\" she thought to herself angrily. \"You'll get yours... you... you... Medusass! Hmm, I'm going to remember that. Note to self, think of a clever insult for the rest of the tenants sans Petra. Then Nefernina saw that the seat of Georgia's jeans was further ripping and looked in surprise. Georgia was oblivious to her pants destroying ass and was walking away, mail in hand before Patsy let out a purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Georgia let out a loud scream. Patsy had slashed both her butt cheeks with her claws and made her bleed slightly as her panties were exposed. \"Yep,\" said Patsy. \"It's definitely bigger. Barely broke the skin.\" Georgia let out an angry grunt as her pants slipped off. \"I swear to Zeus, Patsy, I'm going to put you to sleep. Thank Hera I was heading to the laundry room anyway.\" Patsy purred teasingly as Georgia, now in her Spider-Man print panties was walking angrily to the laundry room. With every step, Georgia's ass grew bigger and bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were several monsters already doing laundry. There was Selena, an 850ft tall black were cat who was loading her bikinis into a washing machine right as Astrid, an obese 700ft tall and red skinned manticore with a scorpion's tail and three sets of sharp teeth was standing butt naked as she was taking out her laundry. Since it was an all female apartment (except for one human) it was okay. Both Astrid and Selena saw Georgia and looked at her in surprise for now Georgia's ass had to be as wide as she was tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Georgia was oblivious but didn't appreciate their staring at her. \"What?!\" yelled Georgia. Selena and Astrid just went back to their laundry as Georgia walked to a drier and took out a spare pair of jean shorts. \"Those will never fit you anymore.\" Said Patsy in a teasing tone. Georgia let out a hiss and showed Patsy her forked tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Patsy turned out to be right because Georgia couldn't get her shorts past her knees. \"Damn!\" yelled Georgia. \"What the Tartarus is... ah!\" Georgia felt a tingle and then felt her sides and felt that they were even squishier that a jellyfish. Georgia looked back at her swelling ass and gasped. \"Oh my Ra!\" yelled Nefernina as she looked on from the doorway. Selena and Astrid stepped back as Georgia twitched and started to pant because her butt was still growing and in less than ten seconds it swelled to....</span></div></div>",

She looked back and screamed at how big her ass had become. \"Georgia,\" said Astrid. \"Calm dowch!\" Georgia in her panic turned and bludgeoned the naked manticore woman with her colossal ass. Georgia blushed and moaned in fear as her snake hair was acting up. Even Patsy, who mocked the gorgon giantess was in shock. \"Wow,\" said the Cat Sith girl. \"That's a big honking booty. You could probably put a splintercat to shame.\" Georgia was crying in fear and Nefernina for once, seemed to show some empathy and walked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Georgia,\" she said. \"Stop it.\" Georgia crouched down while her ass stayed in the air. Nefernina, knowing her own booty was by no means small, laid her rear against Georgia's and was surprised to see that Georgia's ass completely dwarfed her own. \"I never thought I'd meet a non-splintercat or behemoth girl with an ass that made mine look small. We need to see Chel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina walked out the room first with Selena, Astrid and Patsy following. Georgia tried to squeeze out the laundry room door, but her ass immediately got stuck and she groaned. Georgia had both her legs out the laundry room door but her butt was much too big. \"Oh for the love of Ra,\" groaned Nefernina. \"Selena, get Petra and Irene in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelena wasted no time in getting the two strongest monsters in the Monster Arms apartment. First was Irene, the 775ft tall purple skinned cyclops body builder and second was Petra, the 1000ft tall orange skinned and white haired gargoyle policewoman. \"Yikes,\" said Irene. \"That's the worst case of thunder thighs I've ever seen. It's a wonder she can even stand up. Georgia, what the hell have you been eating?\" Petra just rolled her eyes. \"And I thought Janet's ass was huge.\" Petra was of course referring to her younger sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra and Irene each grabbed one of Georgia's arms and pulled with all their strength as Georgia grunted and grit her teeth. It got Georgia free, but it tore off most of the wall and the laundry room doorway was stuck to Georgia's ass. Nefernina glared at Georgia. \"You are <i>so</i> paying for that.\" Georgia just grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the foyer came another monster. Chel, an 800ft tall yeti girl with light blue skin and silvery fur with pink highlights in her hair. Chel worked as a nurse, which was why she was called in the first place. Chel was feeling all around Georgia's ass and even jammed her hand in it to make Georgia wince as she felt around. \"There's something wrong here,\" said Selena. \"Chel? What could've made Georgia's ass get so big?\" \"Well,\" said Chel. \"We can safely say that it isn't nebutori.\" \"Thank Zeus.\" Said Irene. Nebutori was a supernatural virus that spread quickly and made human and monster women morbidly obese and lethargic. A few months ago there was an epidemic of nebutori in the apartment and nobody wanted a repeat, least of all Irene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAstrid bent over and rubbed her head with her own stinger tail as Chel did a diagnosis. \"Definitely no silicon injection and Georgia's record has no traces of cosmetic surgery,\" said the yeti girl. \"I wonder...\" \"Maybe it's an allergy,\" said Selena. \"Georgia works with clay all day. Maybe she had an allergic reaction.\" \"Selena,\" said Georgia. \"I've been working with clay since I was in kindergarten. I don't think that's it. Ugh. I think my ass is still getting bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile this discussion was going on, Patsy walked upstairs to inspect Georgia's apartment. As she walked inside, she saw the sculpture Georgia was working on. \"Ugh,\" she said. \"It looks like Nefernina, better put it out of its misery. Patsy sat in Georgia's chair, unaware of the broken perfume bottle shards on the seat and she took a clay knife to stab away at the Nefernina sculpture as she let out a laugh. As Patsy was laughing, she leaned back and then yelled because she sat on the glass. \"Dammit!\" she yelled. Patsy was rubbing her booty, not noticing that it was swelling just like Georgia's butt was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDownstairs, Chel and the girls were still trying to figure out the reason for Georgia's big ass. \"Georgia,\" said Chel. \"Did you come in contact with anything strange within the last 24 hours.\" \"No,\" said Georgia. \"Just..\" Georgia's eyes popped and she jumped up, accidentally pinning Chel under her large ass. \"Shelly's perfume! That little bitch! Shelly sold me a bum perfume and I sat on the vial. The broken glass must've broke my skin and put the crud in my body.\" Astrid gasped. \"Shelly? That crook? Damn her. She's still on parole for that nebutori scam.\" Petra gave a glare. \"The next time I catch her,\" she said. \"She's going to Under Gloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there was a meowing scream. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Selena. \"Patsy.\" Patsy waddled down the stairs before slipping and rolling. Because she sat on the perfume, her ass had gotten as big as Georgia's and she was struggling to get up. \"Good grief!\" yelled Nefernina. \"Help me.\" Groaned Patsy. Georgia gave a smug smile Patsy's way and Patsy hissed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth the gorgon and the siamese cat giantesses laid their butts to each other in concern as Chel looked at the broken vial. \"I've got good news and bad news.\" \"What's the good news?\" asked Patsy. \"The good news,\" said Chel. \"Is that it appears the swelling will eventually stop.\" \"And the bad news?\" asked Georgia. Chel let out a sigh. \"I have never seen an elixir like this before and I can't identify the ingredients. I'm afraid I can't cure you.\" Both Georgia and Patsy were horrified at their big-butted fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: Don't worry Lwut, I have 12th Doctor's approval on this idea)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich POV to follow the next day?</span></div></div>",

The siamese cat giantess tried to get out of bed, but because her ass was now 1000ft wide, she had some difficulty and as she managed to squeeze out of the bed, she fell with a pratfall to the floor. The cat girl let out a groan. She lifted her monstrous booty and then took a walk into the bathroom to take a shower as she threw off her pajamas. Her pants had been stretched out so wide that they were longer than the shower curtains. Patsy squeezed into the shower but as she turned the water on, she found her top half as the only part of her body that got wet. Her butt had gotten stuck in the shower and she couldn't even close it properly as the water came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat girl let out a moan. \"Damn Georgia and that damn potion,\" said Patsy as she was crying. \"Now I'm gonna spend my nine lives as a big assed kitty cat.\" Patsy managed to squeeze out of the shower, but in the process, her giant ass broke off the bathroom sink. \"Damn!\" yelled Patsy as the sink smashed in pieces on the floor. \"Damn it all! Nefernina's not going to like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina didn't like that and twenty minutes later, the mummy landlady found herself gluing the sink back together. \"What do I look like?\" asked Nefernina. \"A plumber?\" \"No,\" said Patsy under her breath. \"You look like toilet paper, though.\" \"I wouldn't joke about that, given your condition, Fatsy.\" Said the mummy. Patsy just hissed and spat to the side. \"Is that the best insult you can come up with?\" \"Give me a break,\" said Nefernina as she managed to get the sink back together. \"Not all of us can come up with clever insults like \"Cleofatra\". To be honest, this wasn't the first thing I expected you'd need me to fix after your condition.\" Patsy gave a glare at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong after Nefernina had left, Patsy was busy making canary pancakes for breakfast when she dropped her saltshaker on the floor. She bent over to pick the shaker up, but in the process, her ginormous booty tipped over the frying pan and the battery spilled into her butt crack, causing her to scream loudly from the heat. The angry and now red-butted, skyscraper sized siamese cat found herself eating bananas and drinking soda for breakfast.

She wore a pair of large round glasses and today she was wearing a red gothic Lolita outfit modeled after a spider web.

She was with her human roommate, R.L., who was riding on her shoulder. Neither of them had any idea of Georgia\u2019s condition and were heading for her apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Cadence let out a mumble. \u201cI know,\u201d you say. \u201cIt has been seven days since Georgia borrowed your manuscript and you need it back.

The talking jellyfish is a nice touch.\" Cadence let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Cadence walked downstairs and saw construction workers with a small crane driving up towards the laundry room. Cadence didn't know about Georgia's massive butt expansion and grunted in confusion. \"Huh,\" you say. \"Maybe Cheapernina finally exchanged No. 04 for a dryer that works. Let's just get to the library. They asked you to do a book signing.\" Cadence grunted, not noticing that with every step her butt was getting bigger and the pale blue behind had gotten too large for her skirt to cover, revealing piano key print panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCadence walked out the door with RL on her shoulder and noticed an ice cream cart nearby and bought a triple gray matter scoop with an extra scoop of cotton candy and sprinkles. RL looked in disgust as Cadence licked her ice cream made from brains. \"Ugh,\" groaned RL. \"I know you're a zombie, Cadence, but how can you eat that stuff. I'm glad I know that didn't come from anything sentient.\" Cadence ignored the human on her shoulder and continued to lick at the ice cream. \"You know, Cadence,\" says RL. \"You've been eating a lot of sweets and brains lately. Are brains fattening?\" Cadence grunted as if to say \"I dunno\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRL shook his head. \"You know, Cadence. I don't know where you put it all. It's a wonder you're not as big as Lupa. One day all that gray matter is going to go to your thighs.\" Cadence ignored RL's warning not realizing that now each one of her butt cheeks was the size of a car. Her ass was arguably as big as Georgia's and it was almost touching her neck. But the zombie was blissfully unaware as she took RL and was heading off to the library.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cadence had yet to realize how large her behind was and made her way towards the Horrorville Library. \"That new book you released spread like a disease, Cadence,\" said R.L. on Cadence's shoulder. \"Everyone in Horrorville must have a copy at some point.\" Cadence nodded her head and grunted. \"<i>The Notch in the Eagle's Tooth</i>,\" said R.L. \"That's gotta be your best one yet.\" As Cadence was walking towards the library there was a bookstore nearby with Cadence's book, <i>The Notch in the Eagle's Tooth</i> for sale. The cover of the book depicted a blood-stained and disembodied eagle's beak that had a fang in the center of it and the beak was being held by a blood-stained hand of a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The whole idea that a writer is using a disembodied and haunted bird's beak to steal ideas in exchange for murders. Wicked concept.\" Cadence grunted several times. She knew R.L. couldn't really understand what she was saying, but the zombie unaware of her own growing booty was explaining to R.L. that since she lived in the part of the world where giant monsters of mythology made their home, she had to be extra creative when writing horror novels. It wasn't always easy. She then let out a mumble as she saw the library in sight. That was when there was a loud ripping noise. \"Was that the sound of somebody's skirt ripping?\" asked R.L. Cadence shrugged her shoulders and soon enough she was at the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting for Cadence was the librarian who from the looks of it was a bright salmon-colored cockatrice, a monster resembling a hybrid of a chicken and a dragon. She was somewhat fat and had a gold-colored face and a large comb that reached from the tip of her nose to her forehead and spread around in a way that made it resemble hair. The cockatrice librarian saw Cadence's face and smiled. \"Oh,\" she said. \"There you are, Ms. Deadman. Right on time.\" Cadence gave a smile and grunted. \"Actually,\" said the cockatrice librarian. \"The book signing starts in 15 minutes. Plenty of time to get ready.\" Cadence stepped into the library and the librarian gave a look of shock, finally noticing Cadence's enormous booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeepers,\" said the bird woman. \"I think that you've been sitting around writing too long.\" Cadence gave a mutter of confusion and then R.L. looked back and gasped. \"Cadence,\" said R.L. \"Look at your butt?\" Cadence looked in confusion and then in surprise. Her butt was twice her height and seemed to be at least 10 times her width. The zombie muttered and rubbed her temple in confusion. \"Something in Georgia's apartment must've made your ass ginormous,\" said R.L. \"Good grief. Whoa!\" RL fell back and landed in the side of Cadence's piano-print panties. \"This is an odd case,\" said the librarian. \"Do you want me to cancel the book signing?\" Cadence shook her head and then felt her chin. This large behind was giving her a good idea for a new horror story to work on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, first thing was first. The book signing was about to begin and Cadence decided to take her seat. The zombie giantess had to sit down in four chairs due to how massive her behind had become. She plucked R.L. out of the side of her panties and placed him on her earring as she got a few pens ready. \"This is going to be an interesting day.\" Said R.L.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At that time, Nefernina walked into Georgia's apartment looking for what exactly made Georgia's booty so big. \"Nobody in all of Monster Arms has an ass that makes mine look terribly small,\" said the mummified landlady to herself. \"But somehow Georgia's butt has gotten so big that it puts a splintercat's booty to shame. Maybe it was an allergic reaction to her own clay.\" Nefernina inspected Georgia's sculptures and found the grotesque one Georgia made of her. The mummy gave a glare. \"Oh, really funny, Georgia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina then made her way into Georgia's kitchen. \"Perhaps something she ate did the trick.\" Nefernina looked into Georgia's refrigerator and saw that there was a roasted pterodactyl that was half eaten, several old pizzas, a leftover chocolate birthday cake, several cans of soda and a bottle of milk. Nefernina chugged the milk before she took a slice of Georgia's pizza. \"There's barely enough here to add inches to one's waistline. There has got to be something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNefernina then sniffed the air and gagged. \"What the netherworld is that horrid smell?\" asked the mummy. \"It smells like something died. And stayed dead.\" The mummy was smelling the perfume and then walked forward to the chair of broken glass and saw the spilt perfume. \"Is that supposed to be perfume?\" asked Nefernina. \"It smells like Lupa's breath first thing in the morning.\" Then Nefernina noticed the broken glass and gasped. \"Oh my!\" she yelled. \"Georgia must've sat in this swill and it made her ass explode. Hmmm.\" Nefernina took a handful of some of the potion and rubbed it on her ass as she smirked. \"Look out, Georgia,\" she said. \"I'll show you who sits on the throne around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment, a crane had arrived to pick Georgia up. The gargoyle foreman was surprised with what he saw. \"Well, well, looks like we found our new wrecking ball.\" Georgia just gave a glare as she was laid back on the upper floor. Georgia looked back to see that her butt had to be 1500ft wide at least and it was now taller than she was. She let out a sigh and felt the ass. \"Oh my,\" said Selena. \"That's quite an ass. Looks bigger than Petra's kid sister's.\" Georgia was struggling to stand up and wound up accidentally knocking down a wall with her behind. Georgia looked back in embarrassment for behind the wall was Chel the yeti girl and she was in the shower when the wall came down, causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Georgia. \"Nefernina won't like that.\" Before Georgia could say another word, she heard a crashing noise. \"What the heck!\" yelled Georgia. Astrid heard the crash as well and bit her lip. \"Geez,\" she said. \"I had no idea what a dangerous apartment this was. Georgia waddled forward in order to find the source of the crash and was surprised. It was Nefernina and it turned out the potion worked on her and Nefernina's ass was now as big as Georgia's. The mummy girl's bandages were now as skinny as dental floss on such a wide booty and exposed her light tanned skin underneath. At least she had the sense to be wearing gold panties underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mummy grunted and got up and smirked as she slapped her behind. \"Like what you see, Georgia?\" asked Nefernina with a sly grin. \"What did you do? Did you get into that perfume Shelly sold me? Why would you do something so stupid?\" Nefernina bumped her booty into Georgia's own rear and gave her a smug smile. \"That's what you get for challenging my authority. I'm the lady in the throne around here!\" Selena whispered into Astrid's ear. \"She's the lady in 6 thrones more like it.\" Georgia let out a groan. \"Well the joke's on you, landlady. Now you have to remodel the entire building.\" Nefernina simply snapped her fingers and all the hallways in Monster Arms expanded. \"Problem?\" asked the mummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia let out a sigh. She knew that trying to reason with her landlady was not likely to get her anywhere and so she gave up. What now?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a stomping noise as another monster entered the mailroom. This was Irene Stargazer, a ginormous purple cyclops who stood a head taller than the gorgon giantess. Irene was a bodybuilder who had more muscle on her body than the buffest human bodybuilder. The fact was Irene was a total health nut who hated the idea of getting even 1% of fat in her body. Unlike other cyclopses, she didn't eat humans because she considered them to be too fattening. She noticed how Georgia's booty had expanded and gave the gorgon a spanking as she shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Georgia, Georgia, Georgia,\" said the cyclops. \"Just look at you. What have you been eating?\" Georgia's snakes hissed loudly in the cyclops girl's face. \"You want me to turn you to stone, Irene?\" asked an irate Georgia. \"All I'm saying,\" said Irene. \"Is that you're getting a big booty.\" Georgia is about to say something but then she looks back and sees her butt and her jaws drop, to say nothing of her glasses, forcing Irene to cover her eye. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Georgia. \"My butt is HUGE!\" Georgia noticed her glasses landed between her massive butt cheeks and were stuck in the crack. Georgia grunted and tried to reach for her glasses but they were completely stuck and as she tried to reposition herself to better grab her glasses, she accidentally broke them between her buttocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia grunted and then took out her spare pair of sunglasses. \"I can't believe it,\" said the gorgon. \"My butt is 800ft wide. How does this even happen?\" Irene opened her eye as soon as it was safe to do so and then shook her head. \"It all comes from eating all those fatty foods. But I've never seen it happen this fast. Unless...\" Irene screamed and then jumped back. \"Nebutori!?\" Georgia gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNebutori was a supernatural virus that made women morbidly obese and lethargic and spread like wildfire. Irene was deathly afraid of catching such a fattening virus. \"It's not nebutori, Irene,\" said Georgia angrily. \"It was that stupid perfume Shelly sold me. I'm going to make her into turtle soup.\" What Georgia didn't know was that some of the perfume had still splattered all over her pants and there was just enough for another woman to be infected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, another monster was walking in. This was Janine, a mysterious Japanese kitsune resembling a human women with fox's ears, feet and nine tails and a blue kanji-tattoo to the side of her face. She was too busy listening to music to notice Georgia's swelling behind. \"Don't worry, Georgia,\" says Irene. \"I think I know a way to get that booty back to a more bearable size. Georgia let out a grain and then started to leave the mailroom, but as she does so, she accidentally splatters the bad perfume still soaked on her pants and it lands on...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Georgia opened the door and looked up to see the most feared monster giantess in the building; Petra Maza. As Petra\u2019s name suggested, she was a titanic gargoyle. She had an hourglass figure with bright orange skin, large leather wings, a long tail, taloned feet with claws for fingers, small horns on her forehead and long white hair. Petra was the most feared monster in the apartment for two reaons. 1) At 1000ft tall, she towered over every other monster in the building (ironically, she was only the middle child of three sisters). 2) Petra was a cop, making it really difficult for anyone in the apartment to commit any illegal activity. Nefernina actually had Petra live in the apartment because prior to Petra moving in, Patsy and her biker gang threw a wild party that nearly got Monster Arms in trouble with the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia looked up at Petra in pure fear. \u201cOh,\u201d said Georgia. \u201cHi, Petra.\u201d \u201cHello, Georgia. Have you seen Shelly lately?\u201d \u201cNot since that turtle bitch sold me a bogus perfume.\u201d Petra nodded her head. \u201cI noticed. I\u2019ve got two other people in here who are rather steamed with Shelly and have been looking for her.\u201d Petra waved her hand and in walked two more tenants who actully lived on the same floor as Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of them was Mavis Blaze, a 700ft tall hourglass shaped banshee woman with palish green skin, pointed ears, sharp teeth, dark rings over her eyes and long golden red hair. Georgia didn\u2019t like Mavis that much. She was a rather haughty opera singer who believed she had a golden voice. Her species proved otherwise though. The second was Aiba Howler, the older sister of Lupa. Aiba was an ivory furred werewolf goth girl with short-dyed black hair (naturally brown) and red eyes. She was fairly muscular but had a condition called Lactose Overload Syndrome, a condition where her breasts were massive yet unable to lactate. It was a condition that only werewolves, succubi and gargoyles get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two?\u201d asked Georgia. Mavis let out a loud scream. \u201cThat Shelly is a menace. Look what the conditioner she sold me did to my hair.\u201d Mavis turned around and showed that park of her hair was turning golden pink. \u201cTo say nothing of the nail polish.\u201d Mavis held up her sharp fingernails to reveal that they appeared to have turned to soldi copper.\u201d Aiba growled. \u201cI\u2019m steamed too,\u201d she said. \u201cLook what that mouthwash she sold me did to my teeth.\u201d Aiba opened her mouth and showed that her teeth had turned bright green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m surprised Shelly is still alive after all the crap she pulled. As Georgia was walking away, Aiba noticed something. Georgia\u2019s ass appeared to be outgrowing her pants. \u201cGeorgia?\u201d asks Aiba. \u201cAre you putting on weight?\u201d \u201cExcuse me?\u201d asked Georgia. Aiba decided to shut up as Georgia went to work sculpting. \u201cWhat are you making?\u201d asked Petra. \u201cA customer commissioned me to put together the most horrifying sculpture ever.\u201d \u201cSo you\u2019re making it look like old bandage buns?\u201d asked Aiba. Georgia let out a laugh but then she looked at her thighs to see that her butt appeared to have grown to the size of four watermelons. She then polished her glasses and then she heard a yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Georgia\u2019s guests had sat down on the chair with the broken glass and strange potion. But which one?</span></div></div>",

I accidentally sat on that bottle of perfume that Shelly sold me and forgot to take off the glass.\" Aiba looked at the glass wedged in the bottom of Petra's unitard and blinked. \"That has got to be some sharp glass to be able to hurt a gargoyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra begun to cough. \"And it isn't even good perfume either. I promise you this, Georgia, as soon as I find Shelly, I'm going to clobber her.\" \"Save some of her for me, Petra.\" Said Georgia. Petra then walked out as Georgia continued work on her sculpture and Aiba noticed something. \"You're getting a little bit pudgy in the rear, Georgia. What have you been eating?\" Georgia covered her butt in embarrassment and then stood up. \"Excuse me, Aiba? You're not one to talk. After all, those meteors on your chest can be rented as wrecking balls.\" Aiba growled at Georgia for that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Petra was getting ready for work and putting on her police uniform. However, the gargoyle was grunting as she tried to put the skirt on. \"What the hell?\" she asked herself. \"Did my ass get bigger? Damn. Should've known those crullers would catch up to me eventually. If I'm not careful, I'll put Janet to shame.\" Janet was Petra's younger sister. She was a bright red-skinned gargoyle with purple hair worn in a ponytail. However, unlike her sister who was hourglass shaped, Janet was chubby and extremely pear-shaped with an ass that was even wider than she was tall. Petra also had an older sister named Roxy who was shorter than either her or Janet but also much more obese, especially in the stomach. Roxy had yellow skin and lived in Terrordale, which was Horrorville's twin city and most hated enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the three sisters, Petra was the most normally proportioned one, or rather she used to be because that strange potion was taking effect on her rear. As Georgia's ass was growing, so was Petra's as she walked out into the hallway and flew out the window. As Petra tried to climb out the window it took her a minute of struggling because her ass had gotten stuck. As for Georgia, she was ironically sculpting a big assed sculpture of Nefernina as her own ass was getting rounder.</span></div></div>",

At this point she was shaping the face to look like Nefernina\u2019s own and was smirking as she sculpted cracks and wrinkles on the face to make it look like it was decaying. \u201cThis is terrific,\u201d thought Georgia to herself. \u201cThis client of mine wanted absolute horror and nothing is more horrifying than lard butt Nefernina. This is for overcharging me for last month\u2019s rent you used bandage.\u201d Georgia laughed to herself and continued to sculpt. Because she had her headphones in, Georgia failed to notice that her pants were ripping at the sides and her ass was getting bigger. One of the cobras in Georgia\u2019s hair noticed what was happening and then hissed before biting her in the neck and causing her to grunt as she took her head phones off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw,\u201d she said. \u201cYou scaly hair idiot. I already fed you this morning. Now you all had better behave or tomorrow I\u2019m paying a visit to the barber.\u201d Georgia\u2019s hair turned pale before deciding that it would be a better idea to let Georgia notice her booty expansion for herself. Georgia\u2019s ass at this point expanded so big that her jeans had torn at the seat and had been reduced to a pair of chaps, revealing a pair of blue panties with white stars on them that made them resemble Wonder Woman\u2019s thong. \u201cNow,\u201d said Georgia unaware of her own growing ass. \u201cI think to make this one more horrifying, I\u2019ll poke a hole where the heart is, to show Nefernina\u2019s inner heartlessness and project the horror of having your heart torn out.\u201d Georgia kept on sculpting as her ass kept on growing and soon her sculpture was finished. \u201cPerfect,\u201d said the gorgon to herself. \u201cNow I\u2019ll just leave the clay to harden and get something to eat. Thank goodness I still have that leftover tarantula calzone in the fridge.\u201d Georgia licked her lips as she retreated into her kitchen. At this point her ass was as wide as the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia took the calzone and put it in the microwave before she heard her cellphone ringing to the Superhero Squad Show ringtone. She immediately snatched the phone and blushed. \u201cI have seriously got to change my ringtone. The girls would kill me if they heard that. Hello, Georgia Alexopoulos, artist extraordinaire.\u201d \u201cGeorgia. It\u2019s Petra. I think there\u2019s something you ought to know.\u201d On the other end of the phone, Petra\u2019s ass had expanded to the size of a car and she had used it to pin down several would-be-mobsters at a convenience store. The gargoyle lady\u2019s behind was so big that it made her tail look miniscule. However, Georgia didn\u2019t know this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat appears to be the problem, Petra?\u201d asked Georgia right as she took her calzone out of the microwave and begun to eat it. \u201cWell,\u201d said Petra. \u201cApparently that bad perfume Shelly made had the side effect of causing our asses to grow to ginormous size.\u201d Georgia gasped and then looked to see her butt was stuck in the door frame. \u201cJupiter H. Zeus!\u201d yelled Georgia. \u201cOh my gosh! I look like I should be in a hip hop video!\u201d Georgia\u2019s pants fell off and she blushed in horror as she swallowed the rest of her calzone. Petra let out a sigh on the other side. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cAt least mine makes for a decent bludgeon for taking out gangsters. But that doesn\u2019t make me any less annoyed. Janet is going to have a horrible fit when she sees a gargoyle with a bigger butt than hers.\u201d \u201cWell, doesn\u2019t that boyfriend of yours like big women?\u201d asked Georgia. Petra just grit her teeth as her eyes glowed red and then she remembered Georgia couldn\u2019t see it over the phone. \u201cJust be very careful, Georgia. We both had wrecking balls at the ends of our backs. Be careful. Move slowly, try not to break anything, try not to hurt anyone.\u201d Georgia gulped and blushed. \u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Talk to you later, Petra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia hung up and groaned and grunted as she squeezed her way through the doorway. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t likely to end well.\u201d Georgia spanked herself to make her now titanic booty jiggle. \u201cThings can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d That\u2019s what Georgia thought when she heard a knock at the door.\u201d Georgia gasped and ran to answer to door, damaging her window with her ass in the process, looked into the keyhole and sure enough at the door, to her horror, was Georgia\u2019s client who commissioned the sculpture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe client was...</span></div></div>",

This succubus was 1000 feet tall and morbidly obese, possibly more so then Lupa. She had to weight 900 pounds easy. Georgia was even wondering how she was moving. Her breasts were the size of bean-bag chairs, her belly had to be as wide as she was tall, and her butt was as big as Georgia's was right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Brimstone, what a surprise.\" Gerogia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, call me Hellen.\" The succubus replied in a Southern accent. \"So, where is my sculpture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here.\" Georgia replied as she turned to the sculpture. As she did, Hellen's eyes travelled to her ass. \"It's isn't finished yet, but I've captured the horror that you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's beautiful.\" Hellen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you.\" Georgia replied. \"I do take pride in my work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, not the sculpture. Though it is lovely.\" Hellen said. \"I meant your ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia blinked. \"I'm sorry, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, forgive my fowardness.\" Hellen said. \"It's just that I'm, for lack of a better term, obsessed with truly gargantuan female butts. Their size, their weight, their feel. You could say I have a fetish for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Georgia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, Georgia, may I call you Georgia? I'm an artist myself, though I paint rather then sculpt. That's why I commissioned that sculpture. I wanted a new subject for my next painting. But that's beside the point. Would you like to come to my studio and be a model? I can make that magnificent ass of yours famous. What do you say?\" Hellen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia blinked. Not only did someone actually liked this ass of her's, but that person was asking her to be a model. What's Georgia's decision?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The gargoyle woman grunted right before she flew down. In the process, her ass rubbed against a street lamp and caused it to bend. Petra just let out a groan. \u201cToo bad Rosalind is on suspension,\u201d said Petra lamenting the fate of her partner. \u201cThat chupacabra is lucky she wasn\u2019t fired. Jameson wanted to see me bright and early. I better see what it\u2019s all... ugh!\u201d As Petra walked through the front door and folded her wings down over her shoulders, her rear had gotten stuck in the doorway, prompting the gargoyle giantess to grit her teeth and flail her tail angrily. \u201cOh come on!\u201d she yelled. Petra was struggling for two minutes when somebody came to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood grief, Maza,\u201d said a voice on the other side of the doorway. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve been hanging around with those two sisters of yours too long.\u201d The voice on the other side of the door belonged to male hellhound with blackish brown fur and long red hair resembling flames. One side of his face was covered in large blue veins. From the look on Petra\u2019s face, she wasn\u2019t happy to hear him. \u201cHellspont,\u201d groaned Petra. \u201cListen here. If you\u2019re here just to make fun of me, then get lost.\u201d Hellspont let out a snort. \u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, Maza,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll get you out.\u201d Petra was slightly confused but then grunted in pain because her fellow officer kicked her ass (literally) and pushed her across the room with a crash. Petra got up and then glared at the giant hellhound. \u201cI hate you, Hellspont,\u201d said Petra. \u201cI really do.\u201d \u201cWell, it worked didn\u2019t it?\u201d Petra stomped away and her coworker was staring and drooled as he noticed Petra\u2019s ass getting thicker and thicker with every step as she made her way to the chief\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief of the Horroville police was called Jameson and he was a large and muscular black-furred minotaur. As soon as he saw Petra, he could not help but stare. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Petra in annoyance. Petra hadn\u2019t realized it but her ass was now as big as a love seat and her cheeks were so large that they were touching her lower back. \u201cUh,\u201d said Jameson trying really hard not to give Petra a reason to accuse him of harassment. \u201cUh, nothing Officer Maza. The reason I called you in was because as you know your normal partner is on suspension.\u201d Petra rolled her eyes. You have that right. Rosalyn isn\u2019t going to be fired is she?\u201d Jameson gave a snort. \u201cNo, but she\u2019s dangerously close. The reason I called you in was because I\u2019m assigning you a temporary partner. We have a new rookie I want you to train.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Petra. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I don\u2019t care how green they are.\u201d \u201cFunny you should say that.\u201d Said Jameson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The door opened behind Petra and in walked the new recruit. From the looks of it, she was a bright green-skinned werelizard with blonde hair worn in a mohawk and the blue frill of a frilled lizard around her neck. \u201cPetra Maza,\u201d said Jameson. \u201cMeet Shannon Savage. She was just transferred from Terrordale.\u201d \u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Petra. \u201cIf Terrordale is giving us a new officer, something must be up.\u201d Shannon just continued to stare at Petra. \u201cGee,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know gargoyles could interbreed with splintercats.\u201d Petra raised a brow. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Shannon then snuck up behind and squeezed Petra\u2019s couch-sized ass as she gave a groan. \u201cJust look at this rear,\u201d said the new recruit. \u201cHow can you be so bottom heavy when the rest of you is hourglass shaped.\u201d \u201cCut that out!\u201d yelled Jameson. Petra turned and gasped and felt her rear. \u201cOh no,\u201d she groaned. \u201cHow did...? Shelly! That elixir of hers must\u2019ve done this.\u201d Jameson let out a sigh. \u201cRoshi,\u201d he said. \u201cI figured as much. You finally caught her in the act. But the coward left before you could bust her. Well, this situation shouldn\u2019t be a problem, should it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPetra tried to pull her skirt down as she blushed in embarrassment. \u201cI can still go out. Tell me, what is our mission.\u201d Petra was now steaming mad. Her ass looked even bigger than Janet\u2019s at this point and it was all because of Shelly. Well, at least her human boyfriend Stephen would enjoy this. Jameson sweated and cleared his throat before giving Petra and her temporary partner their misssion.</span></div></div>",

Mavis flew off of Georgia's chair and was rubbing her butt in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assailant!\" she yelled. \"Somebody means me harm!\" Mavis even pulled a piece of glass out of her behind. \"Oops,\" said Georgia. \"I'm really sorry, Mavis.

Watch it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Barbara was having one of her usual bad days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara worked as a waitress at the Canyon Diner, a small but respectable diner near the freeway. Many people wondered how she got the job since she was a complete klutz. Not a day went by where she didn't spill a drink, break a plate, or cover someone in their meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people thought she was hired because she was pretty. And she was, standing at an even 6' with long legs, a shapely butt, and D-cup breasts. But that wasn't why she had the job. She was homeless, and the owner wanted to help, so she hired her. She did try her best, and she was good enough to avoid being fired. Which she felt was a godsend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure anywhere else would hire a Gorgon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonsters only existed in myths and legends, but Barbara was a real life gorgon. No one knows where she came from. Her entire body was covered in red and yellow scales, her teeth were fangs filled with venom (though she never bit anyone), her eyes were golden with slit pupils, and her hair were red vipers that reached her waist (but she kept them under control). Although she was unusual, she was a sweetheart, and everyone in town accepted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, when she wasn't having one of her bad days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the Canyon Diner was packed. It was after the work day, and everyone was starving. Since everyone was rushing, Barbara was even klutzier than usual. She had already dropped three sandwiches, broken two glasses, and spilled coffee on a man's lap (that was the man we heard earlier). Barbara went in the back to rest. That's when her boss, Ms. Blake, walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Barbara?\" Ms. Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today's worse than usual. I can't seem to do anything right. And my snakes are acting up again.\" Barbara replied. \"I'm worried they might bite someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, Barbara. Look, why don't you clock out. I'm sure Bob and Stephen have everything covered.\" Ms. Blake told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Barbara replied and got up to clock out. But before she could, the door swung open and smashed into her, sending her onto her butt. She suddenly felt a sharp, stinging pain in both her butt cheeks and yelped in pain. Getting up, she looked down and saw that two of the red vipers that made up her hair had bitten her. She looked up and saw that Stephen had walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap. I'm so sorry.\" He said. \"Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Barbara said. \"My hair just bit me is all. Don't worry, I'm immune to their venom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarbara walked out of the door after assuring that she was fine, and got into her car and drove home. She arrived at the apartment building an hour later and went into her apartment, 4C. Setting her keys on the counter, she went into her bedroom and changed out of her waitress uniform into a simple black tee shirt and jeans. She collapsed on her bed and went to sleep, hoping to forget the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she slept, she didn't know that something was happening to her butt. Since she was immune to her own venom, it had nowhere to go. So, through the rest of the day and night, the venom accumalated in her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Barbara woke up, hoping to start a new day. Before she got up, however, she noticed a weird feeling in her backside. She turned her head to check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1 - Her butt isn't any bigger, it just feels heavier, like something had filled up her butt cheeks. But it does start growing throughout the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2 - Her butt is slightly bigger that normal, and it feels heavy. But it doesn't get bigger during the day<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3 - Her butt is MUCH bigger than normal, and it feels heavy. And it continues to grow throughout the day.</span></div></div>",

Today, however, the routine felt a little off for her. <i>\u201cWhy do I feel so strange today, Barbara thought to herself, what is bothering me so much?\u201d</i>  Barbara looked around her, admittedly, small apartment, trying to discover the source of her discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Gently, she scratched one of her snakes, which in turn looked at her. Barbara shrugged and moved forward. Strangely, she felt heavier than the night before, probably because of some leftover she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaking her way to the bathroom, Barbara looked herself over in the mirror. The only Gorgon in the world and stuck in small, but well off town. She also held the title for the only gorgon to wear pink, polka dotted, pajamas. Barbara looked into the mirror and did a little twirl,psyching herself up for the coming morning. Still, the previous heavier feeling came over her and it now confused her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJeez, I must of eaten a lot of those leftovers\u201d Barbara said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tForgetting her statement for the time being, Barbara turned on the sink and took her toothbrush out of her drawer. Splattering on a generous amount of toothpaste onto the brush, Barbara commenced her daily cleaning. First her main mouth, then her eight smaller one. Taking each of the vipers and holding onto their necks; making them open their mouths to brush their tiny fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that, Barbara went to the rest of her routine. First, coffee in the pot, waiting for the rich liquid to form. Second, find her waitress outfit and her travel clothes. Third and finally, gather up her miscellaneous items. Things such as: her watch, her wallet, her time card, her hat, her purse, and all the other things. After the coffee dinged and she was dressed up(which felt a little more tight at the bottom), Barbara was set. Opening her door and looking up to the world, she went left and took her first step down the stairs. She was ready for any  today\u2019s challenges. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\nBarbara yelped as she stumbled down the stairs, when she reached the bottom her ass was above her head, and her purse was several feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh darn it\u201d she moaned aloud.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a strange mixture of sprinting combined with a hop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter every ten hops of her feet, Barbara would touch the ground, followed by her sprinting sixty or so feet until she began to rush forward with a bounding leap. Rinse and repeat. She didn't feel a bit winded from all of that running, it was natural for her.

Slowly, she tried to get out of bed, but discovered that her butt was also heavier now. It took her 20 minutes to get out of bed. She wobbled a bit, thrown of by her new weight. Eventually, she regained her balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thinking about how this could have happened. She hadn't eaten anything weird. She hadn't gotten any surgery. Then she figure it out: her hair. It had bitten her, but since she was immune to her own venom, it had nowhere to go. So it was stuck in her backside and accumilated. That must have caused the growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn this thought, she felt a tingling in her rear. Looking back, she was shocked to see that her butt was growing again. The venom was still accumilating. She could only watch as her butt, hips, and thighs continued to swell. Eventually, they stopped. Her butt was now twice it's previous size, with hips and thighs to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way Barbara could go to work like this. So she went into her kitchen to get her cell phone, her massive rear jiggling with every step. She could feel the venom in her butt moving around. She got to her phone and called Ms. Blake. She told her that she wasn't feeling well and that she wouldn't be in today. Ms. Blake told her to get better, and then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter placing her phone down, Barbara looked at her butt. What was she going to do about this. Suddenly, the tingling returned and her butt started swelling again. How was she going to deal with this? Eventually, her butt reached the size of...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skyla was very excited. Today was going to be her first day working at the Hole-y Moley donut shop. It wasn't very popular, but it was the first place that actually accepted her onto the team. She was actually surprised that the owner wanted to hire a Gorgon of all things. While gorgons were common knowledge, they usually worked in big business like modeling. Most people thought gorgons were too high class. But she wasn't, and that's why she now works at Hole-y Donuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took one last look at herself in the mirror to make sure she was ready. She knew she was a pretty Gorgon, standing at 6'1'' with red eyes and black and brown spotted pythons for hair. Her entire body was covered in the same scales her hair had. She had a decent figure, with modest breasts, decent hips, and long legs. But she felt that her best feature was her butt. Though it wasn't very big, it was nicely shaped, and she loved it. She was wearing the Hole-y Moley uniform, consisting of a simple orange shirt with her nametag (she couldn't believe she actually had a nametag) and red jeans with white sneakers. Decieding that she looked fine, she left her apartment and drove to the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, she was behind the shops counter, being briefed on what she would be doing by the owner, a short, portly middle-aged man named Mr. Coleman. She expected him to be strict and mean, but he was actually quite kind. Eventually, he wrapped up the briefing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and that's all you need to do.\" He said. \"Just take the orders, get the donuts, and ring up the customers. Don't worry about the drive-thru, Kenny has that covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, boss.\" Skyla said happily, almost giggling at calling this man \"boss\". \"I have everything under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.\" Mr Coleman said. \"One more thing. You can take any unsold donuts home, on two conditions. One, you make sure not to take too many so there are some for the customers the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Skyla replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other thing, try not to take any of the donuts at the far end of the shelf.\" He pointed to the area of the shelf to the far right. \"We've had issues with those ones involving other gorgons becoming addicted to them. Something about the ingredients having odd effects on reptile creatures. If you do end up eating one... I'm actually not sure what will happen. All we've seen happen is gorgons come in demanding more. But just be careful around them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. I'll be careful.\" Skyla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. We're ready to open.\" Mr. Coleman said as he changed the sign to OPEN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day was rather uneventful, mostly just a few customers getting the usual orders and occasionally someone getting a donut from the far right. But Skyla worked diligently, never missing an order or getting one wrong. By the end of the day, she was exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Skyla.\" Mr. Coleman said as he changed the sign to CLOSED. \"You were great. I think you have a future here. Since you did so good, you have the honor of locking up tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mr. Coleman.\" Skyla happily replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. Good night, and remember, any unsold donuts are yours. Just don't take too many, and try to avoid the ones on the far right if you can.\" Mr. Coleman said as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla walked behind the counter to decied which donuts to take. She eventually settled on a chocolate glazed and a plain glazed. As she was getting ready to leave, she looked at the donuts on the far right shelf. They didn't look any different from the regular donuts, so what made them so special? She decided that it couldn't hurt to take one. She picked a plain donut from the far right shelf, then left the shop, locking the door behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in her apartment, Skyla set the keys on the counter and went to her room to change. After doing so, she picked up the donuts she got from the shop. The glazed ones she set aside, but she was curious about the plain one. The one from the far right shelf. What was so special about it. She decied to find out and took a test bite. Her eyes widened, and she immedialty scarfed the whole thing down. It was heavenly! She thought is was the best thing she ever ate. No wonder other gorgons wanted it. She decieded that she had to have more. But that would have to wait until tomorrow. Right now, she was exhausted. She went to her bedroom, flopped on the bed, and went right to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she was ready for her second day at work but more importantly, more of those amazing donuts. She was about to get out of bed when she got an odd feeling in her backside. Confused, she got up and went to the mirror to see if anything was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: She doesn't look any different, so she brushes off the feeling. But during the day, she can't help but think about what she now calls \"The Amazing Donuts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Her butt appears to be a little bloated, but not enough to be noticeable. She goes through her day like normal, but feels drawn to the \"Amazing Donuts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 3: Her butt has become huge! She goes to work and asks Mr. Coleman for help, telling him what happened.</span></div></div>",

It looked like someone shoved two basketballs down the back of her pants. Her hips and thighs had grown as well, to match her new rear end. Skyla was surprised. She must have be dreaming. Shakily, she reached down and put a hand on one of her enlarged butt cheeks. Her hand sank into her butt cheek's flesh. It was real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was panicking. How could this have happened? Then she realized what happened. The donut! It must have done this. What was she going to tell Mr. Coleman? On that thought, she looked at the clock. She was going to be late! She quickly changed into her uniform, quickly finding out that her jeans still fit her now huge butt, though tightly, and went out the door. As she did, she could feel her butt bounce and jiggle with each step. It made her blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, she arrived at the donut shop. Mr. Coleman was already inside, setting up the tables. Nervously, Skyla stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Skyla. How are-\" Mr Coleman began to say, before he saw what happened to Skyla. \"Skyla! What happened to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearfully, Skyla told him everything, from taking to donut from the far right to finding herself this way. \"I'm so sorry, Mr. Coleman. Please don't fire me.\" Skyla cried, her snake hair crying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skyla, calm down. I'm not going to fire you.\" Mr. Coleman said, putting his hand on Skyla's shoulder. \"You made a mistake. That's all.\" He then looked at her butt again to make sure he wasn't seeing things. \"I've never seen this happen before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the weird thing is,\" Skyla said, still crying \"Is that even though this happened, I still want more of those donuts. It was just so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, Skyla. Here's what we're going to do. Let's open the shop, and get through this day normally. At the end of the day, I want you to take some donuts from the far right shelf. If this happens again, I'll call the company and tell them to stop sending those. Maybe I can even figure out why this happened.\" Mr. Coleman explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla sniffled. \"OK.\" She said. She then got up to change the sign to OPEN, feeling her butt jiggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by fairly normally. Aside from a few guys (and some girls) checking out her newly enlarged rear, nothing happened. At the end of the day, Mr. Coleman flipped the sign to CLOSED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Skyla. Remember what our plan is. Don't worry, I'm sure this won't happen again. Make sure to lockup.\" Mr. Coleman said as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla went over to the far right shelf and picked up a glazed donut this time. She then left the store and drove home.<br>\r\nBack home, she changed into a blue shirt and jeans, which she was surprised still fit, and went into the kitchen with the donut. She looked down at it. Should she really try it? Mr. Coleman was certain nothing would happen, but she wasn't. What if she got bigger? What if she couldn't get out of bed? Eventually, she was able to muster up the bravery and ate the donut. It was even better than the last one! She felt like she was in heaven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating the donut, she suddenly felt drowsy. She staggered to her bedroom and fell on the bed, falling asleep automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, she awoke cautiously. Did her butt grow again? She got out of bed, and was immediatly thrown of by the weight of her backside. She went over to the mirror to see if it had grown again. To her shock, it did. Her butt cheeks were now the size of...</span></div></div>",

She's got brownish red scales all over her body except for her front side, which sports a soft belly and F cup breasts. Her hair consists of many corn snakes that are long enough to reach her back. At the moment she's sitting on the ground in the middle of a human city with her back leaning against the tallest building which is barely her height. As she kicks back and relaxes she reaches down toward a small one story building nearby and tears the roof off. With a smile she grabs a handful of people and drops them into her mouth. This is pretty typical of one of her rampages, if you can call it a rampage. She pretty much just picks a spot and plops down, feeding off anyone in the area. If she finishes off everyone or they escape, she just saunters over to another spot and repeats the process. Thanks to her size and tough hide the human weapons have no effect on her. Bullets and tanks and even the occasional missile can't hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is a normal meal day for Sammy. As she munches on the humans she just caught one of the snakes on her head peers into the building she's leaning against. The people inside stare back terrified, most of them hiding. The giant snake breaks through the windows and snatches a few up in its mouth, gobbling them down. Sammy and her snakes continue snacking as the military tries to stop her. Some policemen desperately try shooting her feet but the bullets do nothing. She grabs a bunch of them with her scaly toes and holds them there as they struggle. With a grin she reaches down and grabs them. \"When will you people learn?\" she asks. \"I guess I'll give you points for trying though.\" With that she tosses them in her mouth and swallows them whole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sammy feels a tickle on her ass and looks over to see a couple of tanks shooting her. With a laugh she reaches over and grabs one of them effortlessly. She throws the whole thing in her mouth and chews it up, tearing through the metal and grounding up the people inside. She eats the other one and lays back, enjoying the moment. She feels an itch on her ass where the tanks shot her and lifts it up a bit to scratch it. As she does she notices it feels a bit plumper than usual but ignores it. At that moment a young man who had been trapped between her ass and the building sees his chance and rushes for safety. Unfortunately he isn't quite fast enough and her monumental ass comes back down quickly. What happens to him?</span></div></div>",

He can barely move and its kind of hot but at least he's alive. Without any other options he decides to wait until something happens and see if he can escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the little guy bears the confinement of her ass Sammy is just about finishing up. She's eaten all the humans around. Well, the ones who didn't get away. Its not like she's feels like chasing them down though. Instead she begins tearing buildings to pieces and munching on them. After a little of this she gets up and decides to head home. As she leaves her ass bumps into a building, knocking off a chunk of it. Sammy looks back and gives her ass a squeeze, then shrugs and keeps walking. Meanwhile the little guy is still stuck in her butt cheeks. He can feel the gorgon moving, and his prison is moving as well. While he is trapped between the globes they jiggle slightly, causing him to bob up and down. With a groan he decides he has to wait and see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short walk Sammy arrives at her home. Its a huge cave thats more than big enough to house the giant gorgon. On the inside it actually looks like a well furbished house. The gorgon yawns and heads to her bed for a nap. She lies down on her side and dozes off. The man in her butt feels the giantess stop moving and waits for a while. When he hears the sound of her sleeping he tries to get free of his prison. With all his might he climbs and crawls his way out from between her cheeks, noting just how big they are. Does she feel him?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In his moment of victory he absentmindedly leans against the nearest wall. The problem is that the wall is actually her ass. Before he can react the claw is coming for him . It looks ready to scratch but when it feels him it stops. Sammy grabs him and lifts him up. Roger watches the mattress get farther away as he is carried to the front of the gorgon. He gets a view of her huge body as she brings him to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he's brought before her face Roger is in awe. Sure he's seen her gigantic form as it destroyed the city, but being this close to her face is new. She's actually pretty good looking, despite the snakes sticking out of her head. \"Hmm, guess I picked up a hitchhiker.\" she says. Then she opens her mouth and Roger finds himself being brought closer. \"Wait!\" he cries desperately. Sammy stops and looks at him with a bored expression. \"Why should I?\" she asks. \"You're just a snack.\" A snake advances and gives him a lick as if to agree. Roger can tell from her attitude that she's sleepy. \"Well, uh....you shouldn't eat right before going to sleep!\" he says, trying to keep himself alive. \"You'll gain weight, and it'll go right to your butt!\" Sammy reacts to the word butt and narrows her eyes.

You can practically see the gears turning in her head as she begins to smirk. \"I know...\" she says and walks over to Sammy. \"Well, since it HAS been getting bigger there should be plenty of room.\" she says. You don't know what she means as she lowers you to the bed. Then you see Sammy's ass get closer and realize where you're headed. You start to squirm in Betty's claws and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst you see Sammy's huge yellow cheeks, then you are pushed inside. Betty gives them a squeeze before walking away. \"Hope you're comfy.\" she says with a laugh. You're left between the butt cheeks of the massive gorgon as she sleeps. Despite the softness of your prison it is pretty cramped. You stay like this for a while until you feel the world shift. Sammy is moving! You hope she's getting up but instead she just rolls onto her back, sealing you further. With a groan you curse your situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you get bored and start to drift off along with Sammy. The two of you sleep for  a couple of hours and then you wake up. You try to stretch your arms, but can't move well, reminding you of where you are. You find yourself wondering just when this gorgon will wake up. Suddenly you feel yourself being lifted up. She must be getting up! You thank god and hope she'll realize where you are. On another note, your prison feels like its gotten a bit bigger. Her friend did say her ass was getting bigger.

After a second of scratching she stops and grabs her butt cheek. She feels it for a minute and then uses both hands. Her first thought is that there's no way her butt is this big, but then she turns and looks. The gorgon is shocked to see that her ass is almost double the size it once was. \"What the hell?!\" she exclaims. Her snakes look down and all hiss at once at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the yell, Betty runs in to see what happened. \"Whats wrong?\" she asks. Sammy turns her back to her roommate and presents her ass. \"Look at this!\" she says. Betty takes one look at the enlarged posterior and bursts out laughing. \"Its not funny!\" Sammy shouts. \"Sorry\" Betty tells her, still laughing. \"Its just, I told you your ass was getting bigger!\" Sammy begins pacing around, talking out loud. \"How did this happen? It wasn't this big when I fell asleep!\" Betty sits down and looks at her. \"Its probably from eating so much. That many humans and buildings can do that. Not to mention tanks and cars. Thats pure rock and metal you're eating.\" she says. Sammy just glares at her and continues pacing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do?\" she asks. As she walks her ass bumps into a lamp and knocks it over. Thankfully it doesn't break. When Sammy bends down to pick it up she ends up knocking over the end table the lamp was on. \"Damn it!\" she says. Betty meanwhile is watching in amusement. \"Look, if you want that ass to go back to normal you should try working off the weight.\" she suggests. Sammy just looks at her and groans. \"See, thats what got you into this in the first place.\" the basilisk says. \"You need to be more active, so I'm taking on one of my rampages.\" Sammy just rolls her eyes.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many gorgons in ancient Greece and none were more infamous than Medusa. Except for maybe one gorgon in particular. Her name was Kara and she was a pale albino white skinned gorgon with rattlesnakes for hair, sharp fingernails and toenails and a long rattlesnake's tail. She was an <b><i>evil bitch</i></b> of a gorgon if there ever was one. She was a horrible monster who would petrify anyone unfortunate enough to come across her, especially when unprovoked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment she had petrified a few children playing by the stream as she let out an evil laugh, going so far as to push one of her stoned victims into the ground with her foot. \"It feels so good to be so bad.\" Hissed the rattlesnake woman as she made her petrifying eyes glow. She then let out another vicious laugh before she petrified a nearby stag and even broke off one of its legs to scratch her back. She was pure evil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, Kara was so evil that a few other gorgons watching could only look in disgust. A long necked and purple skinned python type gorgon clenched her fists just watching the scene. \"That Kara just makes my blood boil.\" She said. A green skinned and four-eyed cobra based gorgon with a flap around her head let out a hiss of agreement. \"That bitch. Kara knows that children are off limits to gorgons.\" \"Don't you dare say that horrible woman's name!\" shouted an elderly gorgon woman with bushmasters for hair as she banged her cane into the ground. \"That evil fiend is why humans hate gorgons. She's worse than Medusa, Stheno and Euryale ever were. One of these days the gods are going to get sick of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara had then tore a branch off of a tree sacred to Demeter and used it to pick her teeth when she saw was looked like a group of humans gathering for worship at a temple with a statue of Athena in front of it. \"Oh goodie,\" said Kara with a hiss as she shook her rattle tail. \"More humans to petrify.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara slithered forward and made sure that she was completely hidden. One archer at the temple turned his head and went to investigate. He saw Kara's tail and instinctively reached for his bow. \"What matter of creature is this?\" It wouldn't be a surprise that ancient Greeks wouldn't have heard of rattlesnakes let alone recognize a rattlesnake gorgon. As the archer walked closer to bushes, Kara sprung out and let out an evil hiss. Before the archer could even scream, she smashed her butt into him to knock the petrified archer to the ground. She looked down and gave a smirk because she saw the symbol for Artemis on his belt. She then scratched the crest off with her claws before laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKara hissed and walked into the temple and immediately everyone panicked. \"Gorgon!\" Several worshippers in the back row were instantly petrified as the rest tried to run, only for Kara to trip them with her tail and force them to look up into her eyes, turning them to stone.\" Kara then turned her attention to the priests. \"Merciful Athena,\" said the head priest. \"Goddess of wisdom. We besiege you; strike down this gorgon, this vile creature from Tartarus itself.\" The other priests fell to stone on the ground as Kara made her way to the head priest. The priest tried to turn his head but Kara spat poison into his face that burned him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe priest screamed and held his head and in his haste he looked at Kara and instantly he was turned into a stone statue. Kara let out a laugh, proud of what she had done. However, her actions had pissed off the gods one too many times and they were watching from Mt. Olympus. \"Even for a gorgon,\" said Athena, the goddess of wisdom. \"Kara is one of the most vile creatures I've ever seen and she has just ransacked my temple.\" \"Not to mention killed one of my favorite hunters,\" said Artemis, the goddess of the moon. \"She has the manners of an Erymanthian boar.\" Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty walked forward with a smirk. \"Not to mention her vanity, which gives me a good idea. I've just thought of how we can punish that gorgon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAphrodite whispered into Artemis and Athena's ears and all three goddesses smiled before casting the spell. Where was Kara when this was going on?</span></div></div>",

The sadistic Gorgon knew full well it was pointless: turning her victims to stone already killed them, but smashed stone monuments had a great finality to them that she delighted in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if any surviving humans believed those she petrified were somehow still alive and able to feel pain when smashed, then so much the better. More agony and wails for Kara to enjoy, even is she wasn't around. But all the smashing and crushing had covered her in dust--and Kara did NOT like to look dirty. So she had slinked off to a small waterfall in her cave to wash up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hissed delight as the cool water flowed down her scaly hide, washing the dust of deceased worshippers away. \"Mmm...maybe next time I'll go after one of Ares' temples? See those blustering Spartans prattle on about being true warriors when their patron god can't stop one gorgeous Gorgon.\" Her musing cut off for an evil laugh. \"Or maybe go after some soft-hearted Gorgons?

If it weren't for the population being monsters of mythology that were hundreds of feet tall, then it would be like any town in Texas U.S.A. It was a quiet town, but not without the occasional quarrel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast month a new couple arrived in town. A monster/human couple. The wife of the couple was Skyler Clarke. Skyler was a pudgy and overweight gorgon with rhinoceros vipers for hair. Her body was pale grayish green with red, black and blue highlights and a long tail as well as a pair of legs that ended in sharp talons. She also had a large V-shaped horned yellow nose like an actual rhinoceros viper. Because of her fatal gaze, she had to wear a pair of bright green triangle shaped sunglasses. Skyler lived with her human husband, Archie, an Asian looking human with dyed red hair and thin glasses. At this moment Archie was riding on Skyler's shoulder as she stomped into her house furious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That damn cat! She has a lot of nerve! Giving me a damn parking ticket!\" \"Calm down, Skyler!\" Skyler's hair gave an angry hiss before Skyler grabbed her husband and made him scream. \"Don't tell me to calm down, Archie. That Reaver is a plague.\" Of course, Skyler was referring to Dreadberry's sheriff, Maggie Reaver. Maggie was a 1000ft tall Nemean lioness, an indestructible lion with white fur and golden blonde hair. Maggie was also very obese with a large butt, huge stomach and enormous breasts. She had a human husband herself by the name of Neil. But unlike Skyler and Archie, Maggie and Neil had a daughter; a teenaged mer-lioness named Sapphire who was a hybrid of a monster and a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaggie and Skyler had quickly made enemies as soon as they met. Skyler had an extreme dislike of feline monsters and was outright rude towards Maggie prompting the two of them to exchange some rather cross words. It didn't help that Skyler made fun of the fact that Maggie's husband was a manicurist. Since they met, Skyler would quarrel with Maggie over the dumbest things. The other day they had gotten into a fight over the last can of spaghetti sauce at the local supermarket and before that, Skyler accused Sapphire of stealing from the apple tree in her yard, which didn't sit well with Maggie. This parking ticket was the final straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate that lousy lioness!\" yelled Skyler. \"She thinks she's so smug just because she has a badge. The election's next week and she's fighting without an opponent. Perhaps somebody should change that.\" \"Come on, Skyler,\" said Archie. \"I don't think she means to be vicious.\" Skyler looked out to see Maggie across the street cooking at a grill. \"Think again,\" Skyler said. \"Those propane fumes are gonna make me sick. I can just feel it. I'd like to take that cat down a peg.\" That's when Skyla noticed that somebody else was walking away from Maggie's property and with a black eye from the looks of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new monster was a 660ft tall and huge-gutted werefox with red-orange fur, dark colored hair and a beauty mark on her lower chin. She was wearing skin tight jeans and a yellow jacket without a bra or a shirt. That was Meagan Reynard. She also hated Maggie. She was Neil's ex-girlfriend and despised Neil so much to the point where she wanted to swallow him whole. Of course, every time she's directly attacked him, Maggie retaliated rather violently. One time, Maggie nearly strangled Meagan when she caught the vulpine giantess trying to kidnap her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Skyler got an idea and her snake hair hissed. Archie let out a gulp. \"You're not thinking of teaming up with Meagan are you?\" asked Archie. \"Meagan eats humans.\" \"Only because Maggie's loser husband dumped her and hooked up with a lower quality fleabag. I think Meagan and I could mutually benefit from each other. Skyler gave an evil laugh as her snake hair hissed. Soon the gorgon decided to pay a visit to Meagan who at that time was wearing a steak over her black eye while her per chimeric dog was sleeping in the corner. Meagan heard Skyler knocking and opened the door to look in surprise to see Skyler with a devil's food cake. Meagan seemed confused. \"Skyler?\" asked Meagan. \"What are you doing here? Where's Archie? I could use a snack.\" Skyler gave a hiss. \"My husband isn't here and he isn't on the menu. Listen Meagan, I hate Maggie and you do to. I want to cream that cat in the election for sheriff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeagan let out a scoff and took the cake from Skyler. \"Good luck. Nobody ever runs against that fat cat.\" Skyler then let out a hiss. \"Come on. You'll never be able to make a meal out of your ex as long as his wife is the sheriff.\" Meagan nodded her head and sighed as she cut a piece of the cake for herself and greedily ate it. \"That's for sure. Direct attack has never worked, so perhaps you're on to something. But that won't be enough revenge. I was saving this for an emergency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeagan then reached into her cupboard and took out what looked like a combination of darts and syringes. \"What the hell are those?\" asked Skyler. \"These are special darts I ordered,\" said Meagan. \"The poison in these darts causes expansion of the posterior. Maggie's mother is a splintercat, the species of monster with the biggest ass in comparison to their body. But this dart will make that pussycat's can even bigger than that of a splintercat.\" \"You vulpine idiot!\" yelled Skyler. \"No weapon can pierce the skin of a Nemean lion.\" Meagan let out a growl. \"The kappa I bought these from told me these darts were so sharp they actually could.\" Meagan handed a dart to Skyler who took it and gave an evil smirk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyler saw Maggie across the street cleaning the grill and she had bent over with her rear in plain view. Skyler let out a laugh. \"Alright fat ass cat ass. You asked for it. Ouch!\" Skyler had unknowingly backed up into Meagan's other dart but she didn't realize it at the time as she and Meagan walked out to commence with their evil plan. \"Steady,\" said Meagan. \"Steady.\" Skyler took aim at Maggie's rear as Maggie was busy with the grill. Of course, she felt a pulsing in her own can and vibrations, but decided to ignore them, not realizing her own butt was slowly getting bigger. Skyler took aim at Maggie hoping the dart would be able to pierce the indestructible skin of a Nemean lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Skyler threw the dart, did it work?</span></div></div>",

It would be the Monster version of Sydney, Australia just as Chillingham is the monster version of London. Morose Bluff is mainly a beach based village where skyscraper-sized monsters enjoy going surfing. That is until something that happened six weeks ago. At that time a female biker gang called the Black Arrows came to the beach and quickly made enemies with the surfers. The leader of the Black Arrows was called Cookie and she was a 1000ft tall gorgon giantess with taipans for hair that were worn in the shape of a large pompadour. She was accompanied by Pyro, her human boyfriend who she carried in the neck collar of her jacket. Cookie and her gang tore up the sand with their bikes, littered the beach with cigarettes and racked up a considerable debt at the beach grill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of the surfers was Dominique Frakes. She was a 1000ft tall tan-skinned blonde gargoyle who despised Cookie and the damage her bikers were doing to the beach. At this moment, Dominique had a bone to pick with Cookie and was carrying her surfboard as three more monster giantesses as she was walking to confront the gorgon. Accompanying her were three fellow surfers. The first was a ginger haired and green-skinned kappa girl resembling a snake-necked turtle with blue flowers painted on the back of her shell. The second was a fat brown-orange furred tiger girl who resembled Tigra except for the heart shaped tattoos on her large butt cheeks. She was wearing a dark blue bikini and a necklace made out of shells and dinosaur skulls. Finally, there was a blue Chinese dragon girl with long brownish hair large antlers and a golden yellow underbelly. She also had bright yellow eyes and wore a red two-piece bikini with a star on each nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, Cookie and her bikers were drinking beer and tossing the bottles into the water. They were making a contest on who could toss the farthest bottle. Cookie also had three monsters accompanying her. First of them was a pitch white pear-shaped vampiress dressed in an outfit similar to the Huntress with purple highlights in her hair and large triangular sunglasses. She also had batwings attached to her arms. Next was an orange furred minotaur giantesses with a bright red cowgirl\u2019s hat, an udder bigger than her head and long white hair. The minotaur girl had multiple piercings down to her neck. Last of Cookie\u2019s friends was a red skinned baku girl with a white head and blood red hair. She was wearing an outfit that looked similar to a Nazi\u2019s outfit, complete with a cap. Cookie herself was smoking a large cigarette as Pyro was massaging her neck when Cookie spotted Dominique and her friends walking forward. \u201cSo that\u2019s what smells like dead whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCookie!\u201d yelled Dominique at the top of her lungs. \u201cI got a bone to pick with you!\u201d As Dominique screamed at Cookie, Cookie took the opportunity to use the gargoyle\u2019s tongue as an ashtray and burn her. \u201cThat\u2019s because you couldn\u2019t feel your own bones under your own thunder thighs. What do you want Gargosmell?\u201d Pyro lets out a laugh at his girlfriend\u2019s words as she strokes his head. \u201cGood one, Cookie. Why don\u2019t you tell Greg Weisman\u2019s daughter over there to go **** her face. That\u2019s the only action it will get.\u201d \u201cNow, come on, Pyro,\u201d said Cookie. \u201cNobody is desperate enough to touch her.\u201d Dominique gave a glare as her eyes turned red. \u201cCome on out, Pyro,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will be good with jalape\u00f1o dipping.\" Cookie just blew smoke into Dominique's mouth and made her cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique's friends were ready to attack but Dominique stopped them. \"You lousy bikers did this to our surfboards.\" Dominique held up her surfboard to reveal it had been covered in graffiti with an unflattering drawing of her on it. \"How do you know it was me?\" asked Cookie. Dominique turned the board around to reveal that on it Cookie had wrote \"CUEKY RHULZ\". \"You can't even spell your name right.\" \"At least it isn't a made up name like Dominique. Nobody is born with such a stupid name.\" Dominique was getting more and more mad and then she noticed Cookie pouring beer into the ocean. 'What are you doing?! You are going to kill the fish!\" \"Big whoop,\" said Pyro. \"There's literally plenty of fish in the sea.\" \"Besides,\" said Cookie. \"Booze doesn't taste as good after listening to your nagging, Ms. Hitler.\" Dominique bit her lip. \"Now get off our beach, surfer scum.\" Said Cookie. \"We were here first until you rode in on those glorified tricycles!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCookie's hair hissed and stood up as Cookie stood up herself and smashed a beer bottle in Dominique's face. Dominique yelled before Cookie stuffed her cigarette into Dominique's groin area. Dominique groaned in pain. \"So that's it,\" said Cookie. \"I knew it. That's why it hurt.\" \"It would've hurt either way, jerk.\" Cookie the stepped on Dominique's foot and tore her bikini top, forcing Dominique to hide her nudity as the bikers laughed at her. Dominique turned red in the face and growled but before she could do something, Cookie punched her in the face. The gargoyle left angrily with a brand new shiner. \"This isn't over!\" she yelled. With that, she and her fellow surfers stomped away. Cookie just gave Dominique the finger in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch later, the surfers returned to their beach grill and Dominique was planning revenge on Cookie. \u201cIt\u2019s all over for that gorgon,\u201d grumbled Dominique as she held an ice pack to her eye. \u201cI\u2019m going to hit her where it hurts the most.\u201d Dominique\u2019s kappa friend was slightly confused. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna finally eat her human boyfriend?\u201d \u201cNo fair, Dom,\u201d said the weretiger. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to eat any humans at the last barbecue. You guys know how much I love roasted humans.\u201d \u201cAs much as I\u2019d like to reduce that biker babe\u2019s boyfriend to a few inches on my thighs,\u201d said Dominique as she took out some form of spell book. \u201cI have something better in mind.\u201d Dominique\u2019s friends watched as their gargoyle leader took out several vials of strange potions and begun to mix them together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat gorgon is always butting into things,\u201d said the gargoyle with an evil smile. \u201cSo I\u2019ll just make her butt too big for her bicycle seat. This is a very special poison that will cause Cookie\u2019s fat ass to constantly expand and the cure takes ten years to make. She won\u2019t know what hit her. Dominique then poured the potion into a beer bottle and walked away. The Black Arrows were laughing to themselves and this gave Dominique a chance to fly overhead. \"Nobody can dish out humiliation like you can, doll,\" said Pyro as he rubbed Cookie's cheek. \"Stupid gargoyle.\" \"Yep,\" said Cookie. \"They may be immune to my gorgon gaze, but I always get the best of them in the end.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what Cookie thought, but Dominique smirked and dropped the tainted beer bottle right into the bikers' cooler just as Cookie reached for a beer. She grabbed the bottle with the potion in it and chugged it down greedily. Dominique laughed and flew away because she knew that potion would take effect later and her gorgon nemesis would be in for a big surprise.</span></div></div>",

Two of them were simple guards. The third was the reason the majority of the inmates were in the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Clarissa DelCano. She was a Banded Cat-Eyed Snake Gorgon. She was about 6'1'' and had black scales with white stripes, green eyes behind perscription cat eyed glasses, and snake hair tied up in a ponytail. She had average breasts and a decent butt in a sleek business suit. She spoke with a Cajun accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason everyone hated her was because she was the county's best prosecutor. She was known for always getting the guilty verdict. But she was also a heartless liar. All she cared about was the guilty verdict and her reputation, so there were times when even an innocent man would end up in jail. She lied to everyone, even her family. But she was still one of the best, so she kept getting cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday she was visiting Rory Eck, a man she put in prison for robbing a jewlery store. He had demanded to speak with her, and she obliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa and the guards reached the visiting room. Rory was sitting at the desk. He was a slim human with brown hair and green eyes. And those eyes were filled with hate as Clarissa sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. Eck, I never thought we'd meet again.\" Clarissa said. \"How have you been?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have I been?\" Rory replied. \"I've been miserable. I didn't break into that store. I was set up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Eck, you were found at the scene, and the jewels were located in your apartment. It was practically an open and shut case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were planted there. You knew that. But you didn't care. You don't care about anyone All you care about is that guilty verdict. Your a liar and a snake!\"<br>\r\n\"Let's not bring my species into this, Mr. Eck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRory looked down at the table. \"I curse you.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm putting a curse on you. When you lie, or when an innocent man or woman goes to jail because of you, your butt will get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa stared for a moment, before laughing loudly. \"Seriously? Your cursing me? That's rich.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be laughing for long.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A curse. Hilarious. Guards, I'd like to leave.\" She called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she left, Rory looked up. \"You'll pay, you lying bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa was still laughing when the guard closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it things went well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa finally calmed down. \"Yeah.

Loaned it to a friend.\" Clarissa lied. As she did, though, the curse she thought was fake took effect. Her butt grew, but not enough to be obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap. Well, is it any good? Rick loves those kinds of movies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it is. I'm sure he'd love it.\" Clarissa lied again. Styled to Kill was, in her opinion, one of the worst movies ever. Once again, the lie made her butt grow, now making her skirt feel a little tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Well, if you get it back, let me know. Oh, before I forget, did you get Mom a present for her birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa's eyes went wide. She had completely forgotten her mom's birthday, which was in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's awesome. I'm sure Mom will love it.\" She lied once again, causing another growth spurt in her butt. This time, it grew more then the other times, making it look like two volleyballs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Well, I'll talk to you later.\" Jen said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, bye.\" Clarissa replied before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" She said to herself. \"I forgot Mom's birthday. What am I going to do? And why the hell is my skirt so tight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa reached down to readjust her skirt, only to meet her butt sooner then she thought. Confused, she looked down and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy hell! My butt's huge! What happened? Wait, is this that curse Rory said? So he was telling the truth.\" Clarissa said to herself, feeling her butt to make sure it was real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClarissa was silent for a moment, before exclaiming...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She must be doing her usual rounds, Clarissa thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing. Just acting out a movie I saw. Sorry.\" Clarissa lied.

She had managed to alienate everyone around her, she had been called \"The Weird Woman in 227\" by everyone in her apartment, and she managed to drive away every potential suitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't because she looked odd. In fact, she was considered a very beautiful woman. She was a Chinese Vine Snake Gorgon. She just an inch shy of 6 feet, had bright green scales, orange eyes, and Vine Snakes for hair. She had a decent bust and waist, but her most notable feature was her butt. It was massive. If one didn't know any better, they say she had stuffed medicine balls down the back of her pants. Her hips and thighs were also huge, to match her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd her rear was the main problem with her. Maya was completely and totally obsessed with it. There wasn't a moment in the day she wasn't carressing it. Whenever she talked to someone, she always brought up her massive rear. Every movement or thing she did, she had to do in a way that showed off her butt, even down to walking with an exaggerated swing in her hips. All her clothes and dresses were tight in the rear, making sure to hug her lower curves. She even gave her butt a name: Sasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you can tell, it weirded everyone out. Like today, as she was entering her apartment, fuming mad. She wore a silver dress shirt and leather pants that looked painted on. She had just had another failed date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The nerve of that girl, saying she didn't want to go out again.\" She said in a slight Chinese accent. \"Just because I knocked her over. She should be thankful.\" She then put a hand on her rear. \"Well, it's her loss, Sasha. She doesn't know what she's missing. You know what, why don't we take a nice hot bath, and then I'll put on your favorite thong, and we'll watch a cable movie. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then jumped up and down a little, making her butt bounce in a way that made it look like it was nodding. \"I knew you'd like that.\" Maya said.<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\nAbout two hours later, Maya was lying stomach down on the couch in her living room. After her bath, she had changed into a blue tank top and a dark purple thong, which she claimed was her butt's favorite. She was watching a black and white horror movie while constantly rubbing her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it got to commercial, she got up to get more popcorn. She was half-way to the kitchen when she heard something interesting from the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you tired of having tiny breasts or a bony butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran back to the living room right then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, our growth formula's can help with that. These's beauties can blow up those small boobs or butt in a matter of minutes. Just call the number on your screen now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that oddly brief commercial, Maya grinned madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear that Sasha?\" Maya said to her rear. \"A formula that makes butts grow. You can be even bigger and better then before. Just think of it. We need to order that formula right now!\" With that, she grabbed the nearby phone and dialed the number. When she got an answer, she ordered the butt growth formula without a second thought. The person on the other line asked how many bottles she wanted.

It was dark, moody, and filled with the typical Goths you'd find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Selene hated every moment of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, she was a Goth, but Selene Raven (yes, that is her real name) was the complete opposite of a typical Goth. She was bright, cheerful, and friendly. While most Goths were content with there circle of like-minded friends or being alone, Selene was one of the most social people ever, being friendly with everyone in Nightshade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't hurt that she was fairly attractive. Selene was a gorgon, specifically, a Texas Night Snake gorgon. She stood at 6'1'' tall, was covered in slate grey scales, had black eyes, a forked tougne, fangs, and Texas Night Snakes for hair. She was slim, with decent breasts and an average butt. Like most people in Nightshade, she spoke with a Texan accent. She had a variety of Gothic clothes, but tonight went with a black jacket, a black corset, tight black lether pants, and black high-heeled boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had just left the Shadow Den, having been irritated with the boring people in there. she wanted to talk to more lively people, people who actually knew how to have fun. And she knew just the place and person to talk to for that. And so, she went off to Kelly's Antique Books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small store just down the street from the Shadow Den. It specialized in old, out-of-print books that people wanted to find again. Selene went their just about every day, to the point where she was on first name bases with the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked in, she looked over to the counter and saw the owner, a purple, obese gargoyle named Kelly Matthews.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Kelly.\" Selene called to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked up and smiled at Selene. \"Hey there!\" She replied. \"I thought you were hanging out at the Shadow Den tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was, but everyone is so boring there. I needed to talk to someone who actually could have fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you came to the right place. In fact, it's good timing you showed up. I have something I want you to see.\" With that, Kelly ducked under the counter and pulled out a book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene looked at the book. It was black and completely bare except for the title: \"The Book of Reality\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Selene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure. I just got it today. When I saw it, I immediatly thought of you. I know you like dark and mysterious stuff.\" Kelly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much is it?\" Selene asked, still looking at the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, I'll put it at nothing more then a dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene beemed and took a dollar out of her pocket. \"Cool. I'll take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene handed the dollar to Kelly and took the book out of her hands. Selene then said good-bye and left for home.<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nEntering her apartment, Selene took her boots off and sat down on the couch. She set the Book of Reality on the coffee table. She noticed that under the title was a place to put her name. She wondered briefly how she missed it, but shrugged it off andm grabbing a pen, signed her name. Then she opened it to the first page. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'This is the Book of Reality. It has the ability to alter reality in anyway you see fit. Just write what you want in the pages of the book, and the change will take hold. However, there are rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You cannot kill anyone or raise the dead.<br>\r\n2. You cannot use it to change yourself.<br>\r\n3. You cannot make a person younger or older.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of that, you can do whatever you want. But there is a catch. Everytime you use the book, a price must be paid. It is a price of you choosing. Just write the price, and you may start the book.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder all that was a line of text. It read: \"Every time I use the book, ___________________.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene couldn't believe it. This book had that power? She could do whatever she wanted? It sounded like fun. She couldn't wait to start, but in order to do so, she needed to think of a price. She thought for a moment, looking around her living room. She happened to glance at her butt, and got an idea. She then wrote in the blank line. When she was done, it now read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Every time I use the book, my butt will get bigger and heavier.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, she turned to the next page. It was blank save for one line:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'If you want to undo a change, simply say 'Undo'. The price for the change, however, will not go away.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene smiled. It was time for fun. But what to do first? She thought for a moment, then decided that she would...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She put her pen to the paper and wrote:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Make me a super-hot, super busty succubus goth girlfriend who was completely loyal to me.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure her wish was specific, she finished writing and set the pen down. As soon as she did, she heard a knock on her door. Getting up, she walked over and opened it. What she saw gave her a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door was the hottest succubus she'd ever seen. The succubus was an inch taller then her, had bright red skin, black hair, and red eyes. She had an athletic figure, but Selene's eyes were on the succubus's boobs. They were huge, easily the size of beach balls. She also had horns and a spade tail. She was wearing a black bikini with skull patterns on them, black thigh-high, high heeled boots and had black lipstick on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Selene.\" The succubus said in a sexy French accent. \"I'm Crimson. Crimson Darkshade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene was speechless. She had just gotten her wish. Then she remembered the cost at looked at her butt. Sure enough, it had grown. It looked like two basketballs now. Her hips and thighs had grown too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice bubble butt.\" Crimson said. \"You certainly picked a good price for the book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene looked back at Crimson. \"You know about the book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It did make me, after all. So of course I know. Oh, something the book forgot to mention. The first thing you write in the book is irreversable. So I'm here to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene was beaming at this. Not only did she have a hot, loyal girlfriend now, but she had a book that could do whatever. This night was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson walked into Selene's apartmen (with a bit of difficulty) and sat on the couch, picking up the book. \"So, gorgeous. What else do you want to change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene had to think. She has love now, so what next? Do something selfless and help the world? Or something selfish for her and Crimson?</span></div></div>",

Like, I can't undo them?\" Selene asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you can. After you write what you want, just underline it. That makes it permanent.

Looking, she saw her butt inflated again, tearing her jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrimson thought for a moment, then nodded. Just then, a knock was heard. Selene went to the doors peephole and looked. Sighing, she opened the door.<br>\r\nOn the other side was her landlord Tara. Tara was a slender werewolf with a humanoid face, green eyes, grey fur and black hair. She was known for being snippy and demanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Selene, it's the end of the month. Pay your rent!\" Tara yelled. Selene sighed and went into the kitchen to grab the money. As she did this, Tara saw Crimson. Selene came back and handed her the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Tara said. \"Who's the balloon bimbo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Selene yelled. \"She's not a balloon. She's a great person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure. She looks like a crappy drawing on one of those art sites. All she needs is a huge butt and lips, and she'll fit right in at a strip joint.\" Tara said. Then she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSelene slammed the door and grabbed the book. Waiting about a minute, she started writing. Crimson looked over to see what she was writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Make Tara's breasts, butt, and lips huge. And make Tara's lips pitch black. And make it so Tara's lips are always puckered.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's... quite a bit.\" Crimson said, a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'll pay for calling you a bimbo.\" Selene said.<br>\r\n------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in Tara's apartment, she was sitting on her couch counting Selenes' rent money when she got an odd feeling. All of a sudden, she saw her breasts inflate quickly, bursting out of her top and bra. Then she felt her butt expand as well and destroy her pants. Finally, she felt her lips start to swell as well. But just as fast as they started, they stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreaked out, Tara got up and ran to her bathroom to look in her mirror. Her breasts had blown up to triple Z cups, completely topless. Her buttcheeks were now the size of beach balls, with wide hip and thick thighs to match. And her lips were huge and full, her lower lip almost reaching her chin and her upper lip touching the bottom of her nose. Her lips had also turned pitch black and were puckered up, like she was ready to kiss, and she couldn't unpucker them.<br>\r\n\"Wha thu heww happened?!\" Tara yelled, her words garbled due to her swollen lips.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\nBack with Selene and Crimson, Selene was laughing as Crimson looked a little worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that a little much to punish Tara?\" Crimson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She called you a Bimbo!\" Selene said. \"She needed to pay!\" Just then, she heard a massive rip. Looking, she saw her inflating butt had now burst her pants, leaving her in a black thong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if you insist.\" Crimson said. \"So, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Selene decide to do?</span></div></div>",

At the local bank, there is a loud explosion and a rather large female monster is walking out. From the looks of it, she had pinkish patchwork skin and only one eye in the center of her forehead and a metallic mouth. The Frankenstein girl had the number 091 plastered to her neck and what looked like dart guns jutting out of her shoulders. The Frankenstein girl was walking away carrying a safe stolen from the bank. She would've walked away but that was when she heard the sound of a motorcycle and turned around to see a large blue motorcycle with a serpent-shaped hood driving towards her. The driver was a 1000ft gorgon with mangrove snakes for hair. She was wearing a white chain mail tank top and a white domino-mask with horns and purple shades as well as a bright blue cape and thigh-high boots. Finally, she was wearing skin-tight purple spandex shorts with the word \"DIRE\" printed on the butt cheeks. This was Dire Ass, a superhero who had recently appeared in Fearfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dire Ass was driving forward, the Frankenstein criminal gave a glare and fired darts from the guns built into her shoulders and the darts exploded on impact as Dire Ass drove around to dodge the strikes. \"When will you learn, Shockerstein?\" asked Dire Ass. \"Let me guess? They made you <i>after</i> they broke the mold?\" Shockerstein became more and more enraged as Dire Ass drove forward and the Frankenstein creature wasted her shots. Dire Ass then gave a smirk and leapt off of her motorcycle into the air as her opponent looked up. Dire Ass smirked and then decided to activate her superpower. Instantly, the gorgon super heroine's round rear started to expand and get much larger until it had to be 1500ft wide. Before Shockerstein could react, Dire Ass crash landed on her and flattened her into the ground. The gorgon then stood up and gave a smirk, leaving her opponent crushed into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDire Ass smirked and then slapped herself in the rear to make it jiggle. \"Hail to the ass of justice, baby.\" Dire Ass heard sirens and smiled. \"Well,\" she said. \"I'll let the monsters in blue take it from here.\" The gorgon got on her motorcycle and drove away just as the police arrived to arrest Shockerstein. Accompanying the police was Tara Gordon, a reporter from the Daily Tombstone. Tara was a giant vampire with chalk white skin, long blonde hair and a pear-shaped body. She also had a face that was horribly scarred on one side due to exposure to sunlight which would've proved fatal if she stayed in the sun too long. Tara gave a slight shriek. \"Dammit,\" she said. \"Dire Ass left too soon. Lexi's not gonna like that I missed her. One of these days, I'm going to find out who she is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe true identity of Dire Ass was Pepper Price, a middle-aged gorgon housewife who was married to a human and with an infant daughter who was a human-gorgon hybrid. At that time, she was changing back to her street clothes. \"Well,\" she said. \"That was fun. But Sal and Laura are probably waiting for me back home. Not a problem, Pepper, just gotta shrink back to normal and...\" However, as Pepper was trying to fit her pants on, she found that her rear wasn't getting smaller like it usually did and it took her more effort than usual to get her pants on. \"Well,\" said the super heroine with a grunt. \"This is a revolting development.\"</span></div></div>",

She was wearing blue jeans and a red tank top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's life was boring. She had just graduated college and was looking for a job. She had just come back from a failed interview after her hair bit a worker. She was still a bit annoyed, but was now mostly bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked, she came across something she hadn't seen before. It was a small antique shop. The outside looked plain enough. The sign on top said \"Forgotten Memories Antiques and Books\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'When did this get here?' Kelly thought. Confused but intrigued, she walked into the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside was a far cry from the outside. The inside was gorgeous, with beautiful antiques everywhere. As she walked through the store, she was honestly impressed by many of the antiques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came up to a shelf, she saw something in particular: a small gold ring with a square garnet in the middle. She picked it up and examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful, isn't it?\" A voice said behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and saw the owner of the voice. It was a succubus. She was the same height as Kelly, had purple skin, green hair, and orange eyes. She was quite obese, looking like she weight 500 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, how much for it?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe succubus thought for a moment. \"I'd say 30 dollars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly reached into her pocket and pulled out 3 10's. She then handed them to the succubus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" The succubus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly nodded and procedded to put the ring on her finger.

There were many reasons as to why, but the main one was it's owner and founder, Sylvia \"Sy\" Kens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia, or Sy as she preferred, was a 6 foot, 4 inch, 24-year-old Costal Taipon gorgon. She had brown scales, green eyes hidden behind sunglasses (to keep from petrifying people), and Coastal Taipons for hair. Sy was known for her muscular figure. Her arms and legs were as thick as trees, she had noticable abs, and even her back was ripped. She still had a fair bust, and a toned rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her imposing figure, Sy was surprisingly approachable. She was one of the most social people in town. You could often find her chatting with friends, or just making new ones. She was always plesent when helping people at her gym, and was never seen without a smile. This made her very popular with both men and women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sy's days were about to get quite odd, thanks to a rare illness.<br>\r\n-------------------------<br>\r\nSy rubbed her eyes as she woke up. She never really was a morning person, which is why she only opened her gym at noon. But she had some errands to run today, so she had to get up earlier then usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, she got out of her bed. When she stood up, she briefly staggered. It felt like her center of gravity was off, but she brushed it off as morning lethargy. Yawning, she slowly made her way to her bathroom to shower. When she got in and caught sight of herself in the mirror, she instantly woke up from shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, overnight, her lower half had blown up to massive proportions. Her butt was the size of twin beach balls each, but felt heavier. Her hips were almost as wide as the bathroom door. And her thighs were still thick, but her leg muscles were replaced with what she thought was fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her initial shock, Sy did her best to keep calm. As quickly as she could now, she walked out of the bathroom and went to her phone to call a doctor.<br>\r\n---------------------------<br>\r\nAbout 40 minutes later, Sy was being examined by her personal doctor, a human named Connie Hersondo. After a few minutes of poking and prodding (which caused quite a bit of moaning from Sy), Connie was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sy, from the looks of it, you have Glutos Syndrome.\" Connie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Syndrome?\" Sy asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glutos. It's a extremely rare disease that only affects adult women. It causes there butts to grow extremely large and heavy. Other symptoms are increased fatigue, increased sensitivity in the butt, and sometimes rashes.\" Connie explained. \"It's so rare that we don't actually know what causes it. I suggest that you remain in bed until we figure this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Sy said. \"I have a lot of errands to run today, and I am not letting the gym stay closed.\" With that, Sy started to walk out of her room, but Connie stoped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before you do anything, you need to know two things about Glutos Syndrome. One, it's progressive. Your butt is going to continue growing.\" Connie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn. What's the other thing?\" Sy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other thing,\" Connie said, frowing. \"Is that Glutos Syndrome is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What kind of girl do you think I am? I can't stay cooped up all day.\" Connie let out a sigh as she prepared to leave. \"I'm afraid that you'll have to,\" the human doctor said as she took out a cell phone. \"I'm going to call the board of health to quarantine your home and make sure there's no way the disease could spread.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSy rolled her green eyes. \"Oh come on,\" said the coastal taipan gorgon. \"I can get over this before the disease has a chance to spread. I work in and run a gym to help people get rid of unsightly fat. You think I can't lose my own weight?\" \"It's a virus, Sy,\" said Connie. \"None of that matters. If you go outside today, you're only going to give another monster or maybe even a human girl Glutos Syndrome.\" Sylvia grumbled and spanked her beach ball-sized butt cheeks as they expanded slightly and looked like two brown scaly watermelons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Connie on the phone. \"This is Dr. Connie Hersando. I'm afraid that we've got a 24-year-old gorgon stricken with Glutos Syndrome at 29 Iron Drive. Yes, that's right, 29 Iron Drive. Sent an all male team right away. We need to contain this woman before her condition spreads.\" But while Connie was speaking, she had completely forgotten that there was an open window nearby and Sylvia's hair noticed it and hissed into the gorgon's ear to remind her. Sylvia turned her head and then she spotted the window and smirked as she flickered her fork tongue. While her doctor friend wasn't looking, Sylvia snuck up to the window and stepped out in order to escape. \"Sorry, Connie,\" said Sylvia. \"But I've never taken a sick day and I'm not going to start now. Urk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia looked back and saw that her large and still growing butt had gotten stuck in the window frame. She grunted and hissed as she tried to pull it out and wound up tearing out the frame and making it fall apart before she started to jog off. The commotion alerted Connie who turned her head and gasped. \"Oh no! Sylvia! Sylvia, stop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Sylvia was too far ahead, she was single-mindedly on her way to the gym. But as she did, her butt had gotten so large that it was the size of a bus stop. With every step, the cheeks shook and Sylvia was sweating heavily due to the extra weight. But that wasn't going to stop the muscular gorgon. She kept running until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story takes place in Horrorville, a matriarchal city that is home to monsters of mythology, the size of skyscrapers. Most monsters in this city were dangerous to the tiny humans which for the most part, they preyed upon, but there was a good number of the population that was friendly with humans. Our story begins in April, 2 months from Summer where 7 monsters giantesses were meeting at Triassic Wings, a hot-wing themed restaurant that served fried pterodactyl. 6 of them had gathered at a round table and were waiting for the 7th.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Dolly Fleece, a chubby 655ft-tall golden-wooled weresheep with curved silver horns. Next to Dolly was Nathalie \u201cNat\u201d Hawthorne, an apple-figured, pitch-white-wooden-skinned jack o\u2019lantern girl with a shiny white pumpkin for a head and long blonde hair. To the side of Nat, was Venus Leelander, a 765ft tall and overweight purple manticore with pink hair, leathery wings and four horns on her forehead. After Venus, trying to light herself a cigarette was Heloise Baskerville, an 800ft tall hellhound resembling a black doberman with long bright red hair, a devil\u2019s tail and horns where her ears should\u2019ve been. Then there was Martha Tortue, a 735ft tarasque, a monster that resembled a reddish brown-furred lioness with 6 arms and a tortoise\u2019s shell. Finally was Elisa Starking, a 950ft tall Bahamut, a monster resembling a hybrid of a fish, a hippopotamus and a dragon. She had brown skin and long dark blue brunette hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, Skyla arrived. She was a 735ft tall heavyset kappa resembling a yellow green hawksbill sea turtle with long green hair. Skyla was carrying a tray with 10 pterodactyl wings, 10 boneless wings, 10 fried shrimp and 3 side orders; green peppers, carrots and french fries. While Skyla\u2019s friends were heavyset like she was, she looked in astonishment at the turtle woman\u2019s gluttony. \u201cFor the love of Greg Weisman, Skyla!\u201d yelled Elisa. \u201cYou\u2019re going to look like Ambrosine Peinture if you keep it up.\u201d Skyla just gave a scoff and started to eat. \u201cHey,\u201d said Skyla. \u201cWhere\u2019s Janet?\u201d Dolly gave a scoff and swallowed a few cheese cubes. \u201cWe don\u2019t need Queen Tomato Buns to complicate matters. I invited you here because there\u2019s a problem. I overheard Kaylee say that she\u2019s hiring a new counselor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 7 girls were camp counselors at Camp Darkly, a summer camp for young monster girls. However, they were off the job because it was still 2 months from Summer and they were working different jobs. Nat let out a squee and clapped her hands. \u201cYayzies!\u201d yelled the pumpkin head. \u201cAre we giving her a welcome party! I wish I knew sooner.\u201d \u201cNo, you idiot,\u201d said Heloise. \u201cWe\u2019re making sure she isn\u2019t competition.\u201d Venus\u2019s jaw dropped and she dropped her carrot into her cleavage. \u201cOh my gosh. You\u2019re not saying this new counselor will muscle in on Edgar.\u201d Elisa gave a snort and blew fire from her nostrils to eat up one of her shrimp. \u201cWe don\u2019t know for sure, Venus. But we can\u2019t take any chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar was the sole male counselor and the only human. He lived in the woods with her mother, Nadine, a Nidhogg sorceress resembling a cross between a dragon and a t-rex. Nadine had cast a spell on Edgar to make him immortal so he could survive being smashed and eaten by the monster girls he interacted on a regular basis. However, while he was safe from one kind of predator, he was constantly mobbed by female monsters who wanted to either be his girlfriend or his wife. The 7 girls at the table were only 7 of the 8 suitors who worked at the camp alone. They had neglected to invite Janet Maza, the 8th, because Janet was Edgar\u2019s favorite suitor and she didn\u2019t let the other girls forget it. At this moment, they were concerned about whether or not this new girl would be more competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Martha with a growl. \"If she turns out to be another Janet, I'll clobber make sure her face is more homely looking than a nuckelavee's. What does she look like, Dolly?\" Dolly ate a boneless wing and licked her fingers before speaking again. \"Her name is Casey Cantus. All I know is that she\u2019s a gorgon.\u201d Martha gave an angry roar. \u201cNot another earth-element monster! No thanks.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Martha,\u201d said Skyla as she wolfed down her fries in one gulp. \u201cShe won\u2019t get the best of us.\u201d Nat then clapped his fingers. \u201cYayzies! There she is! Welcome, friend!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey walked forward and revealed herself to be a bright fuchsia-skinned gorgon with a head of Indian cobras and a red bindi on her forehead. She was 560ft tall and rather scrawny. Suddenly, the other girls didn\u2019t seem so worried about her and Elisa held out a chair for her. \"Come in, Casey was it? Welcome to the Camp Darkly work staff.\" Casey gave a nervous smile but sat down. \"Thanks,\" she said. \"You all seem friendly, uh... except for...\" Casey pointed to Heloise who was smoking and Heloise glared. \"I find it hard to believe that hellhound could get a job that involves children.\" Venus gave a cocky laugh. \"It was either that or jail.\" \"Shut up, Venus. At least I didn't get my eatery shut down due to bad food.\" \"Low blow, hellhound.\" Casey gave a laugh. \"Are these all the camp counselors that will be my new coworkers.\" \"Actually,\" said Elisa. \"Odile and Bettina are out of town and Miranda's tending to her sick mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey let out a sigh. \"Too bad. I was hoping to see that cutie, Edgar again.\" \"What?!\" yelled the other girls. Casey's snake hair sighed in joy as the gorgon showed lovestruck eyes under her sunglasses. \"Edgar was the one who welcomed me to Horrorville when I moved here from Dreadberry and he got his sister to help me settle in. First human I've seen to be sisters with a wyvern. He's definitely a prize. And the best part. He's single. He told me he'd even introduce me to his mother later in the week. I heard she was a sorceress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the rest of the girls were not happy that Casey already met Edgar and had already fallen in love with him. However, Elisa just let out a laugh that not only confused Casey but confused her coworkers at the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d asked Casey. Elisa gave a smug smirk. \u201cHoney. You\u2019re out of your league. Edgar grew up with a large mother and sister. He likes his monster girls with curves. A twig like you doesn\u2019t stand a snowball\u2019s chance.\u201d Casey gasped and then looked at herself and realized that Elisa was right. She was indeed weedy. But before she could deliver a comeback, she heard laughter. \u201cLucky for you 7. You need all the help you can get.\u201d The girls turned to see waddling towards them was their coworker, Janet. Janet was an 825ft tall, red-skinned gargoyle with long purple hair worn in a ponytail and two small horns on her forehead. The most noticeable thing about Janet was her humongous butt. It was wider than she was tall and made her jeans look like a thong in comparison. That was her secret weapon when it came to attracting Edgar. Casey's glasses even fell off upon seeing the gargoyle. Fortunately, gorgon eyes had no effect on gargoyles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here, Janet?\" asked Martha with her teeth grit. Janet grabbed three chairs to sit down at the table with her coworkers. \"Oh, Odile told me about your gathering and I wanted to meet the new girl.\" \u201cOf course she did,\u201d said Dolly with a twitching eye. \u201cThat ogopogo is toast.\u201d Janet smiled at the very intimidated Casey and helped her put her glasses back on. \"You might want to make sure these stay on. A lot of parents would be mad if their daughters were turned into lawn ornaments. Welcome to the Camp Darkly family.\" Casey nervously shook hands with Janet while the rest of the girls glared. Casey was a smart gorgon and realized that the gargoyle girl she was shaking hands with had a clear advantage over her if Edgar really was a man who loved curves like his suitors said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, as she laid in bed, Casey couldn't think of anything thing else except for Edgar and Janet. \"How am I supposed to compete with a booty that big?\" asked Casey to herself. \"At this rate, I\u2019ll be a bridesmaid and that gargoyle will marry Edgar. She wouldn't even need a bustle for the wedding gown.\u201d Casey got up and looked in the mirror to remind herself how skinny she was. \u201cNow,\u201d she said. \u201cIf my butt was bigger than Janet\u2019s. But how?\u201d Suddenly, Casey gasped and snapped her fingers. She took out her cellphone to contact Edgar\u2019s older sister, Sora. Sora was a gray-skinned and pear-shaped wyvern with long white hair, jagged teeth and an arrow-shaped tail. Sora was asleep when Casey called and woke up groggily. \u201cHello?\u201d \u201cSora,\u201d said Casey. \u201cYour mom wouldn\u2019t happen to have a potion that could make my butt grow bigger than Janet's?\" Sora raised an eyebrow before she realized what was going on. \"Oh. Sure. This will be fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeeding Casey's word, Sora snuck down into her mother's workshop where the Nidhogg was snoring away and took an ottoman-sized bottle filled with a glowing blue elixir before flying to meet with Casey. Once the wyvern arrived, she held up the bottle. \"Casey,\" said Sora. \"I only know what Mom told me about this elixir. It tastes awful but you have to drink the entire bottle for it to work. And it has to be straight. Diluted and it will be useless.\" Casey smiled. \"I'd drink anything to get Edgar to love me.\" Sora let out a sigh and handed her friend the elixir. \"And another one joins the fight.\" Casey chugged the bottle and then gagged as she finished it. Sora wasn't kidding. The elixir was awful, but she had to drink it all for it to work. \"You okay?\" asked Sora smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey just kept coughing and coughing and then looked in the mirror to see whether or not her butt had gotten any bigger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly, as Casey was looking in the mirror, she grunted and felt her butt as Sora stepped back and in seconds, the Indian gorgon's booty tore out of her pajama pants. \"Ooh!\" yelled Casey. Casey looked back into her mirror and looked in surprise at how big her butt was already. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Casey. \"That actually worked.\" She gave a hiss of happiness and then laughed loudly. \"This potion works fast.\" Sora let out a whistle. \"Mom should do infomercials with potions like that.\" Casey let out a laugh. \"Oh, I'd like to see the look on those girls' faces when they see me now. And more importantly, wait'll Edgar sees me. Before you know it, Sora, we'll be sisters-in-law.\" Casey laughed again as Sora gave a chuckle. \"Normally I don't like to play favorites in this dating game, but this could end very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Edgar was elsewhere in Horrorville. The silver-haired young human was playing chess with his friend Miranda Howler, a gold-furred lesbian werewolf who always wore a red hood whether or not she was outdoors or indoors. \"Diminished Gluteal Syndrome?\" asked Miranda as she moved a pawn forward. \"You mean that disorder on King of the Hill? That's not real, is it?\" \"I'm not sure, Miranda,\" said Edgar. \"But Mom made two bottles of potion the other day to treat similar cases that might cause back problems. She says that it tastes worse than Venus's cooking.\" \"Yuck,\" said Miranda as Edgar moved his knight. \"I guess medicine's not supposed to taste good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Edgar. \"It doesn't take effect unless you drink the entire bottle and it's as big as a vacuum clean. You can't even dilute it.\" Miranda gave a gag. \"Who would drink something like that, willingly?\" \"Well,\" said Edgar. \"It works. It makes people get a butt as big as Janet's.\" \"Speaking of which,\" said Miranda. \"I think that the new girl, Casey Cantus is out to get you.\" Edgar shrugged his shoulders. \"It's too early to tell, Miranda. Besides, she's too skinny. My mom's pudgy and my sister's got quite a can on her herself, so I'm only interested in large women.\" Miranda rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, that makes things easier.\" \"Checkmate.\" Miranda looked down to see she lost and gave a growl. \"Crap!\" she shouted as she pounded her fist on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next day, Janet, Skyla, Dolly and Heloise were walking down the street when they arrived at a bus stop. Skyla was eating donuts out of a bag while Heloise was smoking a cigarette. \"I wonder where that new girl is.\" Said Dolly. Heloise gave a scoff. \"She's probably trying to find a way to seduce Edgar. Good luck. After seeing Janet's fat ass, I'm sure she knows a twig like her is out of her league.\" \"That's not nice, Heloise,\" said Janet. \"She's still a coworker. And I'm sure...\" Janet's jaw dropped as did Dolly, Skyla and Heloise's as at that moment, Casey jogged down the street. The Indian gorgon woman's large fuchsia butt was now the size of Janet's. As Casey jogged by, her hair hissed and spotted the other four girls before she turned her head and gave them a smug wink right before she was on her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably, the girls were more than a little peeved that Casey was getting bigger, mainly because that meant she was now a potential romance rival for Edgar. \u201cThat little... bachelorette,\u201d muttered Dolly. \u201cAs soon as Edgar sees a booty like that, we might as well start shopping for bridesmaid outfits.\u201d Heloise angrily spat her cigarette to the ground and stomped on it. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s natural,\u201d said the hellhound. \u201cHer ass was so small yesterday I\u2019d swear she was sitting on her spine and now it\u2019s as big as Janet\u2019s. I\u2019d bet you she took something.\u201d Skyla stress ate a few donuts before speaking her mind. \u201cI think that\u2019s pretty obvious, Heloise. Just look at me. It took me years of binge eating to get this fat and yet her butt is ginormous in no time flat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Janet was the one of the girls who took this development the worst and her eyes were glowing bright red as she grit her teeth. The red gargoyle giantess didn\u2019t like the idea that she\u2019d run into a girl with an ass even bigger than hers. Her ass was her main weapon over her fellow suitors when it came to courting Edgar and she sure as heck didn\u2019t need any competition. \u201cThis is war, Cantus.\u201d Thought Janet to herself. All four of the girls were in rage as they thought about how to deal with this rival of theirs when suddenly they had a flash and put their hands to their chins all at once. They had an idea on how to even up the score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh,\u201d said Dolly. \u201cI just remembered, I gotta go pick up my parents\u2019 house from the repair shop...\u201d Janet, Heloise and Skyla stared at Dolly as she was backing away. Even though Dolly was a weresheep that made Godzilla look like a lapdog, she was raised by a human couple and they still lived with her, albeit for the most part, hidden away to protect them from predatory monsters. Ironically, weresheeps were one of the 10 biggest human eating species of monsters there were. However, the other three girls could see that Dolly was bluffing but paid her no heed as she ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, darn,\u201d said Heloise. \u201cI gotta go... uh... rob a bank.\u201d \u201cRob a bank!?\u201d yelled Skyla in surprise. Heloise gave a nervous smile and the canine giantess was off. Janet rolled her eyes and then she noticed Skyla still around sucking on a jelly donut and then gave a smirk. \u201cMy older sister Petra needs me to.. to... uh, hang wallpaper in the basement.\u201d With that, Janet flapped her wings and flew off into the air. Skyla looked around and then cleared her throat. \u201cAnd I have to go... wait a minute... I\u2019m alone. I don\u2019t need to think of an excuse.\u201d Skyla then ran the other way, still munching on donuts. \u201cOh,\u201d she groaned. \u201cSometimes I hate being a turtle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time back in the woods, Edgar's mother Nadine was going through her potions and held up a vial of potion that was identical to the potion that Sora gave to Casey. However, she looked into the cupboard and scratched her tyrannosaurus-like chin as she snorted out smoke. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve bet money that there was more than one vial of DGS medicine in here.\u201d Suddenly there was a knock on the Nidhogg woman\u2019s door and she snorted. \u201cWhat the? Who could that be?\u201d Nadine stomped up to the door and right outside was...</span></div></div>",

Elisa?\" Janet took a seat in two chairs specifically designed for Nadine's own large behind. \"Casey.\" Nadine raised an eyebrow and snorted as she rubbed her dinosaur-like cheek with her scrawny arms. \"I'll admit,\" said the Nidhogg sorceress. \"Edgar has a lot of women who want to be his wife, but I don't remember one called Casey. What species is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanet then remembered something and gave a smirk. \"A gorgon.\" She said. Nadine's eyes popped out. \"What?!\" Even though Nadine was hell-bent on her son finding a wife, she was reluctant to allow Edgar to have anything to do with gorgons. Nadine's husband and therefore Edgar's adoptive father was murdered by a gorgon years ago and his petrified corpse was displayed in Nadine's garden. This experience made the dragon giantess reluctant to trust gorgons. Nadine actually bit her lower lip at the possibility that a potential daughter-in-law could be a gorgon. \"Don't tell me Edgar is actually considering a relationship with one of those... things. After what Yuri L did to his father?!\" Janet stood up and walked up to the dragon woman. \u201cDon\u2019t get too overheated, Nadine. I\u2019m here to stop it before it gets too far. The reason I\u2019m here is because I\u2019m certain that Casey Cantus took something that made her butt grow to be as big as mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine\u2019s eyes popped. \u201cSo that\u2019s where that other bottle of potion went. But how would she even know where it is? The only two monsters who knew about it were me and... Sora! That sneaky wyvern. Oh, wait\u2019ll I get my hands on that daughter of mine. Her gray skin will turn bright pink when I\u2019m through with her.\u201d \u201cSora?\u201d asked Janet. \u201cOh, that traitor. Remind me to make her life hell when she\u2019s my sister-in-law. Wait! Oh no, we are not going on a tangent. That goop you made is what made that snake hussy\u2019s behind so big. There is no girl in Horrorville who has a bigger can than Janet Hyannis Maza. Nobody!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine thought for a moment. She did not like the idea of a gorgon being a potential suitor for her son after her experience with the one who killed her husband. Then again, she knew that Edgar had a fondness for round women and that Janet was the closest of the suitors to winning. If the rivalry was limited to the favor to win and a new up and coming suitor, then it would mean either one of them would definitely be the one to marry her son. This was no time for her to be picky. This was a time to be pragmatic. Nadine gave a snort and then she turned to Janet. \u201cIt just so happens that I only have one bottle left of that particular potion. Normally it would cost 500 Skulls, but since it\u2019s you, it\u2019s on the house.\u201d Nadine held up the bottle and Janet smiled and tried to grab it, only for Nadine to pull it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, there is something you must know. It won\u2019t work unless you drink the whole thing.\u201d Janet gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d she asked. \u201cMy oldest sister could drink three times this much and still be thirsty. At least my fat mostly goes to one place.\u201d Janet took the vial and uncorked it to take a sniff and then gagged. \u201cUgh! It smells like Petra\u2019s gym shorts. I bet it tastes yucky.\u201d Nadine gave a snort. \u201cI\u2019m a sorceress, not a gourmet cook. Nobody said medicine was supposed to taste good.\u201d Janet put the cork back on the bottle and then smiled. \u201cNo worries. I\u2019ll just mix this in with a Polter Zero and it\u2019ll go down like water.\u201d Nadine then kicked Janet in the butt and made her grunt. \u201cNo you idiot!\u201d yelled Nadine. \u201cThat potion is no good diluted. It will only work if you take it as it is.\u201d Janet let out a groan. \u201cOkay then. I should be the one telling people to eat the disgusting tasting medicine.\u201d The gargoyle woman then let out a laugh. \u201cBut it will be worth it when I\u2019m the one walking down the alter with Edgar.\u201d Janet hummed a wedding march before walking out of the room. Nadine let out a sigh. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not making a mistake.\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Janet flew off, Heloise ran in and huffed and puffed. \u201cNadine,\u201d said Dolly. \u201cI came here as fast as I...\u201d \u201cToo late, Heloise,\u201d said Nadine. \u201cJanet just took the last bottle I had.\u201d Heloise\u2019s eye twitched and the hellhound giantess screamed angrily into her own paws. At that moment, Janet was back at her apartment and was looking at the bottle of potion. \u201cAlright, Casey Cantus,\u201d said Janet. \u201cIt\u2019s time to remind you who\u2019s the queen behind in Camp Darkly.\u201d Janet sat on her bed and then chugged down the entire bottle. \u201cUgh!\u201d yelled Janet as she held onto her mouth. \u201cGross! What did Nadine put in this? Her dirty socks? Where would she even get socks? She doesn\u2019t even wear shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Janet felt her stomach. \u201cOh dear.\u201d Janet bent over as her already large butt expanded and caused her bed to collapse. Janet looked back and smirked. \u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s it. I never would\u2019ve used this when I won Miss Horrorville three years ago, but this will definitely get me Edgar in the palm of my hand. Look out, Cantus. Janet\u2019s fighting back. Urk!\u201d Janet then looked back and saw her behind was stuck in the window behind her. She let out a sigh. \u201cA minor setback.\u201d Janet then lifted up her cellphone and called somebody to help her. \u201cHello,\u201d she said. \u201cPetra. What\u2019s up, Sis? Listen, I\u2019m stuck in a rather unusual jam and well, I\u2019d appreciate it if you came and helped me out. I\u2019ll explain when you get here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nadine opened the door and saw Dolly standing in front of her. The Nidhogg gave a smirk before she said \u201cHello, Dolly.\u201d. Dolly rolled her eyes. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cLike I\u2019ve never heard that one before. Nadine, aren\u2019t you looking lovely today? New earrings? Oh, I know. You did something with your scales.\u201d Nadine rolled her eyes and smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, let me guess. There\u2019s a new counselor who has taken a shine to my Edgar and without my permission or knowledge, Sora took one of the two vials I had of a potion that induces butt expansion and gave it to the rather scrawny girl in an attempt to give herself a large butt to attract my son, prompting you to come to me to even up the score.\u201d Dolly gave a look of shock and blinked. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d Nadine smirked and showed her hundreds of sharp teeth. \u201cCall it Deja Vu, but when you get as old as me, you get Genre Savvy. Now, tell me, what species of monster is this girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolly had to think about it. Should she tell Nadine the truth that Casey Cantus was a gorgon. Nadine\u2019s husband was killed by a gorgon years ago and it was perfectly obvious gorgons weren\u2019t Nadine\u2019s favorite species of monster. Some monsters had certain species of other monsters they couldn\u2019t stand. Dolly being a weresheep didn\u2019t like werewolves that much and barely tolerated having Miranda around. Come to think about it, vampires and werewolves didn\u2019t always get along either. But then Dolly realized something. If Nadine felt the same way about gorgons that Dolly did about werewolves, she\u2019d sure as heck would think twice about allowing the same species of monster that killed her husband get anywhere near her son. Dolly cracked an evil smirk. \u201cCasey Cantus is a gorgon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA gorgon!?\u201d yelled Nadine in horror. \u201cOh. I know I want Edgar to hurry up and find a wife as soon as he can but a gorgon. Well, at least I can narrow down the search criteria.\u201d Nadine bent over and then took out the vial of potion before she popped off the cork. Dolly took a smell and made a face as if she had been poisoned before Nadine put the cork back on the bottle. \u201cUgh. I\u2019ve smelt skunk apes that were more pleasing to the nose than that potion.\u201d \u201cIt tastes even worse than it smells,\u201d said Nadine. \u201cBut you have to drink it down to the very last drop. The last drop is what makes the magic happen.\u201d Dolly let out a groan. \u201cCan I ate least mix it in with some ice cream? That\u2019s how Mom got me to take medicine when I was sick as a lamb.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Nadine. \u201cIf you dilute the potion, it will be useless. It has to be taken straight.\u201d Dolly took the potion and mumbled. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it means walking down the aisle with Edgar, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Dolly then took out her wallet and opened it up before she took out a 100 skull bill to Nadine\u2019s surprise. Nadine just shook her head. \u201cThis one\u2019s on me.\u201d \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \u201cIt would be rude to make a potential daughter-in-law pay for a potion that could help them win my son.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDolly nodded her head and then skipped away with the potion. As Dolly was leaving the woods, Janet flew down and landed in front of Nadine\u2019s doorway. \u201cOh,\u201d said Nadine. \u201cJanet. You just missed Dolly.\u201d Janet gave a look of shock and then felt her butt before she let out a sigh. \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve been dethroned.\u201d Nearby, at a bus stop that had broken under the mass of Casey\u2019s enormous booty, the gorgon giantess was giggling as she looked through a bridal magazine. She hummed a bridal tune, certain that she would have Edgar for her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Dolly had returned to her house where she lived with her mother Shae and her father Perry. Perry and Shae, unlike their daughter, were humans that raised the weresheep giantess since she was a baby, leaving a monster from a normally dangerous species to humans as docile as well... a lamb. They still lived with their daughter who in turn kept them safe from other monsters who only like humans when they\u2019re in their tummy. Dolly was in her bedroom with her folks on her vanity desk. She had explained her plan to her bite-sized parents and they were shocked at what she was intending to do. \u201cWait,\u201d said Perry. \u201cYou\u2019re telling us that you\u2019re taking that potion to make your butt bigger than Janet\u2019s. \u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Dolly. \u201cThat hussy Casey Cantus did the same thing. This is war.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDolly,\u201d said Shae. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is such a good idea. What if that potion can\u2019t be undone?\u201d Dolly bit her lip. \u201cI\u2019ll worry about that later. Besides, don\u2019t you want a son-in-law as handsome and sweet as Edgar?\u201d Dolly\u2019s parents climbed their daughter\u2019s woolly body and each perched on one of her horns. \u201cAre you sure that you won\u2019t regret this, pumpkin?\u201d asked Perry. Dolly uncorked the bottle and gave a serious look. \u201cI\u2019m not changing my mind, Daddy,\u201d said Dolly. \u201cThis is war.\u201d Perry and Shae smelt the potion and gagged, with Shae even keeling over. \u201cGood grief,\u201d said Perry. \u201cThat potion reminds me of when we had to change your diapers. You\u2019re going to drink something that foul?\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u2028<br>\r\nDolly ignored her tiny father and put the bottle to her mouth before drinking it to the last drop, all the while, fighting back tears from the terrible taste. Once the entire potion was swallowed, Dolly belched loudly. Suddenly, she felt her stomach. \u201cDolly?\u201d asked Shae. \u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d Dolly got on her knees and her movement caused her folks to slide down her back. \u201cWhoa!\u201d yelled Perry. And that\u2019s when it happened. Dolly\u2019s butt expanded rapidly and caused her skirt to snap off before she she sat down on her bed, accidentally sitting right on top of her parents, though not enough to squash them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Dolly shrieked and then the sheep giantess stood up. \u201cMom?! Dad?!\u201d Both of Dolly\u2019s parents moaned as now Perry was stuck to her left cheek and Shae to her right, both tangled in their daughter\u2019s wool. \u201cWell,\u201d said Shae. \u201cAt least we know for sure that potion works.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the doorway was none other than Skyla and the 735ft tall hawksbill sea turtle kappa was stuffing her greedy fat face with jelly donuts. \"Hi, Mrs. Hofferson. Sorry I'm late. I stopped for donuts.\" Nadine looked at Skyla and blinked. \"What brings you here, Skyla?\" she asked. \"It's not even close to lunchtime.\" Skyla licked her chubby webbed fingers before she spoke. \"By the way, did you know that there's a new suitor in town for Edgar's attention.\" Nadine blinked. \"This is news to me. I really hope that she isn't a gorgon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Shelly. \"She had an enormous butt that she didn't have yesterday and it <i>did</i> cross my mind that perhaps one of your potions would be capable of doing such a thing.\" Nadine gave a snort and rubbed her chin as Sora was in the background going through the fridge and then realized what Skyla was saying and tried to sneak out before Nadine knew what was going on. \"Well,\" said Nadine. \"I did make a potion like that that was meant to treat diminished posteriors and it works fast. In fact, I made two bottles. But it sounds like this new girl managed to steal one of the bottles when I wasn't looking. Wait a minute. How would she even know where I kept it? The only one who knew where that potion was besides me was... Sora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora at the time was attempting to sneak out when she felt her Nidhogg mother glaring at her. \"You took my potion without my permission!\" yelled the sorceress angrily. \"You sneaky wyvern!\" \"I was only trying to help one of Edgar's suitors! Don't blow a gasket, Mom!\" Skyla closed her eyes and then heard a smacking sound and then the sound of Sora screaming in pain. The next thing that Skyla saw when she opened her eyes was a large pink imprint of Nadine's clawed three-fingered hand on one of Sora's butt cheeks and the wyvern giantess rubbing her bottom in pure pain. \"That'll teach you to go behind my back.\" Said Nadine sternly. Nadine then bent over and picked up the vial of magic potion. \"Now,\" she said. \"I'm going to have to find a different hiding spot for this vial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then Skyla ran in front of Nadine. \"Wait, Nadine! Don't be rash! Think about it. Edgar loves larger women. If two of his suitors had really big enormous butts, then it would narrow down the search and then it would be only two girls in the lead for Edgar's hand.\" Nadine was going to put away the vial but then she realized that Skyla indeed had a point. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"That's actually a good idea. Hmmm.\" Sora then gave a smirk. \"That doesn't mean you're off the hook,\" growled Nadine, prompting Sora to frown. \"Of course, I still don't know.\" Skyla bit into a cruller before speaking. \"Need I remind you who it was that babysat Edgar when he was a kid.\" \"Fair enough, Skyla. In that case, I won't charge you a cent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadine waddled towards the cupboard and took out the bottle. \"Now, Skyla,\" she said. \"This is very important. The potion will only work if you drink it to the last drop and it must be undiluted. I must warn you, it tastes terrible.\" Skyla then gave a scoff. \"Oh please,\" she said. \"I happen to have a refined sense of taste.\" Skyla then took the bottle and uncorked it. She took a sniff and gagged. \"Good thing I'm already green.\" Skyla then licked the neck of the bottle and then her eyes popped. \"Yum!\" she yelled. In seconds, Skyla chugged the entire bottle as Sora and Nadine looked in surprise and disgust. \"I think I'm going to be sick.\" Groaned Nadine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla finished the potion and was licking the inside of the bottle. \"That was delicious. Got any more?\" \"No,\" said Nadine. \"And I don't think you need to have any more at the moment. I can't believe you drank that all and liked it. It's gross.\" \"Mom,\" said Sora. \"This is Skyla P. Laird. If there were two of her, it'd cause a famine. Wait, shouldn't her butt be growing now.\" Sora grunted and got on her knees. In seconds, her yellow-green-skinned and brown-reddish spotted ass had expanded and demolished the wall of Nadine's hovel. \"Oh my.\" Said Sora. Nadine's jaw dropped. \"My house!\" she yelled. Skyla looked back and then spanked herself. \"Oh,\" she said. \"Look at me. I'm absolutely pear-shaped. Oh, wait until Casey sees me. In fact, I think I'll go to her house and show her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkyla left the hovel as Nadine let out a groan. \"I don't care who marries Edgar of the two of them as long as the bride pays for both the wedding and my hovel!\" After Skyla left, Dolly arrived and blinked. \"What happened here?\" asked Dolly. \"It looks like a wrecking ball struck the place. Now, do you have anything that can make my woolly golden butt as big as a meteor?\" \"Sorry, Dolly,\" said Nadine. \"Just gave the last to Skyla.\" \"Dog Waffles!\" yelled Dolly as she stomped her hoof. At that time, Skyla was still waddling down the street and ate the last of her donuts as she dragged her butt across the ground. She realized how much bigger her butt was than her shell. \"Hmm,\" she said. \"Maybe I didn't think this through.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm doing fine. Except I seem to have misplaced a bottle of magic potion.\" Heloise rubbed her chin and realized that Casey must've had something to do with this potion. \"That's... uh... interesting, Nadine. What exactly was this potion supposed to do?\" Nadine looked at Heloise curiously. \"Why do you care?\" Heloise gave a scoff. \"Well,\" she said. \"It's entirely possible that you'll wind up my mother-in-law if things work out with Edgar and I figured that I should brush up on my spell casting.\" Nadine nodded her head, falling completely for the hellhound's deception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes sense I guess. The potion in question is quite harmless with no threats to the health. Of course, it does have a strange effect. It makes the drinker's buttocks grow to an enormous size.\" \"Oh, really?\" asked Heloise. \"It's relatively easy to make. Just a combination of dragon berries and royal jelly fermented for a week and mixed in with blue daisies and tyrannosaurus teeth,\" said Nadine. \"It works fast.\" \"And why would you make a potion like that, Mrs. Hofferson?\" asked Heloise. Nadine let out a sigh. \"It's meant for use on people who have a very rare medical condition where their buttocks are so worn away they're effectively sitting on their spine. My cousin had it and it was quite embarrassing for a dragon. I had two vials of the stuff but the other one disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeloise of course, had no idea that Sora took the bottle without telling Nadine and took it to Casey, so she assumed the worst. \"That little snake-haired creep,\" thought the 800ft demonic dog. \"She broke in and stole that potion from Nadine. Hmmm. I gotta admit, she did a good job. It almost looks as if somebody from the inside took the potion. If I had those thieving skills, I never would've gotten caught. Thank goodness I had the choice between going to Under Gloom and working at a lame camp for brats.\" Heloise was actually a reformed criminal who was sentenced to do community service at Camp Darkly and as such she did her job rather half-assed and didn't seem to care what she did in front of impressionable children. That didn't change the fact that she was one of Edgar's suitors and Nadine didn't seem to be too concerned with that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, right now, Nadine was rubbing her chin. \"I'm still not sure how they did it. I didn't hear anything last night.\" Before Nadine could even think of what happened, there was a knock at her door. \"Now who could that be?\" asked the Nidhogg giantess. The dinosaur-like dragon stomped to the door and outside was a strange alien-creature resembling a blue-gray-skinned Xenomorph with six arms, an eyeless face, a skeletal tail, sharp teeth and a relatively flat chest. This creature was Xeno, the only giantess in Horrorville to be an extraterrestrial. Xeno was part of an invasion force that tried to attack Earth, only to change their mind when they landed in the part of the world populated by giant monsters and realized they were outmatched. Xeno was left behind because she forgot to refuel her spaceship before they left. Fortunately she was relatively harmless and normally didn't want anything to do with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXeno shrieked in alien language as Nadine lowered her head to the alien's level. \"Hi, Xeno. What can I do you for today?\" Xeno let out a few shrieks and Nadine seemed to understand her. \"I see. Are you sure that's a good idea.\" Xeno held her head in pain and hissed. \"Okay, okay, alright, I'll see if I have something for you.\" As Nadine was tending to Xeno, she left the bottle of butt-expanding potion completely unguarded and Heloise gave a smirk. She snuck her way right to the bottle and snatched it away, shoving it in the back of her skirt in order to smuggle it out without Nadine knowing and snuck right out the door. As Heloise was leaving, Skyla came into Nadine's hovel and was panting and holding her stomach. \"Skyla?\" asked Nadine as she was rooting around her cupboard for potions. \"This must be my day for seeing people. Skyla stopped and looked around. \"Did I just see Heloise in here.\" Nadine gave a snort. \"She was in here a second ago.\" Skyla let out a groan. \"I knew I shouldn't have stopped for donuts on the way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Heloise was back at her apartment and took out the bottle of potion as she was watching a Dr. Madman cartoon on the television. In the cartoon, the despicable Dr. Madman was inside a house of some sort and had gotten himself a bowl of popcorn as he was sitting in front of the television himself. \"Oh yes,\" said Dr. Madman in the cartoon. \"ZX is on the tube tonight and there's no way I'm missing it.\" However, outside, looking in at Dr. Madman was Madman's worst enemy, the bounty hunter Mangaga and he gave a smirk as he looked in. \"That taco-muncher is in for it now,\" said the metallic mutant. \"I've laid a clever snare right on the roof by the satellite. Once I cut the power, Dr. Madman will climb the roof  to fix the TV and step in the rope that I attached to an airplane about to take off.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMangaga let out a snicker and walked up to the fusebox outside before turning his hand into a pair of metal scissors and cutting the power, causing the television to break out in static. \"Aw nuts,\" said Dr. Madman. \"And ZX starts in 10 minutes. Oh well, I'll just find some other house to watch it. It's Mangaga's TV anyway.\" Mangaga gave a look of shock and looked outside to see his own mailbox, remembering that it was his own TV he sabotaged. Mangaga let out a scream and climbed the roof to fix the satellite, falling into his own snare trap in the process. By the time Mangaga realized his mistake, he looked to see the rope moving and his eye twitched. \"I really hate that guy.\" He mumbled before he was dragged away screaming by the airplane. Dr. Madman just gave a smug grin. \"That Mangaga is just <i>plane</i> stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Dr. Madman laughed in the cartoon, Heloise changed the channel to a horror movie starring Corona Poe. As a spear-wielding maniac was moving through the shadows in the movie, Heloise held up the bottle and sniffed it before she covered her nose. \"This stuff smells horrible and I'm a hellhound so I'm not really one to talk. Heloise stuck her tongue into the bottle and gagged. \"Yucky! Ugh! Nadine could at least make a potion that tasted good.\" Heloise got up and looked into her mirror to see that her butt hadn't gotten any bigger. \"No good. Guess you have to drink the whole thing for it to work. Scrud. Only for Edgar, only for Edgar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeloise held up the bottle and chugged it as her large and black-furred and pointy-tailed rear was throbbing....</span></div></div>",

You have no idea what a diva Fanny Stein can be.\" Sora then eyed Casey's rear end and saw that it was now as tall as the gorgon giantess was. \"My,\" said Sora. \"That's some serious junk in the trunk. When mom makes a potion, she makes a potion.\" Casey gave a smile as her snake hair hissed happily. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cWait\u2019ll your brother sees me now, Sora. You are so going to be the best lady at the wedding.\u201d Sora gave a scoff. \u201cNaturally. Of course, you have to meet Mom first. I gotta warn you, gorgons aren\u2019t her favorite species of monster.\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey gave a gulp. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. Sora nodded her head. \u201cYears ago,\u201d said Sora. \u201cDad was petrified to death by a gorgon serial killer from Fearfield. In fact, after her died, Mom put him out in the garden. If you see a wyvern statue by the house, I\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t so much as touch it.\u201d Casey nodded her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s so sad. And creepy.\u201d Sora nodded her head again. \u201cIt is very important that you are very careful around Mom. Don\u2019t give her a reason to dislike you. Though at this point she probably wouldn\u2019t care if the little twerp married Morgan Le Fay. Come on.\u201d Sora flew ahead as Casey waddled on foot. \u201cIt must be great to fly.\u201d Muttered the gorgon giantess with the bindi and the cobra hair. \u201cWhoa!\u201d As Casey moved through the woods, her enormous booty brushed against and knocked over several trees. \u201cOops!\u201d Sora couldn\u2019t help but snicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasey and Sora soon reached Nadine\u2019s hovel where the Nidhogg giantess was rooting around her cupboard trying to find the potion that went missing. \u201cWhere! Where! Where! Oh, you gotta be kidding me! I knew I had that potion somewhere.\u201d \u201cUh-oh,\u201d said Sora. \u201cUh, everything okay, Mom?\u201d Nadine got up and gave a snort. \u201cYou know the potion I had in here for treating DGS? Somehow, it\u2019s gone missing. How does that even happen?!\u201d As Nadine was searching, Sora had to duck as Nadine tossed an empty flask over her head. Casey grunted because the flask got stuck between her massive cheeks. As Casey stepped forward, she grunted because her large rear got stuck in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmph?\u201d asked Nadine as she turned her head. Nadine then gasped and dropped her jaw, revealing her hundreds of sharp teeth as she spotted Casey. \u201cWho is this?\u201d asked the dinosaur-like dragoness. \u201cOh,\u201d said Sora. \u201cMom. Meet Casey Cantus. She\u2019s the newest player in the game.\u201d \u201cA gorgon with interest in my son?!\u201d asked Nadine. \u201cHmm. Well, I guess not all gorgons are like Yuri. I already knew that. But seriously.\u201d Casey blushed and gave a nervous look as Nadine stomped up towards her to inspect her and even sniffed her. \u201cShe looks friendly enough. But my baby boy likes women with curves. She needs far more... meat... on...\u201d Nadine noticed Casey\u2019s rather large behind and was shocked. \u201cWhy is your rear so big and yet your upper body is rail thin.\u201d Casey bit her lip and her snakes were hissing. \u201cWell, you see that...\u201d Sora then cleared her throat. \u201cI kinda sorta helped her keep up with Janet, Dolly, Nat and the rest of the girls.\u201d Nadine realized something. \u201cSora, you sneak! You took my two bottles of potion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?!\" yelled Sora. \"That's odd. I'll admit I did take one of those vials of potion but <i>only</i> one. I left the other one where it was. Mom, did anyone else happen to come by.\" Nadine felt her chin and tried to remember who came by. \"Well,\" she said. \"First Heloise popped in and said she wanted to learn about how to use magic but she must've left when Xeno came in and...\" Nadine suddenly realized exactly what happened and her eyes popped. \"I am <i>so</i> stupid!\" she yelled. \"Heloise was arrested for petty theft in the past. She must've stolen that vial when I wasn't looking. How could I be so daft?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!?\" yelled Casey with a gasp. \"You mean to tell me that Heloise took that potion too!?\" Sora gave a scoff. \"What did you expect, Casey?\" asked Sora. \"These girls are competitive. It's a good thing that Mom only had two bottles of potion or things would've gotten really hairy.\u201d Nadine was at first upset, but then she rubbed her chin because she had a thought. \u201cCome to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis might work towards our advantage. After all, with two girls bigger than all the others, it would make it a whole lot easier for Edgar to narrow down his search for a bride.\u201d Nadine let out a laugh as Sora looked at her mother in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there were footsteps and Casey turned around, shattering Nadine\u2019s window with her enormous rear and looked in surprise as who should she see but...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a bright and sunny spring break Monday in Direopolis, a city populated mainly by mythological monsters that were as big as skyscrapers. There was a lunch rush that day at Neo Neapolitan, the local restaurant. Direopolis was a rather unusual restaurant. The three proprietresses couldn\u2019t decide what type of restaurant to make it so they compromised; Neo Neapolitan was 1/5 pizzeria, 1/5 hamburger joint, 1/5 ice cream parlor, 1/5 donut shop and 1/5 pancake house. The restaurant was run by 3 monster giantesses who married a trio of human brothers. The sextet was in the kitchen right now.<br>\r\n\u2028First walked in the waitress, Salli Van Richter and her husband Allen, the middle brother of the husbands. Salli was a rather unusual monster. She was a vanilla-skinned and black-haired loxodon, a monster resembling an Asian elephant. Salli wasn\u2019t an ordinary loxodon either because her father was a vampire and as well as having all the powers of a vampire, Salli had fangs in both her mouth and in her trunk. She was the nicest of the proprietresses which was why she was the waitress. Salli mainly acted as the bodyguard to her timid husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond of the proprietresses was Pam Hocker and her husband Norman. Pam was a chocolate brown-skinned wereboar resembling a wild sow with six tusks and long blonde hair. Unusually for a wereboar she was born with wings on her back. Pam was mainly the delivery girl because she was very immature, childish and didn\u2019t have a lot of common sense, which made her a liability as far as her sisters-in-law were concerned. She and her husband, Norman, the youngest of the Wraith Brothers, were prefect for each other because they were both prone to rash decision making.<br>\r\n\u2028Lastly there was Patty Round and her husband Wes who were working the grill. Patty was a 1350ft pink-skinned Egyptian werehippopotamus with golden red hair, a cyan tattoo of a pyramid over her right eye and a massive butt that was wider than she was tall like was the case with most werehippos. Patty and Wes were the ones in charge due to being the smartest and most responsible of the couples that ran Neo Neapolitan and they were a clear case of opposites attract. Patty was the most stern and serious of the three wives and like a real hippopotamus, was very temperamental, especially towards Pam\u2019s incompetence. In contrast, Wes was just as serious but more calm and snarky, making him more passive aggressive compared to his wife.<br>\r\n\u2028Patty turned her head and saw Salli picking her left ear with her trunk. \u201cCarina just placed her order...\u201d \u201cI already know it, Salli,\u201d said Patty. \u201cA double brontosaurus burger with seismosaurus bacon, hold the onions with a side of chilli fries and a dragonberry sundae with walnuts, whipped cream and gummy worms.\u201d They were referring to Carina Veldarez, a local punk rock singer. Carina was a gorgon with scales dyed in rainbow colors and different types of colorful snakes for hair. She also had an exaggerated hourglass figure with Z-cup breasts and an enormous butt. However, Carina had no indoor voice at all and was prone to yelling everything she said. In a way, they didn\u2019t need a waitress to take Carina\u2019s orders. Allen gave a scoff. \u201cPatty,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re picking on Salli lately? She has the biggest ears of us. If my wife keeps waiting on bigmouths like Carina, she is going to go deaf.\u201d Patty let out a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Allen. I already put an add in the paper. We\u2019ll hire an extra waitress. But Salli will be the boss.\u201d Salli gave a smile. \u201cOh. Also, Mia wants a pepperoni pan pizza with anchovies, hold the jalape\u00f1os.\u201d \u201cGot it, Salli.\u201d Said Patty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patty opened the fridge and took out a large slice of pepperoni, she made a startling discovery. Right behind the pepperoni was a pair of gold Egyptian style bracelets that looked like snakes with the heads of hippopotami and bright blue sapphires for eyes. \u201cOh no,\u201d groaned Patty. \u201cMom forgot her bracelets the last time she visited.\u201d Wes let out a sigh. \u201cThat means they\u2019ll be back.\u201d Wes didn\u2019t care much for when Patty\u2019s parents visited. Sure, Wes got along with Patty\u2019s werehippo mother perfectly fine, but Patty\u2019s human father hated him and believed Patty could\u2019ve done better. Patty held up the bracelets and then turned to her two sisters-in-law. \u201cSalli,\u201d she says. \u201cPam. Bad news. My mother left her manacles behind in the fridge.\u201d Salli just stared at Patty. \u201cWhat were they doing in the fridge?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Salli,\u201d said Patty. \u201cListen and listen carefully. These bracelets were made to be worn by a werehippo. Absolutely NOBODY except for a werehippo is to wear them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam however, looked at the bracelets and gave a snort. \u201cBut they look so pretty,\u201d she says. \u201cNorman, how do you think I\u2019d look with those bracelets on?\u201d Norman actually had to stop and think about Pam dressed as an Egyptian queen with Neith Round\u2019s bracelets around her wrists. \u201cBaby,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wish they had a pig goddess in Egyptian mythology.\u201d \u201cPamela Petunia Hocker,\u201d grunted Patty sternly. \u201cDo you have cream cheese in your ears? No one is to wear these bracelets! If anyone other than my mom wore them, it would be a disaster.\u201d Patty laid the bracelets on the counter before she returned to her grill. Norman turned to Allen and rolled his eyes. \u201cI don\u2019t see what the big deal is. Neith wears more jewelry than a hip hopper. Like it would be a crime if someone else wore those stupid manacles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty ignored her in-laws as she prepared the french fries and the sundae for Carina\u2019s order and was now waiting on the burger patties. As Patty\u2019s back was turned, Pam picked up one of the bracelets to examine it. It was at that moment they heard Carina shout \u201cWHAT\u2019S GOING ON IN THERE?! I\u2019M ****ING STARVING! COME ON AND GET MY FOOD ON!\u201d The sound of Carina\u2019s voice caused Patty to toss the bracelet into the air as Patty was about to answer Carine. \u201cKeep your snakes on, Carina. It\u2019s ready.\u201d Salli let out a sigh as she picked up the sundae and the fries as Patty put Carina\u2019s burger on the tray. Salli had plugged her ears as she walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what neither Pam nor Salli nor Patty knew was that one of Neith\u2019s bracelets had landed in Carina\u2019s...</span></div></div>",

Outside, Carina was tapping her fingers on the table and her snake hair was drooling. \u201cI\u2019M WAITING HERE!\u201d Patty walked out carrying the burger, fries and sundae that Carina ordered and was wearing a pair of earmuffs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Salli. \u201cI\u2019ve got your order right here.\u201d Salli laid Carina\u2019s order on the table and Carina wasted no time biting into the burger as her snake hair sucked up the sundae. Carina then made a face of pain and grabbed ahold of her head. Allen gave a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when a cold-blooded monster overindulges on the sundaes.\u201d Salli and Allen shared a laugh before  Carina recovered and then reached for her chili fries. But before she could bite into any of them, Neith\u2019s bracelet begun to shake. \u201cHUH!?\u201d asked Carina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bracelet then flew onto Carina\u2019s wrist and made her yell as it tightened. \u201cWHAT THE?!\u201d Salli turned around and saw the bracelet before she gasped. \u201cPatty!\u201d she yelled. \u201cPatty!\u201d Patty and Pam came out of the kitchen with Wes and Norman on their shoulders. \u201cSalli,\u201d said Norman. \u201cWhat are you doing? We already have one big mouth around here. What\u2019s with all the shouting?\u201d Wes then noticed Carina trying to remove Neith\u2019s bracelet off of her wrist. \u201cHey, Patty,\u201d he said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your mom\u2019s bracelet?\u201d Patty\u2019s jaw dropped. \u201cOh no.\u201d She said. \u201cSOMEBODY GET THIS FREAKING BRACELET OFF OF ME!\u201d yelled Carina. Carina kept on struggling and then suddenly, her butt begun to expand and press against her back. Carina moaned as her rear end grew to be twice as tall as she was and several times wider than it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen, Norman and Wes looked in surprise as their wives laid them on the table. Even Salli and Pam were shocked but Patty slapped herself in the face. Everyone in the restaurant was staring and even took photographs. \u201cWow!\u201d yelled Norman. \u201cHer butt is super huge now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s even bigger than Patty\u2019s.\u201d Said Allen. Wes glared at his brother. \u201cWell it is.\u201d Patty let out a sigh. \u201cAny creature that isn\u2019t a werehippo who wears that bracelet will develop the rear end of a werehippo. It was the bracelet of my ancestor, the werehippo queen Tontepsut, who was much bigger than any other werehippo that ever lived.\u201d Carina begun to sputter. \u201cARE YOU KIDDING?! I\u2019M SUPPOSED TO BE THE QUEEN OF ROCK, NOT THE QUEEN OF HIPPOS!\u201d Carina tried to yank the bracelet off, but it tightened again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the door opened up and another monster came in. Only this monster wasn\u2019t one of the regular customers. Instead, she was a raspberry blue-skinned, pear-shaped manticore as tall and fat as Patty, Pam and Salli with long brown hair. She was wearing a red fedora with flowers in it along with a green floral print muumuu. Her name was Dorothy Coward and she was a business partner of the Rounds, Hockers and Van Richters who was originally hired to fill in for Patty while she was indisposed. Dorothy walked into the room and looked in surprise at Carina\u2019s enormous rear and Neith\u2019s bracelet. She even blinked slightly. \u201cWhat did I miss?\u201d she asked. Wes rolled his eyes. \u201cCould somebody give the blue lioness a copy of the script?\u201d Salli flew up to Dorothy and whispered what happened into her ear as Dorothy\u2019s eyes popped. \u201cYou have GOT to be kidding me.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDorothy let out a sigh. \u201cYou six really attract a lot of weirdness. Patty\u2019s from an Egyptian family, Salli\u2019s a vampire and Pam\u2019s as dumb as dumb can be. That\u2019s a regular recipe for disaster.\u201d \u201cDorothy,\u201d said Norman. \u201cShut up. We get enough sass from Wes.\u201d \u201cYou  know, Dorothy,\u201d said Salli. \u201cMaybe if you were married...\u201d Dorothy gave an uncontrolled laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re out of your mind if you think I\u2019d marry a human of all things.\u201d Allen, Wes and Norman all glared at Dorothy before Carina butted in. \u201cHELLO!\u201d yelled Carina. \u201cTHERE\u2019S STILL THE MATTER OF THIS THING STUCK TO MY WRIST!\u201d Carina tried to pull the bracelet off but it was on too tight. \u201cDARN IT! THIS SUCKER IS STUCK!\u201d Pam grabbed hold of the bracelet and tried to yank it off but even her strength couldn\u2019t remove it. Salli and Patty grabbed hold of the bracelet but even the three working together couldn\u2019t pull the bracelet off and fell back, accidentally destroying an empty table in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina groaned as Dorothy walked forward and smirked. \u201cI know how to get that bracelet off.\u201d Carina gave a sigh of relief that quickly turned into a scream of horror as Dorothy took out a meat cleaver from her purse and then brought it down. Carina pulled her hand out of the way as Dorothy\u2019s cleaver hit the table right next to Wes, Allen and Norman. Allen screamed in fear and foamed at the mouth as Norman fainted and Wes clutched his chest. \u201cDorothy, you psycho!\u201d yelled Patty. \u201cYou can\u2019t just chop Carina\u2019s hand off!\u201d Dorothy just let out a sigh. \u201cI was just trying to help.\u201d Everyone around stared at Dorothy in fear and backed away. Carina let out a moan. \u201cPATTY!\u201d she shouted, forcing Patty to plug her ears. \u201cDOESN\u2019T YOUR MOM KNOW A WAY TO REMOVE THIS BRACELET!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty gave a snort. \u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure Mom will be able to get this stupid thing off. But she and Dad are on vacation and won\u2019t be back until tonight.\u201d Carina gave a groan and then grabbed herself by the face and shook her head as she grunted and then her butt started to bulge again. At this moment, Pam realized something. \u201cWait a minute. What about the other bracelet?\u201d Salli and Patty\u2019s eyes bulged out and realized that for once, Pam had a valid point. Patty ran into the kitchen just in time to see the bracelet shaking in the air. It would\u2019ve flown off onto somebody else\u2019s wrist, but Patty grabbed it, tossed it in a strongbox and then locked it up tight. \u201cOh no you don\u2019t!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThe last thing that we need is for that thing to attach onto somebody else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Carina was trying to pull her pants up as they were slipping from her growing behind. \u201cPATTY! PAM! SALLI!\u201d Dorothy shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do something about Carina and that bracelet until Neith comes back from vacation.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget that second bracelet locked in the strongbox.\u201d Said Salli. \u201cWell, what do you propose we do?\u201d asked Pam. \u201cWell,\u201d said Patty. \u201cWe have two options. Either we keep Carina and the bracelets here until Mom comes back from vacation or one of us will have to take them both to our place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u2019s the option?</span></div></div>",

We\u2019ll play Rock Paper Scissors to see who has to watch the gorgon and the bracelets.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast time we played Rock Paper Scissors,\u201d said Pam. \u201cWe tied up for hours! That game is broken. We should draw straws.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d said Wes. \u201cWe need all the straws for the drinks.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Dorothy. \u201cI have an idea.\u201d Everyone looked as Dorothy took out four matches and handed a match to Pam, Patty and Salli while holding the last one herself. \u201cThis will decide which one of us keeps Carina out of trouble and hold onto Neith\u2019s bracelets. Whoever gets burned first...\u201d \u201cThat sounds like a bad idea, Dorothy,\u201d said Allen. \u201cSomeone could get hurt.\u201d Salli shook her head up and down as Pam gave an uneasy look.\u201d Carina just rolled her eyes and then lit all four of the matches at once as they begun to burn down. Wes let out a sigh. \u201cJust one normal day,\u201d Wes said to himself. \u201cIs that too much to ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one minute, the flames burn down and the one who ends up stuck with Carina and the bracelets is...</span></div></div>",

Carina didn't like waiting, but she figured that she had no other choice. \"AS LONG AS I'M WAITING,\" said the gorgon. \"I MIGHT AS WELL ORDER SOME DINNER!\" Salli let out a sigh. \"If only Tanya wasn't visiting her sick mother,\" said the elephant giantess. \"Carina could damage somebody else's ears.\" \"AND I'M SICK OF BURGERS AND SUNDAES! I'LL TAKE A PANINI FOR A CHANGE!\" Dorothy gave a smug grin Patty's way. \"It's a good thing that I decided to do you a favor and add panini to the menu.\" Patty gave a snort. \"Don't be smug.\" \"Hmm,\" said Dorothy. \"Come to think about it, we might consider the idea of expanding into other food markets. Perhaps Lapis might be interested in fishing for us full time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli had brought Carina her panini and Carina's snake hair was slowly picking away at the cheese as the gorgon lounged back, her rear knocking over three tables just by sitting down. Pam gave a snort before she Patty handed her a few boxes of pizza. \"Pam,\" said Patty. \"Even with this craziness going on, we still are running a restaurant here. Please be a dear and take these calzones to Memphis.\" \"Why don't you do it? She's your next door neighbor.\" \"Because I have to stay here and do the cooking, remember?\" Norman gave a scoff. \"Come on, Patty. Why don't you deliver the pizzas and Pam handle the kitchen?\" \"Because Pam only knows how to make donuts, Norman,\" said Patty. \"Frankly, I'm not sure how you even survive.\" Pam snorted and then walked off as Carina laid back and watched television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the TV, Esther Tortuga was doing a news report. \"Today, chaos broke out in the supermarket where a trio of masked madmen wearing boxer shorts and thick glasses broke in and stole everything in the Mexican food aisle. Authorities believe this is in response to the discontinuation of the Mal Verde hot sauce. On the way out, the criminals dismantled the smoothie machine at the kiosk and planted dynamite just to make sure. Whoever these villains are, it is clear that they love tacos and hate smoothies. Here we have a witness. Ms. Christina Sweet. Ms. Sweet, can you tell us anything about these dangerous criminals.\" The witness was Christina Sweet, an orange-skinned werecrocodile and chauffeur to Vienna, the gargoyle jazz singer. \"Anybody who likes nachos and tacos can't be all bad. I like to combine them.\" Christina shook her head. \"Personally,\" she said. \"I like my nachos on a pizza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the news report was over, Carina decided to pass the time by playing cards with Patty, Pam, Dorothy and Salli. Norman had climbed up Pam's ear and looked to see Patty's hand, until Wes glared at him. Dorothy tried to use her tail to steal one of Carina's cards but Carina's snakes bit her in the tail and made her grunt in pain. \"THERE SURE ARE A LOT OF CHEATERS IN THIS HOUSE!\" yelled Carina. Wes nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the card game, Carina was passing her time by painting an image on her large behind. \"Where did she get the paint?\" asked Patty. \"It's not paint,\" said Salli. \"It's the mayonnaise, ketchup and mustard we had stockpiled from the kitchen.\" Patty let out a sigh. \"I hope that Mom gets here fast.

This giantess was a 1300ft high minotaur with brown, white and black stripes all over her body that made her resemble a cross between a cow and an okapi. Body shape-wise she was very fat, especially in the stomach and had large buck teeth. She had long gray hair and wore what looked like a bikini that was made of iron with a hole made to fit her udder. The cow woman looked inside and scratched her chin. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said. \u201cI would\u2019ve thought that at least Wes and Patty were in the kitchen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minotaur\u2019s name was Viola Poe and she was Wes, Allen and Norman\u2019s stepmother. Viola for the most part didn\u2019t have any problems with her 3 daughters-in-law, but she had a tendency to come in unannounced and to the brothers\u2019 dismay, she had a habit of putting her snout where it didn\u2019t belong. At that moment, she had left the brothers\u2019 father at the Rainbow Tongue Hotel in Direopolis and went on ahead to visit the boys at work, blissfully unaware of the curse of the bracelets that afflicted Carina. Not one to give up and come back later, the okapi-like minotaur simply walked in through the back door into the kitchen and looked around. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d she said. \u201cNormally they\u2019re not open this late. Huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola noticed the strongbox used to contain the second of Neith\u2019s bracelets and bent over to read a note that Patty left on it. \u201cDo Not Open This Box.\u201d Viola just gave a scoff. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I gotta.\u201d Viola opened up the strongbox and saw Neith\u2019s second bracelet inside. \u201cUgh,\u201d said Viola. \u201cMust be another one of Neith\u2019s tacky pieces of Egyptian jewelry. Hmm.\u201d Viola picked up the bracelet and then put it on her wrist with a laugh as she looked at it in awe. \u201cI must say,\u201d she said. \u201cThis looks less tacky than the rest of her jewel. Guess my daughter-in-law\u2019s mom isn\u2019t as unfashionable as I thought she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Viola grunted and held her stomach. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked the okapi-like minotaur. Viola grunted as her metallic bikini bottom was being stretched out, revealing her brown, white and black striped booty that was getting bigger and bigger. The middle-aged minotaur looked at her growing rear and gave a look of shock before she grunted. \u201cOkay,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat kind of trouble did those stepsons of mine get into now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInto the kitchen walked Salli carrying Wes, Allen and Norman. \u201cAre you sure that Neith\u2019s bracelet is locked up tight, bro?\u201d asked Norman. \u201cPatty had the sense to put it in a strongbox,\u201d said Wes. \u201cShe\u2019s not stupid like Pam, you know.\u201d Allen then spotted Viola. \u201cMom?\u201d he asked. Wes and Norman turned their attention and gasped at Viola under the spell of the bracelet. \u201cGood grief!\u201d yelled Wes. Viola turned her attention to her sons and Salli and grunted as her metal bikini bottom was cracking. \u201cWesley,\u201d she said. \u201cAllen, Norman. What exactly is going on?\u201d Allen and Norman pushed Wes onto the kitchen table as Wes grunted. The oldest of the brothers glared at his younger siblings before he felt his minotaur mother staring down at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes looked nervously and then noticed the strongbox opened. \u201cMom,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me you didn\u2019t open that strongbox. Patty clearly left a note not to do that.\u201d Viola gave an angry snort and crossed her arms as her butt pushed against all of Patty\u2019s frying pans. \u201cWesley Wraith Round,\u201d says the minotaur giantess sternly. \u201cDo not change the subject. My butt is even bigger than Patty\u2019s. At this rate your father won\u2019t remember what my face looks like. You have 60 seconds to explain what made me so big.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the bracelet you put on, Mom!\u201d yelled Wes as the enormous cow glared down at him. \u201cIt\u2019s cursed. Anyone who wears it and isn\u2019t a werehippo like Patty or her mom will get the butt of the werehippo queen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon learning what happened, Viola smacked herself in the face. \u201cDammit.\u201d She grumbled. \u201cSalli?\u201d asked Patty. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on in the kitchen?\u201d \u201cViola\u2019s here, Patty. She put on the other bracelet.\u201d \u201cWhat?! Are you kidding me!? Didn\u2019t she read the warning on the strongbox!?\u201d \u201cYou know our mother-in-law, Patty. She likes to stick her snout where she shouldn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re one to talk about snouts,\u201d said Viola as she grabbed the end of Salli\u2019s trunk and then turned around. \u201cJust look at me.\u201d Viola tapped on her left cheek and made it shake. She then gave a grunt of pain. \u201cMom,\u201d said Allen. \u201cMaybe you should give up on the idea of iron bikinis. It will never catch on.\u201d Viola gave a scoff. \u201cBit your tongue, Allen. I\u2019m not giving up on it.\u201d \u201cYeah, Al,\u201d whispered Norman. \u201cYou know how stubborn Mom can be when it comes to her fashion ideas. Need I bring up the potted palm tree earrings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViola gave a snort before she grunted and begun to wobble. \u201cWhoa, whoa!\u201d The minotaur was quickly losing her balance and her three stepsons looked up at her in fear. \u201cOh no.\u201d Groaned Wes. Before the brothers could react, Viola fell back butt first on top of them and the table and caused it to shatter beneath her enormous weight and the mass of her larger than usual butt. In the main dining room, Carina struggled to stand up before speaking. \u201cWHAT HAPPENED?!\u201d yelled the gorgon in the same boat as Viola. Patty let out a sigh. \u201cLife in Direopolis.\u201d Viola grunted and stood up, her three human stepsons plastered but still alive to her more massive than usual butt cheeks. \u201cGood grief,\u201d muttered Wes. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since this happened.\u201d Norman and Allen both grunted in agreement as their dizzy mother was walking right out the back door to the kitchen, her sons still stuck to her massive fanny. The massive minotaur tore the wall off of the kitchen door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the other room, Patty shook her head and then her cellphone rang. \u201cHello?\u201d asked Patty. \u201cOh, hi Mom. Things just went from bad to worse. Now there are two girls wearing your bracelets and one of them is Viola Poe. Don\u2019t give me that attitude. We need to avert... what. Oh no.\u201d Carina gave a hiss. \u201cWHAT DID SHE SAY?\u201d asked the gorgon giantess. Patty let out a sigh. \u201cMom ate some bad escargot in Paris and can\u2019t make it back tonight.\u201d Carina let out an angry scream and shattered every window in the entire restaurant. Patty let out a sigh. \u201cI REALLY hate Mondays.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Salli and Allen soon gave Carina her order and then served Mia Maza. Mia was a fat wereleopard handiwoman with a mechanical arm. Mia was the main woman Patty, Salli and Pam hired when something was broken. Before Mia could bite into her pizza, she had to cover her ears as Carina was about to speak out. \"NOW THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!\" The loud mouth gorgon dug into her fries and then took a bite into her burger before her hair devoured it as well and she went back to her fries. However, after Mia ate her fries and her burger, she was ready for her sundae. As she held up the sundae, she saw one of the strange bracelets. \u201cEH!?\u201d Suddenly, the bracelet begun to twitch. Salli turned her head and gasped. \u201cHey,\u201d said Allen. \u201cIsn\u2019t that one of Neith\u2019s bracelets?\u201d \u201cIt is!\u201d yelled Salli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the bracelet flew onto Carina\u2019s wrist and made her grunt before it suddenly tightened and shrank on her wrist. \u201cWHAT THE!?\u201d Patty, Pam, Norman and Wes heard the commotion and ran out. \u201cWhat happened?!\u201d asked Patty. \u201cPatty!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cOne of you mom\u2019s bracelets flew onto Carina\u2019s wrist.\u201d \u201cOh no.\u201d Muttered Patty. Suddenly, Carina heard a stretching sound and looked back to see that her butt was getting bigger. \u201cWHAT\u2019S THIS!? WHAT HAPPENED!?\u201d Carina\u2019s already massive butt got so big that the chair beneath her broke and she landed on the floor with a loud thump and caused it to crack while at the same time, tore apart Carina\u2019s pants. Carina\u2019s butt was now even larger than Patty\u2019s own massive rear.\u201d \u201cWhoa!\u201d yelled Norman in shock. Pam even dropped her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWes was so surprised that Patty had to keep him from dropping his glasses. \u201cWhat just happened?!\u201d yelled Allen as he hid behind Salli\u2019s ear. \u201cCarina\u2019s butt just blew up! It makes Patty\u2019s look small.\u201d \u201cLike I said,\u201d said Patty. \u201cThese bracelets are only meant to be worn by a werehippo. Any other type of monster who wears them with be forced to compromise because the manacles give them the body shape of a werehippo, that is to say...\u201d Patty slapped her enormous rear just to accentuate her point. \u201cWait,\u201d said Salli. \u201cYou mean to tell me that whoever wears the manacles gets a butt as big as yours or Neith\u2019s? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d Norman let out a scoff. \u201cAll we have to do is pull that sucker off.\u201d Pam gave a snort and grabbed hold of the bracelet and tried to tug it with all her might but it wasn\u2019t budging. Norman ran down his wife\u2019s hand and then tugged as well but still nothing worked. \u201cDang,\u201d said Pam. \u201cThat thing is stuck tight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Mia rolled her eyes and then pulled on Salli\u2019s tail. As Salli turned around, Mia handed her a crowbar. \u201cOh,\u201d said Salli. \u201cThanks Mia.\u201d However, as Salli tried to pry off Carina with the crowbar, all it succeeded in doing was making Carina scream. \u201cSALLI! YOU CRAZY ELEPHANT! ARE YOU TRYING TO TAKE MY HAND OFF! OW! OW! OW! OW! OW! BE CAREFUL WITH THAT THING!\u201d Salli kept trying to pry off the bracelet, but all this succeeded in doing was bending the crowbar. \u201cForsooth.\u201d Muttered Salli. Wes let out a sigh. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem. We just need a stronger monster. Where\u2019s Perry?\u201d Wes was referring to Perry Hart, a bright green-furred and winged deer-like monster called a peryton. She was only a teenager but was strong enough to lift Salli, Patty and Pam with only one hand. Wes was hoping that Perry could potentially pull off the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck with that,\u201d said Mia as she swallowed another piece of pizza. \u201cPerry and her folks left a few days ago on vacation to Neo-Atlantis.\u201d \u201c****!\u201d yelled Wes. Carina got up and let out a yell. \u201cWELL THAT\u2019S JUST GREAT! IF NOBODY HERE KNOWS HOW TO FIX THIS, I\u2019LL JUST HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM MYSELF!\u201d Carina stomped away, accidentally knocking down five tables with her large butt, one of which had a glass of soda in it that shattered on the ground. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cYou didn\u2019t pay! Come back here!\u201d Carina turned her head and stuck out her tongue as her hair hissed at Salli, Patty and Pam. But then she let out a grunt. As the gorgon giantess attempted to walk out the front door, her ginormous butt got stuck and she couldn\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Carina grumbled and tried to get out of that hole, but she was completely immobilized. \u201cWELL NOBODY JUST STAND THERE! COME AND HELP ME! GET ME OUT OF HERE!\u201d Patty let out a sigh and gestured to Mia. \u201cMia,\u201d said Patty. \u201cCould you...\u201d \u201cDo you even have to ask?\u201d asked Mia.</span></div></div>",

As Mia and Patty were discussing financial information, Carina waddled out, slouching because of how much her much larger butt was putting her off balance. \u201cI CAN\u2019T WAIT FOR WEEKS BEFORE SOME OLD LADY HIPPOPOTAMUS COMES AND REMOVES THESE MANACLES!

Perhaps she had some spell or medicine or ritual that could be used to remove the bracelet stuck on Carina\u2019s wrist. But she was also referring to Trini Howler-Grunewald, a saber tooth tiger giantess who worked as an inventor, albeit a bungling one. It was the more risky option, but perhaps Trini knew of a way to remove the bracelet through science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028So who does Carina ultimately decide to visit?</span></div></div>",

I'LL BET THAT MAD SCIENTIST CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS STUPID BRACELET OFF MY HAND! IT'S TIME I PAID THAT PREHISTORIC FELINE A LITTLE VISIT!\" Carina ran as fast as she could with her large butt weighing her down and pushed a few monsters to the side in the process. She passed by two monster girls in particular in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one she passed was Lapis Collins, an obese 1450ft and very bottom heavy Loch Ness monster woman with blue-skin, teal spots and a cream-colored belly. She was a fisher by trade and was on her way to sell what she had caught. Of course, all she caught that day was one giant lobster she was holding by the tail in one hand. \"What a terrible day,\" said Lapis. \"All I caught at the lake was one crummy lobster. The fish are getting smarter. The saddest part. This is one more crustacean caught in my fishing net today than the men I caught on the Internet.\" Lapis let out a groan right before she was pushed to the side by Carina. \"OUT OF MY ****ING WAY!\" By bumping into Lapis, Carina caused Lapis to drop her lobster, causing it to nip her tail as she screamed in pain. \"Ouch! Watch where <i>you're</i> going, you ****ing gorgon! What a butt on her. I'm glad I don't have a really big ginormous ass like that.\" Lapis was also oblivious to how morbidly obese she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second girl that Carina was about to approach was Esther Tortuga. Eshter was a giant turquoise-skinned snapping turtle-based kappa with burgundy hair worn in a bun and a dark yellow colored spiked shell. She was a news reporter who was currently on break and opening a box of pizza she ordered from Neo Neapolitan. \"Ah,\" said Eshter as she held up a slice. \"One of my all time very pizzas,  Strawberry and spaghetti. Yum.\" Eshter was well known for having bizarre taste in food, especially when it came to pizza. Patty was forced to experiment when serving the turtle giantess her pizza. However, before Eshter could take a bite, Carina knocked her on her shell and caused the pizza to hit her in the face. \"ONE SIDE!\" Esther grunted as she tried to get back on her feet. \"Sometimes,\" she grumbled. \"I <i>hate</i> being a turtle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina soon managed to reach Trini's house. It wasn't hard to miss with the automated doors, satellite dishes and sand sculptures preserved in tubes to protect them from air. The last part was the work of Trini's wife, Crescent Howler, a large and chubby blonde-haired and blue-furred LOS-inflicted werewolf with her hair and fur worn in a poodle cut that made her look like a weresheep. Carina ran to Trini's door while nearby, Crescent was working on a sand sculpture of a leaf-tailed gecko werelizard with devil's horns and wings and was almost finished when Carina yelled and caused the sculpture to collapse. \"HEY TRINI! GET YOUR FANGS RIGHT OUT OF HERE! I NEED YOUR HELP, RIGHT NOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>BOOM!!!!{/b</b></font>}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina's shouting had triggered an explosion on the inside of Trini's lab. Trini walked out covered in soot with her lab coat in tatters. Trini was a gigantic and obese pear-shaped saber toothed tigress with bright yellow fur and long black hair and she let out a cough as she came out. \"Crescent,\" she said. \"Please add nitro glycerin to the grocery list. What do you want, Carina? You just ruined my experiment.\" Carina then slapped her butt cheeks and glare. \"HEY!\" yelled the gorgon. \"DO YOU NEED GLASSES!? HAVE YOU NOTICE THAT MY BUTT IS THE SIZE OF A CAR!\" \"Huh,\" said Trini. \"How did this happen?\" \"IT WAS THIS BRACELET!\" yelled Carina as she showed Trini the bracelet. \"PATTY'S MOM LEFT IT BEHIND AND ANY GIRL WHO WEARS IT AND ISN'T A WEREHIPPO GETS A GINORMOUS, REALLY BIG BUTT! I NEED YOU TO FIX THIS! FIND SOME WAY TO GET THIS BRACELET OFF!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini just gave a stare and spanked her own rather fat butt. \"Do I <i>look</i> like somebody who knows anything about butt shrinking?\" Carina's snake hair hissed and Trini let out a groan. \"Wait right here,\" said Trini. \"I've got just the thing.\" Carina enters the laboratory and sees all sorts of strange gadgets laying all around, some of which were broken remains of failed experiments, such as the robot Trini built to do the grocery shopping that was undergoing repairs. It wasn't long before Trini showed Carina....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>... a giant electromagnet. The magnet was bigger than a car and was half blue on one side and half red on the other. It even looked like it had mechanical veins. \"WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?\" asked Carina. Trini gave a smile. \"This is an electromagnet I created in order to save Crescent a trip to the beach to collect sand for her sculptures. And to get all the junk out of it that people bury. Of course, I had to do some tweaking to it. The UFO vacuums I built blew up. Hopefully, my magnet can get that bracelet off of you in no time.\" Carina gave a scoff. \"HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS STUPID THING IS EVEN MAGNETIC?!\" Trini shrugged her shoulders as she prepared to hit the switch. \"Well,\" she said. \"We're about to find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrini turned on the electromagnet and it made a loud humming noise before it sparked and begun to pull. Carina let out a yell because the hippo queen bracelet on her wrist was throbbing and twitching. \u201cHEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!\u201d Carina yelled as the magnet indeed pulled on the bracelet and moved it towards itself. However, it moved Carina forward with her still attached to the bracelet. \u201cOh dear.\u201d Moaned Trini. The magnet was attracting everything metal towards itself, including Trini\u2019s grocery shopping robot, several wrenches, hammers and frying pans and even the toaster from Trini and Crescent\u2019s kitchen, that hit Carina square in the cheeks and made her grunt. \u201cTURN OFF THE MAGNET! TURN OFF THE MAGNET! IT\u2019S NOT WORKING!\u201d Trini grit her teeth. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Trini. \u201cIt will stay this way for 20 more minutes.\u201d \u201cDIDN\u2019T YOU PUT AN OFF SWITCH ON THIS DAMN THING?!\u201d Trini blushed and twitched her fingers. \u201cI forgot.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe electromagnet\u2019s power unfortunately was leaking out of Trini\u2019s laboratory. At that moment back at Neo Neapolitan, Patty, Salli and Pam had brought out a strong box and placed the second hippo queen bracelet inside. \u201cThere,\u201d said Patty. \u201cThis way, nobody else will end up in the same boat as Carina.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d said Pam. \u201cAre those bracelets why your mom\u2019s so big?\u201d Patty gave a glare. \u201cNo, you idiot,\u201d said Patty. \u201cShe has a large butt because she\u2019s a werehippopotamus. These bracelets just assume everybody who wears them is a werehippo and makes their butt big enough to pass as one.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Carina only wore one of these bracelets then,\u201d said Salli. \u201cHopefully Neith will know how to go it off.\u201d Patty took out a padlock and put it on the strongbox. \u201cBut I\u2019m not taking any chances. This other bracelet is going under lock and key if I have anything to say about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Patty could turn the key, it flew out of her hand. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Wes. Allen then let out a scream. \u201cDuck!\u201d The girls ducked as all of Salli\u2019s knives, forks and spoons flew out of the drawer. \u201cWhat the... ack?!\u201d yelled Patty. Patty held her throat as her tongue was forced out of her mouth. The electromagnet was affecting her tongue piercing. Wes tried to hold onto his wife but then yelled because his glasses were yanked off by the magnet\u2019s pull. Salli then screamed in pain because the electromagnet was tugging on her earrings. Pam (the only one of the trio to not regularly wear jewelry) was laughing at the scene and so was Norman, until the magnet pulled off the latter\u2019s belt buckle. \u201cIt looks like Trini\u2019s electromagnet is on the futz again.\u201d Said Salli. Patty grunted as she held her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dining area, several chairs were pulled out the door and Mia, who was enjoying a pizza at the time, suddenly grunted because her mechanical right arm was acting up and being pulled by the magnet. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d yelled the wereleopard giantess as she tried to hold her arm. But Mia let out a meow of distress as she was pulled right out the front door. Of course, this was far from the least of their problems because the magnet pulled the lock off of the strongbox and the bracelet flew out. \u201cOh no!\u201d yelled Wes as he squinted. \u201cThe bracelet!\u201d \u201cWe need to stop it before it lands on somebody else.\u201d Said Salli. Salli floated in the air as Pam flapped her wings and oinked as she followed after Salli. Patty ran after the two of them, but found it hard to keep up due to hippos not being as fast as winged pigs or vampire elephants. \u201cJust my luck,\u201d thought Wes to himself. \u201cI married the only one who can\u2019t fly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bracelet was pulled through town, there were three more people in the way. First of them was Lapis who had just sold the lobster she caught to the supermarket and placed the money away in her cleavage. The loch ness giantess checked her profile on her dating website with her phone and found nothing, giving a sad look. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m going at this the wrong way. Maybe I should cast my net in different waters.\u201d Before Lapis could do anything else, her fishing rod flew out of her hand due to the magnetic pull. \u201cHey!\u201d she shouted. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead, Esther was driving down the street in her news van when suddenly the van started to move more slowly. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked he kappa news reporter. \u201cWhat the?\u201d Esther kept stepping on the gas but the van was caught in the way of the magnet and was pulled in the path. Esther tried to turn off the van, but after doing so, her car keys were sucked in the vortex and she tried to chase after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, coming home from the grocery store was Crescent and she grunted as felt herself being pulled by the magnetic ray as she dropped her groceries. Her mithril bra was caught in the magnet\u2019s pull. Unlike Esther and Lapis, however, Crescent knew exactly what was going on and growled in annoyance. \u201cTrini\u2019s stupid electromagnet,\u201d she complained. \u201cI thought I told that wife of mine to dismantle that thing! Whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Trini\u2019s lab, all the metal in the vicinity had stuck to Carina\u2019s butt. \u201cHOW MUCH LONGER!?\u201d yelled Carina in despair. \u201cNot long,\u201d said Trini. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d However, as the front door was pulled out of the wall by the beam, it was shown that in the confusion, somebody else got stuck with the second bracelet and was being pulled in fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028But who?</span></div></div>",

Salli flew above holding up her umbrella and trumpeted. \u201cEsther,\u201d she said. \u201cTake that off!\u201d Esther grunted and tried to remove the bracelet but it was getting her nowhere. Suddenly, the kappa giantess grunted. \u201cOh,\u201d she groaned. \u201cMy aching back. It feels like my shell is going to shatter. Oh!\u201d Eshter\u2019s turquoise cheeks were expanding at a rapid rate as the magnetic force on the bracelet pulled her towards Trini\u2019s laboratory. Esther looked back at her growing behind and dropped her jaw. \u201cHoly Foot!\u201d she yelled. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Salli!?\u201d Salli gave a groan. \u201cThose are the bracelets of the hippo queen who was an ancestor of Patty and Neith. Put them on and you\u2019ll get a werehippo\u2019s...\u201d \u201cAstounding!\u201d yelled Esther. \u201cI wish this was on camera. Whoa!\u201d Esther was pulled into the air as her butt quickly grew bigger than her shell. Salli and Pam flew after her as Patty stopped to catch her breath. \u201cI\u2019m out of shape.\u201d Groaned the werehippo giantess. \u201cHuh,\u201d said Wes. \u201cCleopatra ROUND is out of shape.\u201d \u201cShut up, Wes!\u201d yelled Patty to her husband.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Howler-Grunewald laboratory, Trini\u2019s electromagnet was short-circuiting and even caught on fire. \u201cUh-oh.\u201d Said the sabertooth. Carina gave a gulp and bit her lip. \u201cARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THAT THING IS MALFUNCTIONING!? I SHOULD\u2019VE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO GO TO A MAD SCIENTIST WITH MY BUTT PROBLEM! AND NOT A PARTICULARLY COMPETENT ONE! OH NO!\u201d Trini bit her lip. \u201cDon\u2019t panic, Carina,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m certain that this will all blow over soon enough.\u201d But then there was a crash and the Channel 6 news van crashed right through the wall of Trini\u2019s laboratory. \u201cWhat the!?\u201d yelled the tigress. There was a yelling noise because Esther came crashing in next and flattened both Trini\u2019s door and the news van in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw.\u201d Groaned the kappa giantess. Then she yelled because the van was destroyed underneath her. \u201cOh no. I know a certain bigmouth who isn\u2019t going to enjoy this.\u201d Esther stood up with the van plastered like a thong. She looked back and saw her butt was so big that it looked like her shell was little more than a hard backpack that appeared to be bending due to the massive turquoise, turtle booty. She even pinched one of her cheeks with her eyes popped out. \u201cOh my. This is going to make the 6 o\u2019clock news tonight. I can see it now. Channel 6 reporter\u2019s butt expands to the size of a zeppelin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Carina grunted and Esther saw that hers and Carina\u2019s booties were the same size. They both blinked and Carina\u2019s snake hair hissed. \u201cMust be something about cold blooded girls. Esther and Carina even bumped their butts against each other\u2019s as Trini scratched her head. \u201cMy,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is an odd case. Maybe I should see if my sonic can-opener can do a better job. Carina smacked Trini to the side with her butt as the tigress grunted. \u201cOH, HECK NO!\u201d yelled Carina. \u201cAFTER WHAT THAT STUPID, DUMB, IDIOT MAGNET OF YOURS DID, THERE\u2019S NO WAY I\u2019M LETTING YOUR GOOFY GADGETS INFLICT ANY MORE HARM ON MY PERSON! NO THANK YOU!\u201d Both Salli and Pam came in and saw both reptilian giantesses with their massive behinds. \u201cOh no.\u201d Groaned Salli. Allen even fainted into Salli\u2019s cleavage as he saw what happened. \u201cWell this escalated quickly.\u201d Said Norman with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh boy,\u201d grunted Esther. \u201cWait\u2019ll I put this story on the news.\u201d Carina gave a glare as Esther looked around. \u201cTrini,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a camera handy? I kind of sat on the one that I had.\u201d Carina grumbled as Trini went to get her video camera. \u201cI\u2019M SUFFERING HERE, AND SHE WANTS TO BROADCAST IT ON THE TELLY?!\u201d At that moment, Patty finally came in and was huffing and puffing. \u201cEither I need to work out on the treadmill more, or take ****ing driver\u2019s ed. It must be nice to be able to fly.\u201d Wes then noticed Esther\u2019s large rear and pointed to it as Patty let out a groan. \u201cOne normal day,\u201d grunted the pink hippopotamus giantess. \u201cJust one normal day. Is that too much to ask?\u201d Esther used Trini\u2019s video camera to record footage of hers and Carina\u2019s rears. \u201cGood afternoon, Direopolis. This is Esther Tortuga, Channel 6 news bringing you a rather strange report, even by our town\u2019s standards. Esther focused the camera on Carina who gave a sour look. \u201cLocal punk rocker and noise polluter, Carina Veldarez has found herself in a strange situation. Her rainbow scaled rear has expanded larger than herself due to a rather mysterious peace of jewelry. Any comments, Ms. Veldarez.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina gave a hiss. \u201cNONE THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TELEVISION, YOU OVERGROWN TURTLE!\u201d Esther ignored Carina\u2019s rude comment before showing off her own bracelet. \u201cThis reporter herself has fallen under a similar curse. Here we have the owner of this strange bracelets, Cleopatra Round. Mrs. Round, what can you tell me about this strange jewelry.\u201d Patty let out a groan. \u201cFirst of all, they\u2019re not my bracelets. They\u2019re my mother\u2019s. Second of all, those bracelets are really dangerous. 3000 years ago, they belonged to the werehippo queen, Tuntepsut. There\u2019s a cursed placed on these bracelets that anyone who wears them but isn\u2019t a werehippo will develop the figure of a werehippo. We accidentally served Carina one bracelet in a sundae and tried to keep the other bracelet under control but we didn\u2019t count on electromagnets.\u201d \u201cInteresting. Now, Patty, what would happen if somebody put both bracelets on at once.\u201d Patty dropped her jaw in horror. \u201cI don\u2019t know and I wouldn\u2019t want to find out. Besides, Mom is the only one who knows how to get those things off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Esther nodded her head. \u201cThere you have it. Direopolis has faced many curses from many mummies but this one takes the cake. You heard it here first on Channel 6 news.\u201d Patty let out a groan and slapped herself in the face. \u201cLook on the bright side, Patty,\u201d said Pam. \u201cAt least we were on TV.\u201d Patty stared at Salli who promptly used her trunk to slap Pam in the face. \u201cWhat next?\u201d asked Patty. \u201cWhat more could happen?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The only mummy in Direopolis is an Aztec mummy, so it must be Patty\u2019s. Whoa!\u201d Before Crescent could further analyze the bracelet, the pull of Trini\u2019s electromagnet pulled on both the bracelet and Crescent\u2019s mithril bra. Crescent tried to fight the pull but screamed because it pulled off her glasses in the process. \u201cOh no!\u201d As Crescent was pulled by her wife\u2019s crazy invention, she failed to notice that her butt was instantly getting bigger and bigger to the point where it was as big as her breasts. Her steampunk-style dress was only covering her groin at this point and her titanium panties were clearly visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrescent gave a growl as she got on all fours and held her expanding butt in the air. \u201cThat\u2019s weird,\u201d muttered the poodle-like werewolf. \u201cMy butt is feeling heavier. But it can\u2019t be the magnet. These are Trini\u2019s bulletproof titanium panties. Titanium isn\u2019t magnetic is it.\u201d Salli and Pam flew down and saw Crescent wearing the bracelet. \u201cOh no!\u201d yelled Allen. \u201cCrescent\u2019s got the bracelet!\u201d Crescent looked at the bracelet in confusion and then looked at her butt in surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve been hanging around Trini too long,\u201d said the werewolf girl. \u201cI\u2019m getting as pear-shaped as her. Even Cousin April isn\u2019t this bottom heavy. Whoa!\u201d Crescent tried to grab a street lamp as the magnet pulled on her bra and Neith\u2019s bracelet on her wrist. \u201cPam! Salli! What\u2019s going on?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli flew down and trumpeted before wrapping her trunk around Crescent\u2019s arm, hoping she\u2019d be heavy enough to act as an anchor. \u201cFirst of all,\u201d said Norman. \u201cTrini actually built bulletproof underwear? That\u2019s weird even for her. Second of all, those are Neith\u2019s bracelets that belonged to a werehippo queen.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me,\u201d muttered Crescent. \u201cThis is why Carina\u2019s butt was huger than usual. Now mine is going to be just as big.\u201d Crescent\u2019s butt got bigger and was bending the street lamp. The wolfess let go and was being dragged in the magnetic pull by the bracelet on her wrist as her butt dragged across the ground. Salli and Pam each grabbed one of Crescent\u2019s legs and tried to anchor the wolf but they were pulled as well. At that moment, the electromagnet finally tore off Salli\u2019s earrings and made her scream in pain as she let go. She leaned back into Pam and both the loxodon vampiress and winged wereboar yelled as Allan and Norman were knocked off their shoulders. \u201cWhoa!\u201d Both giantesses landed butt first on their respective husbands and both Allan and Norman grunted as they were flattened. Fortunately, their bodies were strong enough for them to survive such an experience. \u201cNow I know how tattoos feel.\u201d Mumbled Norman as Pam got up.<br>\r\n\u2028Crescent at the time was being pulled back home as she crossed her arms and looked back at her massive butt that was now taller than she was. \u201cI wonder if other mad scientists\u2019 wives have to put up with this minotaur... ouch!\u201d Crescent grunted as she was hit in the face with a flying license plate as she was heading towards her place. Inside at the time, the electromagnetic\u2019s pull was weakening and Carina was grumbling due to the metal that was being stuck to her. \u201cIS THAT STUPID MACHINE OFF YET!\u201d Trini checked the meter on the electromagnet and rubbed her chin. \u201cIt should be turning off any minute.\u201d Suddenly there was a crash. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Trini. \u201cTrini!\u201d yelled Crescent\u2019s voice. \u201cCrescent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Trini could say another word or turn her head, Crescent came barreling in and crashed butt first into Carina as they both grunted. The gorgon turned her head, pens stuck to it from the magnet and her snakes hissed as they took a look at Crescent. The werewolf\u2019s butt was now just as big as the gorgon\u2019s enormous behind and they both bit their lips as they looked at each other. \u201cWHAT THE HECK!?\u201d yelled Carina. Crescent grunted as she put her feet on the ground and then she realized something. \u201cWhere\u2019s Trini?\u201d she asked. Crescent heard a muffled shout that came from between hers and Carina\u2019s butt. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Crescent. Crescent grunted and shook, taking two whole minutes just to sit up and looked back to see that Trini was flattened like a tattoo on her massive butt with an expression of pure shock on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrini!\u201d yelled Crescent to her flattened wife. \u201cSpeak to me!\u201d Trini groaned and managed to pull herself from behind stuck to her wife\u2019s massive booty. Crescent then took out her spare pair of glasses from her cleavage and then grunted as Trini felt all around her massive butt. \u201cMy,\u201d said Trini. \u201cThis is an odd case.\u201d Crescent let out a sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I flattened you, Honey. Oh geez. If I didn\u2019t have enough problems with Lactose Overload Syndrome. Now I have to deal with a giant butt.\u201d \u201cHEY! HEY! HEY!\u201d shouted Carine. \u201cHOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL!\u201d Trini turned to Carina, all while stroking Crescent\u2019s butt. \u201cNow, now, Carina. If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try again. The electromagnet didn\u2019t work so perhaps if we tried another approach. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, Trini,\u201d said Crescent. \u201cNo more experiments for today. I've gone through enough already. I don\u2019t think this is a scab that should be picked.\" Crescent then slapped her right butt cheek and let out a moan. \"We're going to need a bigger bed, Trini.\" Trini nodded her head and then took out her notebook. \"Things to invent... Gum-Gum Mattress. I'll work on that right after I've finished the jogging machine for nagas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina then let out a grunt. \"AREN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING, TRINI!? LOOK AT ME! SOON, MY BUTT IS GOING TO BECOME TOO BIG FOR ME TO SO MUCH AS MOVE AN INCH! IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THIS BRACELET OFF AND STOP ME FROM GETTING ANY BIGGER, THEN YOU COULD AT LEAST MAKE THAT EGGHEAD OF YOURS USEFUL AND BUILD ME A WAY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE WITH THESE TWO DINOSAUR DESTROYING ASTEROIDS STUCK TO THE BOTTOM OF MY BACK!\" Crescent gave a growl at Carina like a rabid dog. \"Would you shut up, Carina!? I'm near-sighted, I have LOS and now my butt is big enough to be used as a wrecking ball. The last thing I need is to have permanent hearing damage.\" Trini rubbed Crescent's backside as she tried to come up with an idea on what to do next before something hit her. \"I have an idea, Carina. Why don\u2019t you stay the night? We can try to get these bracelets off tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Carina could say another word on the matter....</span></div></div>",

Of all the things that I don't need right... ow!\" Lapis yelled in pain because the magnet caused her tackle box to fly open and all of her fishhooks were stuck to her big butt. As Lapis held onto her fishing rod with one hand, she used the other hand to pick fish hooks out of her red-violet and black unitard, shredding the bottom of it and revealing the bottom of another unitard that was colored black on one side and green on the other side. \"Ouch!\" yelled Lapis. \"I gotta use blunter hooks. Ouch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Neith's second bracelet flew onto Lapis's wrist and the sea monster giantess found her wrist twitching. \"Oh no!\" yelled the fisherwoman. \"Ack!\" The bracket tightened on her wrist and Lapis found herself being pulled by Trini's electromagnet. \"Carp! Carp! Carp! Carp!\" grunted Lapis as she was running against her will towards Trini's lab. \"Oh no!\" Since the bracelet was stuck on Lapis's wrist, her butt was expanding at a rapid rate just like Carina's own monstrously large and still growing posterior. However, Lapis was numb in her butt because her occupation as a fisherwoman usually left her sitting all day in the cold. When she initially put on weight by stuffing herself with donuts, she was oblivious to how big her butt was and still was to this day. But while her butt was enormous even before the bracelet hit. In seconds, it was one head taller than she was, including her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli and Pam flew forward and saw what was going on and Salli trumpeted loudly. \"Oh no!\" she yelled. \"Lapis has the bracelet on!\" Pam gave a squeal and flew down, landing feet first on Lapis's rear as the magnet pulled on the bracelet. \"Lapis!\" yelled Pam. \"Get rid of that bracelet!\" Lapis gave a glare as her red-violet unitard was shredded to pieces and she was stuck in her green and black under-unitard. \"You think I wouldn't if I could?\" asked the Loch Ness woman. \"This thing's stuck tight like a lobster's claw. I catch lobsters for a living so I think I know what I'm talking about. Whoa!\" Lapis was pulled further and caused Pam to fall off of her as Norman fell off of Pam's shoulder and was forced to grab Lapis's short and stubby tail, pressing his feet against the water giantess's butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty finally caught up to her sisters-in-laws and panted as she held her chest from running so much. Since she couldn't fly like Pam or Salli or even drive, it took some effort for her to run down the street. \"I'm out of shape,\" muttered the hippopotamus giantess to herself. \"Wes, remind me to take my laundry off of the treadmill when I get home.\" Wes nodded his head. \"Promise me you'll wear the Pack uniform when you run.\" \"Patty,\" said Allen. \"Norman is stuck to Lapis's tail and the bracelet is stuck to Lapis.\" Patty let out a groan and then slapped herself in the front of her snout. \"Of course it did. Damn jewelry.\"  Salli gave a trumpet. \"Since's heading to Trini's lab!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapis kept on involuntarily running to Trini's lab just as Crescent was walking towards the laboratory, steamed and holding onto her mithril bra to keep it from flying off. \"When I get my hands on that sabertooth,\" muttered Crescent complaining about her wife's insane contraptions. \"I'm going to...!! Huh?\" Crescent turned her head and saw Lapis coming up to her. \"Oh no.\" She grumbled.  \"CRASH!\" Lapis had ran into Crescent and her massive booty knocked the werewolf woman into the air, causing her to land breasts first into a shopping cart that was also dragged by the magnet. Crescent growled as she struggled to free herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Trini's lab at the time, the magnet was weakening and Carina held her wrist in pain. Her butt was still as big as ever and the bracelet was not going to come off anytime soon. \u201cTRINI!\u201d shouted Carina. \u201cGET ME OFF THIS CRAZY THING! IT AIN\u2019T WORKING!\u201d Trini smiled nervously. \u201cLike I said, Carina,\u201d said the sabertooth tiger giantess. \u201cThe magnet has to wear off on its....\u201d \u201cTHUNK!\u201d Trini and Carina turned their heads and saw Lapis stuck in the door and wearing the second hippo queen bracelet. Lapis gave a grumble as she was stuck. \u201cLapis?\u201d asked Trini. There was another crashing noise and outside, Crescent\u2019s shopping cart had crashed into Lapis\u2019s massive ass and Crescent fell out as Norman fell and landed in the wolf woman\u2019s cleavage. \u201cOh no.\u201d said Norman right as he sunk into the depths and Crescent got up. \u201cTrini Leary Howler-Grunewald!\u201d yelled the wolf woman to her wife. \u201cI\u2019m going to... huh?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLapis\u2019s massive Loch Ness monster behind had taken up the entire doorway and then some. \u201cOh no,\u201d said Crescent. \u201cTrini. What happened now?\u201d Trini walked up to Lapis\u2019s head as the fisherwoman Loch Ness Monster gave a glare. \u201cWell,\u201d said Trini. \u201cI\u2019d say Lapis is stuck in our front door.\u201d Lapis gave a scoff. \u201cTrini,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not fat like you are.\u201d Carina gave a scoff. \u201cYOU\u2019RE MORBIDLY OBESE, YOU STUPID CRYPTID! YOU WERE MORBIDLY OBESE EVEN BEFORE THAT BRACELET MADE YOUR BUTT EVEN MORE GINORMOUS THAN IT ALREADY IS! I DON\u2019T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS FOOLISHNESS! I\u2019M GETTING OUT OF HERE! OOF! HEY! WHAT HAPPENED!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina foolishly tried to exit through the back door but her butt got stuck in the way and Trini had to walk up and feel the massive gorgon booty and poke it. \u201cHmm. This is an odd situation. Especially considering these are the only two doors in the house that lead to the outside and they\u2019re both plugged. Hmmm.\u201d Carina and Lapis both let out a groan. \"OF ALL THE STUPIDITY!\" groaned Carina. \"WHY DID I DO THAT!? WHY DID I DO THAT?!\" \u201cWell,\u201d said Lapis. \u201cYou had better get me out of here fast. I have fish to fry. Literally.\u201d Crescent let out a sigh as she reaches into her cleavage and then grabs Norman, to her surprise. \u201cNorman?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat are you doing in my cleavage? Pam will skin you alive.\u201d Norman let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d Crescent reached into her cleavage again to take out her cell phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carina decided that since the bracelet on her wrist was magic, then it would be a good idea to fight fire with fire. Namely, she decided to look to Una Pride, a 1000ft tall Nemean Lion witch doctor. Una was very apple-shaped with indigo colored fur and gold and auburn-colored hair that was worn in a beehive hairdo that ended in a ponytail. For clothing, she wore a bikini made out of the skeletons of dinosaurs. At that moment, Una was humming ancient and mystical gibberish as she was drawing a strange circle in the ground. Carina was about to shout and interrupt the lioness but Una held out her hand and stopped her. \u201cI know why you have come.\u201d Said Una. Carina was about to speak but Una placed a seal over Carina\u2019s mouth to stop her from saying anything in her decidedly non-indoor voice, prompting Una to let out muffled yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUna looked at the Egyptian-style bracelet around Carina\u2019s wrist and then nodded her head. \u201cThis is the bracelet of Queen Tontepsut, the werehippopotamus monarch of millennia past to whom Cleopatra Round is related to through blood. I heard that the queen\u2019s mummified remains were just added to the new Egyptian wing of the Direopolis museum. Rather fascinating. The curse of the bracelets state that only werehippos may wear them and any other monster will develop the physique of a werehippo.\u201d Carina glared at Una and continued to mumble. \u201cI can understand your intentions,\u201d said Una. \u201cYou want me to remove the bracelet. Allow me to finish the preparations and I will be able to take it off.\u201d Carina rolled her eyes and took a seat that overflowed Una\u2019s couch before she watched as Una walked up to her refrigerator and took out several ingredients necessary for her spell. \u201cThe scales of a 100-year-old naga,\u201d said Una. \u201cGraveyard mold from the queen\u2019s sarcophagus, an unfertilized pterodactyl egg and finally, the tears of a Nile crocodile.\u201d Una mixed the ingredients together until they turned into a thick fog and then she took out a brush to paint the inside of the circle as she hummed to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Una and Carina were dealing with the first bracelet, Patty was walking towards her own house with the second bracelet. She was carrying it in her cleavage to make sure nobody could pull it out as Wes was sitting on her right ear. \u201cDoesn\u2019t your mom own any jewelry that\u2019s not cursed?\u201d asked Wes to his hippopotamus wife. \u201cMost ancient Egyptian jewelry is cursed, Wes,\u201d said Patty. \u201cIt\u2019s a security measure.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Wes. \u201cWhat if we returned the bracelets to the hippo queen. Her remains are on display in the museum.\u201d \u201cNo way,\u201d said Patty. \u201cThese bracelets are a family heirloom. Mom would flay me if I got rid of them.\u201d As Patty and Wes were walking down the street, three of Neo Neapolitan\u2019s customers passed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first was the elderly yet large-bellied 785ft tall werecheetah, Gardenia Vile who decided to give Patty her own opinion on the bracelet. \u201cIf I were you, Patty,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cI would place that bracelet somewhere where a thief wouldn\u2019t get to it.\u201d Wes gave a glare at Gardenia but Patty was more civil. \u201cWhere would you recommend it?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cCertainly not the refrigerator. I heard that 50 years ago, somebody tried placing a diamond in the freezer to hide it and the thief still wound up stealing it by accident by swallowing it.\u201d \u201cAre you saying that I hide it in the bathroom? Because my mother-in-law keeps a jewelry box hidden under the bathroom sink.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s also problematic,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cNot all burglars can hold it in. And don\u2019t even think about burying it. The new dirt would raise suspicion. I\u2019d recommend hiding the treasure in the fireplace.\u201d \u201cThanks, Gardenia,\u201d said Patty. \u201cYou\u2019re a big help.\u201d However, Wes just gave a suspicious look at Gardenia as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s just telling you where to hide the bracelet so she knows where it is.\u201d \u201cOh, Wes,\u201d grunts Patty. \u201cKnock it off. Gardenia is a sweet old lady who wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.\u201d \u201cThat sweet old lady is Black Spot. I know it.\u201d A long time ago, the monster world was plagued by a female cat burglar known only as Black Spot. She was able to break into even the most impossible to crack security systems and steal anything valuable, usually just to prove that she could. However, Black Spot mysteriously stopped appearing 100 years ago and nobody knows why. From the only photographic evidence of Black Spot, it was clear that she was a feline monster of some kind. While it was too dark to get a good idea, she seemed to be a werecheetah. Since Gardenia Vile was old enough to have lived during the time when Black Spot ran amok, Wes suspected that Gardenia was Black Spot. Gardenia knew about this suspicions and neither confirmed nor denied she was Black Spot. It was unclear if she actually was Black Spot or if she was simply messing with people. Patty of course, didn\u2019t believe Wes\u2019s accusations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, Patty. Her surname is VILE. That should tell you something.\u201d Patty gave a snort before she grunted as she bumped into somebody else. \u201cUgh!\u201d Before Patty realized who she bumped into, she checked her cleavage to make sure the bracelet was still in place and gave a sigh of relief. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that, Mrs. Round.\u201d Said a young voice. Patty looked and saw that she had bumped into Akira Oda, an 18-year-old Japanese dragon who was a regular customer. Akira was a very fat bright violet-skinned dragoness with a yellow underbelly. Today, Akira\u2019s hair was bright blonde. Every 3 days, Akira dyed her hair a different color. Because of that, nobody knew her natural hair color and Akira herself had forgotten as well. \u201cOh,\u201d said Patty. \u201cNo problem, Akira.\u201d Patty looked at Akira and noticed that she was carrying a package filled with hair care products and tools. \u201cSomeone\u2019s having a busy week at the salon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira nodded her head. \u201cMom left me in charge while she\u2019s visiting her sick cousin.\u201d Akira and her mother ran the town hair salon. Because they were so busy, they always ordered takeout rather than sitting in Neo Neapolitan to enjoy a meal. Nobody in town knew what Mrs. Oda looked like except that she was even bigger and fatter than her daughter. It was unknown if she was even a dragon and it didn\u2019t help that Mrs. Oda had her customers blindfolded before she worked on them. \u201cWell,\u201d said Wes. \u201cGood luck, Akira. Patty will be in for her haircut in a few days.\u201d Akira walked away and Patty and Wes let out a laugh. \u201cBy the way, Akira,\u201d said Patty. \u201cHappy late birthday.\u201d \u201cThanks, Mrs. Round.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Wes. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Akira just turned 18. I wonder if she\u2019ll get as big as her mom.\u201d \u201cIf she does,\u201d says Patty. \u201cThen we\u2019d have an idea what that mountainous anonymous looks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patty and Wes were walking forward, they ran into another monster they knew; Christina Sweet, a 1000ft tall ginger-haired and orange-red skinned obese werecrocodile. Christina was the chauffeur to the gargoyle jazz singer, Vienna, who was a friend of Patty\u2019s. Patty gave a nervous look. \u201cHello, Christina.\u201d She said as she forced a smile. Christina turned her head and then snorted. \u201cOh. Hi, Patty.\u201d Patty got along okay with Christina but she wasn\u2019t a big fan of crocodiles. In fact, she was afraid of them. Then again, Werehippos and Werecrocs were usually enemies. \u201cI take it Vienna is in town?\u201d asked Wes. \u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Christina. \u201cWe just got back from a tour. By the way, have you added tacos to Neo\u2019s menu yet, huh?\u201d \u201cNot yet, Christina. I\u2019m kind of in a hurry to get home now.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Christina with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d Christina\u2019s favorite food was tacos, but unfortunately for her, Neo Neapolitan didn\u2019t sell tacos. \u201cYou know, Patty,\u201d says Wes. \u201cWith everything else we have on the menu.\u201d \u201cOne crisis at a time, Wes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Una had finished her magic circle and then pulled Carina up off of the dead couch and instructed her to place the hand in the circle's center. \"Now,\" said the lioness witch doctor. \"I shall conduct a spell that will make the bracelet come off.\" Una was chanting to herself as she played on a strange drum. The spell was making Carina's bracelet twitch and shake. It was certain that the spell would work, but things don't always work the way we want them to. Into the room flew a mosquito the size of a cow and it was buzzing around Carina's head. Carina mumbled but her mouth was still sealed and she couldn't shout. Even with her bracelet twitching, she rose her hand in an attempt to swat the mosquito. This in turn caused magical energy to leave her bracelet and exit out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Wes and Patty's house, Patty removed a loose tile from inside of the fireplace just as Gardenia instructed and then took out the bracelet. \"I still don't think it's a good idea to hide it in the fireplace.\" \"Come on, Wes. What kind of thief would rob the fireplace. There is no way this nasty bracelet is acting up now.\" But suddenly, the bracelet in Patty\u2019s hand vanished. \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Patty. \u201cIt disappeared!\u201d \u201cWell that\u2019s just ducky.\u201d Groaned Wes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the Rounds didn\u2019t know was that the bracelet was teleported and it reappeared on the wrist of...</span></div></div>",

Una grunts as the bracelet constricts and then she sees the bracelet on her own wrist and then gasps as she sees Carina's hand isn't in the circle and Carina is still wearing the bracelet. Carina gives a nervous smile before Una looks back to see her indigo-colored behind expanding at such a rapid rate that some of the bones making up Una's bikini bottom break off as the lioness roars loudly. In seconds, Una's ass is as big as Carina's and it crushes Una's cauldron and ottoman underneath its massive hulk. As Una's booty grows, the magic circle drawn in the floor flickers before fading and bursting into stardust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUna drops her jaw and looks at the spot where the circle stood and then she looks at her big behind as several butterflies fly from the outside and land on it. Then she turns to Carina and angrily shows her her large and sharp teeth. \"You stupid snake-haired mook!\" yells the witch doctor lioness. \"What did you do that for!? Did you not realize that you needed to keep the bracelet in one place for the ritual to work! What made you do something so foolish!\" Carina pulls the seal off of her mouth before she yells back at Una.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT ARE YOU BLAMING IT ON ME FOR, YOUR INDIGO PUSSYCAT! THERE WAS A MOSQUITO IN HERE THE SIZE OF A COW! THOSE THINGS CAN KILL YOU UNDER THE WRONG CIRCUMSTANCES YOU KNOW! YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MOSQUITOS BECAUSE YOUR SKIN IS INDESTRUCTIBLE! BUT GUESS WHAT?! I'M NOT A NEMEAN LION LIKE YOU AND I HATE MOSQUITOS! MOSQUITOS SUCK! LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUna just gives a growl and shakes her head. \"Since the spellbinder circle lost sight of the bracelet on your arm, it went looking for another bracelet and found the twin of that bracelet and now it's stuck to me. I have cousins in Dreadberry who have large behinds but not <i>this</i> large.\" \"WELL, TRY ANOTHER RITUAL!\" Una let out a growl and then took out some strange clay and modeled it in the shape of Carina before squeezing its behind, causing Carina's own behind to become sore as Carina's snake hair hissed and Carina yelled in pain. \"Stop whining,\" mutters Una. \"I'm trying to use voodoo to compress your behind just like on this clay doll. Carina kept on moaning as her butt was being squeezed and Una chanted as she tried to use voodoo to shrink Carina's butt, but nothing was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 10 minutes, Una gave up and reduced the clay to its previous form as Carina groaned and held her butt in pain. \"It's just no use,\" said Una with a sigh as she shook her head. \"From the looks of it, using voodoo on Egyptian magic will get us nowhere.\" Carina groaned and felt her now cherry red enormous butt in pain. \"GEE! Y'THINK?!\" Una was about to speak again but then she heard the phone ringing. The witch doctor lioness crawled up to the phone before she spoke into the line. \"Hello? What?! You're almost in Direopolis? I completely forgot! No, the house is decent. But you might want to be careful when you come in through the front door. I'll see you soon. Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUna fell her forehead and let out a groan as she shook her head and accidentally bludgeoned Carina with her large behind. \"HEY!\" yelled the gorgon. \"WHAT'S WRONG?!\" Una let out a sigh. \"My cousin is coming to visit me for spring break and I did not count on such a calamity befalling me.\" \"WELL YOU'RE A WITCH DOCTOR AREN'T YOU!? AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE THINGS INTO THE FUTURE!\" Una just gave a growl that made Carina quiet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina turned her head and saw all sorts of photographs on the wall of different feline-based monsters, mostly Nemean lions. Una's relatives from the looks of it. From the looks of it, there were a lot of lionesses in the family and they were all heavily built. \"SO?\" asked Carina. \"WHICH COUSIN IS VISITING?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUna let out a sigh before she told Carina who she was expecting.</span></div></div>",

Give me a break. Let\u2019s look at the TV listings. Oh you\u2019ve got to be kidding me? That network only made one good reboot and they pulled its plug while all other attempts to recreate their classics have ended in disasters. Humans have such bad taste, it makes me wonder why they\u2019re considered food to begin with.\u201d Gardenia turned the page on her newspaper, not noticing that her seat on the bus was bending underneath her rear that was now beginning to grow at a rapid rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next article interested Gardenia very much. \u201cThe mummy of Queen Tontepsut is on display at the Direopolis museum. Well, Queenie. I haven\u2019t seen your shriveled self for decades. I wonder if you still have that bejeweled death mask.\u201d It was at that point that the bus arrived at Gardenia\u2019s stop. The werecheetah was for some reason having trouble getting up until another monster came up to her. This was Scarlet Leeds, a heavy hourglass-shaped Jersey Devil giantess resembling a pink and white anthropomorphic and demonic quagga. Scarlet grabbed the elderly cheetah woman by her wrists and pulled on her in order to get her back up on her feet. \u201cOof. Thanks, Scarlet,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cI guess I\u2019m getting weaker in my old age.\u201d Scarlet couldn\u2019t help but stare at Gardenia\u2019s backside which was now almost as tall as Gardenia herself. \u201cUh, Ms. Vile,\u201d said the Jersey Devil giantess. \u201cUh... how do I put this...?\u201d Gardenia just gave a blink and then gave a cough. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Scarlet,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cI must be heading home.\u201d With that, Gardenia ran out of the bus in a flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being old and fat, Gardenia was still a werecheetah and could move at astonishing speed. Of course, with her enlarged behind, every time she moved around a corner, Gardenia bent a streetlight or damaged a brick wall. \u201cWell,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cMy speed hasn\u2019t diminished in the slightest.\u201d Gardenia then noticed her house up ahead and leapt over the fence. She landed in front of the front door, her larger weight causing one of the cobble stones in the ground leading to the door to crack. Gardenia then held out her claws and used them to pick the lock on her own front door before entering the house. However, she grunted because her butt got stuck in the door. However, she at first blamed it on something else. \u201cI need to cut back on burgers,\u201d said Gardenia. \u201cI\u2019m still fast, but I\u2019d like to get in through my front door. How Nicolette can stand it, I\u2019ll never... whoa!\u201d Gardenia finally pushed herself through the front door and then accidentally sat on and smashed her coffee table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardenia looked back at her large behind in surprise. \u201cOh my gosh,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew I had a gut, but I don\u2019t remember having the butt of a splintercat. Huh?\u201d Gardenia had finally noticed the bracelet around her wrist. \u201cNow how did I get this? Hmm. It looks like it belongs to Patty. Wait, I\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d Gardenia waddled up to her bookshelf and took out a book. She flipped to an image of a female werehippo with pitch black skin and long red hair. This werehippo woman was dressed as an Egyptian queen and was wearing a variety of gold jewelry, including Neith\u2019s bracelets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI though so,\u201d said the werecheetah. \u201cThese are definitely the manacles of the werehippo queen. Hmm. Isn\u2019t Patty a descendent of the queen. I certainly don\u2019t recall picking her pocket, though I\u2019m sure that Wes thinks I did. Now, if memories serves, these manacles are cursed. But wait. Where\u2019s the other one? Oh well.\u201d\u2028\u2028Gardenia shrugged her shoulders and then turned on the television to an exercise program before she switched into a brown unitard and a red headband with gray leg warmers that miraculously covered her enlarged spotted graying yellow behind. \u201cI think it\u2019s time to switch to the classics.\u201d Thought Gardenia as she started to jump jacks to the exercise program on the television.</span></div></div>",

Mr. Oda was an albino Japanese dragon with a long gray mustache and long hair. In contrast to his wife and daughter, he was pencil thin. He was also wearing a pair of dark glasses because he was blind. In all the years he had been married to his wife, he had no idea what she looked like. Mr. Oda was listening to an episode of Dr. Madman on the TV via SAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Madman is in the alphabet soup factory, sticking a butterfly net into the soup where he pulls out several letters and throws them back in one by one.\u201d \u201c<i>C</i> you later. You\u2019ve been <i>D</i>-moted. <i>Y</i> are you in here? I\u2019ve got no use for part timers. <i>O</i> yes. <i>U</i> are coming with me. <i>E</i> what I did there? Hee-hee-hee.\u201d \u201cMangaga walks in to confront Dr. Madman.\u201d \u201cDr. Madman! What the heck are you doing?!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m stealing all the vowels from every plant that makes alphabet soup. Now people will have to buy a vowel. Literally! For $100 a can! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\u201d \u201cMangaga rushes at Dr. Madman only for Madman to toss letters in his face and burn him as he yells. The letters spell out \u201cNERD\u201d as Dr. Madman makes his escape. \u201cYou <i>broth</i> that one on yourself Mangaga. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the cartoon was over, Mr. Oda\u2019s ears twitched and he realized that Akira was walking in. \u201cHello, Akira.\u201d He said. \u201cHi, Dad,\u201d said Akira as she took out her supplies. \u201cDid you hear anything from mom about when she\u2019d be back from Tokyo.\u201d \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Mr. Oda. \u201cBy the way, how are your horns coming in.\u201d Akira looked into the mirror and saw that she was growing a pair of bright yellow horns. \u201cThey\u2019re coming in nicely, Dad. I\u2019m now officially an adult with horns like these.\u201d But then, Akira heard a ripping sound. \u201cHuh?\u201d she asked. The 18-year-old dragon turned her head and gasped to see that her butt had swelled to be twice as wide as she was tall and was pressing against two barber seats as her skirt was being torn apart. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Mr. Oda to his daughter. \u201cMy butt! It\u2019s super huge.\u201d Mr. Oda got up and felt Akira\u2019s left cheek and gave as much of a look of surprise as he could without eyesight. \u201cYou\u2019re not kidding. But how is that possible? All your weight normally goes into your stomach.\u201d Akira then gasped and grabbed the sides of her face. \u201cI\u2019m turning into my mom!\u201d Akira had still not realized she was wearing Neith\u2019s bracelet and assumed that because her mother was so titanically huge, it was her DNA to blame for her butt expanding to such an enormous size. Akira even pressed her butt against the mirror and blushed. \u201cWell,\u201d said Mr. Oda. \u201cIt\u2019s a surefire sign that you\u2019re an adult dragon.\u201d Akira bit her nails and then felt her horns. \u201cDragons can live for a very, very, very, very, very long time. But I had no idea that we grew up this fast.\u201d Akira let out a sigh and then she heard the phone ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d asked Akira as she answered the phone. \u201cHi, Sweetie,\u201d said Mrs. Oda on the other line in a soft voice that didn\u2019t match such a titanically huge creature. \u201cHow\u2019s everything at home?\u201d \u201cMom! Oh. I think your genes are catching up with me.\u201d \u201cHow so, Akira?\u201d Akira bit her lip. \u201cMy butt is titanic. I mean, it\u2019s nearly as big as yours.\u201d \u201cWhat? But you only just turned 18. You shouldn\u2019t get a mom butt before you\u2019re even a mom.\u201d \u201cWell, I do.\u201d \u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mrs. Oda. \u201cWhat?! Oh, ratzafratz! I missed my train! Sorry, dear. But I won\u2019t be in Direopolis until next week. Please hold down the fort until then.\u201d \u201cWill do, Mom.\u201d \u201cAnd don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s perfectly natural. Love you. Bye.\u201d As Mrs. Oda hung up, she had no idea exactly how wrong she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira let out a sigh and then noticed Neith\u2019s bracelet on her arm. However, she had no idea it was responsible for her growing backside. \u201cWhere did I get this bracelet?\u201d \u201cWhat bracelet?\u201d asked Mr. Oda. Akira looked closer at the bracelet. \u201cHuh,\u201d she said. \u201cThis looks Egyptian. The only Egyptian monsters in town are Principal Necron and Mrs. Round. Oh. I bumped into Mrs. Round. The bracelet must\u2019ve gotten stuck to me. When she comes in for her haircut, I\u2019ll give it back to her. Huh. My butt is probably even bigger than Mrs. Round\u2019s by now.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite an achievement as Mrs. Round is a werehippo,\u201d said Mr. Oda before his ears twitched. \u201cIt sounds like we have a customer coming.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira turns her head and into the salon walks...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bracelet appeared on the wrist of Christina who was at this moment returning to Vienna's Direopolis Estate overlooking the river. It was a rather large and impressive looking manor with stained glass windows depicting images of female gargoyles along with statues of birds decorated throughout a garden of exotic flowers. The railing around Vienna's neck was built to resemble sheet music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christina opened the door, there was piano music playing for Vienna was at work. By trade Vienna was a singer and as such, she was also skilled with virtually any instrument to the point where she had a collection of them kept in her house. The gargoyle giantess was playing the piano so rapidly that Christina could hear it from the other side of the house. The sunlight from the stained glass windows reflected off of Vienna's tiara and shined upon several strangely colored ferns in the corner. Christina walked down the hallway that was covered in oil paintings of monster women, some of which were even naked, unknowing of her booty that was getting bigger and tearing apart her khaki pants. As Christina reached her mistress\u2019s study, she stopped and decided to wait until Vienna was through with the song she was playing. The gargoyle woman\u2019s large breasts bouncing as she moved back and forth from one end of the piano to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna kept playing the music as Christina\u2019s pants were beginning to slip off. The orange-skinned reptilian giantess made her way into the kitchen and turned on the frying pan. Once the pan was hot enough, Christina puts some steak on the pan and started to flip it as she took out some tomatoes with rice. Then, she walked up to a cupboard that was under lock and key. That cupboard was actually the refrigerated safe where Vienna kept her cheese. Vienna had somewhat an obsession with cheese, that was believed to be because she had Lactose Overload Syndrome. As Christina was busy cooking dinner, her butt grew at such a rapid rate that it was pushing up her long ginger hair and her tail looked like it was shrinking. In the other room, Vienna\u2019s playing became much faster as Christina took out some tortillas and was getting ready to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Vienna struck the final note, she opened up her wings and her eyes glowed bright red. \u201cI thought you came back to Direopolis to relax until you had to get back to work.\u201d Said Christina as she walked in with a plate full of quesadillas. Vienna let out a sigh and smiled before stuffing her face with three cheese-filled quesadillas at once. Christina ate a couple herself. \u201cThanks, Christina,\u201d said Vienna as she was licking cheese off her claws. \u201cYou make a better quesadilla than Patty. Uh, just don\u2019t tell her I said that.\u201d Christina ate another quesadilla, only for the cheese to leak out all over her purple tanktop. \u201cDamn!\u201d Christina then looked and saw that the cheese splattered on her left thigh. She looked down and gasped at how big her butt had gotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna turned and looked in surprise as Christina\u2019s butt was even bigger than her breasts. \u201cOh my gosh. What happened, Christina?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d yelled Christina. \u201cWhat\u2019s the sitch? I knew I was heavy but not that heavy.\u201d Vienna then noticed the bracelet on Christina\u2019s arm and inspected it. \u201cWhere did you get that bracelet?\u201d \u201cBracelet?\u201d asked Christina. \u201cWhat...?! Huh!?\u201d Christina looked at the bracelet on her list and Vienna realized what it was. \u201cThat bracelet belongs to Patty\u2019s mother. It must be what made your behind so enormous.\u201d Christina let out a groan. \u201cFirst the monkey tattoo and now this?\u201d she asked with a groan. \u201cGreat.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be snappy.\u201d Said Vienna. \u201cI\u2019m a crocodile, Vienna. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d Vienna walked up to the phone to contact Patty. \u201cI should have her right... achoo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vienna sneezes, she presses a button by her phone to one of her contacts.</span></div></div>",

The gorgon\u2019s snakes hissed angrily as Mia was applying the grease. \u201cAnd I thought my cousin Janet was pear-shaped,\u201d said the wereleopard with a giggle. \u201cIf she saw you, she\u2019d have quite a hissy fit.\u201d One of Carina\u2019s snakes nearly bit Mia for that remark. \u201cHISSY FIT!

Ah, I\u2019m getting a signal.\u201d However, it wasn\u2019t Patty\u2019s mother that answered but her human father, Carter. \u201cCleopatra?\u201d asked the old man on the phone. \u201cWhat are you calling us for?\u201d \u201cDad? I was looking for Mom. She forgot her bracelets and one of our customers has one of them stuck to her wrist.\u201d \u201cWhat?! Are you serious!? Those bracelets belonged to the werehippo queen 3000 years ago.\u201d \u201cI know,\u201d said Patty with a sigh. \u201cAnd now Carina\u2019s butt is already half as big as the werehippo queen\u2019s and I can\u2019t get it off.\u201d Carter let out a sigh. \u201cDid that filthy hipster you married have something to do with it?\u201d Wes overheard that part and was visibly flustered. \u201cYou\u2019re no prize yourself, you old badger.\u201d Thought Wes to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWes,\u201d said Patty. \u201cShut up. Dad, where is Mom? She might know how to get the bracelet off.\u201d Carter let out a sigh. \u201cNeith is busy being a model for a college figure drawing class. We\u2019ll be in Direopolis in the next two weeks. Just don\u2019t let anyone who isn\u2019t a werehippo wear the other bracelet.\u201d Carter hung up and Patty let out a sigh before looking at the second bracelet. \u201cThat thing is dangerous. I\u2019m taking it back to the safe in our house.\u201d \u201cWhy not just leave it here with us, Patty?\u201d asked Salli. Patty gave a snort. \u201cAnd leave it alone with you and Pam? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Pam gave an angry squeal and Salli gave a trumpet. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d said Pam. \u201cI am surprised at your lack of trust.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m often surprised at your lack of brains! Remember when I sent you to pick up eggs and you came back with a step-counter dog collar?\u201d \u201cIt was a good deal, Patty.\u201d \u201cOh it was,\u201d says Wes sarcastically. \u201cNow all we need is a dog.\u201d Pam drooped her tusks but Salli stepped forward. \u201cPatty,\u201d she said. \u201cI know Pam is stupid but you can trust me.\u201d Patty gave a snort. \u201cThose bracelets are a Round family heirloom. Only a Round can be trusted with them. I\u2019m taking them and putting them in a safe.

Only mom knows how to take the stupid bracelets off. The sooner this thing is locked away the better.\u201d Patty waddled up to a bus stop where her naturally humongous butt took up the entire bench. The pink werehippo let out a sigh as she begun to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Pam who had wings and Salli who could levitate due to her vampire blood, Patty couldn\u2019t fly and what made moving around Direopolis difficult for her was the fact that she had never taken driver\u2019s ed let alone had a license to operate a vehicle. That\u2019s why she needed Pam to be the delivery girl. The werehippo waited for five minutes until another would-be passenger sat next to her. This giantess was Mallory, a turquoise-skinned, cream-haired succubus with oryx-like horns, one red eye, a patch over her left eye and enormous breasts due to having Lactose Overload Syndrome, a disorder that only affects werewolves, succubi and gargoyles. \u201cOh no,\u201d groaned Wes as he watches Mallory watching Sun Vulcan on her phone. \u201cIt\u2019s Mallory.\u201d Patty groaned. Mallory, or Deathina as she preferred to be called, was a would-be super villain out to take over the world. However, the fact was she was more of a nuisance than an actual threat and only ever succeeded in causing trouble for the Rounds, Hockers and Van Richters. \u201cIgnore her, Wes,\u201d muttered Patty. \u201cWe have bigger fish to fry.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u2028The bus arrived and Patty and Mallory walked inside. There weren\u2019t too many monsters on the bus but there were two in particular near the back seat that Patty and Wes noticed. First of them was a giant and pear-shaped capricorn woman, a monster who resembled a humanoid indigo furred and blonde-haired goat with a large udder but with gills on her neck and grayish blue fish scales covering her legs. This capricorn was wearing a black mask that covered the top of her face, fingerless gloves, a unitard, a cape and a belt with stockings. She was reading the newspaper article about an evil geneticist who died in a car crash during a police chase. This woman was Wilma Kidd, known mainly as Deneb, a would-be superhero who goes around Direopolis looking for crimes to destroy. Not that there was much crime in Direopolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the side of Wilma there was a pear-shaped and silver-skinned werelizard resembling a hunch-backed chameleon with gray-striped on her back, brown reddish hair in a bobcut and a rainbow colored tongue. She was wearing a white-colored business suit with a skirt and appeared to be yelling into her cell phone at somebody. Her name was Claire Melon and she was one of Neo Neapolitan\u2019s regular customers. She was a businesswoman who ran a chain of hotels around the monster world. She was usually stressed out because the main hotel located in Direopolis was especially problematic. Patty couldn\u2019t make out what Claire was so mad about but decided to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus took off again and Patty laid down her purse and let out a deep yawn. The bus soon came to another stop but Wes looked out and saw that they were nowhere near the street where he and Patty lived. This was because the bus was picking up another passenger. This passenger was a fat scaly yellow-green-skinned monster resembling a long horned wildebeest with aqua-colored hair. She was wearing a pair of sunglasses along with a mawashi and a basketball shirt. Her name was Ethiopia Gnu, a wildebeest-like monster called a catoplebas and a friend of Deneb\u2019s. She was a recurring customer at Neo Neapolitan and was a rather odd duck. She was constantly trying to perfect a sport that combined basketball and sumo and right now as she walked up and sat next to Patty, she was dribbling a basketball big enough to destroy a human village. \u201cHey, Patty.\u201d Said Ethiopia. \u201cHi, Ethiopia.\u201d Said Patty with a sigh. Patty saw the catoblepas spinning her basketball on her finger and rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus soon arrived at Patty and Wes\u2019s house and the Rounds walked to the door. Patty reached into her cleavage and Wes handed her the key. Patty walked up to a painting of a four werehippos tasting wine and revealed a safe behind it before unlocking the secret combination and opening the door to reveal the valuable contents inside. \u201cNothing is getting out of this safe until Mom gets home.\u201d \u201cOr until we need Mia to fix the sink again.\u201d Said Wes. \u201cVery funny, I...\u201d Patty then noticed that she didn\u2019t have her purse with her. \u201cWes?\u201d asked the hippo giantess. \u201cWhere\u2019s my...?\u201d It was at that moment, Patty realized that she had forgotten her purse on the ride over and it was still on the bus, prompting the giantess to let out a scream of frustration.\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you forgot your purse on the bus with that cursed bracelet in it.\u201d Moaned Wes. \u201cI\u2019m a hippopotamus, not an elephant, Wes! I can\u2019t remember anything! **** my luck!\u201d Patty shut the safe and then ran out hoping she could catch the bus. \u201cWait!\u201d yelled Patty. \u201cStop!\u201d But the bus had already driven off. \u201c****!\u201d yelled Wes. Patty let out a sigh. \u201cSome days it doesn\u2019t pay to get out of bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings were about to get a whole lot worse for Patty and Wes because one of the other passengers on the bus had at that point found Patty\u2019s purse with the cursed bracelets inside. But who?</span></div></div>",

She gave a scowl as she picked up the purse and took it with her as she was leaving the bus. As Deneb held up the purse, the second bracelet twitched in the purse and flew around the capricorn giantess\u2019s wrist. The goddess-sized goat walked down the street, her cape hiding the fact that her already rather large behind was slowly getting larger and stretching her fishnet stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown the street, Patty was rushing to reach the bus in order to retrieve her purse before anyone could wear the bracelet and be cursed just like Carina. \u201cCan\u2019t you run any faster?\u201d asked Wes. \u201cI thought hippos could run 19MPH Patty snorted as she was running. \u201cGet off my case, Wes.\u201d Wes let out a sigh. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you just take driver\u2019s ed anyway?\u201d Patty grit her teeth and growled at her tiny husband riding in her ear. Wes shook his head. \u201cMight I recommend yoga, Patty? I see you\u2019re flustered. You already have five medicine balls built into your body.\u201d \u201cYou know, Wes, you\u2019re not as funny as you think.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Patty came to a scoff and Wes yelled as he fell into his wife\u2019s ear canal.\u2028\u2028As for why Patty stopped running, she ran into Deneb who was holding out her purse. \u201cYour purse, Mrs. Round.\u201d Said Deneb. Patty smiled and took her purse. \u201cThanks, Deneb. You\u2019re a regular Johnny on the spot. This purse contains dangerous cargo.\u201d Deneb nodded her head, still unaware of the bracelet around her wrist. \u201cI recommend you keep whatever is in this purse under lock and key. What exactly is in it that\u2019s so important?\u201d Patty let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my mom\u2019s bracelets. Any non-werehippo who wears the bracelets has their butt swell to enormous size.\u201d Deneb raised an eyebrow because normally her rear was half as big as Patty\u2019s quite massive rear. \u201cWell,\u201d said Deneb. \u201cI\u2019ll just leave you two on your way. Be careful. You have no idea how many evildoers there might be in this very town.\u201d As Deneb went on her way, neither she nor Patty noticed that her fish-scaled goat booty was getting enormous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty shook her head and out into her hand fell Wes, covered in his wife\u2019s earwax. \u201cWe\u2019re in luck, Wes,\u201d said Patty. \u201cDeneb found my purse.\u201d Wes grunted. \u201cGood, now let\u2019s get home so we can put that bracelet in the safe and me in the shower.\u201d Sure enough, Patty and Wes returned to their home and Wes was in the kitchen sink washing hippopotamus earwax off of himself as Patty opened the safe revealing several pieces of Egyptian jewelry, a collection of DVDs and a briefcase labeled \u201cMia Money\u201d. \u201cNow,\u201d said Patty as she reached into her purse. \u201cTime to... what?! Oh no!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Wes. \u201cThe bracelet isn\u2019t here.\u201d \u201cWhat?! Where is it, then!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the bracelet was stuck to Deneb\u2019s wrist, not that Deneb noticed and Deneb\u2019s rear was now twice as big as she was and even wider. However, at that moment, she actually wasn\u2019t patrolling Direopolis and was returning home, somehow unknowingly managing to squeeze her now enormous butt through the front door. However, she still didn\u2019t take off her costume and simply walked into the living room where the windows were obscured by newspaper. Deneb then walked up to a markhor-shaped lamp and opened the head\u2019s mouth to reveal a button inside. By pressing the button, Deneb caused her easy chair to move back and reveal a elevator. Deneb sat down into the easy chair, accidentally destroying it as the cushion slide down the chute. She landed at the bottom and grunted as she landed on her butt with a crashing sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Deneb sprung up and the goat giantess walked into an underground base of some sort. As Deneb reached the inside of her underground lair, her shadow cast over a table that appeared to have a human-sized model city built on it. She loomed over a model hotel and tapped on the roof. as her butt and udder wobbled. \u201cAdam,\u201d said Deneb. \u201cAre you in there?\u201d Out of the front door of the model hotel came a human boy, one who barely looked older than 10. This young boy was Adam Kidd, Deneb\u2019s adoptive son. However, Deneb didn\u2019t usually take her out of the lair with her due to how inhospitable a monster town can be to humans the size of ants to the creatures of mythology running about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown here, Mom!\u201d yelled Adam up to Deneb. Deneb gave a smile before switching it to her usual grimace. \u201cNot a very eventful day,\u201d said the goat giantess. \u201cWhich is what worries me. I\u2019m sure that Deathina is up to something.\u201d Adam let out a laugh as he climbed on his goat mother\u2019s gloved index finger. \u201cCalm down, Mom. Deathina is the closest thing to a super villain Direopolis has. There\u2019s nothing to worry about.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s more to worry about than you know, Adam,\u201d said Deneb as she walked up and hooked her udder up to a machine of some sort. \u201cI only came back from patrol early because it\u2019s that time of the week again. It all comes with being a capricorn. Nobody knows the trouble goat and cow-based monsters have to go through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Deneb was waiting to be milked, she took off her mask and Adam climbed up his mother\u2019s shoulder, only to look back in surprise. Deneb\u2019s butt was now so large that her fishnets looked like they were painted on and her cape and hair were being held up by it. \u201cUh, Mom,\u201d said Adam. \u201cThere\u2019s something you should know...\u201d</span></div></div>",

But I don't recall putting this thing on. I didn't even look at the inside of the purse.\" Adam crawled down his mother's arm and tried to pull on the bracelet in an attempt to take it off but only received a minor shock of static electricity and screamed. \"Mom,\" said Adam. \"I think that this bracelet is one of those artifacts that sticks itself tight to whoever it comes close to.\" Deneb grumbled and then put her son down on her left cheek before she went to get something to remove the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she took out a saw and tried to cut the bracelet off, but the saw broke and then Deneb's rear swelled up again and her stockings started to snap. Adam was forced to climb up Deneb's hair behind one of her horns. Deneb looked at the broken saw and then she put her mask back on. \"Something tells me that this bracelet can only be removed by magic.\" The capricorn grabbed herself by the face and moaned. \"And I'm no sorceress.\" Deneb let out a sigh as she let her rear end toss the ground. It was so big at this point that she was sitting down and standing up at the same time. She then heard more snapping sounds that irritated her. His fishnets were coming apart and the goat woman looked back to see how huge she had gotten. \"And I thought I was pear-shaped before,\" said Deneb. \"This is more damage than any of those burgers I shovel down at Neo could ever do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam poked Deneb's behind slightly and was amazed at how big it was getting. \"Mom,\" he said. \"Something just occurred at me. Somebody else must have the other bracelet stuck on their wrist.\" Deneb let out a groan. \"Some people should be more responsible with their Egyptian artifacts.\" \"Look on the bright side, Mom,\" said Adam. \"You can just sit on the next criminal you come across.\" Deneb picked up her son and placed him on her control panel before her master computer started to erratically beep. \"Uh-oh,\" said Adam. \"Trouble already.\" Deneb crushes three chairs underneath her as she walks up and hits a few keys on the control panel to zoom in on a section in town where....</span></div></div>",

The episode of Sun Vulcan she was watching ended, and she finally looked away to see she had grabbed the wrong purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. This isn't mine.\" She said. She grabbed her actual purse and put Patty's down, but not before taking a quick peek inside. When she did, she saw the bracelet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello.\" Mallory said, intrigued. \"You look magical. Maybe I can use you to further my world-conquering plans.\" She reached down to grab the bracelet, but before she could, it shot up and latched itself onto her right wrist. Mallory frowned at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" She said, before attempting to remove the bracelet. But no such luck, it was stuck tight. \"Great, it's one of those magic items. This is the third time this month.\" Unknown to Mallory, her butt had already begun to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bus stopped in front of Mallory's workplace, an LOS strip club called LOS Lovely's. Mallory got up and started to get off. Her butt was expanding at a rapid pace, so she was already bumping into people on her way off, but she didn't realize it yet. When she got to the door of the bus, her butt got stuck in it. With some effort, she managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, I got through that door earlier. Did it magically shrink on me? Wouldn't be the first time.\" Mallory muttered as she walked up to the club, still unaware of her inflating butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory had managed to get into the club no problem, since the doors were designed with LOS afflicted women in mind. She started for the staff changing room before she heard a wolf whistle. She rolled her eyes at it. She knew who that belonged to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and saw her coworker, Viveka. She was an indigo succubus with lavender hair, purple eyes, and an exaggerated hourglass figure. Viveka had a huge crush on Mallory, and was always flirting with her, but also flirted with pretty much any monster that walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, Mallory.\" Viveka said. \"I must say, you look even sexier today then usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory just groaned. \"I'm not interested Viveka.\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. But just look at you. I love what you've done with that gorgeous ass of yours.\" Viveka purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My ass?\" Mallory said, confused. It was then she finally looked back. Her butt had expanded to about her height of 855 feet, and about 1000 feet wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Mallory yelled. \"I look like Beast Tamer Keris times 100!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViveka was still staring. \"Just look at it. I could use it as a bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory whipped her head back. \"Do that, and I'm turning you into a glass bowl.\" She threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViveka shrugged and walked past her. \"Keep my offer in mind.\" She said, before smacking Mallory's now giant ass, making it wobble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory face-palmed. \"I swear...\" She muttered. Then she looked at the bracelet still stuck on her arm. \"I'm guessing this is what you do. Didn't think I'd see a body expanding piece of jewelery again after last month. But you usually come in pairs, so where's the other one?\" Before she could ponder it, she realized her butt was still wobbling. She frowned, realizing it wasn't going to stop anytime soon.</span></div></div>",

It felt like Ring Shadow was squeezing my brain. Mallory then accidentally broke off one of the sinks just by wobbling her large rear and then looked at it while biting her lip. \"Oh,\" she groaned. \"Cora is not going to like that.\" Mallory bent over and tried to fix the sink, but accidentally knocked over several stalls before dropping the sink on the ground and making it shatter. Mallory let out a moan and then reached into her cleavage. She took out an anchor, a boomerang and finally her cell phone to call home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt home was Mallory's zombie servant Rob. She resurrected him in an attempt to raise an undead army but for some reason (mainly Mallory's incompetence), Rob was resurrected at human-sized rather than monster size. At that moment, Rob was watching an Internet video on Mallory's computer when Mallory called. He let out a sigh and answered the phone. \"Now what?\" \"Rob!\" yelled Mallory. \"My butt is huge.\" Rob gave a scoff. \"Every monster girl's butt is huge at my size.\" \"No, you idiot! I put on a strange bracelet I found on the bus and it made my ass bigger than me!\" Rob blinked slightly. \"Bracelet? Singular? Where\u2019s the other one.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d groaned Mallory. \u201cBut it looked valuable. Kind of like the one the queen of Egypt would wear. Whoever has the other bracelet must\u2019ve lost it. Maybe they\u2019ll know what to do?\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d said Rob. \u201cIt sounds like the Gigi Armlet and the Gaga Armlet.\u201d \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Mallory. \u201cGigi? Gaga?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the manacles that give Kamen Rider Amazon his powers.\u201d Replied Rob. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory\u2019s eyes popped upon hearing that news. \u201cYou used my computer that I use to watch Super Sentai in order to watch Kamen Rider?! You traitor!\u201d \u201cYou watch Kamen Rider too.\u201d \u201cOnly Kamen Rider Drive! Those Showa era shows are so violent. Ugh! This is no time to argue. As soon as I find the owner of this manacle...\u201d Suddenly a thought came to Mallory. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder what would happen if I wore both bracelets?\u201d Mallory tapped her chin while on the other end on the line, Rob gave a look of worry. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s such a good idea, Mallory.\u201d Mallory gave a scoff. \u201cWhat do you know? Your brain is rotten. TTYL.\u201d Mallory hung up and Rob let out a sigh as he continued to watch Kamen Rider X. \u201cShe\u2019s going to do something stupid again, I know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory exited the girl\u2019s room to find her boss Cora, a punk LOS-stricken werewolf with pink and green colored hair, walked up towards her. Cora looked in surprise at Mallory\u2019s behind before speaking. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to know.\u201d Said the wolf woman. Mallory blushed and inched away to avoid getting in trouble with her boss and picked up a serving tray. To the succubus\u2019s dismay, all eyes were on her. \u201cThis is so humiliating,\u201d thought Mallory to herself. \u201cIt feels like a whole room filled with Vivekas.\u201d Mallory saw a tengu with eagle-like wings and a werebat resembling a spectral vampire bat and they were both eyeing her before she turned around and got ready to cast a spell. But before she could, she saw Cora coming and stopped herself as she let out a groan. Cora told Mallory that if she hexed the customers, she\u2019d lose her job and being a self-taught supervillain was no way to make a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d thought Mallory. \u201cObviously there\u2019s some great power in this bracelets. I need to find whoever is wearing the other bracelet, steal it and then put it on. It\u2019s obviously Egyptian. The owner must be an Egyptian monster. Pharaoh Deathina. Has a nice ring to it. I wonder if I should design my costume after Grand Marshall Deathmark or Spectral Empress Illiess.\u201d Mallory snickered to herself as Cora kept an eye on her. \u201cShe\u2019s up to something stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cI just know it.\u201d Mallory waddled up towards a fellow waitress, accidentally knocking over a table in the process. This fellow waitress was an obese LOS stricken, spring green-skinned and beaked gargoyle girl with long lavender hair reaching to her rear. \u201cHey,\u201d said Mallory. \u201cLotus. You\u2019re from Egypt. Could you tell me how many Egyptian monsters there are in Direopolis.\u201d Lotus simply blinked as she saw a glint in Mallory\u2019s eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Mallory was scheming, Carina was walking down the street and dragging her butt against the road as she grunted. \u201cI NEED AN EGYPTIAN TO TAKE THIS DAMNED BRACELET OFF!!

Mallory then flashed Neith\u2019s bracelet in Memphis\u2019s face. \u201cLook familiar?\u201d Memphis took a closer look and had to lift the gauze from around her eyes to get a better look. \u201cThat looks like one of the bracelets of Queen Tontepsut. I haven\u2019t seen that thing for thousands of years.\u201d Mallory then barged into the room, tearing the doorway all the other way with her large behind. \u201cLiar!\u201d she shouted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you have the twin of this bracelet in this very room! I can\u2019t trust you any more than I can trust Meemy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory noticed a wall that was made of bricks and started to dismantle it. \u201cHey!\u201d shouted Memphis as her gauze stood on in. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea!\u201d Mallory then walked up to Memphis\u2019s sarcophagus and noticed a dent on the side. \u201cPerhaps this is the answer.\u201d Mallory picked up an Egyptian-style coaster that was on the table. She inserted it on the side of the sarcophagus but it didn\u2019t open. Mallory rolled her eyes. \u201cI should\u2019ve known that wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d Mallory tore the sarcophagus open and tried to look through it, only for her butt to get stuck as she muttered and tried to pry herself free. Memphis was getting rather upset with what was going on. \u201cCut that out!\u201d yelled the angry mummy. \u201cYou are going to destroy my sarcophagus!\u201d Mallory grunted and wiggled her backside before she slipped and wound up shattering Memphis\u2019s sarcophagus to pieces, leaving the mummified werehorse too enraged to speak clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMallory falling to the ground butt first also destroyed Memphis\u2019s floor and the succubus flapped her wings in vain in an attempt to get back up as Memphis was stomping her foot. \u201cCut that out!\u201d shouted Memphis. \u201cNot until you surrender the other bracelet! Your bracelet is what made my butt so enormous.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not my bracelet!\u201d yelled Memphis. \u201cIt\u2019s probably Patty\u2019s next door.\u201d But Mallory still didn\u2019t believe Memphis and was looking everywhere for any sign of the bracelet she believed was in the house. She tried to go through Memphis\u2019s couch, but knocked down the mummy werehorse\u2019s TV with her ponderous behind and caused it to break. Memphis\u2019s eyes glowed red with rage as her gauze was moving about like tentacles. \u201cGet out of my house before I call the rangers!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mallory realized something and then pinned Memphis to the wall with her behind. She gave a vicious smile, a crazed look in her single eye. \u201cOh,\u201d said the succubus. \u201cOh.. oh... oh. I know exactly what your game is. The reason I can\u2019t find the bracelet in your house is because you\u2019re wearing it right now.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d asked Memphis. \u201cYou lamebrain! There\u2019s nothing under my gauze except for me!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be the judge of that!\u201d yelled Mallory. Mallory yanked off Memphis\u2019s gauze and made her scream. The werehorse\u2019s dried up, yellowish brown body was exposed, showing that she was completely hairless and had a skeletal tail. She was morbidly obese under the bandages and was wearing an ill-fitting blue and white striped two piece bikini.\u201d She hissed and covered herself as Mallory looked nervously and then leaned back, crushing Memphis\u2019s coffee table under her but and wincing in pain from the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemphis walked up towards the telephone, mad as heck. \u201cForget the rangers,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m calling the KDP!\u201d But before Memphis could dial a number, somebody else came in.

Wes, could you answer that.\" Wes climbed down his wife's red hair and took out the phone and gulped. \"Uh-oh. It's from that neighbor of ours.

And to top it all off, Mallory just had to be the other one to get hit by the curse!\" Patty's phone begun to ring again and Patty groaned as she held up the phone and read the caller ID. \"Mom,\" says Patty as she answers the phone. \"I'll have to talk to you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the other end of the phone, Neith was showering underneath a waterfall. \"I just forgot to tell you, Patty,\" said the mother hippopotamus. \"In the event that two people each wear one of those bracelets, they must be kept separate. Something awful will happen.\" Patty grit her teeth. \"Are you kidding me?!\" Neith shook her head on the other side and walked out from under the waterfall to put her tiara back on. \"And whatever you do, make sure nobody wears both of them at once.

The wildebeest-like giantess monster moved her shaggy aqua hair and adjusted her sunglasses to get a good look at what she saw. \u201cGreat Malone\u2019s ghost,\u201d said Ethiopia. \u201cLooks like Patty forgot her purse. I better let that werehippo know that it\u2019s missing. Hey, what\u2019s this?\u201d Ethiopia noticed the bracelet and let out a scoff as she rolled her eyes. \u201cMust be more of her flashy Egyptian gold jewelry. That hippopotamus and her mother wear more of this junk than a mummified queen. It\u2019s a fashion disaster.\u201d \u201cThis coming from a catoblepas who regularly wears a basketball tanktop with a mawashi?\u201d asked a male werebear on the bus who was reading the funny papers. Ethiopia gave a glare. \u201cIf looks could kill,\u201d said the catoblepas. \u201cCome to think about it, if it weren\u2019t for these sunglasses, my looks COULD kill. Oh well.\u201d Ethiopia stepped out of the bus and carried Patty\u2019s purse with the bracelet in it as she walked up towards her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthiopia\u2019s house was a rather oddly decorated house. For one thing, it had a sumo ring in the back of it with a basketball net over her garage. There was also a garden of mushrooms of different varieties (catoblepi just loved mushrooms, especially poison mushroom since they could make their breath poisonous as well), a koi pond that was guarded by a brightly colored wire dome and the flags for France, Russia, Kenya, America and Japan hanging from the roof like a clothesline. The inside of the house looked even stranger as there was a display rack with a collection of exotically designed basketballs, a floor that was designed to look like a jigsaw puzzle and a television that was hung over the fireplace. Ethiopia also had a display case with novelty soda cups and a collection of cans, to say nothing of a shelf with wrestling and basketball trophies decorating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthiopia walked up to her front door and reached into her mawashi to take out the key. She unlocked the door and walked inside. \u201cI\u2019m ho-ome!\u201d shouted the catoblepas giantess as she walked inside. Ethiopia bent over to look around the floor, lifting up her stomach in order to get a better look. She took a step forward and was about to bring her foot down when she heard somebody yell \u201cStop!\u201d. Ethiopia looked down to the floor and spotted a young Japanese man her age dressed in a red and white basketball jersey and shorts. The human was dangerously close to being stepped on by the catoblepas giantess. Ethiopia gave a snort and then picked up her human mate and let out a scoff. \u201cMasao,\u201d she said. \u201cI told you to be careful. You\u2019re not indestructible like Patty, Salli and Pam\u2019s husbands.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasao just let out a nervous laugh as his wife smiled at him with her sharp teeth. \u201cSo how did it go?\u201d he asked Ethiopia. Ethiopia let out a sigh. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got 11 volunteers for my basketball class and 8 for my sumo class, but absolute 0 for both at once. It\u2019s going to be tougher to combine the two sports than I thought.\u201d Masao nodded his head as he stood on his wife\u2019s finger. \u201cI see,\u201d he said before he noticed Patty\u2019s purse. \u201cUh, what are you doing with Patty\u2019s purse?\u201d Ethiopia put her husband on her shoulder and then she stepped up towards her telephone. \u201cShe forgot it on the bus. I\u2019m going to call her to tell her that I have it.\u201d Masao nodded his head. \u201cWell that\u2019s great. By the way, are Pinky and Deneb available for game night.\u201d Ethiopia picked up the phone to dial the number and then let out a sigh. \u201cDeneb is going to be late. Apparently somebody called her to tell her they were going to rob a vending machine near the playground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthiopia held up the telephone to her ear and waited for Patty to answer. \u201cHello?\u201d asked Patty on the other end of the phone. \u201cThis really isn\u2019t a good time to call.\u201d \u201cHello,\u201d said Ethiopia. \u201cPatty. I found your purse on the bus and I\u2019d like you to know it\u2019s at my place.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Patty on the other line. \u201cEthiopia, whatever you do, don\u2019t put on the bracelet in that purse.\u201d Ethiopia gave a scoff. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d asked Ethiopia. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t put on that ugly thing if you paid me. The only jewelry I ever wear is my wedding ring.\u201d \u201cThis isn\u2019t a joke, Ethiopia,\u201d said Patty. \u201cIf you wear that bracelet, it will make your butt expand to the point where it\u2019s bigger than you are.\u201d Ethiopia broke out in laughter. \u201cPatty, you can\u2019t be serious. And hello, I\u2019m a sumo wrestler. Like a bigger butt would bother me? What are you afraid my ass will get bigger than yours?\u201d \u201cListen you wacky wildebeest,\u201d said Patty in an angrier tone. \u201cCarina the gorgon already wore that bracelet and now she\u2019s ginormous. Be careful.\u201d Ethiopia let out a sigh. \u201cYou\u2019re such a worry wart,\u201d she said, not realizing that the bracelet was already shaking in Patty\u2019s purse and repositioning itself towards the catoblepas\u2019s wrist. \u201cWell, while I\u2019m on the phone, I\u2019d like to order some dinner for me and my husband. We\u2019ll take a large pizza with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, black olives and oregano. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEthiopia hung up the phone and then Masao tugged on her ear. \u201cOuch. Masao!\u201d \u201cEthiopia,\u201d said Masao to his enormous wife. \u201cIs it just me or is that bracelet moving.\u201d Ethiopia grunted in confusion and then spotted the bracelet twitching. \u201cWhat the? Yikes!\u201d Without warning, the bracelet clung to Ethiopia\u2019s wrist and tightened itself. This in turn caused Ethiopia to drop her sunglasses, which shattered on the ground, forcing her to close her eyes to avoid petrifying Masao as she screamed. \u201cEthiopia!\u201d yelled Masao. \u201cDon\u2019t look at my eyes! They\u2019re unprotected! You\u2019ll turn to stone!\u201d Masao instead looked at Ethiopia\u2019s butt that was already expanding and knocked over their coffee table. \u201cUh, Ethiopia,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks like Patty was right.\u201d Ethiopia let out a grumble and then there was a knock on the door. \u201cCrap,\u201d muttered the wildebeest giantess. \u201cI can\u2019t answer the door in this condition. It\u2019s unlocked! Come inside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028\u2028The door opened and in walked...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the bus, Claire was still arguing on the phone. \u201cListen here,\u201d said the chameleon giantess as she grit her teeth. \u201cYou\u2019re treading on thin ice. I am warning you, you are making a powerful enemy. I am going to tell everyone around Direopolis that you are an incompetent halfwit who couldn\u2019t put together a gazebo if you had the blueprints tattooed to your body! I should\u2019ve just hired Trini! I can\u2019t believe that even Pam would recommend an a-hole like you!\u201d As Claire hung up, she let out a yell of frustration. \u201cIt\u2019s people like those who are what\u2019s wrong with the.... huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire noticed Patty\u2019s purse right next to her and then picked it up. Before she spoke, Claire noticed a dragonfly flying overhead and flicked out her tongue to pull it into her mouth, chew it like bubblegum and swallow it. \u201cThis is Patty\u2019s purse. She must\u2019ve left it on the bus. I\u2019ll just take this to the hotel\u2019s lost and found.\u201d Claire then held up her cell phone and went to her day planner before typing \u201cCall Patty\u201d and \u201cReturn Purse\u201d onto her to-do list. Suddenly the phone begun to ring because Claire got another call and then answered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d asked Claire. \u201cCalm down, Xandra. I can barely hear you. What!? Oh no, he ****ing didn\u2019t. I\u2019m really sorry, but if I were you, I\u2019d call that San Francisco lawyer, Kate Rowling. She\u2019d destroy him. Excuse me? And why should I get married? Give me one good reason. Xandra, you can\u2019t be serious. I\u2019m not mother material. Besides, have you seen the size of my butt? I can\u2019t sit on an egg. I\u2019d break it. Get off my case. A lot of girls stuff themselves when they get stressed out.\u201d As Claire was busy yammering away, she didn\u2019t notice that the second hippo queen bracelet was shaking in Patty\u2019s purse and sensed Claire\u2019s wrist nearby. The bracelet flew onto Claire\u2019s wrist and squeezed itself tight until it was too tight to be removed before it started to glow. Claire was so busy speaking on the phone that she failed to notice the bracelet and she also failed to notice that her already huge and fat booty was expanding in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chameleon giantess let out a sigh and then noticed she had come to her stop. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you later. I just have to go and inspect the weak link in my hotel chain.\u201d The 875ft tall lizard woman placed her phone in her pocket and got up out of her bus seat. While her butt was already wider than she was tall, it had gotten so big that her mere motions broke the back of the bus seat. As Claire moved towards the front of the bus, her larger than usual Italian skirt wearing booty was pressing against the seats on both sides of the bus. At several points, she unknowingly whacked several other monster passengers in their faces and made them yelp. \u201cOw!\u201d yelled one werewolf girl as Claire hit her in the cheek with a butt cheek. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, fat ass!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire turned her head and gave a hiss at the wolf girl as she was about to step out the bus door. However, because her backside was expanding at a rapid rate, the moment she tried to climb out, the chameleon lady got stuck and grunted as she grit her teeth and tried to shake herself free. The green and slimy ectoplasmic ghost bus driver turned his head and gasped before he started to try and push Claire out the door, pressing his green translucent hands against Claire\u2019s planetary butt cheeks. \u201cI told the bus company to make those doors bigger,\u201d thought Claire to herself as she grit her teeth. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s my own fault since my diet is 75% donuts, humans and insects. Starting tomorrow, I\u2019m cutting back on the scorpions. Ugh!\u201d The bus driver finally managed to shove Claire\u2019s titanic butt through the door and Claire landed with a heavy pratfall outside the Direopolis Rainbow Tongue Hotel. Claire\u2019s butt was so big that the entire ground beneath her cracked apart and the cracks seeped into the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire stood up as the bus drove away and then took out her compact mirror to apply a fresh sheet of lipstick. The chameleon giantess was so busy tending to her face that she didn\u2019t notice that her ass was 2000ft tall and 3000ft wide. It was so big that the only thing covering it were her Jurassic Park undies. Unfortunately, the chameleon woman  closed her make up mirror before she could see just how extremely pear-shaped she had become and then took out her cellphone to text Patty as she was walking up to her hotel to inspect the place. Of course, the text that Patty sent back confused Claire. \"Whatever you do, Don't wear the bracelet? Bracelet? What bracelet? I didn't see a bracelet in the purse. Ugh. I have enough to worry about without crazy hippos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire walked into the hotel, her booty jiggled and shook with each step, not noticing that people were staring. The Frankenstein\u2019s monster doorman spotted Claire and looked in shock at his boss\u2019s more massive than normal hindquarters. Though he didn\u2019t say anything and just opened the door, not wanting to risk his job. Of course, Claire still noticed that her doorman was staring and raised one of her bulging cross eyes. \u201cIs there a problem, Khary?\u201d The Frankenstein shook his head and then detached his jaw to stow away in his pocket to prevent himself from saying anything that could and would get him into trouble. Claire just rolled her eyes. \u201cWeirdo.\u201d She thought to herself. As Claire walked into the lobby, she grunted and begun to slouch, not realizing it was because her growing booty was wreaking havoc on her spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGeez,\u201d thought the chameleon woman. \u201cMy back is killing me. All this stress must be affecting my body. Oh no. I\u2019m not calling that chiropractor that Pam recommended. He\u2019d probably turn my spine into a Picasso. I learned my lesson from those ****ing contractors. It would be easier if I just called two of my human employees to my office and had them work on my joints. At least humans can be useful, unlike some monsters I can name.\u201d While it was true that Claire was a monster that ate humans, she sometimes hired them as employees. Any human that worked for Claire was in no danger of being chameleon bait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire then walked up to the manager of the hotel and her mere presence intimidated her. The manager was an obese female wendigo with white fur over her body, a deer-like nose, razor sharp teeth and short pink hair. Unlike others of her kind, this wendigo didn't have horns. \"Ms. Melon?\" asked the wendigo. \"What are you doing here so early?\" \"Rebecca,\" said Claire to the wendigo. \"You do recall that the Ambassador of Neo Lemuria is going to be in town, right?\u201d \u201cYes, Ms. Melon.\u201d Said Rebecca as she stared at the chameleon lady\u2019s monstrous rear that was at this point even larger than its owner. \u201cWell,\u201d said Claire. \u201cHe\u2019s staying at the Rainbow Tongue Hotel and I don\u2019t want any monkey business. Their stay is to be perfect.\u201d Rebecca heard what Claire was saying but couldn\u2019t help but stare at Claire\u2019s ass and desperately tried to change the subject. \u201cDoesn\u2019t the ambassador have a fetish for reptilian monster girls, Ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you start that too. I want this hotel to be in perfect shape for when they come. We can\u2019t afford any foul ups.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire was continuing to speak, she noticed that crawling across the ground was a house centipede that was the size of a train to humans. The massive lizardess flicked out her rainbow-colored tongue and swallowed the centipede whole on the spot. She then turned to face Rebecca. \u201cThat centipede that I just ate,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the only bug I want to see in this hotel for a while. Everything must be perfect for the arrival of the ambassador, Rebecca. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wendigo\u2019s mind was elsewhere, namely on her boss\u2019s enormous booty. \u201cRebecca!\u201d yelled Claire startling the manager of her hotel. \u201cAm I clear?!\u201d Rebecca was startled but cleared her throat. \u201cAs clear as the ass under your tail, boss.\u201d Claire gave a shocked look and then gave a glare. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d the chameleon businesswoman asked. Rebecca bit her lip. \u201cYour ass, Ms. Melon,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s bigger than usual. It\u2019s more than twice your height.\u201d Claire flicked out her tongue and slapped Rebecca in the cheek as she grunted. \u201cI\u2019d be really careful about what I say if I were you, Rebecca. Urgh!\u201d Claire felt her back again and groaned. \u201cI\u2019ll be in my office. Please be a dear and send up two of our human employees, I don\u2019t care which ones, and tell them that I\u2019ll pay them extra if they can do something about this back pain I\u2019ve been having.\" With that, Claire walked up to the elevator and got inside. It took some effort because of the size of her rear but she managed to squeeze inside, still oblivious to how big her ass had gotten. The elevator was moving slowly as Claire's booty took up the entire thing. The chameleon woman grunted as she tried to reach down for her cell phone. \"Great,\" she muttered. \"What is with this elevator? I thought I made it clear that they were to be cleared for monsters as big as gargoyles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Claire was struggling, Carina was down the street grumbling to herself. Her butt was so big at this point that the gorgon's upper body was completely unseeable from the back. \"OF ALL THE ROTTEN LUCK! TRINI AND CRESCENT HAD TO CHOOSE <i>NOW</i> TO GO ON A SECOND HONEYMOON! AND TO TOP IT OFF, UNA'S SICK WITH THE FLU! HOW DOES A <i>WITCH DOCTOR</i> GET SICK! I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO TO... THEM... BUT WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE NOW! DAMN BRACELET! THIS IS YOUR FAULT! I JUST HOPE THEY'RE IN TOWN, UNLIKE A CERTAIN SABERTOOTH I KNOW!\"</span></div></div>",

Do you think she found out about that washing machine that we broke.\u201d The young woman gave a scoff. \u201cRelax, Craig. That thunder-thighed dinosaur doesn\u2019t have eyes in the back of her head and even if she did, her hunch back and massive booty would obscure them.\u201d \u201cBrenda,\u201d said Craig. \u201cShe\u2019s still our boss. Don\u2019t be so nasty. Working for a giant monster means we\u2019re safe from monsters that would eat us.\u201d \u201cHello, Craig! She eats humans too!\u201d \u201cNot humans that work for her.\u201d Craig and Brenda walked into the human-sized elevator in order to make it to Claire\u2019s office. \u201cHey,\u201d said Brenda. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you. But I\u2019m not going to be the slave to Godzilla\u2019s fashion challenged ex-wife for the rest of my life. Once I have the capital I need to put the Black Top in motion, I\u2019m going to tell Claire to stick it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig rolled his eyes as they reached the floor where Claire\u2019s office was. \u201cYou know, putting extra stress on Claire isn\u2019t a good idea. She\u2019s already pretty unstable as it is. Besides, I\u2019d say she\u2019s a decent person to work for.\u201d \u201cDecent person to work for? Craig, she\u2019s a literal monster.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s so bad.\u201d \u201cJust the other day, she screamed at me just because I was late for work and told me that I\u2019d be fired if it happened again.\u201d \u201cBrenda, you were 2 HOURS late for work. That would make any boss mad.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Brenda. \u201cOne of these days, I\u2019m going to tell that chameleon...\u201d Before Brenda could say another word, she had to stop in her tracks to avoid being stepped on by a werehyena maid that had just finished tidying a guest\u2019s hotel room. \u201cWatch where you\u2019re going, moron!\u201d yelled Brenda up to the large maid. The hyena giantess glared down at Brenda before Craig waved his arms at her. \u201cShe didn\u2019t mean it, Juliet! Honest!\u201d Fortunately for Brenda, Juliet had work to do and stomped away to clean the next room. \u201cBrenda,\u201d said Craig. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t that nice. You know Juliet has bad eyesight.\u201d \u201cThat thing nearly killed us! And what\u2019s the idea calling her by her name?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s our coworker.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s a hyena!\u201d \u201cListen. Let\u2019s agree to disagree. Ms. Melon won\u2019t like it if we keep her waiting too long.\u201d Craig went ahead as Brenda rolled her eyes. \u201cI was getting my nails done the other day. So eat me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCraig and Brenda reached the door to Claire\u2019s office and walked under it. \u201cLow,\u201d said Claire. \u201cDevon. Where are you two?\u201d \u201cDown here, Ms. Melon!\u201d shouted Craig. \u201cYou called.\u201d \u201cYes, I did,\u201d replied Craig with a groan. \u201cMy back is killing me. I don\u2019t even know why.\u201d Brenda gave a scoff. \u201cSee what I mean,\u201d she whispered to Craig, making sure that Claire couldn\u2019t hear her. \u201cShe only called us in here for a massage.\u201d Craig then blew on his finger. \u201cI am willing to pay you overtime for this.\u201d Said Claire. \u201cRight on it, ma\u2019am.\u201d Said Brenda changing her tone. That was when Brenda and Craig looked up in surprise as they saw Claire\u2019s enormous rear that was now so big that it was pushing the back of her red hair up and had completely swallowed her hunchback. Both tiny humans couldn\u2019t believe what they saw and since Claire didn\u2019t know about her butt being so enormous, she was completely confused. \u201cWhat?\u201d she asked impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...\u201d muttered Craig. \u201cNothing.\u201d Claire rolled her eyes and held out her hand for her human-sized employees to crawl onto before she placed them both on the back of her neck. \u201cDang,\u201d muttered Craig. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any back anymore with a butt this big. Claire always did have a rather big butt but not like this.\u201d \u201cGuess all those donuts at that monster trap run by those lunatics finally caught up with her.\u201d Both Brenda and Craig had to climb onto Claire\u2019s large behind in order to settle her back pain and Claire mumbled as the two humans walked on her back and then took out a guest book to go through. \u201cAmbassadors are such a pain,\u201d the chameleon thought to herself. \u201cEverything had better go right. Ooh!\u201d Brenda\u2019s heels had dug into Claire\u2019s behind and even after 10 minutes, neither human was even halfway to the top. Craig even poked the fleshy silver wall. \u201cThere is no way she got this pear-shaped by binging on donuts,\u201d muttered Craig. \u201cDo you think she knows?\u201d \u201cNo way, Craig,\u201d said Brenda. \u201cAnd don\u2019t tell her. If she thinks we\u2019re being insulting, you had better hope she swallowed an unemployment office.\u201d Claire took out her cell phone to check e-mails as she continued to moan from Brenda and Craig\u2019s movement. \u201cWhat\u2019s taking them so long? It doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re at the top. Maybe I should\u2019ve asked a monster to massage me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire went through her e-mail folder and started to delete junk files as she gave a hiss. \u201c****ing junk mail. It\u2019s bad enough in the real world, but in the virtual one?\u201d At that moment, Brenda and Craig were at the top of Claire\u2019s rear and they both looked down to see they were more than twice as high as Claire\u2019s head. \u201cShe had better make good on that overtime.\u201d Said Brenda as she kicked back and laid down while Craig was getting to work with the massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Claire was checking her e-mail, she looked on her wrist and noticed Patty\u2019s bracelet as her cross eyes focused on it and blinked in confusion. \u201cWhere did this bracelet come from?\u201d thought the chameleon giantess. \u201cI don\u2019t remember putting on this bracelet. Heck. I don\u2019t even remember buying this bracelet. Wait. This must be Patty\u2019s. It has to be. It looks like the type of jewelry a werehippo would wear. Wait, didn\u2019t Patty explicitly tell me NOT to put on this bracelet?! But I didn\u2019t put it on. It must be sentient jewelry! It must\u2019ve attached to my wrist when I wasn\u2019t looking. I hate these Egyptian artifacts. They almost always have a nasty curse on them! And just my luck. My insurance policy doesn\u2019t cover Egyptian magic. I don\u2019t even think I want to know what this curse does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside of the hotel, Carina was wondering what to do about her growing booty and grumbled. \u201cWHAT TO DO?! WHAT TO DO!? WHAT TO DO?!\u201d Rebecca walked out, hearing Carina\u2019s shouting. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled the wendigo. \u201cThis is a hotel. Some of the guests might be trying to sleep. Please keep it down. We\u2019re expecting a very important client.\u201d Carina raised an eyebrow before she saw a newspaper vending machine. She put in a quarter with a crossbones symbol on it before she took out the paper and read it. \u201cAMBASSADOR OF NEO-LEMURIA TO VISIT DIREOPOLIS!\u201d Carina put down the newspaper and rubbed her chin. \u201cHMMM,\u201d thought Carina as loudly as she normally spoke. \u201cDOESN\u2019T THE AMBASSADOR OF NEO-LEMURIA HAVE AN INTEREST IN REPTILE GIRLS?! THIS MIGHT GET MY MIND OFF OF THIS STUPID BRACELET AND THE STUPID CURSE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a loud crash that caused Carina\u2019s snake hair to stand on in as their eyes popped out in fear. \u201cWHAT THE HECK WAS THAT!?\u201d The crash had come from Claire\u2019s office, as her enormous behind was too much for her chair to hold and it collapsed under the chameleon giantess\u2019s mass. In the process, Craig and Brenda slid down Claire\u2019s mountainous backside and screamed. Craig managed to save himself from falling by grabbing hold of Claire\u2019s curved tail. Brenda however, slipped and fell in the back of Claire\u2019s panties and was wedged between the two \u201cmountains\u201d. Craig looked down in surprise at Brenda\u2019s position as the acid tongued human was pushed between the walls of silver chameleon flesh. \u201cThis is officially the lowest point in my career.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire got up and gave a groan as she felt one of her thighs in pain. \u201cOw,\u201d moaned the werelizard titaness. \u201cDefective chair. Huh?\u201d Claire felt around her thighs and then she moved her head and finally noticed how enormous her ass had become. She looked like she was about to have a heart attack when she saw exactly how large she had become and her face turned a paler shade of silver than usual and then her jaw dropped as she put a clawed hand to her head. Craig managed to climb to the top of the mountainous chameleon rear and gave a look of fear as one of Claire\u2019s eyes twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack down the street, Patty was running as fast as she could towards the Rainbow Tongue Hotel, with Wes on her shoulder. Of course, that wasn\u2019t particularly fast and Patty had to stop to catch her breath. \u201cIt\u2019s days like this,\u201d said the werehippo giantess. \u201cThat I really regret not taking driver\u2019s ed.\u201d \u201cMaybe you should spend more time in the pool and less time in the kitchen.\u201d Said Wes. Patty then let out a groan. \u201cI really hope that Claire hasn\u2019t put that bracelet on. The last thing we need is for two monster girls under that butt expansion curse.\u201d \u201cOh come on,\u201d said Wes. \u201cClaire doesn\u2019t even wear jewelry except for formal occasions.\u201d \u201cExcept that there\u2019s an ambassador coming to her hotel today, Wes. Claire would want to make a good impression.\" Suddenly, Patty's cell phone begun to ring. \"Hello?\" asked the werehippo woman. \"Rebecca? You're kidding me! Carina's outside the hotel too?!\" Patty hung up and then started to run on all fours this time. \"Nothing's ever easy.\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that...</span></div></div>",

You know how nasty that marble muncher can be when she\u2019s stressed out.\u201d Pam gave a snort as she was sorting the donuts and putting sprinkles on a pumpkin donut. \u201cYou know, Patty has been really pushy lately.\u201d \u201cWes, too,\u201d mutters Norman. \u201cThose two deserve each other.\u201d Patty is about to walk up to the grill but Salli stops her. \u201cUh-uh,\u201d she says. \u201cI handle the grill while Patty\u2019s away.\u201d \u201cAnd why is that, hose nose?\u201d \u201cBecause you only know how to cook donuts.\u201d Norman let out a sigh as he held onto his wife\u2019s ear. \u201cShe\u2019s got you there, honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam gave a snort but as she turned her head, she gasped. \u201cSalli!\u201d she yelled. \u201cLook!\u201d Salli turned her head and hovered over her porcine sister-in-law before Allen gasped. As it turned out, the second hippo queen bracelet was still on the kitchen counter. \u201cThe other bracelet,\u201d said Allen. \u201cPatty must\u2019ve forgot it when she went out.\u201d Salli let out a laugh. \u201cShe should\u2019ve trusted me to take it to her safe. Elephants never forget.\u201d Allen gave a gulp. \u201cWell, we better keep it someplace safe before somebody else wears it and ends up in the same boat as Carina.\u201d Norman gave a scoff. \u201cCome on, Al,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t you like to see what Salli would look like if she was as big butted as Patty?\u201d Allen actually thought about that but then he shook his head. \u201cSalli! Don\u2019t listen to him. It\u2019s your belly that\u2019s my favorite part of you.\u201d Salli let out a sigh. \u201cWell, whatever happens we can\u2019t let anyone wear that bracelet. It\u2019s not leaving the kitchen and Pam, don\u2019t even go anywhere near it. I\u2019m going to see if any customers came in while Patty was away. Don\u2019t let that thing leave the kitchen.\u201d Pam gave a snort. \u201cWhat do I look like, an idiot? Sheesh.

In no time at all, Pam's butt was expanding and caused her dark yellow jeans to tear, leaving her peacock print underwear exposed. Pam was squealing with glee as if she was in the middle of a sugar rush. \"I can feel it,\" said the winged pig woman. \"I can definitely feel it. This is going to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam's butt had gotten so big that it pushed the table in the center of the kitchen into the wall and was in plain view of Norman and Allen.

Why oh why did I do that?!\" Pam squealed in despair as Patty and Allen rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman jumped on his wife's larger than normal butt and climbed up her blonde hair to reach her ear. \"It's okay, Pam.

Oof!\" On her way out, Pam's chocolate-colored porcine booty was stuck in the back door. Pam snorted and tried to flap her wings but she was stuck. Salli and Allen grabbed their brows and let out a sigh. \"My idiot brother's idiot wife.\" Mumbled Allen. \"Uh,\" said Pam. \"A little help, Salli.\" Salli stepped up to Pam's enormous butt and then gave a smirk that showed off her fangs. \"Oh,\" she said. \"I'm going to enjoy this.\" Salli levitated in the air and then held out her feet before she brought them down in Pam's ass, pushing it through the door and making the pig woman squeal loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam landed butt first on the pavement and snorted before she realized something. \"Norman?\" asked the wereboar. \"Norman! Where are you!?\" Pam then heard mumbling from under her ginormous butt and then got up to learn she had sat on Norman and her dazed husband was flattened like a tattoo on her right butt cheek. \"Oh my gosh!\" yelled Pam. \"Norman! I'm sorry!\" \"It's okay, Honey,\" said Norman. \"But now I know how Wes feels.\" Pam tried to reach down for her husband, only for her to learn that her butt was now so enormous that she couldn't even reach. Pam grunted and tried to reach Norman and tried flapping her wings to fly. However, because of how big her rear had gotten and how small her wings were in comparison, the boar woman only succeeded in prat falling five times in a row. Pam stood up and it looked like she would cry but then heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL IT LOOKS LIKE SOME STUPID PIG COULDN'T KEEP THEIR BIG OLD SNOUT WHERE IT DIDN'T BELONG, IT LOOKS LIKE!\" Pam turned her head and saw Carina and Carina's butt was even bigger than it was before. \"Carina,\" said Pam. \"Oh, am I glass to see you.\" Carina bent over, crushing the dumpster in back of Neo Neapolitan with her own butt as she peeled Norman off of Pam's butt and handed him to his porcine wife. Pam stuck Norman's flattened form into her nose and then snorted in order to restore him to normal. \"Thanks, Carina,\" said Norman. \"Boy, was that a harrowing ordeal.\" \"AND THIS ISN'T!?\" yelled Carina as she pointed to her big butt and revealed that she was reduced to wearing her panties as her pants were shredded up to the waistband. \"WHAT AM I GOING TO DO IF MY BUM GETS ANY BIGGER! I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ME FROM NOW ON!\" Pam then panicked and covered Carina's mouth. \"Not so loud, Carina! If Patty hears you, she'll realize that I put her mom's second bracelet on and then I'd be in big trouble. We need to get these bracelets off as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Pam grunted and so did Carina. \"WHAT THE *****!?\" yelled Carina as she held up her bracelet that was twitching. Pam held up her own bracelet and saw it was twitching too. Suddenly both of the bracelets started to glow and the jewels sparked out magical energy until the bracelets were pulled to one each other and let out a flash of light, making Carina and Pam yell as Pam and Norman covered their eyes. When the light cleared, both Pam and Carina's bracelets had mysteriously transformed into a pair of golden handcuffs, each cuff resembling a snake with a hippopotamus's head. The cuff on Pam's wrist had sapphires for eyes while the cuff on Carina's wrist had rubies for eyes. \"Oh no.\" Muttered Norman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam and Carina dropped their jaws and then held up the magical handcuffs and bit their lips. \"Patty is totally going to kill us.\" Mumbled Pam. \"DON'T PANIC!\" yelled Carina. \"THERE MUST BE SOMEBODY IN TOWN WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET THESE OFF! COME THIS WAY!\" Carina pulled Pam as she walked one way and Pam muttered before she tried to walk in another direction and jerked Carina. Both giant women kept on tugging until eventually...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bracelet landed on Salli\u2019s wrist and Salli gasped. \u201cOh no!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cSalli!\u201d shouted Allen in fear of what would become of his vampire-loxodon wife. Salli grunted and put her hands on the ground as she groaned and trumpeted out loud. \"Oh dear.\" Said the elephantine vampire. In no time at all, the bracelet's magic went to work and Salli's butt started to expand, brushing up against all of Patty's frying pans and making them clatter. Salli's stood up and accidentally knocked over all of the frying pans on the ground, one of which landed on Pam's foot as Pam yelled in pain. \"Yikes,\" said Norman. \"Maybe this wasn't a good idea.\" Allen was panicked at the sight of his wife's growing ass and saw the loxodon goth girl's already minuscule tail was practically nonexistent as the giantess looked back in horror at her immense booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" she said. \"Pam! Look what you've done! If you had only left that stupid bracelet alone! This wouldn't have happened!\" Allen was at first horrified at what had become of his wife but looked up to see nothing but vampire elephant ass for what seemed like miles and her black skirt was getting smaller, exposing turquoise panties with black bat designs on them. Allen's jaw dropped and he coughed a few times as he felt his nose. He looked at his hand and saw that he was bleeding. \"Great Achilles,\" said Allen. \"It's even bigger than her perfect belly.\" Salli stroked her booty with her trunk and bit her lip with her fangs. \"Patty is going to kill us when she finds out what happened.\" \"Calm down, Salli. We just need to wait for Neith and Carter to return from vacation and...\" \"You don't get it!\" yelled Salli angrily. Salli held up her umbrella and opened it up. The umbrella covered every part of her body except for her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to wait until it gets dark to return home.\" Groaned Salli. Salli may have had the body of an anthropomorphic elephant, but she was still half vampire and couldn't go out in the daylight without burning herself and that enormous booty would be too big to keep out of the sun. Pam poked Salli's rear with one of Patty's spatulas and made her groan. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"That's going to be hard to keep out of the sun.\" Allen saw Salli's tail wagging in front of himself and jumped up and grabbed the elephant tail in order to climb up her massive booty. \"Don't look down!\" yelled Norman. Allen did just that and looked in fear at how high up he was. Allen should've been used to it given how big Salli was, but Salli's butt was now so enormous that she seemed that it seemed like crouched down, she was bigger than she would if she stood up. Allen climbed the space between his wife's butt cheeks until he reached her raven hair and then climbed up to the top of her head as she extended her fanged trunk to his level. \"You know, Salli,\" said Allen. \"You look more beautiful than usual with an ass like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalli gave a trumpet and stroked her husband's head, but then Pam pointed something out. \"A few more customers just came in, Sal.\" Salli gave a gasp. \"But I can't go out looking like this. After what happened with Carina.\" \"Well, you're the waitress here. Besides, you're the one whose job it is to remember what who ordered.\" Allen slid down and climbed up Salli's trunk and saw another customer come into the dining area and his eyes popped out. \"Oh no.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customer who came in was wearing a trenchcoat and hat that obscured his entire body and when he reached a seat, he revealed his true form beneath the suit. He was a 300ft blue-skinned vampire with light gray hair and a mustache with sharp yellowish white fangs and sideburns like that of an ape. He was wearing a white suit with a black and red cape. This vampire was Salli\u2019s father, Demitri. Salli was the result of a mixed marriage. While Demitri was a vampire, Salli\u2019s mother, Elektra was an Asian loxodon, hence why Salli was the world\u2019s only vampire elephant. However, Demitri and Elektra\u2019s marriage fell apart after a while and they divorced back when Salli was barely a preteen. Demitri won custody of Salli and raised her while Elektra moved back to Terrordale. Despite the fact that Salli was as an adult more than 4 times the size of her father, she got along well with Damian and was a Grade A Daddy\u2019s Girl. Unlike Elektra who devoured every human she saw, Demitri was completely harmless to humans and approved of Salli\u2019s marriage to Allen. Though he did warn him that there would be hell to pay if he ever made Salli cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing Demitri, Allen climbed down his wife's trunk to tell her about who walked in. \"Salli. Your dad just walked in.\" Salli gave a gasp. \"Daddy?\" she asked. \"Oh no. He can't see me like... ugh!\" Salli's butt had expanded again and then crushed the door of the refrigerator in the kitchen. \"Well,\" said Pam. \"At the rate your ass is getting bigger, it will be harder and harder to hide it. You won't be able to ignore the elephant in the room any longer.\" Salli gave a glare at Pam. \"Really?\" she asked. Pam laughed nervously. \"Poor choice of words,\" she said. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Demitri (among other customers) was waiting for Salli to take his order. \"Where is that girl?\" asked the vampire. \"It's not like her to be late.\" \"I'm coming!\" yelled Salli from the kitchen. \"It might just take a while.\" It was there Demitri heard a crashing sound. \"What the hell!?\" Salli at that moment was coming out of the kitchen but her butt was so big that it got stuck in the doorway and couldn't budge an inch. The other customers turned their heads and looked in surprise at Salli while on the other side, Pam was trying to push her sister-in-law through the door. \"It's no use,\" said Norman. \"That thing is bigger than Patty's ass. It's not budging.\" Salli then held a spatula over one of the burners on the oven and then after 30 seconds she whacked Salli's ass with the spatula, causing her to leap screaming out the kitchen door. She had to levitate through her telekinesis in order to avoid prat falling and turning the floor into a jigsaw puzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Demitri saw what had become of Salli, he very nearly had a heart attack. \u201cSalli!?\u201d he yelled in shock. Salli gave a nervous trumpet. \u201cHi, Daddy.\u201d Demitri could not believe how large his daughter\u2019s butt had become. Sure, she was an elephant monster and was chubby and large since the day she was born but Salli\u2019s rear was now twice as tall as she was and even wider. Demitri levitated to his pachyderm daughter and saw that her rear had stretched out her turquoise bat printed panties. \u201cSalli, what happened? Have you been drinking the blood of pro athletes? Didn\u2019t I tell you those veins were tainted?\u201d Demitri even poked one of Salli\u2019s cheeks as it rippled and then Allen climbed down from Salli\u2019s hair to speak with his father-in-law. \u201cSalli accidentally put on one of Patty\u2019s mom\u2019s bracelets and it made her butt enormous.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Demitri. \u201cEgyptian magic? Phooey. Everything with them is cursed. This is worse than that time Coffin, Cauldron &amp; Century got me confused with another customer and sent me a sarcophagus. How do those walking bandages sleep in a hard unpadded bed. Wait? Where\u2019s the other bracelet.\u201d Patty blushed, causing color to come to her otherwise dark vanilla cheeks. \"On a gorgon, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDemitri gave a hiss and grabbed the bracelet with two hands as he pressed his feet on one of his daughter's massive butt cheeks and attempted to pull off the bracelet. However, Demitri was not nearly as strong as his daughter or her equally titanic friends and was groaning as his lifeless face turned purple from exertion. \"It's no use, Demitri!\" yelled Allen. \"We tried! Only Neith knows how to remove those bracelets!\" Demitri didn't listen and pulled so hard he only succeeded in pulling himself out of his shoes and crashing into the wall. Demitri sprung up and groaned. \"This is going to take some thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Patty and Wes were returning back to Neo Neapolitan and Patty was incensed at the fact she forgot to bring the second bracelet with her. She glared at Wes and showed her enormous teeth. \"I didn't say anything,\" said Wes to his werehippo wife. \"Nothing at all.\" \"Then don't stop,\" said Patty. \"The last thing I need is a sarcastic husband at a time like this.\" But as Patty walked inside, the first thing she saw was a Vanilla-colored booty, bigger than her entire body and covered in turquoise bat-printed panties. \"What the?!\" Patty leaving the door open, let the sunlight in and it touched Salli's rear and set it on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire loxodon screamed in pain and then ran around, knocking over tables in her attempt to put the fire out. Several of the customers were tossed around in the confusion and grunted before Demitri ran in the way of his daughter. \"Salli! Stop! Drop! Roll!\" Salli did as her father said, unfortunately, when she got to the roll part, she accidentally rolled over, butt first on top of Demitri and flattened him like a cartoon character. \"Ow.\" Muttered the male vampire. Patty at this point noticed the second bracelet on Salli's backside and was flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave you two alone for a minute,\" said Patty. \"Which numbskull thought it would be a good idea to try that stupid bracelet on?\" Salli then pointed to Pam and Allen did as well. Pam crossed her arms. \"Tattlers.\" She moaned.</span></div></div>",

STUPID HIPPOPOTAMUS ROUND! STUPID NEO NEAPOLITAN! STUPID EVERYTHING! I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING! I WENT TO THE <i>MAD</i> DOCTOR, SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING! I WENT TO THE <i>WITCH</i> DOCTOR, SHE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING!\" Carina lowered her head and then screamed into her own breasts. \"I'M DOOMED!\" thought the gorgon to herself. Even in her thoughts, Carina was as loud and boisterous as ever and it showed. \"I CAN'T WAIT FOR A FEW WEEKS JUST SO PATTY'S MOM CAN COME HOME AND REMOVE THESE BRACELETS. I WANT THEM OFF NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina gave a grumble and tried to wheel up a steep hill. However, her wheelchair couldn't take the long uphill trip, especially when it was carrying so much weight as well and Carina wound up falling back and letting out a yell. In the process, she bit her tongue and moaned in pain right before she accidentally knocked several monsters out of her way. In the process, the wheels on Carina's wheelchair snapped off and the gorgon giantess had to hold on tight as her chair spun out of control. She was heading straight for the Huffington autoshop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the garage was Beatrix, the daughter of the Huffington family of mechanics. Beatrix was a 777ft tall basilisk resembling a yellow and gray anthropomorphic puff adder with arms and legs. She was busy trying to fix a monster truck when she heard Carina yelling. Beatrix turned her head and spotted Carina before she jumped out of the way right as Carina came in and flattened the monster truck beneath her massive hulk. \"OW!\" yelled Carina as she laid upside down with her ginormous rear in the air. Beatrix looked at her fellow snake-like monster and was shocked at how bottom heavy Carina had become. \"Ms. Veldarez?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarina crossed her arms before a male voice yelled out loud. \"I mean it, Blunk! If I catch you trying to steal my cable again, I'm calling the rangers! You have no right criticizing that boy of yours when you're the one doing something clearly illegal! You're a hypocritical jerk who hates animals and can't be bothered to acknowledge that all of your problems are self-inflicted! Now stay away from my property before I show you why it's a bad idea to pick a fight with a basilisk!\" Beatrix let out a sigh. \"Oh boy,\" she groaned. \"Dad's fighting with the neighbors again.\" Beatrix's father walked down into the garage mumbling to himself. He was a basilisk resembling an anthropomorphic death adder with a skull-shaped marking on the side of his head. He was chomping a cigar as he entered the garage. \"Beatrix?\" asked Mr. Huffington. \"What was that noise? What the Sam Hill!?\" When the older basilisk spotted Carina, his cigar fell out of his mouth and burned him in the foot, causing him to yell in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Huffington turned to his daughter before he tried to reach around his jacket for a replacement cigar. \"Why is that tinnitus factory in our garage? Why is her rear enormous? And what has she done to the Leeds' car!?\" Beatrix bit her lip. \"Is it okay if I can only answer the last question?\" \"WILL YOU TWO STOP GAWKING AND HELP ME ALREADY!? WHOA!\" Beatrix fell back and landed with a crash. Mr. Huffington let out a groan before he took out some bubble gum to chew it. \"First the newspaper insults me on the front page, then Blunk tries to steal my cable and now this. Something always happens to me during spring break.\" Carina let out a mumble. \"WELL MY WHEELCHAIR FELL APART! AND THAT'S AFTER I GOT THIS BRACELET STUCK TO ME THAT MAKES MY BUTT ENORMOUS!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeatrix looked up at Carina's backside and then looked at her own backside. \"I gotta rethink my weekly binge of mango donuts.\" Thought the teenage basilisk to herself. Carina looked down through cracked glasses and saw something interesting in the newspaper right next to an article that was titled \"You Stink, Roland Huffington!\" \"Monster Truck Race this Thursday. First place prize: a trip to Paris. That's where Patty's mom is, right now.\" That's when Carina had an idea to try and remove the bracelet sooner.</span></div></div>",

I won\u2019t touch it.\u201d Salli rolled her eyes and then levitated herself out of the kitchen with Allen on her shoulder. She was looking around to look for customers that had yet to order. The first customer that she spotted was Pinky Ringmoore, a 950ft tall and chubby hourglass-shaped harpy with the wings and talons of a flamingo and long rose-colored hair.Pinky was a teacher at the local high school and had dressed up as a Mexican masked wrestler initially as a way to intimidate any potential troublemakers. But the costume started to influence her to the point where she saw herself as a real masked wrestler. \u201cHi, Pinky,\u201d said Salli. \u201cEnjoying your spring break?\u201d Pinky gave a smile. \u201cYou bet I am, Salli. No papers to grade, no delinquents to pile drive. Just one big fiesta.\u201d \u201cWhat will it be today?\u201d Pinky let out a laugh. \u201cBring me three Hawaiian meringue donuts and a strawberry shake.\u201d \u201cGot it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Salli was floating by, she heard a voice calling to her. \u201cHey, Sal. Where was Patty off to in such a hurry.\u201d Salli turned her head and saw the next customer was Patty\u2019s friend Vienna. Vienna was a jazz singer and a chubby, gold-skinned gargoyle with long golden brown hair, cat-like ears, bat-like wings and a face resembling that of a fanged ape of some sort. She also had lactose overload syndrome which made her breasts quite large. \u201cOh, Vienna! I didn\u2019t know you were in town. Patty just had to go home and put away a dangerous artifact.\u201d Vienna let out a laugh that made her breasts shake. \u201cThat\u2019s just like Patty.\u201d \u201cWhat can I get you, V?\u201d \u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d asked Vienna. \u201cThe 13 cheese pizza, extra large, please. But no jalape\u00f1os. I hate jalape\u00f1os.\u201d Salli gave a trumpet. Vienna had somewhat of an obsession with cheese. Some people thought it was due to her LOS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllen then heard a door open and then tugged on Salli\u2019s earring to get her to turn her head. She spotted one of the local mountain rangers, Delphine Dare. Delphine was an hourglass-shaped teal-skinned and violet haired weredolphin resembling a humanoid porpoise. She looked glum. The fact was Delphine was a complete klutz prone to overreacting, jumping to conclusions and making up tall tales to salvage her ego. Delphine was for the most part, not very good at her job. \u201cHey, Delphine,\u201d said Salli. \u201cYou look like you could use some cheering up.\u201d Delphine let out a sigh and waved her hand. \u201cHi, Salli. Just get me a stack of chocolate chip pancakes with some orange soda. I need something good to help me forget about this bad day. And no, it\u2019s none of your business.\u201d Salli trumpeted before she started to float away. \u201cDelphine doesn\u2019t seem like herself today, does she?\u201d asked Allen. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look that way, Honey.\u201d Said Salli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the door opened again and another female customer came in. \u201cWell, look who\u2019s already hard at work.\u201d Salli turned and looked in surprise. The woman who came in was an enormous and fat minotaur resembling a cross between an American buffalo and a Native American woman. She had copper-colored fur and long black hair with an enormous udder and was wearing a black shirt, blue jeans and a pair of thin glasses. Her name was Corona Poe and not only was she a famous actress, but she was Wes, Allen and Norman\u2019s stepsister. \u201cCorona!\u201d yelled Salli as she floated forward and hugged her sister-in-law. \u201cWhat are you doing in town?\u201d Corona let out a sigh. \u201cWell, they finally finished shooting G.R.U.B. and I decided to pay my brothers and their wives a visit.\u201d \u201cHi, Corona.\u201d Said Allen. Corona smiled and then held out a finger for Allen to climb on before she kissed him, being absolutely careful not to accidentally swallow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d said Corona. \u201cWhere are Patty and Wes?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Allen. \u201cThey went to take a dangerous artifact and put it in their safe but they forgot to bring it with them.\u201d Corona let out a laugh. \u201cYou are so lucky that you married a loxodon, Allen. You and Wes always did have all the taste in the family.\u201d Pam looked out through the kitchen and gave a stressed out squeal. \u201cOh! That cow just had to walk in!\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Norman. \u201cEasy, Pam. She\u2019s still my sister.\u201d Pam gave a snort. \u201cI\u2019m sure the moment I step out, your sister is going to blast me with a barrage of insults. No thanks.\u201d While Corona got along well with her other 2 sisters-in-law, she and Pam didn\u2019t get along well. Corona\u2019s human boyfriend was devoured by a wereboar years ago and Corona obtained a severe dislike of wereboars like Pam since then. Pam watched as Salli took Corona\u2019s order and snorted. \u201cI\u2019ll bet she made a condescending remark about me just now. I\u2019d like to fix her good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Salli returned to the kitchen. \u201cOkay,\u201d said Allen. \u201cDelphine ordered pancakes, Corona burgers, Vienna pizza and Pinky donuts.\u201d \u201cI can remember all that, Allen.\u201d \u201cYeah, but with Patty out, you have to do all the cooking.\u201d Salli gave a trumpet. \u201cI think that I can handle it.\u201d However, Pam still had the second hippo queen bracelet on the table and it wasn\u2019t long before it was unknowingly placed on a plate heading towards a customer. But which one?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Besides, it would be a whole lot more unpleasant if mom came in.\u201d Norman grumbled. \u201cOf all the monsters, our stepmother had to be a minotaur.\u201d It wasn\u2019t long before Salli took out Vienna\u2019s pizza and Pam snorted as she gave a look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor crying out loud, Sal. Is there any crust underneath that hunk of cheese. Vienna eats so much cheese I sometimes think she\u2019s part wererat.\u201d \u201cNot likely, Pam,\u201d said Allen. \u201cWererats are viviparous whereas gargoyles are oviparous.\u201d \u201cYeah, Pam,\u201d said Norman with a scoff. \u201cEven I could tell you that gargoyles were... oviraptors.\u201d Salli then sniffed the pizza and then briefly turned pale blue with disgust. \u201cThis must be really good cheese. Ugh. It\u2019s almost as bad as garlic. Pam, could you deliver this to Vienna? My trunk feels like it\u2019s on fire.\u201d Allen gave an uneasy look. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s a good idea for Pam to help us wait tables?\u201d Pam gave a snort. \u201cWhat do you think I am, incompetent?\u201d Salli gave a trumpet and then put the pizza on a plate and was about to put down the pizza paddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Salli dropped one of her earrings on the floor and bent over to pick it up as Pam was taking the pizza to Vienna and the donuts to Pinky. In the process, she accidentally moved the pizza paddle dangerously close to the second bracelet that was left out on the table. But at that moment she heard Carina shouting \u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN UNA IS SICK!? I THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS A WITCH DOCTOR! DOCTORS DON\u2019T GET SICK!\u201d Carina\u2019s shouting startled Salli and caused her to accidentally flip the bracelet into the air with the pizza paddle and when she turned her head, she hit the second bracelet like a baseball and it landed in the center of the pizza that Pam was taking out. In the commotion, Allen fell into his wife\u2019s ear with a yell. Salli gave a grumble. \u201cOh, that Carina! She\u2019s halfway down the street and I can still hear her. I hate my elephant ears!\u201d \u201cHelp!\u201d yelled Allen from inside Salli\u2019s eardrum, further alarming the loxodon-vampire hybrid. Salli plucked Allen out of her ear and groaned. \u201cAllen,\u201d she said. \u201cCarina nearly gave me tinnitus so I would appreciate it if you did the same. Salli placed her husband in the kitchen sink to wash the earwax off of himself before she took out Delphine\u2019s pancakes and Corona\u2019s burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Pam handed Pinky her order of donuts, she walked up to Vienna\u2019s table where Vienna was smiling and salivating at the scent of cheese. \u201cThanks, Pam,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to enjoy this.\u201d Vienna messily bit into a slice of pizza and then licked some splattered cheese off of her enormous medicine ball-sized breasts. \u201cHow can you eat that?\u201d asked Norman. \u201cIt smells like a zombie\u2019s sock drawer.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s cheese, Norman,\u201d said Vienna. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to smell terrible. That means it\u2019s good.\u201d Corona was nearby and was stuffing her face with burger. \u201cPizza is okay, but give me burgers any day. By the way, Vienna. Starlight Virgo did awesome at the box office. The studio is considering  putting the two of us in another flick together.\u201d Vienna gave a smile and blushed. \u201cTo be perfectly honest,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m built for singing, not acting. I\u2019m certainly no Corona Poe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vienna was continuing her meal, she spotted the second bracelet in the center of her pie. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d asked the gargoyle giantess as she picked up the bracelet. \u201cOh, it looks like one of Neith\u2019s bracelets. It must\u2019ve fallen into the pizza.\u201d Norman and Pam gasped as they spotted the bracelet. \u201cVienna!\u201d yelled Norman. \u201cWhatever you do, do not put that bracelet on.\u201d Vienna rolled her eyes. \u201cNorman, do I look like I need to wear any more jewelry?\u201d As Vienna said this, she pointed to her earrings, necklace, ankle bracelets and finally to her tiara. It\u2019s unknown why Vienna wore a tiara since she clearly wasn\u2019t actual royalty. Given her occupation as a singer, it was probably just a part of her costume. Some humans however believe that tiaras are apparently a popular article of clothing among gargoyles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, Vienna,\u201d said Pam. \u201cThat thing is cursed. Watch out!\u201d The bracelet suddenly flew onto Vienna\u2019s wrist and then tightened just as it did with Carina. Vienna looked at it in annoyance and tried to pull it off but it wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cDarn,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stuck. I\u2019ll have to tell Patty this naughty thing should be kept under lock and key.\u201d Vienna shrugged her shoulders and then continued to eat her pizza as the Hockers looked at her in horror. \u201cSalli!\u201d yelled Pam. Salli gave a dazed look and then trumpeted angrily. \u201cDing dong fiddle dee diddle darn it, Pam!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cNot so loud!\u201d Allen then pulled Salli\u2019s ear and pointed to the bracelet, to which Salli\u2019s eyes popped out of her head. Vienna was oblivious to Salli and Pam and finished half of her pizza before pausing to drink her cherry soda, not realizing that her butt cheeks were as big as her breasts and were seeping out of her seat and into the seats to the side of her. Vienna didn\u2019t notice her ass expanding until she was about to bite into her sixth slice of pizza and heard a ripping sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprised gargoyle turned her head and saw her dress was tearing at the back, exposing her bright blue panties underneath. \u201cSon of man,\u201d said the gargoyle giantess. \u201cI think I\u2019ve been overindulging on the pizza. My butt looks like it could rival Patty\u2019s.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not the pizza, Vienna!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cIt\u2019s the bracelet! It places a curse on anyone who wears it who isn\u2019t a werehippo.\u201d Vienna gave a look of surprise. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat?\u201d Vienna heard another rip and then looked back to see her butt had gotten even bigger and was now slightly bigger than her breasts. Corona gave a look of surprise and then took off her glasses to polish them just to confirm what she was seeing. Pinky nearly choked on a donut as she spotted what was going on and Delphine gave a gasp and dropped her fork on her foot, albeit not feeling it herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna herself looked back at her butt and wagged her tail that was very much outsized by her butt cheeks. \u201cWell this is an odd predicament.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re taking this well.\u201d Said Allen nervously. Vienna shook her breasts and rolled her eyes. \u201cAllen,\u201d she said. \u201cSince I turned 18, I\u2019ve had to deal with LOS. After spending so many years carrying these medicine balls on my chest, carrying two more on my lower back is nothing. My only concern is that between my voice, my breasts and now my ass, people will forget what my face looks like. Wait. Where\u2019s the other bracelet?\u201d Salli and Pam bit their lips. \u201cOn Carina\u2019s wrist.\u201d They both said simultaneously. \u201cWell,\u201d said Vienna as she sat down, crushing two tables in the process. \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Patty and Wes were walking back to Neo Neapolitan. \u201cWes,\u201d said Patty with an annoyed tone. \u201cIf you say one word about me forgetting the bracelet in the kitchen, you\u2019re sleeping on the couch for a month.\u201d Wes rolled his eyes. \u201cWell, I\u2019d still get to be sat on by the... second biggest butt in Neo Neapolitan now that Carina\u2019s been zapped.\u201d Patty opened the door and grumbled as she looked back. \u201cMom and her stupid jewelry. I\u2019m going to...\u201d But then Patty grunted because she bumped up against Vienna\u2019s massive behind and startled the gargoyle. In the process, Wes was tossed into Vienna\u2019s left cheek. Wes felt the thick, rock-like but surprisingly soft golden flesh right before Patty picked him up and looked in surprise herself. \u201cOn second thought,\u201d said Wes. \u201cThird biggest.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna lowered her head and then spotted Patty. \u201cHello, Patty,\u201d the gargoyle said to her good friend. \u201cPlease don\u2019t lose your temper, but it appears that one of your mom\u2019s jewelry seems to have cursed me.\u201d Patty tried to fix her jaw but Delphine had to run up and do it for her before Patty did what came instinctively to her. \u201cPam!\u201d yelled Patty. \u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Pam. \u201cHow come I get blamed for everything around here? How do you know this wasn\u2019t Salli\u2019s fault.\u201d \u201cMe!?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d bet money the pizza was clean when I was walking out. This time you were the klutz.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d Patty grumbled and then she grabbed Salli and Pam by the heads and knocked them into each other. \u201cBlockhead! Airhead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Patty,\u201d said Vienna. \u201cThings will work out.\u201d \u201cVienna, aren\u2019t you afraid this will make things difficult for you?\u201d Vienna scoffed. \u201cI\u2019m a singer, Patty. Wait, isn\u2019t Carina one as well?\u201d Before Vienna could give much thought in the matter...</span></div></div>",

Salli moaned as she put the cellphone up to her ear. \"What is it, Dax?\" asked Salli. \"Dax?!\" yelled Allen. \"Oh no. What does that idiot cousin of hers want now?\" Salli let out a sigh and placed the food onto the serving tray, accidentally placing Neith's second bracelet on the serving tray. While Salli was speaking to her cousin, Pam gave a snort. \"Don't worry, Salli,\" she said. \"I'll take care of this.\" Salli turned her head and snorted. \"Don't even think about putting used chewing gum in Corona's hamburger.\" Pam shook her hands and then spat her gum into the trash before she picked up the serving trays while Salli argued with her cousin. \"Are you kidding me? What kind of idiot would animate a statue of Hercules just to win a snowball fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut in the dining hall, Pam passed by Corona, despite carrying her hamburgers. \"Hey!\" yelled Corona. Pam had given Vienna and Pinky their orders before she walked up to Delphine. Delphine was about to bite into her chocolate chip pancakes when she noticed Neith's second bracelet. \"Thief!\" yelled Delphine jumping to conclusions like she always did. \"Beg pardon?\" asked Norman. Delphine grabbed the bracelet and held it up. \"Don't play dumb with me, Bonnie and Clyde,\" she said. \"Since I discovered Neo Neapolitan, I've eaten here at least five meals a week and I've never seen your wife once wear any jewelry other than her wedding ring, which means this bracelet is clearly stolen.\" Nearby, Gardenia Vile, the elderly big gutted werecheetah was munching a burger, turned her head to see what was going on and rolled her eyes. \"I can't tell who's the bigger amateur.\" She thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" said Pam. \"That's Neith's bracelet. Whatever you do, Delphine, don't put that bracelet on.\" Delphine gave a gasp. \"You stole from your own sister-in-law's mother? You'll get more than 30 days for this. I'll cage you like I did that Pablo... what the?!\" Suddenly the bracelet twitched and attached itself to Delphine's wrist as the weredolphin gave a shriek. In the process, Pam tossed Corona's order into the minotaur girl's face in order to focus on Delphine. Corona angrily lifted a pickle from her glasses and then looked in surprise as Delphine got on her knees and her butt already begun to expand. The porpoise grunted as her teal booty stretched out her cargo pants before they exploded, revealing her teddy bear print underwear as she shrieked like a dolphin and looked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?! What the?! Why did!?\" Pam let out a snort and slapped herself in the face. \"Patty is going to kill us.\" Vienna was in such shock, her slice of pizza fell out of her mouth and into her cleavage as her jaw dropped. \"I'm going to go out on a limb,\" said Corona. \"And assume that that bracelet was cursed.\" \"Aha,\" said Delphine. \"So you admit it. It wasn't theft; this was a smuggling ring for cursed magical artifacts and Neith Round is the ringleader. It was clever. That trip to Paris was just an excuse to get out of the country.\" \"Like anybody is going to take accusations from somebody in teddy bear underwear seriously.\" Pointed out Norman. Delphine realized her undies were showing and nervously tried to cover them with her webbed flipper hands. Salli and Allen came out and noticed Delphine before dropping both their jaws. Salli was going to give Pam an earful but Pam snorted. \"You were the one not paying attention. This is your fault.\" Salli was about to argue but then she realized that Pam was actually making sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman let out a sigh and then took out his cellphone. \"I better contact Carter for the damage update.\" At that time in Paris, Patty's father, Carter, was at the Eiffel Tower when he heard his phone ringing. Carter checked the caller I.D. and let out a moan. \"Oh great,\" he groaned. \"It's my idiot son-in-law's idiot brother. What do you want Roman?\" \"It's Norman, Mr. Round,\" said Norman. \"Listen. How long did you say you were going to be in Paris.\" \"Don't tell me, let me guess, somebody else put on Neith's other bracelet? I swear, you Wraith Brothers are total clods. Just keep an eye on the two girls with the bracelets. Don't call us. We'll call you.\" Carter hung up and then let out a moan. \"Why couldn't Patty marry somebody who'd amount to somebody? And who was an only child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a few earthquakes and Patty's mother, Neith, walked up to the Eiffel Tower, bending over to speak with her human husband. Neith resembled her daughter in face and body shape but had turquoise skin with black hair worn in the same style as an Egyptian queen. The hippopotamus giantess also snorted a tattoo on her back of the Nile River. \"Who was that on the phone, Carter?\" asked Neith in her high-pitched voice that one would not expect from a hippopotamus as big as a skyscraper. \"It was that idiot Wes's idiot brother, Gordon. Two of Patty's customers wore those bracelets you left behind at Neo Neapolitan.\" \"Damn!\" yelled Neith as she slapped herself in the face. \"I knew I forgot something. I take it they're as bottom heavy as me and Patty by now.\" \"Well, I hope they can stay put for two weeks before you can take off those bracelets and reverse the spell.\" Neith then kicked back in a Mona Lisa style pose as a passerby on the streets stopped to sketch her likeness. \"Oh,\" she said. \"That spell is irreversible. Even after I take off the bracelets, their butts won't get any smaller. Hmm, maybe I should've told that to Patty.\" \"You think?\" asked Carter in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Neo Neapolitan, Patty had returned and saw the damage done. \"Pam, you idiot!\" Pam gave a glare at Patty. \"Sorry, force of habit. Salli, you idiot! Didn't anyone tell you not to text and cook?\" \"I'd be more concerned with the fact that your mother is a smuggler.\" Said Delphine. Patty gave a glare. \"You know what's sad?\" asked Patty. \"Technically, you and I are related.\" Wes shook his head. \"We can't leave you four alone for a second.\" \"Well, your father-in-law wasn't any help,\" said Norman. \"You don't see my father-in-law speak to me like yours did.\" \"That's because Carter's a jerk.\" Patty turned her head and glared at Wes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine then heard her beeper go off. \"Hello?\" she asked. \"Uh-huh. I'm on my way. I'll deal with the Neith Round crime syndicate later,\" said Delphine. \"Now I have to deal with a gorgon stuck in the chimney of her own house. The neighborhood is complaining about the noise pollution.\" \"Carina,\" moaned Salli. \"Well this escalated.\" Delphine then tried to exit through the front door, only to grunt because she got stuck. Delphine grunted and then managed to yank the door off of the hinges. Mia then turned to Patty whose jaw was dropped. \"Tell me the combination to your safe and it'll eliminate the middleman.\" \"Deal.\" Moaned Patty. Delphine tried to get into her patrol car, only to accidentally sit on it and smash it beneath her hulk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dolphin moaned and then noticed Akira Oda the Japanese dragon getting on her bicycle. \"Young lady,\" said Delphine as she sat on the motorcycle and started to peddle. \"I'm going to have to commandeer your vehicle in the name of justice.\" Akira just blinked as Delphine peddled away. \"And I thought Mom was huge.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

Delphine kept trying to accelerate Akira\u2019s motorcycle but it was no use. \u201cCome on!\u201d yelled Delphine. \u201cCome on! Come on! Justice is waiting!\u201d Suddenly, there was the sound of an engine dying and Akira\u2019s motorcycle released smoke before it broke under the immense weight of Delphine\u2019s booty. Delphine got up and held her butt in front of a window to see the crushed bike wedged into her cheeks against her teal flesh. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d said the porpoise giantess. \u201cThis\u2019ll cost me a king\u2019s ransom to fix. I\u2019ll reimburse Akira later. A citizen needs me.\u201d Delphine waddled down the street and panted as she clumsily moved her giant booty and unintentionally smashed a parked bus in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine let out a yell and then fell down a curve in the street, causing monsters to run for their lives to avoid being rolled over by the cetacean giantess with the enormous booty. \u201cOh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!\u201d shouted Delphine. As Delphine was rolling down the street, Harold, a werewolf regular at Neo Neapolitan was going through his mailbox when Delphine unintentionally flattened him like a cartoon character right before she bounced off of a street sign and came to a stop. Delphine let out a sigh of relief. \u201cSweet Mother of Laird,\u201d she groaned. \u201cThis is going to take some thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Carina was still stuck in her own chimney with her large behind sticking out in plain view. The neighbors gathered around to see it moving about as she tried to pull it out. Inside the chimney, Carina had to keep her eyes closed because she dropped her sunglasses and did not want her would-be rescuers to be petrified by her gorgon gaze. Her snakes were wildly hissing as they were drooping downwards from Carina being upside-down. \u201cI CAN\u2019T BELIEVE THAT I\u2019M STUCK IN THIS UNDESIRABLE POSITION! IF ONLY I HADN\u2019T LOST MY HOUSE KEYS! AS SOON AS I GET OUT OF THIS MESS, I\u2019M GOING TO CALL THE LOCKSMITH TO MAKE A NEW COPY TO AVOID SUCH AN EMBARRASSING SITUATION! I REALLY HOPE THAT NEITH GETS BACK SOON! SURELY, SHE\u2019LL KNOW HOW TO REVERSE THIS! RIGHT?\u201d Carina\u2019s snakes just hissed loudly and weakly as they drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelphine at this moment was waddling down the street towards where Carina lived and was panting as she tried to hold her mountainous behind up. \u201cThis is going to make things much harder. Just you wait\u2019ll you get back from your dealings in the human part of the world, Neith Round. \u201cJust wait\u2019ll you get back! You\u2019re as good as under arrest! There has got to be a law about turning a ranger\u2019s backside into a parade float.\u201d Delphine stopped and then paused to catch her breath. However, she then turned and saw somebody coming out of what she thought was a bank, carrying a large bag. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d yelled Delphine. \u201cBank robbers! Stop, in the name of the law!\u201d Delphine ran towards the woman she assumed was a bank robber, not realizing that right next to the bank, there was a laundromat which was really where the woman was coming out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was too late at this point because Delphine tackled the woman and made her yell out before pinning her underneath her enormous behind and making her scream. In the process, the woman\u2019s laundry was flung into the air, with a pair of socks landing on Delphine\u2019s beak. The dolphin giantess smiles to herself and gives a squeaking click. \u201cWell, well, well,\u201d said Delphine. \u201cGuess having a backside this large comes in handy at times. You have the right to remain silent, lawbreaker.\u201d Delphine hears mumbling and then gets up and looks down in fearful realization as to who exactly she sat on. The monster walking out of the laundromat was an enormous baku woman resembling a platinum-skinned tapir from the waist up but with a lower body that was white and brown striped from the waist down. She was very fat and had long light pink hair that reached down to her backside. She also wore a pair of glasses that were broken from Delphine\u2019s impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe baku stood up to her full 1100ft height as Delphine stepped back in fear. \u201cYou idiot!\u201d yelled the baku giantess as she glared angrily at Delphine, albeit not getting a good look due to her broken glasses. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big idea sitting on me! Can\u2019t you tell a laundromat from a bank!\u201d Delphine looked in pure fear. \u201cMayor Merry, I can explain. Oh my gosh! I forgot about Carina! Gotta run!\u201d As large as her butt was weighing down on her, Delphine ran for the hills towards Carina\u2019s place. The mayor of Direopolis gave an angry snort and bent down to pick up her laundry. While she was dealing with the laundry, Delphine kept on moving towards Carina\u2019s place when suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Ironically, despite being a minotaur and therefore a bovine monster, Corona rarely ordered anything other than burgers at Neo Neapolitan. Pam then noticed the second hippo queen bracelet and gave a smirk. When Salli\u2019s back was turned, Pam picked the bracelet up. \u201cPam?\u201d asked Norman to his porcine titaness of a wife. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Pam gave a snort and then hid the bracelet in one of Corona\u2019s burgers. \u201cI\u2019m taking that sister of yours down a peg. If the first bracelet made Carina\u2019s butt ginormous, it should work on that supercilious bison.\u201d Norman thought about whether or not he should stop Patty but then he begun to giggle himself at the thought of his sister\u2019s butt expanding. \u201cI know I shouldn\u2019t, but this sounds too good a prank to pass up.\u201d As the two of them were laughing, Salli with Allen on her shoulder took her tray of food, completely unaware of the second bracelet in one of Corona\u2019s burgers. Pam gave an evil smirk. \u201cWait\u2019ll Corona bites into the last burger.\u201d Said Pam fiendishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Salli had tended to everyone else, she brought Corona her order of burgers, completely unaware of the second bracelet hidden inside. \u201cThanks, Salli.\u201d Said Corona as she picked up the first burger and bit into it. Allen watched his sister eating the burgers and shivered. \u201cCorona,\u201d he said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t that make you feel like a cannibal? You\u2019re a minotaur.\u201d Corona gave a scoff. \u201cAllen, you do realize a lot of minotaurs prefer humans over hamburgers right?\u201d \u201cFair enough.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d said Corona as she swallowed another burger. \u201cExactly what was the problem that Wes and Patty had to contain.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Salli. \u201cPatty\u2019s mom forgot her bracelets last time she was here.\u201d Corona let out a sigh. \u201cPatty and her mom wear so much jewelry, I\u2019ll bet Neith hasn\u2019t even noticed it.\u201d \u201cWell, these bracelets are only meant to be worn by werehippos. Any other species and their ass becomes absolutely gigantic.\u201d \u201cAre we talking about Patty\u2019s size or bigger?\u201d asked Corona as she stopped to sip soda. \u201cCarina already got the first bracelet stuck to her and Patty was going to put the thing in her safe before it caused anymore trouble. But she forgot to take it.\u201d Corona let out a laugh. \u201cI just hope you\u2019re keeping an eye on it. Wouldn\u2019t want... ow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorona bit into her last burger and hurt herself. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d Corona lifted the bun off of the hamburger and found the second bracelet. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d The bracelet then flew onto Corona\u2019s wrist and tightened itself as Corona grunted. Allen saw the bracelet and looked in horror. \u201cOh no!\u201d Corona held her chest and grunted as her ass begun to expand and tear apart her jeans, causing her to yell as the chair under her all but exploded. Corona let out a stressed moo as everyone looked on at her in surprise. Pinky was watching and immediately put down the donut she was about to eat and Delphine gave a look of pure shock before she fainted into her pancakes. Scarlett, the teenage Jersey Devil stuffing her face with garlic pizza by the window, took out her cell phone to snap a photograph of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorona tried to stand up and saw that her butt was now taller than she was and twice as wide. \u201cOh come on! The director told me I needed more junk in the trunk for my next role, but this is ridiculous.\u201d Pam came in and was laughing herself sick. Norman was laughing as well and held his chest. \u201cHey, Corona,\u201d said Norman. \u201cI heard cows have four stomachs but even then it all goes to your thighs.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a new chauffeur,\u201d said Pam. \u201cKnow any limo driver with a license to operate a crane.\u201d Pam and Norman laughed as Salli gave a glare. \u201cI\u2019m telling Patty on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon realizing what happened, Corona gave an angry moo and snorted as she tried to stand up and lift her titanic behind off the ground. \u201cPam! You did this?! You sneaky third of a BLT!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard of pork butt,\u201d said Pam smugly. \u201cBut never beef butt.\u201d As Pam and Norman laughed at their prank, Corona dragged her foot across the ground and mooed like an angry bull. \u201cYou mess with Corona Poe,\u201d says Corona. \u201cYOU GET THE HORNS!\u201d Corona rushed forward, knocking down her table with her large butt as she ran after Pam. Pam responded by flying over her sister-in-law and then literally kicking her butt, causing Corona to grunt in pain as Pam left a large hoof mark in her left cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the process, Corona dropped her glasses and then Pam, with a mischievous smirk on her face, flew forward and snatched the glasses. \u201cLooking for these?\u201d Corona gave a snort. \u201cI swear, Pamela!\u201d yells the buffalo girl. \u201cI\u2019m going to put you to sleep!\u201d Corona tried to tackle Pam again but without her glasses, she ran right into the wall before she turned around and accidentally knocked over and nearly tripped over a potted palm tree. As Corona fixed her footing, she angrily chased after Pam, knocking over three more tables in the process, forcing some of the customers to hold up their food to avoid it splattering on the floor. \u201cGirls!\u201d yelled Salli. \u201cStop! Oof!\u201d When Salli tried to interfere, Corona\u2019s butt wobbled and knocked the loxodon to the side. Allen had to grab hold of the end of his wife\u2019s trunk to avoid being tossed to the side. \u201cI\u2019m going to clobber you, Pam!\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see you try, thunder thighs!\u201d Salli flew in to try and stop the chase again, only for Corona to accidentally flatten her into the wall. Allen was pressed into his wife\u2019s left breast and was in a daze as he looked more like a tattoo in his new position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you forgot the bracelet in the kitchen and didn\u2019t realize it until we were halfway home, Cleopatra.\u201d Muttered Wes. \u201cCut me some slack, Westley,\u201d said Patty in annoyance. \u201cI\u2019m a hippopotamus, not an elephant.\u201d As Patty opened the door, she and Wes looked in pure surprise at the chaos unfolding, most of all, Corona chasing Pam and Corona\u2019s enormous booty. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a football out of your head!\u201d Patty dropped her jaw before she immediately realized that Corona had the second bracelet stuck to her arm and it didn\u2019t take long for her or Wes to figure out how it happened. \u201cPam!\u201d yelled Patty into the air. Upon hearing her name shouted into the air, Pam stopped and caused Corona to crash into her as the two of them yelled and were both pinned over the buffalo woman\u2019s titanic ass. Norman for his part was tossed in between his sister\u2019s butt cheeks during the chase and was still laughing. \u201cThat was totally worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVienna simply chewed on a piece of pizza crust as Salli and Patty had to each grab one of Corona\u2019s arms to help her up off the ground. \u201cI\u2019d recommended she find some way to put that chase routine in her next movie.\u201d Corona was unamused and snorted angrily before she plucked Norman from her cheeks and squeezed him as he grunted. \u201cYou think what your wife did to me is funny, Norman!? That swine was completely unprovoked!\u201d \u201cWell it serves you right for being so on your high horse,\u201d said Pam. \u201cNow you can\u2019t even sit on it without crushing it.\u201d \u201cI am going to asphyxiate you, Pam!\u201d Patty was far from pleased herself and glared at Pam. \u201cAre you brain dead!? You saw what this bracelet did to Carina! What made you think it was a good idea to curse somebody else with the hippo queen\u2019s booty!?\u201d \u201cCome on,\u201d said Pam. \u201cYou know Corona is always saying mean things about me. I thought it would be...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Pam could say another word, Patty slapped her upside the head. \u201cOw! Ow! Ow! Ow!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s for now,\u201d says Patty angrily. \u201cRemind me to barbecue you later! Thanks to your petty rivalry with our sister-in-law, now we have two giantesses cursed with mountain-sized butts and no way to remove those stupid bracelets until my mom gets here. Corona, I am really sorry about this.\u201d Corona let out a sigh. \u201cNot as sorry as the director\u2019s going to be. They\u2019re starting filming for a new flick next week. They\u2019ll probably have to modify the script like they do when the actresses get pregnant.\u201d Corona then gave a grunt because somebody slapped the side of her butt. It was Harold the idiot werewolf. \u201cNow that\u2019s a rather impressive side of beef right there.\u201d He said. In seconds, Corona was sitting on top of the wolf man and threatening to crush him as her face was turning red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatty let out a sigh. \u201cI hate mondays.\u201d She said. It was at that moment....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once everyone\u2019s order was taken, Salli was loading them on a tray. \u201cPam,\u201d said Salli. \u201cWhatever you do, do not touch that hippo queen bracelet. If somebody else was in the same boat as Carina, Patty would skin us alive.\u201d Pam gave a snort. \u201cWhy do you think I\u2019m stupid, Patty.\u201d Salli was getting Pinky\u2019s donuts together as she was speaking with Pam. \u201cNeed I remind you of the time you watered my daddy\u2019s begonia with soda water? Or the time when you were tried to pay your taxes with salt?\u201d \u201cWell, salt was worth a fortune in that old fairy tale.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re taking a fairy tale\u2019s advise on your finances?\u201d asked Allen indignantly. Salli just let out a sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s a really good thing that Patty left me behind to keep an eye on you. I don\u2019t make the stupid mistakes that you do.\u201d However, as Salli was taking out the food, she failed to realize that she mistook the second bracelet for one of Pinky\u2019s donuts and put it on her plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPam just crossed her arms as Salli left the room. \u201cSalli and Patty must think I\u2019m dumber than a truckload of bricks.\u201d Norman gave a scoff. \u201cLeave it to my brothers to marry those two naysayers.\u201d Outside in the dining area at that time, Salli had delivered everyone their meal and Pinky was the last one up. \u201cGracias, Salli,\u201d said the flamingo harpy in the lucha mask. \u201cI love Neo Neapolitan.\u201d Salli then heard the door open and two teen monster girls came in. First was Elisabeth Makoa, a 1240ft pinkish gray, raven-haired, Hawaiian wererhino resembling an elasmotherium with wildflowers in her hair. The second was Beatrix Huffington, a 777ft tall basilisk resembling a yellow and gray puff adder with arms and legs. The two of them sat down as Salli floated up to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinky meanwhile had dug into her Hawaiian meringue donuts. The first one, she bit too hard and squeezed the merinque over her lip before she drank a bit of her strawberry shake to wipe it off. After finishing the first donut, Pinky shoved the second one all the way into her mouth before chewing it and causing meringue to leak out. Finally, she dunked the third one in her shake before eating that one as well. \u201cDelicious.\u201d She muttered. However, she saw the second bracelet on her plate and at first mistook it for a donut. \u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d thought the harpy to herself. \u201cI distinctively told Patty that I only wanter three donuts. Not quatro. Oh well, who am I to say no to a free donut. Bottoms up.\u201d Pinky bit into what she believed was a donut but then groaned in pain. \u201cOuch! This donut must be stale. Huh?\u201d Pinky looked at the bracelet and finally realized that it wasn\u2019t a donut. \u201cWait,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a donut. It\u2019s a bracelet. Looks Egyptian. It must belong to Patty.\u201d\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that the bracelet begun to twitch. \u201cWhat the?\u201d asked Pinky. The bracelet tried to fly to Pinky\u2019s wrist, but since Pinky\u2019s wings were attached to her arms, this made things difficult until the bracelet fell to the ground at Pinky\u2019s massive talons. Before Pinky could react, the bracelet flew around her left ankle and tightened. \u201cHey!\u201d yelled Pinky. \u201cPulsera loca!\u201d Pinky waved her foot and to try and shake the bracelet off but then she heard Elisabeth and Beatrix speaking. \u201cIt looks like Ms. Ringmoore is staying in Direopolis for spring break,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cI know it shouldn\u2019t but seeing a teacher out of school feels kind of weird to me.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised that Ms. Ringmoore is still a teacher,\u201d said Beatrix. \u201cShe\u2019s been wearing that lucha libre costume for so long, you\u2019d think she\u2019d have become a real wrestler by now.\u201d Pinky gave a scoff to herself. \u201cI <i>am</i> a real wrestler.\u201d She thought to herself angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028Elisabeth bit her lip and then bit into a slice of pizza. \u201cMy mom doesn\u2019t think that. She told me that Ms. Ringmoore was nothing but show.\u201d \u201cWhat?!\u201d yelled Pinky in anger. As Pinky stood up, she didn\u2019t notice that her wrestling speedo was getting tight on her body because of how big her butt was getting due to the cursed bracelet. \u201cMy mom is a boxer,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cAnd she says that in a real fight, Ms. Ringmoore would drop dead.\u201d Pinky did not like what she heard and gave an angry glare. \u201cOh really!? Well, Elisabeth. You tell your mother that I can kick her large, wrinkled and unflattering ass any day of the week, anywhere.\u201d Pinky in rage slammed her money on the table, not even waiting for Salli to return, and then walked out. Beatrix blinked slightly in confusion because Pinky\u2019s butt cheeks were now as big as yoga balls and were rapidly getting bigger as she left. \u201cDoes Ms. Ringmoore look like she\u2019s putting on weight to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth ignored her friend and called her mother to warn her about Pinky. At that time, Elisabeth\u2019s mother, Isabella was at the gym punching at a punching bag until it exploded. Isabella was a 1300ft brown-skinned wererhino, resembling a prehistoric rhino called an indricotherium, which meant that unlike other wererhinos, she didn\u2019t have a horn. She was even more apple-shaped than her daughter and was wearing a tiger print sari and a tanktop. She was completely bald and had a tattoo of Hawaii on her back. Elisabeth told Isabella about Pinky but the mother rhinoceros wasn\u2019t even remotely worried. \u201cLet that lolo harpy come,\u201d said Isabella as she blew on her naked fist. \u201cI was in the mood for fried chicken anyway. She only dresses like a wrestler to scare people. Those luchadores are all show. I\u2019ll bet the only reason their wear those stupid masks is so they don\u2019t embarrass themselves. I set up that wrestling ring in our backyard for a reason. I\u2019ll talk to you later, sweetie. Mama has to get ready to kill that goony bird. Aloha.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella hung up but then she heard her cellphone ringing again and it was a phone number she didn\u2019t recognize. She shrugged her shoulders and then answered it. \"Aloha. Isabella Makoa speaking.\" \"Mrs. Makoa, I'm calling you out, Bruja!\" Isabella's eyes popped out. \"You must be Mrs. Ringmoore. How did you get my phone number?\" On the other end of the line, Pinky's ass had expanded to the point where it was a pair of wrecking balls but the harpy was too incensed to notice it. \"That isn't the point, rhino rump. I challenge you to a fight in the ring. Your boxing vs. my lucha.\" Isabella gave a smirk. \"I accept your challenge. Oh. But I have a neighbor who loves to fight and she wouldn't want to feel left out. To make it interesting, let's make it a tag battle. You and one of your friends vs. me and my friend.\" \"Coward!\" yelled Pinky. \"But I accept your challenge.\" \"Good. You and your partner meet me at my house and we'll see who is in Pele's favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinky hung up and grit her teeth before she decided to call her friends. Surely there would be somebody to help her stand up to Isabella and whoever she brought with her. First she decided to call Ethiopia Gnu, the catoblepas who had been trying to combine basketball and sumo. At the end of the line, Ethiopia was spinning her ball on her finger. \"Sorry, Pinky,\" she said. \"I can't. I'm babysitting my sister's kids today. Perhaps if you call again next week.\" Pinky then decided to call Deneb, the capricorn vigilante. At that moment, Deneb was sitting on top of an unconscious bank robber when she gave her answer. \"This isn't a good time, Pinky. Call somebody else.\" Pinky's last bet was to try and call Patty herself who was just returning to Neo Neapolitan. \"I've got bigger fish to fry, Pinky,\" said Patty. \"I forgot to take something really important and dangerous back home when I should've.\" With that, Pinky hung up and then was wondering what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Pinky was deep in thought, she turned her head and saw Carina walking down the street. At this point, their asses were equal in size. \"Carina?\" asked Pinky. \"What happened to your butt?\" Carina turned and noticed Pinky and gasped at the sight of her massive rear. \"WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR BUTT!\" Pinky was confused but then shook her head. \"Listen, Carina. How would you like to try your hand at lucha libre.\" \"WTF!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until Carina was wearing a light blue lucha libre outfit with a stylized snake's skeleton on the mask and shirt and an ill-fitting speedo with a snake's face and open mouth on the front. \"Bueno,\" said Pinky. \"Now you look like a really real wrestler.\" Carina gave a glare and her snake hair hissed. \"Oh, don't be that way. You look amazing. Let's go kick some rhino butt.\" Pinky then noticed her own enormous rear and squeezed one of her cheeks. \"Speaking of which, how did my butt get so big? I must've had one donut too many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the Makoa residence, Isabella was waiting for Pinky with her human husband on her shoulder. \"Isabella,\" said the Hawaiian man on the rhino's shoulder. \"I don't think that fighting with one of our daughter's teachers is such a good idea.\" Isabella let out a laugh and rubbed her husband on the head. \"Kaikane, you worry too much. Let's just say Elisabeth is going to need a <i>substitute</i> teacher for the next month.\" Pinky and Carina arrived and the Makoas looked in surprise. Isabella took one look at Pinky's ass and broke into laughter. \"Oh, this is going to be easy. It's clear you haven't done any real fighting for a while, if ever. And you brought a gorgon as your aid? And Carina? Seriously.\" Carina gave a hiss. \"JUST HIT US WITH YOUR BEST SHOT IF YOU CAN, ROCKSTEADY!\" Isabella rolled her eyes. \"I'm quaking and shaking. But now that I know who I'm up against, I think I'll call in my tag team partner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella blew on her fingers and then calls forth the monster girl who will be assisting her in the ring against Pinky and Carina...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pinky and Carina turned their heads as they saw another giant monster woman stomping forward. From the looks of it, this one was a turquoise-skinned Lovecraftian with short tentacles for hair that appeared to be a darker shade of blue than the rest of her skin. Her lips were bright lavender and were covered in suction cups. She appeared to have long ears that reached down to her hips and resembled those of a Dumbo octopus. There were six sharp fingers on each hand and three sharp toes on each foot. She and a chubby stomach but well-toned abs and muscular arms and legs. She appeared to be dressed up in a black kick boxer's outfit. The Lovecraftian woman gave a loud and shrill hiss as Carina looked at her in fear. \"EXACTLY WHAT DID YOU GET ME INTO, PINKY?\" thought the gorgon giantess to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIsabella gave a smug smirk as her tag partner walked right up towards her. The Lovecraftian giantess gave a growl. \"You have got to be kidding me,\" hissed the cephalopod-based giantess. \"These are who we're fighting today, Isabella? My feet are insulted to be up against such blatant jokers.\" Pinky gave a flamingo-like honk in rage and flapped her wings, only for her large behind to force her to reposition her feet in order to stand. \u201cYou arrogant pulpo!\u201d yelled the luchadora flamingo. \u201cI\u2019m going to make you into takoyaki!\u201d Carina waddled forward and groaned as she scratched her face and her snakes hissed. \u201cPINKY,\u201d she said. \u201cCAN\u2019T I TAKE OFF THIS RIDICULOUS MASK!?\u201d Pinky just glared rather menacingly at her gorgon tag team partner. \u201cYou bite your forked tongue!\u201d yelled Pinky as she kneed Carina in the rear and made her groan. \u201cThese masks are a symbol of honor!\u201d Isabella then gave a smirk. \u201cNot to mention a good way to hide all of your wrinkles, you decrepit crone.\u201d Pinky became enraged and held out a foot filled with sharp talons. \u201cI\u2019m 27!\u201d Isabella\u2019s tag partner gave a hiss. \u201cIs that your age or your number of ex-boyfriends!\u201d Isabella gave a laugh. \u201cGood one, Maria. As for your partner, exactly what kind of gorgon is she? Pick a snake and stick with it, lady.\u201d Carina twitched an eye from underneath her sunglasses as her snake hair hissed. \u201cYou are so loud,\u201d said Maria. \u201cThat you\u2019re not aloud in the same town as a library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinky then stepped in and glared at Maria and Isabella as Elisabeth sat on the sidelines with Kaikane on her shoulder. \u201cOH YEAH!\u201d yelled the gorgon. \u201cTHREE CAN PLAY AT THE CHEAP HEAT GAME! YOU, OCTOPUS FACE! YOUR SKIN IS SO DRY THAT MOSQUITOS NEED OIL RIGS TO DRINK YOUR BLOOD! THE LAST TIME I SAW LIPS LIKE YOURS, THEIR OWNER WAS BEING BURIED!\u201d Pinky then stepped in. \u201cGood work, Carina,\u201d she said. \u201cBut let me try out. Hey, Isabella, if you\u2019re the boxer you say you are, why do you work at the DMV?\u201d \u201cJoke\u2019s on you, teacher,\u201d said Isabella. \u201cI make more than you do.\u201d \u201cOffice supplies don\u2019t count, rhino breath.\u201d Said Pinky smugly. Maria piped in and hissed. \u201cWell, your butt is so big, you could rent it out as a wrecking ball!\u201d \u201cYour ears are so big that you get all your candles for free.\u201d \u201cOh yeah, where did you find your partner? A coloring book.\u201d \u201cBEATS THE FISH MARKET THAT ISABELLA FOUND YOU IN!\u201d Isabella snorted and then chimed in. \u201cAt least she doesn\u2019t have to hide behind a pair of tacky glasses.\u201d It was at this point that Carina decided to shut Isabella up with a rather strong insult. \u201cWELL I MAY HAVE SNAKES FOR HAIR, BUT AT LEAST I HAVE HAIR! YOU ARE SO BALD, YOU MAKE LEX LUTHOR LOOK LIKE RAPUNZEL!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElisabeth gasps upon hearing that insult towards her mother. \u201cOh no, she didn\u2019t!\u201d Immediately, Isabella becomes violently enraged and roars in pure fury. \u201cJust for that,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cI\u2019m going to tear you apart in the ring and kick that big butt of yours so bad that your grandchildren will be born with hemorrhoids!\u201d Pinky gave a shriek. \u201cUh,\u201d said Elisabeth. \u201cExcuse me. But we need a referee.\u201d Isabella gave a snort. \u201cThat\u2019s your job, Elisabeth.\u201d \u201cOh no!\u201d yelled Pinky. \u201cShe\u2019s your daughter!\u201d \u201cAre you implying that I\u2019m a cheater?\u201d Maria gave a hiss. \u201cThe bird brain is right.

I can\u2019t believe I forgot that bracelet at Neo Neapolitan!\u201d Wes rolled his eyes. \u201cJust for the record, Dear,\u201d he said. \u201cMy name is Wes.\u201d Patty gave a snort. \u201cI\u2019m not in the mood for snarky husbands today.\u201d It was there that Patty stopped in her tracks because she saw Pinky and Isabella staring at her and smirking. Patty gave a worried blink. \u201cScrud.\u201d Groaned the werehippo giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Patty was dressed up in an ill-fitting referee\u2019s outfit and was grumbling to herself. \u201cHow do I get myself into these messes?\u201d she asked herself. Isabella and Maria both glared down at Pinky and Carina who glared back. \u201cThink you can survive a fight when your behind is weighing you down?\u201d Carina gave a hiss. \u201cJUST WATCH, RHINO RUMP!\u201d Maria lets out a shriek and jumps into the ring first as the match is about to begin and Isabella is ready to ring the bell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a sunny day over Growling Hills. Growling Hills was like any other farming community out in the country miles away from civilization, except that the residents were giant monsters from all kinds of mythology. However, the citizens of Growling Hills had little to no interest in humans and just went along raising their crops and livestock. In the case of one particular gorgon, this crop was corn. Her name was Sicily Houlihan and she was a 1000ft tall somewhat pear-shaped gorgon with red and blue garter snakes for hair as well as pink skin with white diamond tattoos that bore a yellow outline. She was busy pouring water over her cornfield with a watering can when she heard a loud yelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, Mom! Be careful where you water!\u201d \u201cOopsie,\u201d said Sicily as she blushed. \u201cSorry, Perseus.\u201d Out from the bottom of the cornfield came a human teenager, barely older than 15. This human was surprisingly Sicily\u2019s son, Perseus. Sicily\u2019s late husband was a human, largely because gorgons were an all female race and therefore had no choice but to seek their mates with other species. Normally gorgons only give birth to gorgons, but by some genetic fluke, Perseus was born a human male. Due to being half gorgon, he was immune to his mother\u2019s petrifying gaze. Perseus was riding on a ladybug the size of a bus when his gorgon mother picked him up and her snake hair licked him. \u201cDid you chase away all the bugs on this end?\u201d \u201cYes, Mom,\u201d said Perseus with a sigh. \u201cI\u2019ll bet we have the biggest cornfield in Growling Hills.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d said Sicily. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to harvest it all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the Corn Queen of Growling Hills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSicily let out a sigh. \u201cThat I am, my little prince, but the more successful the corn queen\u2019s empire, the more the rest of the royalty are willing to go to war.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re just jealous of your success.\u201d Sicily smiled and then kissed her son as he let out a moan. Sicily\u2019s enormous lips engulfed Perseus, accidentally pulling him into her mouth. Perseus let out a few muffled screams before Sicily opened her mouth and allowed him to walk down her forked tongue back into her hand. \u201cSorry, sugar. Oh sugar! That reminds me. We\u2019re running low on supplies. I\u2019ve got a few things to pick up at the store. Come on, Perseus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSicily placed her son into the back pocket of her jeans before walking down the street. As she did so, she passed by one of her neighbors who was busy tending to her orchid garden. This neighbor was an overweight light blue-skinned gargoyle women with violet red hair that was worn in an enormous pompadour with a ponytail. \u201cHi, Orchid,\u201d said Sicily. \u201cThat orchid garden is looking really good.\u201d Orchid gave a smile as she got up. \u201cThanks, Sicily,\u201d said the gargoyle in a southern belle accent. \u201cAnd ah must say, that\u2019s a pretty fine looking cornfield. But let\u2019s be frank, my garden is just a teensy bit bigger.\u201d Sicily raised an eyebrow as she hissed. \u201cAnd why is that important?\u201d Orchid let out a laugh as she continued to water her flowers. \u201cWhere have y\u2019all been, Sicily? Haven\u2019t ya heard? There\u2019s an eligible bachelor coming to Growling Hills and he\u2019s looking for a southern girl to be his bride. Word on the street is he\u2019ll marry the gal who has the biggest plot of land and no offense, sweetie, that\u2019s me.\u201d Sicily shrugged her shoulders and then walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to the general store, Sicily passed by another of her neighbors. This neighbor was a wererhino resembling a woolly rhinoceros with long gold hair and violet-colored fur. From the looks of it, she was carrying a bowling ball in a bag. \u201cHi, Kendall,\u201d said Perseus. \u201cGoing to hit the bowling alley.\u201d Kendall gave a snort. \u201cJust practicing for the tournament. Tell your mom that I\u2019m going to kill her this saturday.\u201d Sicily gave a scoff. \u201cIn your dreams, Kendall. I\u2019ll dethrone you yet.\u201d Perseus gave a sigh and then saw an election poster on a fence. The poster depicted a silver furred weretigress who from the looks of it was running for mayor of Growling Hills. \u201cLooks like Mabel was serious about running for mayor, Mom,\u201d says Perseus. \u201cAre you going to vote for her?\u201d Sicily shrugged her shoulders. \u201cWho knows?\u201d she asks. \u201cNot many people in Growling Hills cares who\u2019s going to be the mayor. I was thinking of running myself.\u201d \u201cMom?\u201d asks Perseus. \u201cSerious? Mabel\u2019s even more viciously competitive than Kendall.\u201d Sicily gave a giggle as she finally reached the general store and took a basket to take some supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that perhaps we should try growing Indian corn for a change, Perseus. I\u2019m going to pick up some seeds.\u201d As Sicily walked up to pick up some seeds, she found a packet of seeds that surprisingly didn\u2019t have a label, yet it did have a price tag. \u201cHuh?\u201d asked Sicily. \u201cWhat kind of seeds are these?\u201d The werecrocodile proprietor just shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI have absolutely no idea, Mrs. Houlihan. They just came in this morning and I don\u2019t have any idea where they\u2019re from.\u201d Sicily looked at the package just as a bright green-skinned baku girl with long black hair wearing a pair of rounded glasses and a sheriff\u2019s uniform walked up towards the counter to pay for a handful of jellybeans. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be messing with unknown seeds if I were you, Sicily,\u201d said the sheriff in a Japanese accent. \u201cFor all you know, it could be something illegal.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t you worry your tapir sides off, Kiriko,\u201d said Sicily. \u201cI won\u2019t know until I plant them.\u201d Kiriko took her jellybeans and begun to walk away. \u201cSuit yourself, Sicily. But I have to warn you. A recently got wanted posters from a gang of witches the sheriff of Dreadberry warned me about. I\u2019d be careful if I were you.\u201d Sicily ignored the sheriff and paid for her supplies, including her seeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Sicily was walking back home. \u201cI think Sheriff Zanki might\u2019ve known what she was talking about, Mom.\u201d Said Perseus. But before Perseus could voice his opinion any further, Sicily arrived back home and planted the seeds and watered them. \u201cI doubt these seeds are carnivorous plants, Perseus. You have nothing to worry about.\u201d Perseus gave a gulp. \u201cI sure hope not. I\u2019m lucky that most monsters in town think humans taste bad.\u201d Sicily and Perseus walked inside, turning their backs to the seeds that they had planted into the ground.\u201d Suddenly, the two of them heard a loud rumbling. \u201cWhat the?!\u201d Both the gorgon giantess and her human son ran out and looked in surprise. There was a glowing rainbow corn stalk where the seeds were planted. The rainbow corn had spread in with the rest of the cornfield and glowed in the sun. \u201cHoly minotaur!\u201d yelled Perseus as he stood on his mother\u2019s shoulder. Sicily\u2019s hair hissed as Sicily plucked an ear of corn. She sniffed it and bit into it only to yell in pain. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t appear to be good raw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSicily took the corn, removed the kernels and put them in a skillet before making them into rainbow popcorn. Sicily walked into the living room and turned on the TV station to the Yesterday network and munched the popcorn. \u201cYum,\u201d she says. \u201cThis stuff isn\u2019t half bad. Care for a bite, Perseus?\u201d Sicily held up a piece of popcorn that was 3 times as big as her son but Perseus shook his head. \u201cNo thanks,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that stuff is meant for humans.\u201d Sicily shrugged her shoulders. \u201cAlright, but try not to fall into the popcorn. I don\u2019t feel like having my stomach pumped again.\u201d As Sicily ate the popcorn, she had no idea that it would have terrifying side effects that would occur...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There didn\u2019t appear to be any immediate effects from eating the rainbow popcorn and instead, it gave a loud crunching sound that forced Perseus to cover his ears as he sat on his gorgon mother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cNot bad,\u201d said Sicily as she watched the Corona Poe movie on the television. \u201cBut it needs some butter. Oh good. A commercial. I\u2019ll just pay a visit to Regina next door.\u201d Perseus stuck out his tongue. \u201cYuck. Capricorn milk?\u201d \u201cWhat choice do I have, Perseus?\u201d asks Sicily as she gets up and makes her way towards the front door. \u201cMrs. Gorelick has a terrible cold. Drinking milk from a sick minotaur? Not a good idea.\u201d Sicily placed Perseus into her back pocket and ran through the cornfield as fast as she could in order to avoid missing the movie on the television as she crossed over to her second next door neighbor, Regina Spade. As she was running, Sicily placed Perseus into her back pocket, where Perseus felt the \u2018walls\u2019 and noticed they were softer. Of course, that wasn\u2019t the only thing that he noticed. \u201cThat\u2019s odd,\u201d thought the half-gorgon human. \u201cIt seems to be tighter in here than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegina Spade was an enormously obese Asian capricorn who from the waist up resembled a spiral horned goat with bright blue fur and short black hair but with golden scales on her legs like that of a fish and gills on her neck. She was watching the same movie that Sicily was. It was a movie that depicted a minotaur girl resembling a cross between a buffalo and a Native American woman who from the looks of it was engaged in a sumo match on the top of a bullet train with an evil-looking bronze furred weretiger with bluish green stripes, blackish green hair and an eyepatch. \u201cPush her off the train, Rough Ruth!\u201d yells Regina to the TV. \u201cGo get her!\u201d Regina then hears a knock on the door and grumbles. \u201cWhy do people always burst in when I\u2019m watching something?\u201d Regina rolls her wheelchair to the front door and opens it to see Sicily. She instinctively covers her eyes. \u201cFor crying out loud! Put your glasses on.\u201d Sicily gives a gasp and then takes out a sunglasses case and puts her glasses in. \u201cThere. Sorry.\u201d Since Perseus was immune to Sicily\u2019s petrifying gaze, the gorgon giantess usually didn\u2019t wear her sunglasses in the house. Because it was fatal to look a gorgon in the eye, gorgons were required to wear sunglasses that canceled out the petrification. Regina gives a grumble and opens her eyes. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d asks the capricorn rudely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, Regina,\u201d says Sicily. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have some butter that I could borrow? I need it for my popcorn.\u201d Regina gives a gag and sticks out her tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s right in the fridge,\u201d she says. \u201cTake it. I hate popcorn. How can you eat that junkfood.\u201d Sicily looks at how enormously fat Regina is and gives a smirk. \u201cLike you\u2019re one to talk about junk food. Can you even walk?\u201d Regina gives a rather sour look. \u201cYou know where it is, Houlihan,\u201d she says angrily. \u201cThis movie has Corona Poe as the leading lady. If you think that I\u2019m missing it, you have another thing coming.\u201d Sicily shook her head and then made her way to Regina\u2019s refrigerator to take the butter she needed and then turned around and closed the fridge with her rear, not noticing that she left a dent in it. In the process, Perseus let out a grunt, which prompted his enormous mother to give a look of surprise and embarrassment. \u201cOops,\u201d says Sicily. \u201cSorry, Perseus.\u201d Regina gives a look of surprise. \u201cPerseus is with you?\u201d the goat giantess asks as she licks her lips. Sicily gives a glare at Regina. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d With that, Sicily storms off and runs back to her house to melt the butter onto the popcorn as she continues to watch her movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the movie ended, Sicily had gone to bed and placed Perseus in his bed on the table right next to her own. As both the titanic gorgon and her tiny human son were snoozing, the full effects of the corn that Sicily ate were about to be seen. As she slept, Sicily\u2019s mattress made several squeaking noises as the bed springs were coming apart and the mattress was sinking. Sicily\u2019s lower body was expanding at a rapid rate and the legs on her bed bent from the critical expanding mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the alarm clock rang loudly and Perseus sprung out of his bed with a grumble. \u201cAs usual,\u201d he said as he took out a ladder and walked to the house-sized clock. \u201cI\u2019m the one who has to stop the clock.\u201d As Perseus turned the clock off, he heard a loud crash that was right next to him. \u201cWhat the... oh my gosh! Mom! Wake up!\u201d Sicily sprung up groggily and got out of bed. However, she now looked vastly different. Her butt was much bigger than it was before, to the point where it reached her shoulders and was taking up more than her entire bed. Her pajama pants were coming apart at the seams. However, she was too tired to notice and accidentally knocked over the table next to her bed, forcing Perseus to jump on one of her cheeks and crawl frantically up to her ear. \u201cMom! Watch out!\u201d Sicily yawned again. \u201cWhat is it, Perseus? It\u2019s not even 4 in the morning.\u201d \u201cUh,\u201d said Perseus to his giant mother. \u201cLook.\u201d Sicily looked forward and gasped as she saw her enormous behind in the mirror. \u201cOh my gosh!\u201d she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon giantess needed three entire mirrors to see how enormous she had gotten and tapped on one of her butt cheeks to make it shake as she bit her lip. \u201cMom,\u201d said Perseus. \u201cPlease don\u2019t freak?\u201d How exactly does Sicily react?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in Screamtown, a town in a world populated by giant monsters of all forms of mythology. Anywhere else, humans would be in danger of being devoured by giant monsters but in Screamtown, monsters and humans coexisted peacefully and it was illegal for monsters to harm humans. A lot of times in Screamtown there are families that mix together monsters and humans. There was one such case in the form of Esther Ringer and her family. Esther was an 800ft tall gorgon woman with cobra-like snakes called ringhals for hair, bright green skin and a long tail as well as a pair of legs. She was slightly chubby and pear-shaped which was actually common because adult female monsters in Screamtown were either very muscular like Mayor Phyllis Gacks, Dr. Desdemona Weisman and Chief Eileen Dinkley or rather heavyset and often even obese like several of Esther\u2019s neighbors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther herself lived with her human husband, Perseus in a section of Screamtown called Autumn Avenue. It was so-called because it was perpetually autumn. Before Perseus married Esther he had three human children from a previous relationship that ended badly. However, Esther got along very well with her human stepchildren and at that moment was walking them to school. The gorgon giantess was carrying them in her purse as she walked down the street. As she did so, she saw several instances that reminded her of monsters and humans getting along in Screamtown but for some reason it made her feel a sense of ennui. However, her children were as restless as ever. Her infant son, Preston was laughing as her older two children, Ashlyn and Sherman were running about because apparently Sherman took one of Ashlyn\u2019s textbooks. \u201cCome on, Sherman! This isn\u2019t funny! Give it back!\u201d \u201cWhy not? You\u2019re not failing any classes.\u201d \u201cKids,\u201d said Esther. \u201cCalm down. You\u2019re going to upset Preston. Here we are, almost there.\u201d Esther walked up to a junior high school and then handed them to the gargoyle teacher before she lowered two of her hair snakes to kiss them. \u201cCome on, Preston,\u201d said Esther. \u201cWe\u2019ll come back for your brother and sister after school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dropping off her older kids, Esther decided to take Preston in the harness in her necklace and go for a walk around Screamtown. First, she decided to walk by Winter Way, having pulled the hood on her sweatshirt over her head to prevent brain freeze from her cold-blooded hair. She turned to see V. V. Burton the fortune teller yeti was busy with human clients as the sorceress unicorn Gabriella Gallops flew overhead. Esther waved up at the giant unicorn woman right before she spotted Penumbra Howler the werewolf interior designer shoveling snow. Esther then turned to see what looked like a monster-sized birdbath where a human hockey game was going on and several monsters were spectators. A muscular and blonde-haired zombie giantess with an exposed spine and missing lips appeared to be cheering on her still-living human son on the ice, prompting Esther to smile. Esther noticed that Preston was feeling cold so she took her tiny son and moved on to the next part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the part of Screamtown that was known as Springtime Street. This part of the town was stuck in spring and it showed with blades of grass as big as trees to humans and large flowers everywhere. The minotaur, Latanya Bull was working in her garden and as Esther walked down the street and turned her head, she could see Cassidy Voltaire, the vulture harpy and her pigeon-like daughter Libby jogging down the street. The Golden Hind woman, Hera Hind, was running the opposite way acting as a taxi for the humans that were riding in her belly bag. Esther looked and saw a fat and pregnant centicore woman resembling a humanoid eland. Her human husband was standing on and rubbing her pregnant belly right before she held her head down to kiss him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Esther. \u201cPreston. How about we see if we can pick up something yummy from Maddie\u2019s place.\u201d Esther walked into the bakery of Springtime Street. The proprietress, Maddie, was a gorgon as well with lavender rattlesnakes for hair. Unlike Esther who had legs, Maddie only had a rattlesnake\u2019s tail where her legs should\u2019ve been. Some gorgons were born with legs and some were born with tails. Some gorgons like Esther had both. Maddie was busy with a mixing bowl when she noticed Esther come in. \u201cOh,\u201d said Maddie. \u201cHi there, Eshter. Hi, Preston.\u201d Preston burbled as Maddie moved her finger in front of him. \u201cHi, Maddie,\u201d said Esther. \u201cWould you happen to have any elephant ears?\u201d Maddie gave a puzzled look as she felt the sides of her head. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t have elephant ears. I have gorgon ears. But Josephine has elephant ears, which makes sense since she\u2019s a grootslang and...\u201d Esther rolled her eyes. \u201cLet me rephrase that, do you have any elephant ears for sale today. And I mean pastries.\u201d Maddie snapped her fingers. \u201cOh! Silly me, I just baked a batch this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther let out a sigh. Maddie wasn\u2019t very bright or good with metaphors. You had to be very careful when speaking to you or she wouldn\u2019t understand a word you say. Esther then looked around and Preston\u2019s sight was following his giant gorgon mother\u2019s field of vision. \u201cWhere\u2019s Rick?\u201d asked Esther. \u201cRick\u2019s home sick today,\u201d said Maddie as she was rooting around for elephant ears. \u201cSo I gave him the day off.\u201d Rick was the human who was Maddie\u2019s sole employee. He lived in a tree in Mayor Gacks\u2019s yard in Centerville. Like Esther, Rick had a mixed family. Rick\u2019s adoptive older sister was a hippogriff named Olga. Esther smiled thinking about that but then let out a sigh. Preston looked up and saw his mother speaking with Maddie. \u201cMaddie? Don\u2019t you ever think that perhaps things work too well in Screamtown?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaddie as usual was confused. \u201cWell, I work pretty well. I spend half the day baking sweets and then Angel, she works very well building those steampunk gadgets, Mayor Gacks works well making sure the humans and monsters get along, but then again there are monsters like Alex who work too well playing pranks, Mabel doesn\u2019t work at all and just sleeps all day and as for Noreen, I don\u2019t know if she has a job but she has money and electricity and water and...\u201d Esther let out a groan. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s just no excitement. It\u2019s too peaceful. Nothing ever happens.\u201d Maddie let out a laugh. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. Right now something is happening. Right now, I\u2019m selling you an elephant ear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEsther paid for her pastry and left. She let out a groan. \u201cPay close attention, Preston,\u201d said the enormous gorgon mom. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when one\u2019s hair is smarter than one\u2019s head.\u201d Preston let out a laugh. It wasn\u2019t long before Esther and her baby were both sharing the same elephant ear as they were sitting on a bench. \u201cSure,\u201d said Esther. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful in Screamtown but it sure is boring.\u201d As Esther let out another sigh, she heard a banging sound and Preston begun to cry, forcing Esther to rock him. She lifted her head to see a gashadokuro putting up a poster. The gorgon\u2019s snake hair hissed to get a good look and Esther read the flier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSumo Competition in Yellfleet. Monster Women Only. Grand Prize: 10,000 Skulls.\u201d Esther was deep in thought on the manner right before Preston looked up and burbled at her in confusion. That was when the giant gorgon housewife got an idea to herself. But then she realized something and felt around her belly to remember that it was too small for her to enter the competition. She then smiled at Preston. \u201cCome on, Darling,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re picking up takeout for lunch and I know a great restaurant...\u201d</span></div></div>",

The problem was, that vampire was not her husband. Cassidy was married to Foggy Bell, a cockatrice businessman who was at the moment out of town. Cassidy had been having an affair under the cockatrice's beak for some time. Cassidy stood up and let out a sigh. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Get out.\" \"Huh?\" asked the vampire man still in a daze. Cassidy let out a sigh. \"You heard me. Get out. I gotta get to work. But don't worry, Foggy won't be back until next week. Same time again tomorrow. Do what you gotta do in the bathroom and then split.\" With that, Cassidy was off and the vampire was struggling to put his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy took the taxi to work. She was a reporter for the Daily Oboe and was meeting with her boss first thing. As she made her way to the editor's office, she was thinking to herself. \"I really hope that Asner doesn't put me on something boring again. That story about the eight-legged horse race took a lot of thought.\" Cassidy walked into the office of Mr. Asner and the wolf man gave her her next assignment. \"I still can't believe that Red Fountain was on steroids. It's a good thing I didn't bet on him.\" Cassidy gave a scoff. \"Well, Chief. How else would you expect a horse that old to have 10 straight wins in a row. I heard he and his jockey have been banned from the races.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy's story was a load of horse manure. She was simply sent to cover the horse races and report who won but she used photo manipulation in order to forge a story that one of the horses was under the effect of a performance enhancing drug. What Mr. Asner didn't know was that the last 20 or so stories Cassidy gave him for the paper were nothing short of fiction. Not only was Cassidy cheating in marriage but she was cheating on the job. Asner unaware of the defeat lit a cigar before speaking to Cassidy. \"Well. Here's your assignment for today. You are to inspect the new restaurant that opened downtown. It's called Burger Ghoul.\" Cassidy let out a scoff. \"What am I? A food critic?\" \"Simian called in sick. I'm going to need you to fill in for him.\" Cassidy let out a sigh and nodded her head. \"Great,\" she thought to herself. \"I think I know exactly how to go about this one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassidy arrived at Burger Ghoul and inspected the restaurant from top to bottom. \u201cDamn,\u201d she thought. \u201cEverything appears to be in order. How dreadfully boring.\u201d Cassidy then spotted the manager sweeping the floor. He was a bright black-skinned cyclops with sharp teeth and a bald head. \u201cHmm,\u201d said Cassidy. \u201cHe looks intimidating. I could easily write him as an organ thief. Oh, that sounds perfect.\u201d Cassidy bit into a burger and smirked. \u201cTastes safe enough. I\u2019ll have to think of something nasty for them to hypothetically put into the burger recipe. I could write the lettuce off as poison ivy.\u201d Cassidy was writing down notes as she left the restaurant. \u201cUgh,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t stand burgers. Luckily my favorite inn is nearby. I can put the finishing touches on the story there. Maybe I\u2019ll even get the place shut down. Wouldn\u2019t that be exciting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, karma was about to deal Cassidy a very hard blow. In the front of the inn there was a group of four muscular monster men racking up a number of plates at a table. First there was a bright red-skinned Japanese oni with scars on his face and bright blue hair. He was eating so fast that he was biting right through the plates. Next to him was a onryo with long black hair, purplish skin and a green snow hat. In contrast to his friend, he was sucking up soup rather slowly. Next to the onryo was a yeti with long pink fur that had green, blue and white highlights and long eyelashes. He was the only one of the four who was eating with silverware. Lastly there was a muscular bright black furred werebat with short pinkish hair hair, large fangs and scars all over his body. From the looks of it, his lips had been completely torn off. The bat man was eating just as ferociously as his ogre friend right before pounding on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey waiter! What\u2019s taking so long to get the grub going?!\u201d The yeti let out a scoff. \u201cYou are so uncouth, Kenji. Show some class.\u201d \u201cAt least I know how to enjoy good food, Mitsuo,\u201d said the bat man to the yeti. \u201cYou\u2019re only eating spotted salmon.\u201d \u201cIf you must know,\u201d said Mitsuo. \u201cThis spotted salmon whitens the skin.\u201d \u201cAnd other than that,\u201d said the oni. \u201cIt has no nutritional value or taste. You might as well be eating styrofoam.\u201d \u201cWho asked you, Ryotaro?!\u201d The onryo just let out a laugh at his friends right as Kenji picked up a large sausage and squirted ketchup all over it before topping it off with bread. But before the bat could take a bite, his ears twitched because he overheard Cassidy speaking on the phone. \u201cEverything is fine, Foggy,\u201d said the gorgon to her husband on the phone. \u201cI just stopped at a cafe for some coffee. I just got a big story that is going to make my career.\u201d Cassidy hung up and Kenji twitched his ears as he overheard what she was saying. \"Burger Ghoul looked clean enough, but that won't get me a front page. Hmmm. Cannibal buffet. New Burger Joint Makes Monster Whoppers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, Kenji could tell that Cassidy was lying and it really made him mad, so mad in fact that he bit right through his glass. \u201cWhoa,\u201d said the Onryo. \u201cEasy there, Kenji.\u201d \u201cThat gorgon woman is a no-good cocky, lying, adulterous slanderer!\u201d Ryotaro let out a belch before speaking. \u201cUh-oh,\u201d he said. \u201cKenji heard a liar.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell do you care?\u201d asked Mitsuo. \u201cIt has nothing to do with you.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s lying about things that you don\u2019t joke about and she\u2019s lying to her husband. That triggers me. There\u2019s nothing worse than a liar. It\u2019s the most arrogant thing you can do. You know that. Judging from that woman\u2019s heartbeat, she probably hasn\u2019t told the truth in months.\u201d The onryo looked forward and stared into Cassidy and gasped. \u201cKenji\u2019s not kidding,\u201d he said. \u201cThat woman is a reporter and from what I see in her mind, everything she writes has a tendency towards slander. Oh my! She\u2019s having an affair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMitsuo let out a gasp. \u201cAre you serious, Takahiro?! That\u2019s horrible.\u201d Kenji was now so mad that he broke his glass in his hand. \u201cI think it\u2019s time we make her pay for her actions. Come on fellas.\u201d The foursome shoveled in what was left of their food and Mitsuo, Kenji and Takahiro left. Ryotaro was about to leave when the gargoyle waitress stopped him and presented him the bill. The oni grumbled and handed the gargoyle girl his entire wallet before following his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2028The oni, onryo, werebat and yeti got together over a frying pan on a fire and drew magic circles on the ground. First, Takahiro poured a potion of some sort onto the frying pan. \u201cIngredients please.\u201d Mitsuo tossed in a bottle of beer. \u201cSome beer,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the beer belly.\u201d Ryotaro then took out several balloons and threw them into the frying pan as well. Kenji gave a devilish smirk and then tossed in a Pinocchio doll. \u201cAlright, guys,\u201d said Takahiro. \u201cIt\u2019s time to cast the spell.\u201d The four put their hands together to cast a spell. \u201cMagic pan and sacred potion, put our mighty curse in motion. Smoke and fire on a roll, cast a spell from the ancient scroll. Gorgon, gorgon, liar, liar. Under you we\u2019ll light the fire. For every each deceit and every lie, your belly swells to reach the sky. And when we speak in fast reverse, your nasty curse will just get worse. Sky the reach to swells belly your, lie every and deceit each every for. fire the light we\u2019ll you under. Liar, liar, gorgon, gorgon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that a magic light emitted from the cauldron and the curse was going to work. But when does the curse first take effect?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins at the law firm of Rowling and Rourke. It was a slow day and Yasmin Rourke, one of the two lawyers in charge of the firm was bored out of her mind and tossing pencils into the ceiling as her partner, Kate Rowling was speaking with a client. Of course, Yasmin and Rourke were not ordinary lawyers. They were giant version of the monsters of folklore. Yasmin was a rather chubby 1200ft long and 900ft high gorgon with flying snakes for hair and a flying snake\u2019s tail where her legs should be. Being a gorgon, she had to wear a pair of round turquoise-colored sunglasses to prevent herself from turning people into stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate was a 1200ft tall harpy resembling an anthropomorphic archaeopteryx with a large beak filled with sharp teeth, pointed leather ears, long blonde hair and feathers arranged in a plumage of red, black, blue, green, pink, gold, cyan, gray, violet and silver. Body shape-wise, Kate was very fat with a large rear and E-cup breasts. Like Yasmin, she always wore a pair of dark glasses, though that was more to do with the fact that she was near-sighted. Despite originating from the Monster World, the two of them had a law firm in San Francisco. It was placed near Alcatraz so the giant women wouldn\u2019t accidentally cause any harm to the big city. Kate at that moment was staring down at a client who seemed intimidated at the ancient bird woman\u2019s gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the human young man looking up at the skyscraper-sized harpy. \u201cHow can I put this, Mrs. Rowling. She slipped on a leaf that was on my porch and is threatening to sue.\u201d \u201cWas she injured?\u201d \u201cWell... no.\u201d The client said. Kate let out a sigh. \u201cPeople seem to think of us lawyers as a means of extortion. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019d swear on my grandmother\u2019s teeth that there\u2019s no way you can lose.\u201d Yasmin looked ahead to take a peak at the conversation and had to fight back drool. Yasmin had trouble around humans because she used to eat them. She had recently given them up because it would endanger their law firm otherwise. It was easy for Kate not to eat humans. She never started in the first place for one. For another, Kate was married to a human. In fact, she and her husband, Jake, had a human son. By some genetic fluke, the harpy woman gave birth to a male offspring. The reason Rick turned out to be human was because harpies were an exclusively female race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin let out a hiss and then started to slither towards the door before Kate noticed her. \u201cYasmin?\u201d asked Kate. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Yasmin gave a hiss. \u201cI\u2019m on break, Kate. See you in a while.\u201d \u201cJust be careful, Yasmin. San Fran isn\u2019t exactly built for girls our size.\u201d Yasmin nodded her head and then slithered through the ocean, looking at San Francisco. \u201cNow that\u2019s what I call a buffet,\u201d thought the gorgon giantess to herself as her hair hissed. \u201cNo! Those days are over. No more eating humans. Ugh. How does Kate stay so sane and fat? There isn\u2019t much in the human world that\u2019s particularly filling to giant-sized monsters like us.\u201d Yasmin pouted to herself but then she caught wind of something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that delicious smell?\u201d asked the gorgon giantess. Yasmin followed the scent to see what looked like a houseboat modified into a restaurant. Yasmin licked her lips and looked in surprise to see that on the deck there appeared to be a hamburger that was big enough for a monster like her. \u201cHuh?\u201d she asked. Before Yasmin could question why there was a monster-sized burger, she heard a strange sound like that of a harpsichord and for some reason, it drove her further towards the burger and she picked it up and bit into it. The taste of the burger was so intense that Yasmin couldn\u2019t help but finish it. \u201cYum!\u201d she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the main cabin of the boat, there was a man giving a smirk as another man in a mask was playing a harpsichord. Next to the grill was a tank labeled \u201cPrimordial Ooze\u201d. The cook gave an evil laugh. \u201cThis giant freaks are too easy,\u201d he said. \u201cThis scam is about to pay off big time.\u201d With that, the cook walked out to meet with the eatery\u2019s new gorgon customer. As Yasmin finished the burger, she looked down in surprise at the cook. \u201cWelcome to Titan Burger,\u201d the man said. \u201cThe first restaurant in the human world to cater to giant monsters.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The time period is the 1970s, a wonderful and simpler time. I time that this narrator personally wishes he was born in. But we can\u2019t decide when we come into the world, so we\u2019ll just come in here, where two secret agents are meeting in a maze of hedges. At the center of the hedge, there is one secret agent who appears to be a lizard man resembling a frilled lizard with a pair of thick glasses and a frill that was bright blue, gray and violet. He was reading a box (upside-down) while waiting for his partner, in front of a rather large and strange looking lawn gnome that appeared to have glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent waits for another hour and starts to carve the solar system into the ground before his partner shows up. The lizard man\u2019s partner was a male minotaur who was unusually scrawny despite coming from a species of muscular males and chubby females. he had long brown hair and was wearing a pair of headphones. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d asked the lizard man. The minotaur looked dazed and his head was even spinning before he finally spoke. \u201cI\u2026 I got lost. Mr. O really should\u2019ve made the secret meeting place something a whole lot better than a hedge maze.\u201d The lizard man blinked slightly before he spoke back. \u201cYou\u2019re a minotaur and you got lost in a maze? What\u2019s wrong with you. Wait. On second thought, don\u2019t tell me. Mr. O has a message for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lizard man pressed the nose of the gnome and its face moved, revealing a screen of some sort that shadowed a shadowed out figure of a being of unidentifiable species. \u201cAgent Goggles, Agent Varner, welcome. There is a mission of the utmost importance. Eyes on the viewing globe.\" Agent Goggles adjusted his glasses to get a good look at the screen and had to pull on one of Agent Varner's horns in order to get him to pay attention as the viewing screen turned to static. Agent Varner punched the gnome on the head in order for its vision to return to normal. The screen then depicted a man scientist in a steampunk style outfit complete with a mechanical face and what looked like a bear trap for teeth. He had his arms replaced with robotic claws. \"Whoa,\" said Agent Verner. \"That is the worst plastic surgery I've ever seen.\" Agent Goggles elbowed his partner in order to get him to focus and pay attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the dreaded Dr. Ironjaw,\" said Mr. O. \"Wanted on 7 planets and banned from 17 others for his insane experiments. Right now he's cooking up something especially dastardly. Ironjaw is building a super-monitor programmed with the stolen brains of the greatest minds in 7 different dimensions. He is attempted to make himself the smartest person in the galaxy. With that much intelligence in such an unsound mind, who knows what kind of damage it will do.\" \"Well,\" said Agent Verner. \"You could ask the main computer when it's completed.\" Goggles nudged his partner in the chest in order to make him shut up. \"Your mission,\" said Mr. O. \"Is to make sure the super computer is never completed. This tape will now self-destruct.\" Verner and Goggles panicked as the gnome begun to smoke and was letting out some steam as it was sparking. The two agents screamed and ran around the hedge maze in an attempt to get out before the gnome exploded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was of no use and the gnome went off with a loud \"BOOM!\" that destroyed all the flowers in sight and caused the maze to fall down. Goggles and Verner were left for the most part unharmed and only coughed as the entire area was smoked off. \"What was that about you criticizing me getting stuck in a maze?\" asked Verner. Goggles gave a cough and poked the lenses out of his glasses. \"Oh, shut up, Verner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the center of town in a building that looked dilapidated and had a sign outside that read \"NO EVIL LAIR HERE, GO HOME!\". Inside the building was Dr. Ironjaw and his jaw was clacking as he was putting the finishing touches on his evil supercomputer. He was attaching the stolen brains to wires as he welded the panels of the computer shut. \"Soon,\" said Dr. Ironjaw in his metallic sounding voice. \"Very soon, I will possess all the knowledge in the known universe. Knowledge is power and with that much power at my disposal, I shall become master of the world!\" Ironjaw laughed so hard his jaw fell off and he had to reattach it. He gave a grumble as he did so. \"I should've gone with a different moniker. This Ironjaw will be the death of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Ironjaw thought that his diabolical plan would come to fruition, but things don't always go as planned. This time, there would be no exception. At that moment, the door opened up and revealed a ditzy-looking gorgon girl with long coral snakes for hair and yellow sunglasses that were shaped like hearts and were glowing bright. She was very skinny in frame, albeit mildly hourglass-shaped and was wearing a polo shirt and jeans with a name tag that read \"Coral\". In one hand, she was carrying a package and in another hand, she was carrying a lime soda. Ironjaw looked at the girl in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon girl paused to sip her soda before she spoke. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this 772 Moscato Road.\u201d Ironjaw\u2019s jaw rattled and his eyes spun around. 772 Moscato Road? This is 773 Pound Way.\u201d The gorgon girl slapped herself in the face and groaned. \u201cOh,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an idiot. The wrong number and the wrong street. My bosses are going to kill me if I don\u2019t deliver this package by 1:00. Huh?\u201d Coral looked all around at the scenery and saw the super computer that Ironjaw had been working on. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I had a computer like that, crossword puzzles will no longer be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Coral walked towards the super computer, Ironjaw noticed her drink. \u201cBe careful with that!\u201d he yelled. \u201cMy machine isn\u2019t waterproof! I probably should\u2019ve gone ahead and done that before I built the computer.\u201d Coral gave a laugh. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry, metal man. This is soda. Whoops!\u201d Coral spilled her soda on the control panel of the machine and it begun to spark violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, downtown, Agents Verner and Goggles were driving down the street in a big red car and Verner let out a groan. \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have gotten another car. I feel weird in a red car.\u201d \u201cThis was the only car they had left,\u201d said Goggles. \u201cWe crashed all the other ones. Ironjaw shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find. Just look for anything unusual.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBOOOOOOOM!!!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the explosion cleared, Verner and Goggles looked up at the smoke and blinked. \u201cDoes that count as unusual, Goggles?\u201d asked Verner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the scene of the explosion, Ironjaw was unconscious on the ground and Coral was walking away with her head in pain and her hair hissing and standing up on end. \u201cOh my,\u201d groaned the gorgon. \u201cThat was quite a rush. I hope the picture comes out because it was one heck of a flash.. At least my package wasn\u2019t destroyed. I gotta get to the right address or I\u2019m dead meat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Coral was walking away, she failed to notice that there was a piece of metal from the explosion that got stuck in her brain and was sparking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Coral walked off, Verner and Goggles walked in and spotted the destroyed lab. \u201cGood grief!\u201d yelled Goggles. \u201cI\u2019ll say,\u201d said Verner as he walked forward to the last surviving wall and noticed a painting hanging on it. \u201cThis painting is crooked.\u201d The wall then fell down as the painting caught fire and turned to ash. \u201cIt looks like Ironjaw\u2019s super computer plan didn\u2019t work out so well. It\u2019s like what they say about the best laid plans. We better look for Ironjaw.\u201d The two secret agents walked away, not noticing they were walking right past Ironjaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Coral was in her delivery truck and then her eyes flashed because she noticed her crossword puzzle. In seconds, she filled out every single square and put the puzzle away as she begun to drive off. As she was driving, she failed to notice a strange glowing vein appeared on her head as her brain was slowly growing larger.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was another day in Fearfield at Under Gloom, the most awful and disgusting prison known to all giant monster kind. In the office of the warden, there were three monsters. First of them was Warden Destiny Sirtis herself. Destiny was a 1000ft tall blue skinned gargoyle with an uncanny resemblance to Demona with the obvious exception of the crown. Next to her was the assistant warden, Belladonna Solanaceae, a 700ft tall yellow skinned manticore woman with three sets of razor sharp teeth and an hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third monster in the room was a Frankenstein woman, a monster made of both flesh and steel. This particular Frankenstein woman was an obese pale white skinned patchwork corpse with pieces of cloth stitched into her body and a glasgow grin from the stitches on her face. She had strawberry blonde hair worn in a beehive and was wearing a pair of glasses with a lab coat. Her left arm was flesh but her right arm was mechanical and was very undersized compared to her much larger and muscular organic arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I follow you, Dr. Goodwitch,\" said Destiny. \"You're saying you've developed a way to keep the troublemakers in this building completely immobilized and out of my hair.\" \"Exactly,\" said Dr. Goodwitch as she held up a syringe. \"In this very syringe is an experimental solution I've been dabbling with. I know you've had problems with attempted escapees and you and your staff are so frustrated that you're taking it out on each other. You in particular Destiny. Your blood pressure is so high it's a miracle you're even alive.\" Belladonna let out a yawn. \"Cut to the chase, Doc. What's that crazy blue stuff do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All in due time vice warden,\" said Dr. Goodwitch. \"To demonstrate, I'll need a guinea pig to test the syringe on.\" Destiny was thinking to herself. \"I know just the deserving waste of life for the job,\" she said with a smirk. \"But unfortunately he's in the pit for the week for destroying the kitchen. I have someone else in mind. Yuri L. That way, in case the experiment fails, no big loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri was in her cell at that moment, she was an 800ft tall and obese gorgon with blue pythons for hair. She had a visor attached to her fave to cancel out her petrifying gaze. Yuri was a serial killer who turned monsters into stone corpses that she would then mutilate for her own twisted amusement. Now, she was spending a life sentence in the Dark Side. Dark Side was the part of Under Gloom where they kept the most evil criminals. Criminals whose crimes were so vile they were left to rot. Dark Side's name came from the fact that the prison staff didn't even bother to turn the lights on in that area of the prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, Yurielle was getting into an argument across the way from fellow inmate, Persephone, an albino werewolf arrested for cannibalism. \"What the **** did you just say about me, you damned pooch!?\" \"I said that my body count is higher, you snake haired moron.\" \"Listen here you mongrel, I oughta come in there and neuter you, you stupid mutt!\" \"I'd like to see you try,\" said Persephone. \"I can eat you in over 900 ways with just my front teeth.\" \"I'd rip out your intestines and use them to strangle you, you tree pissing literal daughter of a....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Yuri let out a yell because she was tasered. As Yuri was recovering from the shock, two guards entered her cell. One of them was Cree, an 800ft tall and grotesquely obese were hyena and the other was Clover, a gigantic grootslang, a green skinned hybrid monster of an elephant and a snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Cree and Clover held the gorgon down, Destiny and Dr. Goodwitch walked into the cell. \"Destiny,\" said Yuri with a hiss. \"You three-layered anus hole. I'm gonna...\" \"You're gonna what?\" asked Destiny. \"You already have life. Don't push it.\" Yuri's snakes let out a hiss as Dr. Goodwitch held up her syringe filled with mysterious blue liquid. \"Don't fight it, Yuri. Resistance will forever be futile for you and for your future prisoners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought Dr. Goodwitch injected Yuri right in the...</span></div></div>",

Yuri let out a scream and held her stomach in pain. \"Zeus damn it!\" yelled the gorgon. \"What the hell was that.\" Dr. Goodwitch then squeezed the needle to make the blue liquid ooze out. \"You might feel a little light-headed, Ms. L,\" said the Frankenstein giantess. \"But it should keep you in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw you,\" said Ms. L to Dr. Goodwitch before she turned her attention to Warden Destiny. \"And screw you too, Demona!\" Destiny let out an angry shriek as she made her eyes glow red. Destiny was fully aware of her resemblance to the cartoon villain and she was really not amused with it, so calling her \"Demona\" never failed to throw the warden into a vicious rage. Destiny would've assaulted Yuri but Belladonna held her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Destiny,\" said Dr. Goodwitch. \"My blueberry solution will render her and all the other malcontents powerless to challenge or undermine your authority.\" Destiny just let out a hiss. \"I hope so,\" she said. \"Because if this works on this, this menace to society, I'm going to use it on the rest of the Dark Siders. They're in for life, so I'd appreciate it if they didn't complain and make a big stink about it. After all, they've got nobody to blame for being in this hellhole but themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ball me!\" yelled Yuri as he snake hair hissed. Destiny lowered her head with glowing eyes. \"You are getting to be as bad as Wade. I told that little malcontent that I'd eat him for breakfast the next time he acted up.

However, given the bizarre and disgusting items that monsters considered to be food, Under Gloom's cuisine was barely edible and almost poisonous. Most of the chow in the prison's cafeteria wasn't fit for rats. Today was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri walked out of line for chow with a plate full of unidentifiable slop that looked like it expired years ago and couldn't even be distinguished from vegetable or meat. It was even coated with a putrid purple ooze that looked like venom. Yuri sniffed the prison food and gagged before walking off to find a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was walking by, she stole a cup of what looked like gelatin dessert from another inmate; Priscilla, a white skinned orc sorceress in for practicing medicine without a license. \"Hey!\" yelled Priscilla. \"Yuri! That was mine!\" Priscilla then yelled in pain as Yuri drove one of her snakes up the orc giantess's nose. \"So?!\" asked the gorgon. Priscilla fell back on the ground in pain before Yuri grabbed the rest of Priscilla's tray and poured it over the orc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri walked off as a cockatrice inmate looked at her. \"Bitch.\" The cockatrice said under her breath. The cockatrice then wound up with a black eye. Yuri was walking towards a table where there was another prisoners sitting down. It was Arethusa, a brown skinned and blonde haired European dragon who was locked up in the Dark Side for construction, use and selling of bombs that were used to kill people. \"Get out of my seat dragon breath.\" Said Yuri. Arethusa just snorted out flames. \"No, I don't think I will. I don't see your name on it lardass.\" Yuri's snake hair hissed and Arethusa got up to growl as flames came out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen asshole,\" said Yuri. \"If it weren't for this Zeus damned visor, I would petrify you, break your head into gravel and flush it down the toilet.\" \"I'd like to see you try.\" \"What was that?\" \"I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri would've attacked Arethusa but then she gagged and held her chest. She groaned and looked at her hands to see they were turning blue. \"What's going on?!\" yelled Arethusa.\" Yuri gagged and begun to sweat before she felt her already fat body expanding and she fell back as she continued to turn blue. \"Wh-What is happening to me?\" asked the gorgon girl. Yuri found herself swelling to the point of being spherical as the other inmates, Arethusa included, looked on in fear. Something strange was going on.</span></div></div>",

Oh!\" Dr. Goodwitch took out a pipe to smoke it as Yuri's legs and arms swelled so much they seemed to disappear into the gorgon girl's round blue body. Yuri's chin even merged with the rest of her face as she was gasping for air while her breasts seemed to hand on her torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny walked forward and was dumbfounded as she felt Yuri's bloated body. \"I don't believe it,\" said Destiny. \"Is that what your crazy potion was supposed to do?\" \"Yep,\" said Dr. Goodwitch as she puffed on her pipe. \"This blueberry poison I've invented induces an unusual form of swelling that mutates the inmates into living blueberries.

Several of the inmates had to run and those that failed to get out of the way were bowled over like pins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Destiny flew over Yuri and stopped her. The gargoyle warden gave a smirk at the sight. \"You know,\" she said. \"I kind of like the results? Dr. Goodwitch, how would this work on a human?\" \"I'm afraid that the poison is so strong it would kill a human with the first injection, Warden Destiny.\" Said Goodwitch. \"Damn,\" said Destiny. \"Oh well, can't have everything.\" \"Screw your face!\" yelled Yuri as her hair hissed. \"You sick freak. Somebody oughta pump this crap into you. You're already blue.\" Yuri then heard a flowing liquid and was really afraid when she learned the sound was coming from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny let out a vicious laugh that terrified the other inmates. \"Let this serve as a warning,\" the warden says. \"Anybody who acts up will share Yuri's fate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

She angled her in a way so that Yuri's snake hair couldn't reach her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Destiny rolled her, Yuri was steaming mad. That a-hole doctor just turned her into a giant blueberry freak. And Destiny was loving it. Yuri could feel her blood boil. When she got back to normal, she was going to tear those two apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Yuri was put back in her cell. Since Destiny assumed she wasn't in any condition to move, she didn't bother locking the door.

Her name was Icy Coldwind and she was a bright blue feathered snow bird harpy. The harpy was making her rounds and making sure everyone was still locked up. Icy of course, was still new to Under Gloom's staff and was still familiarizing herself with the entire prison's inmates. \"Let's see,\" said Icy. \"Ursula Majors is in her cell. And in Elaine's cell. There's no way I'm falling for that trap again. Huh, what's that...?\" Icy turned her head and screamed as her eyes popped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe harpy couldn't get out of the way in time as Yuri rolled over her and flattened her like a cartoon character. Icy squawked as her flattened body rolled underneath an empty cell and she stuck out in tongue in a daze. \"Look out guards!\" yelled Yuri. \"Coming through!\" As Yuri rolled, her blueberry body got bigger and rounder to the point where her limbs sunk into her blue flesh. As Yuri kept rolling, she managed to flatten Cree and Clover before they could even realize what happened. Clover managed to stagger up as she heard Yuri laughing. \"Aria!\" yelled Clover. \"Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp ahead was Aria Tazel, a giant onryo with huge Z-cup breasts and long black hair like a Japanese movie ghoul. Aria was the highest ranked guard in Under Gloom and was a cop in life. As Aria was floating above the floor, she spotted Yuri coming and held her guard. Yuri continued to laugh but then she saw Aria's huge breasts in the way. \"Uh-oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blueberry gorgon bounced off of Aria's breasts and then off the walls as she grunted, screaming in pain as she hit the cell doors and then was sent into the stair well as she was rolling downstairs grunting and groaning. On the ground floor, Wade Wilson, the sole human inmate was plotting another escape. \"Finally,\" he said to himself. \"Once I reach the basement I can just tunnel my way and say goodbye to Demona and this stupid pris...\" Before Wade could finish his sentence, Yuri rolled over him and lodged him into her belly button as he yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" muttered Yuri. \"This is a setback.

That voice was coming from Destiny and the blue gargoyle came forward and poked Yuri as she groaned. \"It looks like we found the perfect patch for the world's biggest blueberry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuri grit her teeth in anger. \"I'd like to turn you to into a statue!\" Destiny scoffed. \"I'm <i>already</i> a statue, stupid.\" Destiny then kicked up more dirt to bury what was left of Yuri's feet. \"Hey!\" Yuri tried to roll over Destiny but then she gagged because she expanded again and was bluer than ever. She was now completely immobile. Yuri begun to cry again as Destiny smirked. \"You deserve this, you know. Maybe now you'll know the despair faced by the family and friends of every last monster you petrified in cold blood. Or right now, cold juice.\" \"You're the epitome of evil!\" yelled Yuri. \"I hope you die from your rage!\" Destiny smirked and then walked away as Yuri groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gorgon looked around to see all the strange plants that grew in the prison garden. There were two-headed conjoined daisies, hand-shaped mums, roses that looked like they were made of metal and even violets that looked like they had tongues. Yuri let out a sneeze and groaned. She was one of the prisoners of Under Gloom who absolutely hated to be in the garden. She had allergies and Destiny knew it darn well. To make matters worse, it started to rain and the rain came down fast and hard. Yuri yelled as the water poured into her mouth at a rapid speed. She had to spit water out fast to avoid choking as her hair curled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really, really, really hate that Destiny Sirtis!\u201d yelled Yuri. \u201cI may have done some horrible things, but that woman is an outright sadist! I\u2019d love to put her in the same boat as me. Then again, she\u2019s already blue. But I'd love to see her expand. I wonder if Dr. Goodwitch's poison has any effect on gargoyles.\" Yuri grunted and tried to shake free but as she did was flip upside down because she was too round to move. The gorgon was swearing under her breath as her snake hair hissed loudly and snapped their jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well. It looks like you might need some help.\" Yuri let out a grunt. \"Who said that?\" the gorgon giantess blueberry asked. \"Oh,\" said the voice again as the voice's owner walked up towards Yuri. \"Just a small timer who'd like to rise up in Under Gloom's ranks by helping out one of the more infamous inmates. Besides, I don't like gardening in the rain either, but that warden can be so mean. But then again, gargoyles are hard on crime.\" Yuri felt a couple hands on her and groaned as she was rolled upwards and then she looked eye to eye (her visor blocking her petrifying gaze) and saw exactly what small timer would dare team up with a stone cold killer like her...</span></div></div>",

She was so angry at her condition that she appeared to be foaming at the most. The other inmates looked in fear. The orc sorceress, Priscilla, imprisoned for impersonating a doctor, had the nerve to speak with another inmate, Eva, a Jersey devil imprisoned for insider trading, about the situation. \"Yikes,\" whispered Priscilla. \"What a horrible fate. You think that transformation is permanent?\" Eva nervously bit her fingers. \"Destiny's not that cruel, I don't think. She'll probably reverse the effects once Yuri serves her sentence.\" \"But, Eva,\" said Priscilla. \"By the time Yuri is complete with her sentence, she'll be dead. Demona's really flipped her lid this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny turned her head and then faced Priscilla. \"Did you say something? Priscilla?\" Priscilla nervously shook her head and waved her hands. \"I didn't think so,\" said Destiny. \"Since Yuri is serving a life sentence, I'm not even going to bother using the antidote on her. Anybody caught misbehaving one time too often, will be blueberry-poisoned for the remained of their sentence.\" All the inmates are frozen in fear as Destiny left the cafeteria with Dr. Goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the rest of their sentence?\" asked the frankenstein giantess to the gargoyle warden. \"That sounds harsh.\" Destiny let out a scoff. \"These aren't ordinary people. These are society's embarrassments that chose to murder, rob, swindle and otherwise commit wrongs against their fellow monsters. They deserve no mercy. There are three off the bat that I can think of, joining Yuri.\" \"Who?\" asked Dr. Goodwitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First is the one monster I'm sure could escape on her own given the wrong circumstances. Persephone, that white werewolf in for cannibalizing hundreds of monsters of countless species. She's so vicious that I don't let her out of her cell. I had to muzzle the literal bitch because otherwise she'd eat the guards and other inmates. If she was a blueberry, she'd never be able to escape. Additionally, there's that jewel thief, Bebe. That Cheshire Cat's not bad herself, but she's in love with that MF-er Wade whose always trying to break out. She might try to help him out out of her misplaced love and loyalty. She wouldn't be of much use to that troublemaker bloated.\" Dr. Goodwitch nodded her head. \"And the third one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDestiny hissed. \"That gremlin, Ariel. She got thrown in here for dismantling cars to sell the parts on the black market. Gremlins being good tinkerers makes them resourceful enough to be capable of breaking out. I don't like to take chances.\" \"What about that kitsune on level five?\" asked Dr. Goodwitch. \"Her shapeshifting could spell trouble.\" Destiny nodded her head. \"Elaine,\" she muttered. \"Thanks for reminding me. That identity thief probably couldn't do much as a blueberry. But who to use the blueberry poison on first?\"</span></div></div>",

At 400ft tall, Bebe wasn't a particularly large inmate, but she was heavily muscular. She was imprisoned for a bunch of Catwoman-style jewel robberies and ever since she came to Under Gloom, she's been working out in the prison gymnasium.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe was actually much nicer than the other inmates in terms of disposition. Unfortunately she had fallen in love with Wade Wilson. Unlike the other inmates who were giant monsters, Wade was a normal-sized human and the only male in the prison. Unlike Bebe, he was a total jerk with a racist hatred to monsters. He was an awful human being as well; car robbery, destruction of private property, assault and battery, those were only a few of the crimes that Wade committed. He had a volatile temper and a nasty habit for Disproportionate Retribution. He lived in Van Nuys until a mummy giantess was hired to play a role in a monster movie. Her name was Cleotiti Su-Ancknamun, and she accidentally stepped on Wade's car and destroyed it. In retaliation, Wade set her gauze on fire and nearly burned her undead. The once human-loving Cleotiti was so traumatized that she would have a panic attack upon seeing a human. Because of the property damage caused by Cleotiti's panic attack, Wade was sent to Under Gloom. Destiny despised Wade more than any other prisoner because not only did he constantly try to escape, but he was nothing but rude and insulting towards her and everyone else in the prison. What Bebe could possibly see in him was beyond anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Bebe,\" said Wade. \"You know the plan.\" Bebe nodded her head and purred. \"Today, I'm on garden duty. I'll smuggle you out into the prison garden and toss you over the fence. But Wade, what if you get hurt?\" Wade let out a scoff. \"Last time, Demona threw me back in, I tore off a piece of her shirt. It should make a good parachute. Although I probably would've had better luck if I snagged her panties. And once I get out, I'll come back for you.\" Bebe smiled at that, not noticing that Wade had his fingers crossed. \"There's just one problem with your plan, Wade.\" Said Destiny as she walked to the jail cell. Bebe looked up in fear at Destiny but Wade looked in contempt. \"Demona!\" he yelled. \"And it looks like you brought Frankenstein's leftovers as well!\" Dr. Goodwitch walked up behind Destiny as Destiny turned to Bebe who was still in fear. \"Please don't hurt him.\" Begged Bebe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not this time,\" said Destiny. \"Bebe, I warned you about consorting with bad company before. Dr. Goodwitch.\" Dr. Goodwitch polished her syringe as Bebe meowed in fear. \"Relax, Bebe,\" said Destiny. \"It's like one of those evil brews that bitch Antoinette used to make.\" \"Antoinette Curry?\" asked Dr. Goodwitch. \"That nuckalavee was pure evil. She had no right to call herself a doctor after everything she did. Didn't she die here?\" Destiny scoffed. \"Good riddance,\" said Destiny. \"I hope she's eating centipedes in hell right now. Enough with the chit-chat, get it over with. Wade would've slipped through the bars in Bebe's cage and escaped, but Destiny put a board in front of the bottom of the cell to block the escape. \"I want you to see your only ally in this prison being reduced to uselessness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe yelled in pain as Dr. Goodwitch inject the blueberry poison into her system and she begun to grumble.</span></div></div>",

Destiny just gave a sinister laugh as Bebe felt her rear getting rounder and from the looks of it, her front was going the same way as her muscles were slowly disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBebe let out a frantic meow as she felt her muscular arms getting soft and merging into her skin as her face and her torso were getting increasingly rounder.

Look at me! I've never been this bloated in my life. Ack! And my mouth tastes like blueberries. I'm allergic to blueberries.

I might just recommend you for an award.\u201d Dr. Goodwitch smiled but then her dead skin turned pale. \u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cYou actually want to try my blueberry poison on Persephone? You should\u2019ve executed her if what I heard about her was true. I heard that she once ate a bus load of tourists all the way from Chillingham and picked her teeth with the driver\u2019s ribs.\u201d Destiny gave a gag. \u201cPersephone never scared ME.

The guard was Clover Marathon, a bright green skinned grootslang, a hybrid of an elephant and a snake. She resembled an anthropomorphic African elephant with scaly skin and a cobra for a trunk. She also had yellow hair in a Bob haircut that made her resemble a certain spy cartoon character of the same first name. Persephone looked at the sorry excuse for food and couldn\u2019t identify it as meat or vegetables. She even sniffed it before turning to face Clover. \u201cIs this it? I would\u2019ve preferred a grootslang\u2019s heart, roasted on a stick with cinnamon. \u201cYou\u2019re not eating me today, you albino mongrel,\u201d said Clover. \u201cI can\u2019t wait for the day when the Warden finally decides to fry you.\u201d Persephone just spat at Clover to make her jump back. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be nasty, little elephant,\u201d said the murderous wolf. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in my tummy one of these days.\u201d Clover, not wanting to take any chances with the most dangerous villain in the Dark Side, quickly moves away from the cell as to avoid any accidents in case Persephone did manage to get out of her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone just shrugged and started to lap up as much of her dinner as she can with her muzzle in the way. Then she heard footsteps and Destiny was there with Dr. Goodwitch by her side. \u201cHello, Persephone.\u201d Said Destiny with venom in her voice. Persephone spotted the extremely nervous Dr. Goodwitch and smiled evilly as she licked her lips in anticipation. \u201cOh good,\u201d she said. \u201cYou brought some real food. Frankensteins give me gas, but I think I can manage.\u201d \u201cAll you\u2019ll be eating is your words, you many werewolf,\u201d said Destiny. \u201cIt\u2019s become a real bother keeping you locked up all the time, which is why I\u2019m going to do something about you.\u201d Dr. Goodwitch nervously holds up the syringe with the blueberry poison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething isn\u2019t right,\u201d said Persephone. \u201cUnder Gloom doesn\u2019t use lethal injection.\u201d Persephone growled and then she heard a clicking because Destiny was unlocking her muzzle. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be needing this any more, Howler. It would only be redundant.\u201d Persephone gave an evil smirk and showed her sharp teeth as she licked her lips and looked at Dr. Goodwitch in hunger. Dr. Goodwitch screamed as Persephone growled and leapt at her to try and bite her neck, but before the wolf could eat Dr. Goodwitch, Destiny grabbed her in a bear hug. Persephone growled and tried to scratch and bite Destiny. \u201cNow, Dr. Goodwitch! Hurry!\u201d Dr. Goodwitch hesitated slightly in fear but then she managed to inject Persephone as Persephone let out a growl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersephone then grunted and held onto her stomach as it was gurgling. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s going...?\u201d That was when the wolf\u2019s body turned blue and was expanding. The werewolf giantess cannibal growled as she expanded until she was as big and blue and round as Yuri. Persephone growled as she tried desperately to chomp on Dr. Goodwitch but she couldn\u2019t reach her. Destiny led the doctor out and locked Persephone\u2019s cell. Dr. Goodwitch was panting heavily as Destiny smiled at her. \u201cThank you, Dr. Goodwitch.

Nobody ever told that to Natasha Seldon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was a 35-year-old Sahara Sand Viper gorgon. She was 5'10'', covered in tan scales with light brown spots, had green eyes, and Sahara Sand Vipers for hair. She had a pronounced hourglass figure that was complemented by her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha was the CEO of SandCorp, a company specializing in chemicals. The years of being on top had inflated her ego to insane degrees, and people even thought she had a god complex. She viewed everyone as beneath her, using them like tools then tossing them away when she didn't need them. She was also incredibly vain. In her mind, she had to be the center of attention. Everyone had to focus on her. And everyone did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, usually. Because today, as Natasha walked through SandCorp's lobby, she was annoyed to see that no one had flocked to her like usual. Instead, everyone was gathered around something off to the side. From where Natasha stood, it looked like a giant ball, 6' in height and diameter. Confused and angered that no one was paying attention to her, she walked over to see what was so important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she saw when she got there confused her. In the center of the circle wasn't a ball, but another female gorgon. The woman had a gorgon head, but her body had become a massive sphere, with her hands and feet sucked into her body. Her breasts were the only thing that weren't absorbed by her body, having turned massive. Natasha also saw that the gorgon's scales had turned dark blue. Her cheeks were also puffed out. She was wearing a tee shirt and pants that somehow fit her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha recognized her as Cary, a scientist in the R&amp;D lab. But Natasha had seen her yesterday and she was normal. What had happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, everyone, enough gawking. Get back to work!\" Natasha yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally realizing their boss had shown up, everyone left, leaving only Cary in the middle of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks boss. It was getting kinda crowded.\" Cary said, relived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cary, what happened to you? And why was everyone focusing on you? They should be focusing on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yesterday, I was in R&amp;D, overseeing the production of a new flavor enchancer, when another worker spilled some chemicals on me. I was only shaken at first, but then my scales turned blue and I started blowing up until I wound up like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha got up close to her and poked her side. When she did, she heard the sound of liquid sloshing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Natasha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blueberry juice. Those chemicals turned me into a giant blueberry.\" Cary replied. \"They spent hours trying to juice me but nothing worked. Eventually, a doctor checked me out and said I might be stuck like this forever. Though it's not so bad. Everyone seems to think I look good this way, and have been showering attention on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Natasha mentally screamed. 'They should be paying attention to ME, not this bloated ball. If this is what they want, then fine! I'll get their attention back!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What chemicals were spilled on you?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\" Cary replied, closing her eyes to remember. \"D448, T199, B634, and R144.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her eyes again, she saw Natasha walking away, leaving her alone in the lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, can someone roll me to my office?\" She called out.<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nNatasha stormed into R&amp;D, surprising everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You,\" She pointed at a random scientist. \"I need chemicals, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which ones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D448, T199, B634, and R144. And bring me two of each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist complied and went to get them. A few minutes later, he came back with 8 bottles of blue liquids. Without saying anything, Natasha grabbed them, opened the bottles, and dumped the chemicals on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU MAD?!\" The scientist replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet, Tarleton.\" Natasha replied. \"If Cary thinks she can take my attention from me, she's wrong. If one dose of this junk made her that big, two doses will make me twice as big. Then everyone will love me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo the chemicals take effect now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking down, she saw that her belly had begin to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The chemicals are working!' Natasha thought. She then brought her hands up to her face. Sure enough, they had begun to turn blue. Turning on her heel, Natasha ran out of the R&amp;D lab and ran to her office, which was down the hall. (She didn't want to waste time using the elevator to get to R&amp;D.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind her, Natasha could feel the growth in her belly speed up. She now looked like she was 6 months pregnant. She also took note that her bust had begun to blow up too. And though she couldn't see it, she could feel her butt grow too. She gave her butt a slight slap, and heard a sloshing sound come from it. The blueberry juice was filling her quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, she felt her arms and legs begin to inflate too, becoming conical. By this point, her body had blown up to be quite big. Her breasts had become ZZ cups, her belly had become an overinflated yoga ball, and her butt looked like two beach balls. The blue on her body had also spread to her legs and torso. Only her head was still it's normal color. Through all this, Natasha could only think 'I'll show up Cary. She thinks she can take attention from me as a blueberry.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few more minutes, it had happened. Natasha's body had inflated to the point where it was almost a perfect sphere. Natasha had become as big as Cary, with the exception of her breasts being slightly bigger. She had also now turned completely blue. Somehow, throughout this ordeal, her suit hadn't burst. She guessed the chemicals had made it stretchy. She wasn't completey sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point that she discovered...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Natasha realized that she wasn't done growing yet. This both worried and excited her. If she could get bigger, maybe she had a chance to get all that attention back from Cary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she continued to swell up, going past the 6 feet Cary had been. She was thankful that she had picked a room with very high ceilings. After an incident involving a gorgon becoming a giantess, she had both high ceilings and big doors installed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, her growth stopped. To guess how big she was, she looked at the ceiling, which was 20 feet high. It looked there was a 10 foot gap, so she guessed she was 10 feet. She then looked down at herself. All she could see were her breasts, which were the size of beanbag chairs now. She could feel she was a ball now, her arms and legs sucked into her body, leaving only her hands and feet. In short, she was a blueberry now. She was amazed that her suit had remained intact, but again, she contributed that to the chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting her assistant, Natasha began rocking back and forth, hoping to roll enough so her hand could reach her desk. Eventually, she managed it and, with great effort, hit the call button on her intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scarlett, could you come in here? I need you for something.\" Natasha said into the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes madam.\" Scarlett replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha smiled at being called madam. Scarlett had only worked here for a few months, but she was completely devoted to Natasha. She did find it odd how Scarlett was obsessed with her even before she started working for her, but Natasha didn't care. As long as Scarlett contiuned to lavish attention on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatasha heard the doors open and, with more effort, rocked herself forward to face Scarlett. Scarlett was a red Cobra gorgon, just an inch shorter then Natasha with orange eyes. She was slim up top, but had a huge butt. Natasha never did figure out why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam, what happened?\" Scarlett asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cary had an accident that made her popular, so I recreated it to get that attention back.\" Natasha explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, those people out there will be noticing you. Though it's hard not to. You are the most beautiful woman ever, and this just makes you even more beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was Scarlett. Always lavishing praise onto Natasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Scarlett.\" Natasha replied. \"Now, do you mind rolling me to where Cary is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be an honor, Madam.\"<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMeanwhile, out in the parking lot, Cary had managed to learn how to roll herself and was leaving for the day. Though she found it hard to manuver with everyone around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, do you mind leaving? I need to get home.\" She said. No one listened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, everyone stopped when they heard the sound of something big being rolled. Turning, they saw the massive blue ball that was their boss, Natasha.<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone.\" Natasha called out. \"I know you all have come to love Cary and her blue form. But look at me. I'm bigger then her, and I make this look so much better. So, why don't you forget about that marble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's this crowds reaction?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Received from lwut: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/lwut2929\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/portfolio/view/lwut2929</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGorgons are my personal favorite monster species, but there don't seem to be any gorgon stories on this lovely site of ours. So why don't we add more, starting with this one. There's going to be a few rules though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. This story will only have 5 expansions: Breast, Butt, Belly, Brain(think Gravitina from Buzz Lightyear), and Blueberry. Any other expansions will not be accepted.<br>\r\n1A. Once you pick an expansion, you cannot use any others. For example, if you pick Breast expansion, you cannot have Butt expansion. That will confuse the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No sexual content. I want to keep this clean and sane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No characters under 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No bodily fluids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Nothing involving feet, tickling, farting, diapers, ect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Characters can be topless, but panties stay on at all times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No male expansion or viewpoints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. No TF or TG<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. Only two character can expand at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. No vore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. No shrinking. That is the literal opposite of expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n12. If you're characters breast fill with milk, she cannot lactate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n13. No death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n14. If you choose blueberry, the character cannot pop or be juiced. That would defeat the purpose of blueberry expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n15. No pregnancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n16. I know people love this, but no weight gain. (By this, I mean the fat HAS to stay in the area you picked to expand. If any other area starts growing as well, the chapter will be deleted.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n17. Whether or not they have their stone gaze is up to you. How they can control it and if they need glasses to stop it is up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n18. The Gorgons have to look at least 50% snake. I'm sick of Gorgons who are completely human looking except for snake hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n19. Please don't focus on only one expansion or story. Try to broaden your horizon and add to the others. For example, if your adding to breast expansion, try to write a story in the belly expansion section. You may be surprised at what you come up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n20. Finally, while this is an expansion story, try to actually have a plot, good grammar, and spelling. The writing minimum for this is two paragraphs. Except for option chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all. Have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
