            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The magical library of Viole'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn immense and labyrinthine library that sat below in the bowels of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. As far as the eye can see lay shelves upon shelves of any magical tome, grimoire and guidebook there could ever exist. For centuries, this vast collection of pages and covers was amassed by a single person, an extremely compulsive reader and a good friend to the owner of the mansion her mammoth library lay beneath; Patchouli Knowledge, otherwise known as the Unmoving Great Library, a fitting name for a witch that found no interest to leave her vast collection for over one hundred years on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli herself was a rather introverted individual, having no interest in the world outside of her library and putting all of her efforts in studying magic and experimenting with various aspects of the mystical and alchemic arts. This disinteresting in going out, also seemed to be due to the witch's less than stellar physical constitution, but it was something she could deal with considering her profession and usual hobbies. Despite her ill nature, Patchouli's figure was rather zaftig and healthy, the lack of manual labor and work on her part giving rise to a gradual layer of fat accumulating on her already curvy physique. The witch's pajama like attire swelled out in various areas of thickness, her hefty bosom resting atop a slightly convexed paunch that lightly swelled the middle of Patchouli's stripped dress. Below lay the exapnse of her wide and thickened hips and equally bounteous bottom that filled the frilly nightwear with it's jiggling mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everything seems to be in order...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch's hushed voice muttered out, her sleepy eyes gazing into the pages of a thickened grimoire before craning upward to stare at her current construction; an incricate magic circle adorned with runes and ancient glyphs of an esoteric origin. However, while these sigils could mean nothing to the common mind, Patchouli knew exactly what these letters meant to her newly built gateway of sorcery; they were designed to call forth an entity from another plane, the alternate and demonic world of Makai. Indeed, Patchouli was going to summon a demon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Patchouli had one demonic familiar helping her in the library, it was already clear that another would be required as a means of both giving the aforementioned help and perhaps specializing in combat to deter any threats and intruders who step foot in this library unannounced. Her current familiar, Koakuma, was effectual and actually helped bridge a social gap that Patchouli herself never would have crossed. However, when it came to handling more than one task and combat, her abilities seemed to falter. It was through this observation that Patchouli came to the conclusion that another familiar was needed to help make things a little more effecient in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another silent check around to see if anything was out of order, the pruplenette began the summoning ritual, a magical aura manifesting across her plump form as the tome she held began to levitate from her fingertips. Patchouli's lips muttered of an unknowable demonic tongue, her streaming chant coaxing the magical circle to glow and mingle with her swirling energies. Soon enough, the once calm exchange of magic began to intensify by the second, the magic circle's brightened aura empowering itself with Patchouli's magic as it began to establish a connection with the demon she wished to summon from Makai.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the mystical energies reached their absolute peak, Patchouli spread her arms wide and ushered in the new addition to her library and her new familiar; \"<b>AND WITH MY WORDS, I COMMEND THEE, TO BRING FORTH A CHILD OF SHINKI!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic circle agreed to her request, the center of it's form erupting with a pillar of light as mauve flames ignited on the numerous corners of the runic summoning circle. A deep rumble began to thunder from the core of the magic circle before a bolt of mystical lightning struck down in it's center, a bright and luminous nova exploding from the circle as the familiar made it's way to the library's native coil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli covered her eyes as the brightened flare began to slowly lose it's blinding splendor, the witch blinking several times as she was slowly allowed the ability to gaze into the calming circle. Slowly, as the light dispersed, Patchouli was able to the new familiar's form, her sights managing to see...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She needed to cover his boy up and maybe find him some clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the tiring walk to her bedroom and returning with a blanket, she wrapped the quilt over the imp and carried him bridal-style to a nearby couch and set him down gently.

He still had the blanket wrapped around him, and was seemingly pleading at Patchouli.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting her book, Patchouli questioned \"Oh, you're up. Something bothering you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white haired boy nodded rapidly, his motions almost making it look like his head would snap off. Walking away from Patchouli and towards one of her many bookcases, he then pointed silently next to it. Setting her book down, Patchouli trudged along the floor, making her way to the bookcase. When she got there, Patchouli was met with an unusual sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the finger of her new familiar, she saw several books from the cases floating in the air, hovering for a short while before descending into a bag on the floor. The bag looked pretty full, with several books already inside. Patchouli soon felt a tug on her gown, only to see the imp holding up a book. Glancing at the book's title, it read \"The Invisible Man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why are you showing me thi-\" Patchouli stopped herself in mid sentence, understanding why the Imp showed her the book. Hovering quickly towards the closest bathroom, she came back with a fresh cup of water. With it, she walked over to the bag of books and the steady stream of literature entering the bag. As Patchouli approached, she noticed the floating book freeze into place, and the bag on the floor begin to move, as if being tugged away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just as he thought, this isn't magic, it's just someone using an invisibility spell or potion.\" Patchouli thought as she chased the supposed invisible figure. \"I won't be surprised if it's who I think it is.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cup of water in hand, she threw the liquid in front of her, supposedly at the invisible person. Much to her and the Imp's pleasure, who was currently waving his hands around in joy, the liquid hit something and formed the shape of a person. As the water overrided the effects of the invisibility, a familiar figure began to materialise in front of Patchouli and the Imp. This figure was no other than...</span></div></div>",

In the very same cocky smile she always had on her face, Marisa Kirisame appeared before Patchouli and the Imp. Quickly shoving her current book into the bag of others, she gave a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Patchouli! I know what you're thinking, \"Really Marisa? You think some simple invisibility potion is going to outsmart me?\" Let me tell you, I had my doubts from the beginning, so don't think I'm losing my touch or nothing.\" Marisa scratched the back of her head in an embarrassed way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTilting her head past Patchouli, Marisa noticed the young imp boy behind her, smiling at the sight of her. \"Ooooo, I haven't seen him before! Is he a new familiar? A boyfriend? The second brother's son on your mother's side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiring a barrage of Danamku at Marisa the second she stopped talking, Patchouli took to the air and began her assault, rage seething behind her eyes. Whistling with her fingers, Marisa's broom weaved through the library and flew over to her, giving her the time to hop onto it. With Marisa trying to make a swift escape and Patchouli wanting to shoot her down, it was a quite a spectacle for the Imp to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Patchouli started to slow down, cough violently as she flew, Marisa turned around on her broom and slowed down. \"What? Tired already? Come on Patchy get your act together! Seriously, go see Eirin or someone, you're in awful shape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer wanting to see anymore of Marisa's attitude, the boy's eye glowed bright red. Raising his hands, a red aura radiated from them. As they did, Marisa soon felt herself and her broom both come to a stop. Looking around, she noticed that she and the broom were both trapped in a red aura, just like the one the boy was using. Suddenly, Marisa was pulled down to the ground, trapped inside the red glow, until she was brought onto a spare chair, and soon fitted with a red aura styled binding spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly levitating back to ground, Patchouli covered her mouth to cough and soon met up with the Imp. \"That was remarkable! Thank you ever so much.\" Patchouli then followed the boy towards the chair where Marisa was held.</span></div></div>",

Noticing that Patchouli was approaching, she gave a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, looks like that new familiar of yours is a pretty talented kid. He caught me on his first try, something you've never been able to do!\" Marisa laughed, Patchouli feeling hurt by her words. \"Maybe you should let him take over the library? He'd do a far better job than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of Patchouli's fingers, Marisa's mouth disappeared from her face, leaving the magician to muffle what other jibes she had to say. Making her way back to the Imp, she knelt over and whispered to him \"She is right, this is the first time she's even been caught.\" Patchouli stroked her chin. \"Come to think of it, I haven't ever thought of something to do with her. I'll need to get something arranged to teach her a lesson, not to mention keep her out of my hair for a while. Maybe you could think of something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in Patchouli's words, the Imp scratched his head. An audible \"Hmm\" could be heard, which was soon followed by him dashing into one of the many sections of the library. It wasn't long before he returned with a book, bounding over to Patchouli and passing her the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExamining the cover, Patchouli saw that the book was called \"Hansel and Gretel\". \"This familiar seems to like Outside World stories.\" She pondered, opening the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStories from the Outside weren't Patchouli's personal preference for books. They very rarely talked about magic, usually having some kind of fictional magic that is merely for entertainment purposes. While modern technology and ideas could be learnt from Outside literature, it was mostly things that would be very hard for Patchouli to replicate, the only endeavour she ever took involving Outside World technology being the rocket that was made to traverse to the Moon. Even then, it took a lot of teamwork and some help from the Lunarians to even get going. Simply put, Patchouli did not read Outside World books to much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking through the pages of the book the Imp had given her, she soon came to a conclusion on her familiar's idea. </span></div></div>",

She took note of the two fictional children as they munched their way through a gingerbread house and continued to snack on much to the also fictional witches delight. Patchouli's mind flared with ideas and she shut the book just before the Witch revealed her plans in the story. The purple clothed magician had read enough to know what she thought of this idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli grabbed the Imp and gave him a peck on his cheek, Patchouli surprised herself at her impulsive action. \"You are a genius, this plan is great!\" She whispered to him. \"If we can fatten up Marisa to immobility there's no way she'll bother us ever again!\" Making her way over to the exit of her library, Patchouli gave a quick wave to the Imp before she took her leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloating up the stairs and into the Scarlet Devil Mansion's hallways, Patchouli began her search for the always elegant chief maid of the Mansion, Sakuya Izayoi. Always clad in blue maid clothing, Sakuya was easily distinguishable by her glistening silver hair and beautiful blue eyes. With the ability to stop, slow down and speed up time, the duties as a maid were a breeze for Sakuya. While she and Patchouli didn't always see eye to eye, they would still work with each other when the situation called for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Patchouli found Sakuya, who was busy disciplining a group of unruly fairy maids, the chief maid brandishing her trademark throwing knifes as a symbol of intimidation for her much smaller co-workers. Sakuya's eyes caught Patchouli's purple clothes nearing her, which caused the maid to quickly dismiss the fairy maids in light of her fellow housemate at the Mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Patchouli? Is something troubling you?\" Sakuya asked the magician. She knew that Patchouli very rarely left her library unless something important had occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakuya, I must ask you for a most important favour.\" Patchouli asked, slightly out of breath despite her use of hovering rather than running. \"You know of that Black White magician?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya's concerned face turned to an icy frown. \"You don't even need to mention her name. I am fully aware of that intolerable witch who forever disturbs m'lady's domain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli attempted to smile to bring up the mood. \"Well, a new familiar of mine managed to incapacitate her in my library and we have a plan to make it so she won't be a nuisance to us any more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya's eyebrows raised up. \"Tell me more of your...plan.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This was a revolutionary discovery on part of Patchouli and her new familiar, something that could very well rid them of their little witch problem for good. While not directly involved with the library and the inner workings of the magically inclined chamber of books, Sakuya found that it was always in her best interest in finding ways to better improve the security of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and with Marisa constantly finding ways in and out of the library...well, it acted as a persistent blemish on the head maid's record of keeping the mansion, not only in working order, but it's interior free from intruders, thieves and other manners of interlopers who seek to disrupt the residents that lived here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, listen to this,\" Patchouli began, confident in the newest plot to keep Marisa out of their hair for good. \"In my time in dealing with Marisa, one of the largest factors of her entrance and escape from me was all thanks to one thing...her speed. All of this time, I've tried keeping Marisa out and each time, she's managed to weasel her way in. However, now the idea shifts to keeping her in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Patchouli smirked, the idea still sounding as if it was one of the best epiphanies to happen to the witch in centuries, Sakuya stood by with a skeptical look. The maid wasn't entirely sold on things, mostly from Patchouli mentioning one phrase that perplexed her greatly. \"...'keep her in'?\" Sakuya echoed, with a raised eyebrow. \"Wasn't the plan to keep the witch out of the mansion, Miss Patchouli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, not quite, Sakuya.\" Patchouli corrected, having figured the head maid would find her choice of words rather odd. \"You see, my newest familiar showed me something a moment ago...something that told me that, the best way to be rid of our little Black White magician is to fatten her up to immobility!\" Patchouli concluded, giving to Sakuya the book in which the young imp had given his master. Sakuya gazed at the children's book in a curious manner, turning it to one side as if examining it for anything unusual before, taking a look at the pages within. The maid wasn't exactly an avid reader like Patchouli, she herself finding little time to do so usually because she was often busy catering to the needs of either, the mansion or her mistress. That said, Sakuya wasn't entirely familiar with a lot of stories but, this one however...it seemed to strike a chord of familiarity to her, something she wasn't entirely certain as to why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it, if we fatten Marisa up to a point where she can't even move, what choice does she have but to sit on her fattened duff? She can't go anywhere from being so engorged, she can't steal anything from me because she'll be too big to move. It's the perfect plan!\" Patchouli explained further, Sakuya swiftly examining the book before she handed it back to the plump witch and took a moment to think on whether this was worth trying or not. At face value, Patchouli's proposition was sound, if a little silly, but with time it could very well keep Marisa from causing any more trouble at the mansion. However, there was still one thing Sakuya felt was worth mentioning...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Danmaku?\" The maid inquired, Patchouli perking up at the question. \"Marisa may be immobile, but that does not mean she is without magic to use at her leisure. This plan is actually rather good, but we need a way to neutralize her destructive attacks, otherwise, we'll end up with a bloated magician that constantly causes property damages to the mansion and is someone whom we can't get rid of due to the very same girth that's pinned her down.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, I have several methods that will help in dampening, or even nulling, Marisa's destructive power. One of these methods involves her power being stifled for every pound she gains.\" Patchouli replied, the witch already seeming to be ahead of the maid in her thoughts. Even so, with that out of the way, there was still yet another fork in this road that needed to be passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, but there's one more thing we must address.\" said Sakuya, the witch leaning in slightly to hear of what the maid had to offer this time. \"How shall we go about fattening Marisa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a good question, one that would ultimately decide on who would be the one focusing their attention on making Marisa as big as a house. Patchouli stood by, pacing around a bit to think on her answer, only two obvious choices presenting themselves but only one standing out to her...</span></div></div>",

Do you think you'll be able to handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am always ready for anything Miss Patchouli, especially if it involves the Black White Witch getting what's coming to her.\" Sakuya replied in a confident tone. \"What will you require me to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe purple clad magician cleared her throat, then began another explanation. \"There is no doubting your culinary skills, is there Sakuya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can handle any recipe that is given to me, name it and I will make it.\" The maid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that is just what you will doing for this plan Sakuya.

Inside are recipes for what is commonly referred to as \"Fast Food\" by humans from there.\" The magician gave a small chuckle at the very thought of such foods. \"Their high calorie count and simple recipes will make this plan work smoothly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya closed the book and raised a question. \"While I can fulfil my side of your plan all well and good, where do you come into this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli put her hand up, signalling that she knew a response to the Maid's question. \"As well as providing that book, I am currently in the process of searching for more of these cookery books that will aid you. Due to my library's size, this could take some time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Sakuya could speak up again, Patchouli added more to her response. \"Plus, I shall be working my hand at some enchantments on your cooking. As I previously mentioned, an enchant that will drain Marisa's magical abilities will be added, but that is not all. Koakuma haw been assisting me as well and she was able to find a perfectly good hunger enchant in my tomes. With this handy magic, the more one eats, the hungrier one becomes!\" The purple witch clapped her hands together, pleased with herself at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya gave a nod of approval. \"This plan sounds good to me, I cannot see how this could fail us.\" The always elegant maid began to walk away, the Outside World cooking book in hand. \"I shall begin gathering the ingredients required for these new meals right away. When your enchants are perfected, come to the main kitchen as soon as you can.\" Taking a pocket watch from one of her compartments, Sakuya disappeared in a flash, leaving Patchouli to make her way back to the library.</span></div></div>",

When she got there, she saw the enchant she had made, a combination of the hunger increasing spell and the magic decreasing spell. It was a little tough to get right even with Koakuma's help, so she hoped that it would work just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting her mind drift into a state of emptiness, Patchouli looked over the vast amounts of food and began chanting the spell. The piles of juicy burgers and succulent steaks, the treats smothered in chocolate and drenched in sugar, the containers filled to the brim with syrup and peanut butter, every piece of delicious food lay before the master magician as she recalled the spell as loud as her weak voice could allow her to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the enchant was completely recalled, Patchouli floated back down to the floor, a little uneasy as the chants had drained her of her strength. The magical essence of the spell, personified in a golden powder, fluttered onto the many foodstuffs below, every single item of food now enchanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining her balance, Patchouli surveyed the many meals. \"I did find that enchant quite hard to create, I'd feel safer if we got ourselves a test of the food to see if it all worked. If it doesn't work, Marisa is sure to be suspicious of us with all this food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya nodded. \"Oh yes, good thinking.

Today had been quite uneventful, so she decided to have her daily nap earlier than usual, allowing her to be wide awake for the rest of her duties that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the gate with a tray of enchanted food in hand, Sakuya eagerly awaited the results of Patchouli's spellcasting to see if the food she had created and allowed to be enchanted was suitable for the cunning plan to get Marisa out of their hair once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling the gates open to get through, Meiling was alerted of Sakuya's movement and gave an approving grin. \"Hey there Sakuya! Isn't it a bit early to be having lunch? Either way I'm not complaining!\" Meiling eyed up the many foods on the tray with hungry eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've decided to make something a little different today, so I thought it'd be best to share it with you earlier.\" Sakuya approached the gatekeeper and brandished the tray right before her. \"I would love to know what you think of these meals. They're many delicacies from the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeiling took a slice of pizza from the tray and looked at it gleefully. \"Wow....this looks great! Sure thing Sakuya, I'll gladly let you know what I think.\" The elegant maid looked on silently as Meiling took the slice and took several bites from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya smiled as she heard the moans of pleasure come from Meiling, followed be her quickly eating the rest of the slice. \"That....That was divine! It's the best thing I've ever tasted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you liked that, then this whole tray is yours for the taking.\" Sakuya beamed as she handed the many foods to Meiling. \"There's plenty of other new foods for you to try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, the tray was snatched from her hands as Meiling sat down against the wall and began to devour the other meals that rested on the tray. Loud chews and pleased moans were all that could be heard from her as Sakuya looked on. Allowing her fellow colleague to eat in peace, the maid closed the gates behind her and made her way back to the Mansion to tell Patchouli the good news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really worked?\" The magician asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, Meiling started stuffing her face the moment she tasted a morsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! Let's serve those meals to Marisa at once! Let's start our plan so she'll never bother us again!\" Patchouli rushed to her library as fast as she could, quickly disappearing from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya pondered. \"Hmmm...guess I'll need to make sure Meiling gets fed regularly too....better make sure she can still walk though...\" With that thought, she took another tray of calorie caked treats and made her way to the library as well.</span></div></div>",

So many rich meals all lined up for me, it's wonderful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing her nose to the most delectable of the foods, Remilia found herself face to face with a pile of chocolate bars, all based around the many different tastes each brand followed.

Having shown that he did not hold the ability to speak, it was mostly just Marisa talking to herself with no response. Patchouli didn't mind the annoyance of her constant talking, as she knew that very soon Marisa would be stuffing her mouth full of calorie filled treats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa noticed the return of the duo. \"Oh, heya both. It's been kinda boring here, with your little friend here not saying a syllable. Maybe next time a familiar that can talk would be better? His magic is nice and all, but the no talkie thing doesn't fly with me. Maybe you could be a good little asthmatic youkai and let me go now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Sakuya have been thinking of keeping you here for a little while. Can't be having a little thief like yourself running around being a nuisance now, can we?\" Patchouli signaled for Sakuya to approach with her tray in hand. The various fattening foods were presented to the young witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you will be staying with us for some time, it makes sense to keep you fed. Consider this your lunch for the day.\" Sakuya smiled as she put the tray on the nearest table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarisa's eyes instantly lit up. \"Oh wow, I wasn't expecting this! You call this keeping me hostage? Where's the luxury clothing and expensive wines while you're at it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli leaned over to Sakuya. \"Marisa is never one to miss a free meal. About what she said....make sure to sew some plus sized clothing for when she inevitably outgrows her current dress....\" The purple haired girl didn't like the concept of having Marisa as a naked jiggling mess in her library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeespite being binded to the chair by the powers of the imp, Marisa could still use her arms freely. Taking a sugar coated doughnut from the tray Sakuya presented her, she sunk her teeth into it and began to chew, A very pleased look appeared on her face, followed by her wolfing the rest of it down followed by licking her lips and fingers for excess powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Sakuya....I knew you were a good cook but that was fantastic! I've been missing out on some quality food not coming to you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli gleefully looked onwards as the tray gradually became empty, her hostage happily gorging herself on the many delicacies from the outside world. She made short work of the food before her, only taking ten minutes to eat it all. Licking her fingers once more, Marisa gave a thumbs up to the maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is how I'll be treated, I'm just fine with your little captivity game you're playing Patchy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we can't let you go starving while you're here, right?\" Patchouli replied. \"We'll have some more food up for you later, okay? See you then!\" She hovered away with Sakuya in tow, leaving Marisa and the Imp alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked perfectly! She ate that so fast, I can't imagine what she'll be like when the full hunger sets in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll make sure there's enough food to keep her occupied.\" Sakuya responded. \"I do wonder if the Shrine Maiden will look into things if Marisa disappears for long enough.\" She warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Right now all I care about is getting that nuisance fattened up and make sure her magic is sapped too. Soon enough she'll be nothing more that an useless immobile blob...\" The magician giggled to herself as she and the head maid walked out of the library.</span></div></div>",

Naturally up early and properly dressed, Sakuya walked through the mansion to prepare everyone for the following day. Having worked with Patchouli actively over the past days, she decided it would be best to wake her up first. Her magical abilities had proved to be vastly useful in their plan against Marisa, so another early morning batch of the enchanted food would be easy to create.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the bedchamber of the magician, Sakuya lit the candles in the room and approached the bed Patchouli slept in. She lifted the covers and let her stir in her own time and pace. Eventually, she awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....Miss Sakuya...\" She groaned, clearly sleepy. \"Is it morning already?....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed it is. If you could so kindly wake so we can create more of Marisa's meals. The plan has been going swimmingly as of late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli smiled. \"I am too pleased with the progress. Let us begin shortly....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising out of her bed using her magic, Patchouli hovered over to the desk of her bedroom. While the tired girl did lose her balance while hovering, swinging left and right while almost crashing into the wall, she still made it over to her dressing table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall I assist you in dressing yourself Lady Patchouli?\" Sakuya offered. Being the head maid, she tried to be as helpful as possible. She avidly assisted Remilia in dressing herself, along with the occasional help for Patchouli if she desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes please Sakuya....\" From the huge yawn she let out, it was clear why she wanted the help. Removing her worn nightgown she had slept in, a cause for concern gripped Sakuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli's body had shrunk greatly. Sakuya knew her body type. She had always been on the larger side, years of staying in the library moulded her figure to be quite plump. But now that was all gone, her body now looking painfully thin. Her backbone jutted out on her skin, her rear was tiny compared to it's once jiggling mass. Through the mirror of the room, Sakuya could spy deflated breasts and visible ribs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lady Patchouli! What on earth have you done to yourself?!\" The elegant maid exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatchouli looked down at herself, then waved a bony hand nonchalantly. \"It is nothing Miss Sakuya. Just a side effect of the spells I've been doing. I assure you, everything is just fi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sentence would cut off by Sakuya dragging the much thinner girl from her room all the way to the kitchen. Patchouli's magic was unable to focus at this time, causing her to alternate between hovering and walking, though being dragged all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are ill enough as it is Lady Patchouli!\" Sakuya yelled. \"I will not have you risking your health like this! If you do wish to continue with this, then I must keep you well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat the partially naked girl onto a chair in the kitchen, followed by clawing her way through the pantries of the room. Many of the outside world delicacies lay on a table on the other side of the kitchen, obviously intended for their meddling guest. For Patchouli, Sakuya created many of her usual meals, a variety of meats and sponge cakes. Being a talented chef, this did not take long to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPresenting the large spread to Patchouli, Sakuya stared at her. \"From now on, you will be kept on a strict diet. You must eat all the food I serve you, no matter how much it is. If you fail to follow this, I will be to resort to forcefeeding. Do you understand Lady Patchouli?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking note of the maid's concern for her well being, Patchouli did indeed understand. \"Yes I do. From now on, I will eat what you desire me to.\" While she was intimidated by the sheer size of the portion she had, as well as what else Sakuya had in store for her, she knew better than to anger her by disobeying. Taking the first dish prepared for her, Patchouli began to eat it with a quick pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you are going along with this. Just remember, this is more for your own well being than it is for the success of our plan.\" Sakuya reminded her. With that, she remembered that Marisa was set for her now daily fattening breakfast. Taking the trays of outside world food from the table, she made her way to the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not enchanted due to Lady Patchouli's situation, but they should still bulk her up well.\" She thought as she made her way there.</span></div></div>",

It had seen became a rather lively place due to the addition of a loudmouth magician, but thankfully she'd been too busy enjoying the vast amounts of meals supplied to her to cause any kind of ruckus. Even so early on in her and Patchouli's plans, Sakuya felt much more at peace knowing that regular break ins into the mansion would be a thing of the past, no longer feeling as much stress as she would before due to the near daily occurrence. Bringing the trays inside, Sakuya spotted the captive. Marisa sat in her bound chair with hungry eyes focused on the various foods all presented and all for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mornin' Sakuya! Looks tasty as usual!\" Marisa greeted as she lifted her hands up in preparation for gorging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too Marisa.\" Sakuya bowed. \"Today you have pancakes with a variety of spreadables. Do enjoy\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the trays were placed on the nearby table, Marisa wasted no time pouring syrup onto the pancakes and hungrily eating away at them. Sakuya smiled as she witnessed the food massacre, taking a look at the black white magician. Only a few days in and the enchanted food was doing it's magic, as clearly visible on the girl. The curve of her belly could be seen through her clothes, along with her breasts looking rounder and more defined in the fabric. Her face had plumped out slightly, along with her arms sporting extra flab. It was early days, but it was a sure fire sign that the fattening was working. There was no doubts in anyone's mind that the hunger enchantments were working, as Marisa near demolished the breakfast before her with no regard for cutlery, using her hands to shovel food in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmpgh....how do you make your food so delicious...\" Marisa moaned between bites, causing Sakuya to put a hand to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You flatter me Marisa. I shall be back when you are finished to collect your tray. Dinner shall be ready soon.\" With another bow, the elegant maid left once more. Her mind cast to the future, envisioning just how large the witch would end up with an eating rate like that.</span></div></div>",

As this was the only indication of the creature's demonic origin, she decided to call him only \"butler\". When this examination process ended, the butler spoke: \"I have been ushered into existence from realms unspoken into a single purpose: serving my Mistress. Even such is my loyalty that any other purpose given to me by Her word will be obeyed in the absolute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned visibly in satisfaction.

Food would always be prepared on a shared table, the only thing Sakuya had been willing to serve her personally had been tea.

This day she already noticed plates of cookies, chocolate, slices of tender meat and so on, all headed to her rooms, and it wasn't even noon yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could somewhat tolerate this \"room service\", but she also worried for the Mistresses' health. Every plate, filled with only sweets, junk food, meat products and refreshments, returned to the kitchen emptied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was thinking of this of this as she walked past The Lady's private quarters' doors.

Known for her expertise in housekeeping, which ranged from cooking, to cleaning, to dealing with unwanted guests in the mansion, she was also known for her abilities with time itself, being able to slow down and speed up pockets of time, which was handy for growing crops amongst other things. Plus, the time powers allowed her to also stop the flow of time itself, leaving all but herself frozen in place, which proved very handy during combat situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill wearing her usual blue and white maid uniform, symbolising she was still working at such a late hour, she covered her mouth to block a yawn as she approached the magician and the young man she had whisked to her quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Patchouli, what are you doing at such an hour?

As expected of someone from the outside world. I can tell from his clothes.\" She walked over to Ken, continuing her glare over him as she circled around his wide body. \"Tell me Miss Patchouli, does he claim to be skilled in any fields?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did inform me that he has a profession as a chef, so the male has knowledge of cookery.\" The magician rubbed her weary eyes, readjusting her hat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smile then crept onto Sakuya's face, a glint appearing in her sapphire eyes. \"Perhaps this man could be of some use to us....\"</span></div></div>",

Using the ingredients at his disposal, he worked on roasting meat, chopping vegetables and kneading dough. The moment he was done with one task, he moved right onto the next. His speed and swiftness was surprising for his chubby frame, seemingly no factor in the effort he put in. Aromas soon filled the air, a short preview of just what kinds of meals he was intending to make.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakuya...you did make sure to check that meat, right?\" Patchouli asked, somewhat nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would be the matter with it Miss Patchouli?\" Sakuya responded, confused at what possibly could be the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have both animal meats and meats that the Mistress...enjoys. She enjoys her own from less reliable sources...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see what you mean now.\" Sakuya waved her hand and smiled. \"Not to fear, I've made sure it's not that kind of meat. I run a perfect shift in this household.\" However, the confidence Patchouli had in her statement didn't last long. \"Besides, a little cannibalism never hurt anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate into the night, Ken cooked away, While Sakuya stayed wide awake to keep a sharp eye on him, Patchouli and Koakuma had begun snoozing away, both lying face down on a table. Their slumber didn't last long, as they were woken by an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've finished my creations.\" Ken took a seat and rested, clearly worn out from excessive cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver haired girl looked down at the cooking area. He had certainly outdone himself, with a full spread of meals on display. Roast dinners of beef and vegetables were common on the table. Pork inside pastry was also very prominent. Skewers in shish kebab style piled on top of each other. Specific parts of meats were focused upon, with plates of bacon strips and bowls of chicken legs. It was grand feast which surprising the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow....it all looks so good!\" Koakuma was near salivating at the foods before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It certainly is a vast amount...\" Patchouli noted.

Next to the pantries laid a fairly large fridge, encased in white silver and looming over the kitchen like an ominous monolith.  That fridge happened to be a gift from her friend Yukari Yakumo, and Yuyuko recalled Yukari explaining that a fridge was a device from the Outside World used to preserve large amounts of food for long periods of time through cold temperatures and the fridge being \"a perfect gift for a bottomless pit of a stomach like you\", whatever that means.  Still, the importance of the fridge must mean that all of the tasty meals must be in there!  Yuyuko then went to the fridge and opened both of the doors wide open.

It smelled like...chocolate. Maybe it was chocolate! But Yuyuko had only seen and eaten small pieces of candied chocolate, never one at this scale before! It was bigger than a wagon wheel and thicker too! Yuyuko marveled at the chocolate confection, still not knowing what it is, but she knew how to find out. She didn't visit the kitchen often, but she remembered that Yukari had sent her Shikigami Ran over several weeks ago, giving Yuyuko some news about what's going on in Gensokyo and leaving Youmu with several 'magazines', tall and thin booklets with pictures in them. She remembered spying on Youmu after Ran had left that day and saw Youmu stuff the magazines in one of the kitchen drawers. There were only so many drawers in this kitchen...how hard could it be to find a few books?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvidently, very. Yuyuko struggled to open most of the these drawers, not because she was out of shape (even though she was), but because Youmu was a very organized person, especially in the kitchen. Each drawer was tightly packed with tools and utensils, so tightly that upon prying open drawers 2 and 3, she narrowly avoiding being skewered by several knifes &amp; cleavers that came flying out of each of them, most of which only tore holes in Yuyuko's already loose and open robe, one of which tore the cloth right between her legs, exposing her large ass if she were to bend down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a total 45 minutes for Yuyuko to wriggle the 4th drawer in the kitchen open, by which point Yuyuko had worked up a mighty sweat, which was thankfully cooled by still open Fridge. Inside the 4th drawer were the thin booklets that Youmu had stashed! Yippee! Now Yuyuko could see what this massive treat was. Flipping through the pages, Yuyuko tried not to get distracted by the delicious looking pictures, focused on finding this large chocolate wheel. Halfway through the 2nd magazine, she spotted the picture she was looking for. A large, chocolate wheel, complete with a recipe...the treat was called a 'cake'. A section of small text below the picture caught her attention; 'Chocolate Cake, the go to treat for the Birthday Bash of your beloved!' \"<span class=\"cpred\">Birth..day?</span>\", Yuyuko asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a ghost who had been sealed in a youkai tree for hundreds of years, Yuyuko couldn't quite remember what a 'birthday\" was, but she knew it was some kind of party. So, this 'cake' was for a festivity dedicated to someone else...it was likely from one of their friends, but Yuyuko could stop thinking about eating it. A piece of chocolate that large, that tasty, that...moist...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>UUUUUUUURRRRGH!</i></b> Yuyuko jumped at the sudden noise, her vast womanly assets bouncing as she did. Thinking she'd been caught, she flung the magazine down the floor and hid under one of the tall white marble counters...after several minutes, Yuyuko caught her breath and came out for under the counter. Looking around, the lights were still off...but the door to the fridge has been shut! If no one was there, then how could that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading to the fridge, Yuyuko opened it and started at the tremendous chocolate cake...eyes widening and mouth watering Yuyuko took the cake from the top shelf and carried it over to the counter.

She bit into the cake like a predator bites into its pray. Her beautiful kimono got dirtier with every bite she took, but it mattered not to Yuyuko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chocolate was exquisite. Even to a connoiseur, it was one of a kind, much more so to Yuyuko. Youmu never allowed her sweets so she had to sneak them by, but this time she was unchained. Unleashed. Still hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she knew, the platter was empty. Instinctively, she bit into the rest of the cake, not even caring to cut it up. In her delirious state, she devoured the humongous cake. As she tried to guide every piece into her mouth, the platter on which the cake has been set tipped over, all of it spilling on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis startled her as she dropped on the floor, chocolate everywhere. Finally somewhat snapping out of it, she noticed something has changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat laid before her was a large bulbous mass, violently protruding through her kimono, all covered in chocolate. She inevitably arrived to the shocking conclusion: This must be her belly. As the calories were fresh, the fat has had yet to settle, at the moment forming what one would describe as a belly of a \"lady in her 8th month\". Yuyuko affectionately stroked this food baby, the baby seemingly reacting by growling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile doing so, her belly has begun to slowly lose its tense spherical shape. What she noticed as a result of that were her breasts. Funnily enough, like you get used to looking at your nose, she has gotten used to ingoring her two melon-sized breasts, but she couldn't anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey now pushed aside the kimono and jumped out into the open, finally enjoying their freedom. She untied the obi that had been restricting her growth up until now. Sagging slightly, her milk tanks rested slightly on her stomach, even surpassing it somewhat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs chocolate also has the effects of an amphrodisiac, her next course of action was only obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then you scared me even closer to it, but it's ok, cus you are baaaack!</span>\" As Yuyuko's hug continues, The statuesque spirit's mountainous breasts situated themselves on either side of Youmu's white-haired head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the fact she should be used to this, with innumerable years of serving Yuyuko under her proverbial belt...Youmu could never not be uncomfortable whenever it happened, this moment being no exception. \"<span class=\"cteal\">Yuyuko-sama...please. Let...go...of...me!</span>\" After several more minutes, Youmu squirmed her way out of Yuyuko's embrace. Catching her breath, she was finally able to get a word in edgewise to her Lady; \"<span class=\"cteal\"><i>gasp...gasp...gasp</i>...Yes, <i>cough</i>, Yuyuko-sama, I have returned. I was only gone for maybe...2 Hours? To be honest, I'm surprised to find you awake even at this hour. Ordinarily, you sleep until 1 in the afternoon. I'm not, however, surprised to see you in the kitchen...And to find you attempting to eat the cake I made, but I'll return to that later. First, why did you open all these drawers, my knives are splayed in all directions now! Was it to slice the cake? And can you not do something as simple as dressing yourself? Just because you had the manor to yourself, doesn't mean you can walk around with a wide open robe! For goodness sake, did your sense of decency die when you did?!</span>\" Youumu looked down,  gripping the bridge of her nose, only to lift her face back towards the direct of her Lady, where it displayed an even more intense stern look of frustration...\"\"<span class=\"cteal\">Yuyuko-sama...just...what were you doing?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">Oh..my...</span>\" Yuyuko became timid at the conclusion of Youmu's tirade, \"<span class=\"cpred\">I...I became elated when it dawned on me that I had the manor to myself, so I made my way into the kitchen...you normally don't let me in here. I'm not dumb...I know why. And when I saw the cake, I had never laid my eyes on one before, so I just had to know what it was, so I snooped in the drawers to find those magazines...After that, I couldn't contain myself, I just wanted one bite! Ohhhhh...Youmu! I'm sooo sorryyyy!!</span>\" By the end of her defense, Yuyuko's voice had become a painfully saddened whimper, looking downwards as she spoke and poking her fingertips together. This, in combination with her round delicate face, made for an adorable display that made Youmu feel guilty for scolding her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuyuko was now on her knees, the open nature of her damaged robe granting visibility to her nipples &amp; inner thighs, much to Youmu's embarrassment. Yuyuko was almost on the verge of tears when Youmu decided to console her, knowing that she couldn't let her Lady become so glum. Kneeling down to Yuyuko's level, she stroked her fluffy cherry-pink locks, calming her. Looking up to face Youmu, she saw that where tired and angered eyes were once kept now rested a gentle &amp; empathetic gaze, a soft smile on Youmu's lips below. \"<span class=\"cteal\">Yuyuko-sama...I should be the one apologizing to you. I don't remember the last time I had ever spoken to you like that...it was likely after the incident we managed to cause, and even then, I only scolded you so I wouldn't feel any guilt about helping you steal the Spring. This time...I have no excuse...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">Y-Youmu...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cteal\">I haven't finished...you see, I had made that cake only after Ran-san had granted me those magazines. It seemed like a great gift for someone. It's for that Reisen girl, over at Eintei in the Bamboo Forest? I...like her. Very heavily. And although it's hard to tell how old a Lunarian is, I've overheard that her birthday was soon. So I made it for her. And when I saw you had almost eaten it, I was furious! But I didn't have much right to be...I know you, so I should have expected this.</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cpred\">Oh, Youmu, I didn't know you liked someone! This news...makes be even more upset!</span>\" Almost crying again, Youmu acted quick before her Lady could. \"<span class=\"cteal\">No! No no no no! Yuyuko-sama, You shouldn't be upset! </span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">W-why?</span>\" \"<span class=\"cteal\">Because I can always make another one.</span>\" Yuyuko's face beamed with a happiness brighter than an Spell Card she had. \"<span class=\"cpred\">YOU CAN?! </span>\", she shouted in excitement, resulting in Youmu being gifted with another soft, warm hug, once again getting a face full of bulbous breast flesh, this time with full nipple. Her face as red as a ripe radish, Youmu pleaded to be let go, \"<span class=\"cteal\">Yuyuko-sama...please...no more hugs...ehehe...</span>\" This embrace lasting longer than the last, Yuyuko finally releases her retainer. '<span class=\"cteal\">Thank you...again, Yuyuko-sama.</span>\", Youmu said catching her break once more. \"<span class=\"cpred\">Oh, you are very welcome, my sweet Youmu!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuyuko's face was still beaming, but her happiness was soon replaced with curiosity, staring once more at the fateful Chocolate Cake. Turning back to Youmu, she ask, \"<span class=\"cpred\">Youmu?</span>\" \"<span class=\"cteal\">Yes?</span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">I have only now noticed...before you returned, I had managed to slice into the chocolate cake. It's a very deep cut, actually...</span>\" Joining her Lady at the plate, Youmu bend her head down to get a closer look. \"<span class=\"cteal\">Ooooh...yes, that is a deep cut, I can't give it to Reisen like this...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">Oops...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cteal\">It's fine, Yuyuko-sama. Like I said, I can easily make another one. For now...I'll let you eat this one, just like you wanted to.</span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">REALLY?! Oh thank y-oh wait...</span>\" \"<span class=\"cteal\">Huh? W-what is it?</span>\" Youmu was slightly taken aback by the fact that her Lady was hesitating to eat something...that only happened when something was seriously wrong. \"<span class=\"cpred\">Weeeell, after all the trouble I have caused with this cake, I'd feel horrible if I only ate it by myself...Let's share it, Youmu!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cteal\">Yuyuko-sama?!</span>\" Her Lady...sharing food?! Something was most definitely wrong! \"<span class=\"cteal\">Are you sure?</span>\" \"<span class=\"cpred\">I am positive! Besides, you'll never impress your little crush with that skinny frame, so you <b>need</b> some cake in you! So come, let's eat it together!</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYoumu didn't know what to say...her lady had a point, she had always been very small, in her height and her...assets. But she also knew that her Lady would not be satisfied with just 1 cake. She knew that if she joined her in this meal, she would be dragged along and forced to eat with Yuyuko for the rest of the ensuing binge across the land she takes every month. She hadn't taken one this month and she was overdue...What was Youmu going to say to Yuyuko's offer?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the ghost princess realized there was one place she forgot searching Youmu in: Youmu's bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Youmu's probably oversleeping as much as I was doing,\" Yuyuko thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuyuko then went to outside Youmu's bedroom, thinking about the possibilities.  If Youmu was truly snoozing off in her bedroom, then Yuyuko had the chance to spook Youmu awake and chastise her for oversleeping.  Although Yuyuko got a more than a healthy amount of beauty sleep from not being awoken, it is not good practice for a servant like Youmu to not work for the well-being of her master.  Yuyuko also thought about chastising Youmu for making her superior think she was truly alone to do whatever she wants for the heck of it.  If Youmu was not inside, then that means Yuyuko could freely dig around Youmu's stuff for any deep, dark secrets!  There was no downside to barging into Youmu's room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a biotech of thinking, Yuyuko decided to enter Youmu's bedroom.  Yuyuko entered the room by phasing through the door (since she was a ghost) and looked around the bedroom.  Youmu's bedroom was small and plain compared to Yuyuko's wealthy bedroom.  Yuyuko spotted Youmu's bed, and she floated next to it.  However, Yuyuko saw that:</span></div></div>",

A silver haired young woman with braided hair and a blue maid's outfit set down a large plate of flan on the floor, with a spoon sitting atop it. She, Sakuya, looked up and ahead at a chubby young woman who looked about her age as she slowly walked forward, smiling. Flandre, having spent a majority of her life in the Scarlet Manor basement, didn't get much chance for exercise. She saw visitors once in a while, but her sister Remilia didn't allow her to play with them much for fear she would \"break\" them. As such, Flandre had started to put on weight recently, growing rather chubby. A small, bulging potbelly was visible under her crimson dress as well as thick chubby legs and thighs with a round bottom that seemed to jiggle a bit whenever she ran. She also seemed to have sizable, full looking and round breasts, likely a result of the fat accumulating there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Flandre paid little mind to such a thing. Her innocent mind was, if only for the moment, joyous in looking forward to more flan for the day. Sakuya had requested Remilia limit Flandre's flan intake per day, but Flandre's begging expression as she overheard this was too much for Remilia to bear. She dearly loved her sister and felt some guilt in keeping her locked away to prevent her from causing too much damage, perhaps even to herself, so it was hard for her to be too tough on her dear, sweet sister especially with how genuinely kind she was. This was, in a way, even worse considering this could be attributed to Flandre's childish personality, due to lack of mental development from being locked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlandre hummed to herself as she cooed, eating more and more flan off her plate with an innocent smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya smiled in a mix of happiness for seeing Flandre enjoying herself and pity for being born to such a fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlandre noticed a look in Sakuya's eyes, tilting her head in curiosity and looking staring at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong, Sakuya-san?\" Flandre asked curiously, her eyes reflecting her childish innocence in her persona and tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing. Just thinking.\" Sakyua said calmly as she shook her head with a smile. \"Is there anything else you need, Imouto-sama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...maybe some milk if we have some. Oh! And could you see if Patchy-san has books I could borrow, like that one from last week?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuya smiled and nodded, holding her hands and arms in front of herself in a courteous manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I'll bring what you asked for later.\" She said calmly, before turning to leave. However, she was so preoccupied in her thoughts that Sakuya had not closed the door all the way. Flandre enjoyed the rest of her flan, singing aloud to herself about how yummy it was, when she saw the door wasn't locked and fully closed. She paused, thinking once more. She could go out of her room, see what everyone else is doing. True, she was aloud outside to walk freely in the Scalet Manor often, but the basement served as her main room for the time. She thought of leaving the room, maybe see her sister Remilia. ...Or maybe see if she could get her hands on some more flan!</span></div></div>",

The short blonde-haired, red-eyed youkai had a somewhat petite figure similar to that of a 10-year-old girl, and she wore a black vest and skirt snd a white blouse with a red tie around her neck.  She also wore a red amulet in her hair like a ribbon, and she couldn't remove said amulet as it was sealing a greater power from her, according to the rumors from some people.  As a youkai of darkness, Rumia has a perpetual sphere of darkness surrounding her body, and although Rumia can control and manipulate the darkness around her, said veil of darkness causes her to fly around aimlessly and bump into obstacles due tithe darkness obstructing her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumia lives a simple life of a youkai, preying on humans to kill and devour.  Although humans native to Gensokyo are off limits to be eaten by youkai, humans from the Outside World who wandered or were \"gapped\" into Gensokyo are fair game.  Rumia was a voracious youkai, and there is nothing tastier to Rumia than the flesh of a human.  Outsider humans were especially tasty to Rumia, and Rumia could tell whether an Outsider human was nearby through their scent.  Lately, more Outsider humans have appeared in the forests of Gensokyo, and very few were able to escape being eaten by youkai.  Very peculiar was that some of the Outsiders were tied up and wearing nothing but a fundoshi and a sack with the kanji symbol for 'sin' over their heads.  Probably they were criminals and their punishment was to be hunted by youkai?  At least Rumia found those types of Outsiders, dubbed 'Sinsacks', much easier to hunt down; Rumia was getting lazier with her hunting and found it generally a pain to do, especially when chasing humans had gotten her running into more trees than humans.  Rumia's lifestyle of hunting and eating humans was catching up to her, though, as Rumia was developing a slight pudge on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rumia is not hunting humans, she is seen hanging out with her fellow youkai friends.  They include Cirno, the ice fairy who lives at the nearby Misty Lake; Mystia Lorelei, the night sparrow youkai who can sing and owns a grilled lamprey stand; and Wriggle Nightbug, the firefly youkai who can control bugs.  Rumia were great friends with them, but for some reason she couldn't help but think about having her friends inside her, whatever that means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Rumia was flying in her forest searching for humans to prey on.

Shortly after, the leader of the Temple and the Buddhists that inhabited it, the Magician Byakuren Hijiri awakens, ready to brew tea and wake the rest of her disciples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first needing to woken up was the temple's \"captain\", Minamitsu Murasa. Byakuren \"nudged\" the ghostly captain awake and by nudge, I mean Byakuren shoved her foot against Murasa too hard, sliding her still sleeping body halfway across the brine soaked wooden floor, crashing into the wall. Despite being her leader, Byakuren could not help but profusely apologize.  As always, Byakuren didn't bother going into Shou's room, one because even she didn't like to wake the tiger youkai and two, because she knew Shou's servant and overall caretaker Nazrin would wake her anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext came Nue, the...Nue, who was still sleeping on a cloud, her bed somehow avoiding clearance by Ichirin &amp; Unzan earlier, likely by making the cloud unidentifiable. She could not, however, avoid the small furry alarm clock that was Kyoukou Kasodani, who on Byakuren's request, shouted towards the sky, knocking Nue off her cloud bed and plummeting onto the temple grounds. Unintentionally, Kyoukou's screech also knocks the mischievous Kogasa Tatara off the cloud...Kogasa, while not a permanent Resident at the Temple, visited often, mostly to get cheap scares out of other visitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least, there was the venerated Bandanuki Mamizou Futatsuiwa, who has been awake long since the sun set yesterday. She watches all the typical morning commotion and goings on of the Temple from atop a nearby hillside, drinking the finest of Sake from her gourd. Because while she wasn't officially allied with the Myouren Temple, she still cared for those residing there, knowing that its grounds were always a safe haven for wayward Youkai still adjusting to life in Gensokyo, which there was never a short supply of. She also drank on the hillside out of respect for Byakuren as a friend, knowing that drinking the large container of alcohol while Byakuren was attempting to teach Buddhist values would make her uncomfortable, as strict Buddhism forbade drinking. Not that Mamizou was complaining, because as all Tanuki do, young or old, day or night, she loved a good drink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was due to her advanced age or her drinking habits, no one could deny that in her undisguised form, Mamizou Futatsuiwa was a fairly <i>mature</i> woman. While her face was still thin, her breasts were practically the size of cantaloupes, always threatening to slip out of the confines of her beige cotton shirt. Not that such an occurrence would embarrass Mamizou...Tanuki do not <i>get</i> embarrassed. In fact, she was quite proud of her large chest, because to female Tanuki an especially large chest was a sign of great power and wisdom, just as testicles were to Male Tanuki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing further down, Mamizou's arms were still in decent form, a minor layer of plush surrounding them. Her belly, however, was adding just the right amount of curvature to her midsection, her large chest riding her shirt up, allowing her stomach to be shown to the world. Further south still, her hips were wide and alive, rhythmically moving side to side anywhere she walked...which is why, when she was out of a disguise, Mamizou fly most of the time. And although you could hardly ever see them, as they were typically crossed against one another and resting on a flat surface, the Tanuki's thighs and buttocks were just as plump and magnificent as everywhere else. Yes, Mamizou was quite...the <i>mature women</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMature in both body and mind, as even in times of crisis and confusion, like the Incidents she's been involved in. Mamizou always kept a calm mind about things, typically cleaning up after everyone else's attempts to solve things, often made them worse. Yes, Mamizou was a voice of reason in Gensokyo, especially to the Idiot Shrine Maiden. But even with all of her years of wisdom, Mamizou could never keep a cool head when she ran <b>out</b> of alcohol...which was about to happen in 3...2...1!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a sip from her gourd, Mamizou was expecting more delicious sake to pour into her mouth as it had always done...but she felt a lone drop hit her tongue. Opening her eyes, she peered into the spout of the gourd, finding only darkness...and another drop, which promptly landed on the lens of her spectacles. Wiping the lens and shaking her head, Mamizou got herself together. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Okey then...so I'm outta drink. That's fine, no really...it's fine. Been through a dry spell a'for, nothin I can do...</span>\", Mamizou thought...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">THIS IS NOT FINE!</span>, she shouted into the sky. While no where near the volume of a normal vocalization from Kyoukou, the outburst was still enough scare the birds surrounding the Temple and draw the attention of those in the Temple Courtyard. Ichirin, Kyoukou, Shou, Nazrin, along with many other minor residents, turned their heads towards the source of the yell as it disturbed the silence of their daily sweeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Arrgh, for all the...blasted fish in the waves! Arrrrrgh!</span>\", Mamizou continued the shout. \"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright, alright. So, this is the first time I've run outta of drink since moving to the this wacky realm...Alright, think ol' girl, THINK. Where can I...acquire a large amount of drink?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew her way around Gensokyo, having been all over, in and out of disguise. But with all her wisdom, she'd never been faced with this situation before...she didn't know where to get booze. Then it hit her...As much as they didn't like each other's company, Mamizou knew there was one person who knew where to find things anywhere in the realm. The Idiot Shrine Maiden, Reimu Hakurei. In a frantic tizzy, Mamizou flew into the sky, the Residents were still looking in her direction. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Where's Mamizou-sama off to in such a hurry?</span>\", asked Shou. \"<span class=\"clgrey\">Beats me. Doesn't matter, back to sweeping. You want Hijiri-sama to catch you slacking...again?</span>\", retorted Nazrin. \"<span class=\"cbyellow\">Nooooooo...</span>\", pouted Shou, resuming her duties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching the Hakurei Shrine, Mamizou landed on its steps. Walking up the steps, there was no one in the courtyard and the donation box lies empty..as always. A sad display, it was. Knocking on tatami door, it didn't open right away, though Mamizou did here the tiny voice of the Inchling Princess Sukuna shouting into the room. \"<span class=\"cmagenta\">Reimuuuu! Someone's at the doooo~r!</span>\" Beyond the door, she heard a faint response from the Shrine Maiden. \"<span class=\"clred\">Ughh...what the fuck? Who knocks on the door at 9 in the morning?</span>\" She wasn't even up yet? Pathetic. But Mamizou had to withhold judgement this time if she wanted Reimu to tell her where to snag some booze. Sliding the door open, Reimu seeing Mamizou standing in the doorway, smiling brightly. \"<span class=\"clred\">Wha-God damn it. As if Yukari bothering me every other day wasn't enough, no I got you...what am I, a hag magnet? Ugh, what do you want?</span>\" \"<span class=\"ctan\">Hehe..mornin' to you too, Hakurei. So...I'm just gonna get to the point. I am in a bit of a pickle. And I know yeh aren't fond o' me, but iffen me get out outta this pickle, I'll....<i>owe...you...one.</i></span>\" Mamizou had to grit her teeth for that last part. She never liked being indebted to anyone, no Tanuki did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu let out a tired, shaky laugh. \"<span class=\"clred\">Ehe..ehehe...heeeee! You?! You need help? You, the wise confident old Bandanuki needs help from me? Eheeeehehe!<br>\r\n Oh, how the shoe had turned!</span>\" Mamizou was becoming frustrated now...She took her gourd off her belt and held it down, demonstrating its emptiness. This got Reimu to stop laughing for a moment...\"<span class=\"ctan\">Alright look...normally, I would never ask for yer help. I don't like you and you don't like me...but ya see this? I'm dry...and this is the 1st time that I've ran dry since I got to this place. I don't know where to get any more and I figured you do. So spit it out! Where do I get more?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that point, the details of where Mamizou went next that day are fuzzy. She remembers someone giving her an inkling or a lead. It went something like...</span></div></div>",

An unamused expression formed on her young face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">You know what, Futatsuiwa? Please. Go to hell. They have Sake there...</span>\" Reimu at last answered, haggard disdain for the present company in her voice. She with motioned to close the Front door, but Mamizou's hand interjects before it is done<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Ay! Hold on half a moment now!</span>\" the older women objects, opening the door back up, giving Reimu a frustrated and bewildered look<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">What do ye mean 'Go to Hell'...which Hell?! Yer not...are ye pullin' a jape on me right now? Cause I cannae say I'm in the mood for a jape at the moment, you little taffer!</span>\" Mamizou makes her frustration well known, crossing her arms under her substantial chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu only yawns in response to the short lecture, rolling her eyes and sighing \"<span class=\"clred\">Alright listen...near the Shrine, fly along the valley side and you'll find some natural hot springs. Further in and you'll see a massive hole in the ground. Fall down that hole, make your way through the tunnels as you watch out for youkai in buckets and you'll end up in Former Hell</span>\" Reimu explained tersly, rubbing her eyes. Mamizou raises an eyebrow in suspicious, but continues listening<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">That's all you really need to know. Try not to die with whatever you're doing, I've already forget...Good luck, Ball Hag</span>\" Reimu rudely says, before slamming the tatami door shut a final time<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamizou stares at the door for a moments, digesting what she was told before turning around. She uncrosses her arms as she makes her way from the Shrine, adjusting her glasses in a huff<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Well now! That's just choice, innit? The lass tells me where to go, how to get there, what I'm lookin' fer and she don't even tell which direction to go! Of all the ungrateful..</span>\" Mamizou complains as she walks along the path to shrine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway from where she landed, the wind begins to pick up, blowing her loose fitting cloth shirt up a bit. Mamizou holds onto her leaf hat, enduring the sudden gusts and gales. Eyeing the sky, she soon spots the source of the abrupt weather approaching her. A certain Tengu, smug face and camera in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bird youkai makes the stop in front of Mamizou on a dime, lowering herself down to the Ban-Tanuki's level. She spoke up first<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">So...Futatsuiwa-san. Word on the winds is that you need a guide? Making your way to Former Hell on a booze run eh?</span>\" The Tengu brightly asked, oddly familiar with her predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Mamizou wasn't privy to Tengu asking her questions, but this one looked familiar...<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">And who exactly are ye to know all this not an hour into my misadventure? Mmm...hang on</span>\" she adjusts her spectacles, having had them jostled in the strong gales<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Ah! You're that Shamimura lass, the one who was a right pain in my tuckus when I was gettin my claws in Kosuzu, the sweet little thing. Why you reckon to help me out now?</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Slow News Day</span>\" The reporter Tengu replied bluntly with a shrug and smile<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Hmm...fair dues. Well, I haven't a reason to hang about this side of the realm much so I suppose you'll lead the way to the hole then, eh?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cred\">Yes indeed! Right this way, my Bandanuki Elder!</span>\" Aya chirped with a bow before turning in flight, due west\"<br>\r\nMamizou didn't trust Aya as far as she could throw her...but she needed a guide around this section of Gensoukyou. She simply gritted her teeth and hoped this lass didn't pull and funny business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the long journey for even a drop of booze, Mamizou zoned out again and when next she came to....</span></div></div>",

With perked ears, the two turn and look to the source of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the back yard, stumbling, mumbling and always ever bumbling, came running the little Oni Suika in their direction.<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cindigo\">HEEEEEEEEEY~</span>\" Mamizou, seeming to have garnered the attention of the little drunkard with her inquires on alcohol, was the one the Suika was now in a dead long sprint towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Eh? Who's that there, Hakurei{?/c}\" Mamizou squinted, not recognizing the figure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReimu, recognizing the danger of a high speed Suika, made the split second decision to tackle Mamizou to the ground, allowing Suiki to ram head first the wall, back to unconsciousness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on the cobblestone path, having avoided the danger, Reimu finds that in tackling Mamizou, her hands are places squarly on the Tanuki's ripe plush breasts, one hand even making its way <i>under her cloth shirt</i>, meeting warm flesh. \"<span class=\"clred\">Ehh!</span>\" the shrine maiden yells as she takes her hands off the other woman's pillows, her cheeks flushing as red as her outfit. Mamizou, thankful for the save but amused at the shrine maiden's gaff, teases her as they both stand up<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">My my, Hakurei. And here I thought y'only had eyes for that magician girl yer always hanging about with. But, I suppose you are gettin' to be that age...</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"clred\">I....uh.

She's not normally that much a hellion is she?</span>\" Reimu shakes her head \"<span class=\"clred\">Nooo, just the normal oni fair from her until recently. Last Sestubun, Sakuya shared some of this 'Red Wine' stuff and since then Suika can't get enough of the stuff. It really gives her a different kind of drunk than Sake does. Though it takes more of it to get her blitz...but with her bottomless gourd and all...</span>\" <br>\r\nReimu trails off and the two look back at the unconscious little Oni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMamizou's eyebrows raise a little as the position Suika had landed on the wall was exposing her stomach, which lay out wide and soft against her lap. Her short legs were encased in plush fat and, as miraculous as it seemed, average sized breasts had been developed on Suika's chest. All from the result mass consumption of this 'Red Wine' type of booze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Goodness gracious...Red Wine ye say? Who was it that gave it to the short lass o'yers?</span>\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, Sakuya. The Maid over at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, just north of the Human Village. There's a big-ass lake right before it so you can't really miss it.\"<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"ctan\">Scarlet Devils, eh? Noted\"</span> Mamizou said with smile. She nodded to Reimu, thanking her for the information and the save and made her way to the Misty Lake and towards the SDM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than a few tripe fairies and a mermaid who was rather persistent to have a meaningful conversation, the Lake proved an easy fly over<br>\r\nNow at the large ornate metal gates to this mansion, however, Mamizou stood in front of a more formidable foe. A statuesque women, clad in green with fiery red hair. Gown adorned with Chinese characters, an intensely muscular build, legs that went on forever and chi signature that indicated to Mamizou that the women was in actuality a rare Half-Dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch an interesting obstacle Mamizou found herself before...it was a shame that this unique obstacle was stood up straight, dead asleep. Her position in front of the gate spelled that she was a guard for would be intruders. Like Mamizou might be considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old gal thought to herself...should she play this smart and just fly up and past this scaly stunner or should she take the time to make some mischief? A sleeping target almost seemed too easy... </span></span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>General Overview</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouhou (or Touhou Project) is a series of top down shooters that takes place in the supernatural realm of \"Gensokyo\". There is usually no connecting plot between games and, usually, the most that's involved in every game is that various 'incidents' occur across Gensokyo and it's up to the shrine maiden, Reimu Hakurei (and her witch friend, Marisa Kirisame) to investigate and solve these incidents, all the while battling various youkai and beings with their magic and danmaku abilities. Basically, this interactive takes the usual formula of Touhou and throws in the elements of expansion to the mix. Storylines can focus on single characters or an entire group, if desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor information regarding the series and it's concepts  -&gt; <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Canon Characters</b><br>\r\n-Because Touhou Project has a vast amount of characters that I know can't be fully listed here without making this boring, please refer to the link below to get a good understanding of the canon characters and who they are. Not all of them will appear in the story, but feel free to add more Touhou characters to the story as you see fit. It makes things alot more interesting if you manage to pull in more characters into the situation~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink to canon character list: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Category:Characters\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Category:Characters</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n+Fetishes that can appear during this story...+<br>\r\n- Stuffing/Weight Gain<br>\r\n- Pregnancy/Unbirth<br>\r\n- Vore<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStandard rules apply...<br>\r\n- Only female characters are to expand. Although this doesn't exclude male characters from appearing at all in the interactive.<br>\r\n- Please put forth effort in your chapters.<br>\r\n- Nothing completely outlandish in regards of expansion.<br>\r\n- Let's try to avoid the overly gross situations such as toilet stuff and the like. Burps are fine (farts too, if you play it for comedy), but nothing past that please.<br>\r\n- This is an 18+ interactive so sexual situations are allowed, just...try not to go overboard with them. Use in moderation, basically and try not to have the story revolve too much around it and build up to the sexual things.</td>",
