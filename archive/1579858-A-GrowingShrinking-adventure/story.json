A device that can alter the size of living or inanimate mater at the push of a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe the sweet from you brow, and think \"That should do it.\" as you lean back and rub your sleepy eyes, then admire your work. It looks like a 3 inch long, black, Laser-pointer with three buttons on it. One button is an arrow pointing up toward the end, another is an arrow pointing back at you, and there's a round button in between them. It's obvious witch button dose what. Up to grow, down to shrink, and the center button changes the settings from living to Inanimate mater, and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick it up from the lab table, and decide... </span></div></div>",

You suspect that he has a crush on you, and your not sure if it's low self esteem or a fetish, but he's always staring at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly on the other hand is a 20 year old African American female with an Athletic build standing 5.11. She is the meaning of the words OVER ACHIEVER and unsurprisingly, your best student. <br>\r\n4.0 GPA, always the one asking the most astute questions, pushing herself to be the best, and diving on any and all extra credit assignments, and somehow still finds the time to be on the school track-team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know if you offered her a chance at being a part of this she would only ask \"When do we start?\", but you also know shes super competitive, and kind of a selfish bitch. She has the brains, the brawn, and the attitude to go far in life, but with her \"In your face, I'm the best\" personality you can't help but wonder if you could trust her to fallow instructions, keep this all a secret, or even trust yourself not to step on her mouthy, smug ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough no one says you have to only call one. together Scott's easy going attitude, and people skills, and Kelly's strong mind, and drive for success could make them into the perfect team...</span></div></div>",

You can easily see that the boy has short brown hair, a slim, yet muscular body, lightly tanned skin, and brown eyes. You take a quick glance at his crotch and lick your lips. You can see that this boy is well hung, and as he turns around, you can see that he has a nice ass too. You then turn your attentions toward the girl.

What are your names, and ages? Are your parents with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boy tells you that his name is Justin Wilson, and he is 18. The girl tells you that her name is Kara Wilson, and she is 17. They then inform you that they are selling candy for their school. They also tell you that their parents are at work. You then invite them both inside and ask them to wait in the living room while you get some money. While they wait, you zap them with your new device, and quickly shrink them both down. You then look down and see two piles of clothes lying on the floor. You also see movement underneath the clothes, as well as tiny; almost mouse like voices coming from underneath the clothes. You then kneel down, reach into their clothes, and quickly remove the tiny, nearly unconscious siblings. As they both look around in shock, you grab an empty brown bag near by, and place the two naked siblings into it for safekeeping, not bothering to inspect them, at least for now. You then point your new device at their now empty clothes, and atomize them. However, you have decided to keep the candy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then take the brown bag where?  </span></div></div>",

You British women are all alike, so uptight. You think I didn't see the way you eyed me up when I entered? The way you wrinkled your nose, before responding too me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts walking over to you as you tell him \u201cOh, you're judging me now? If you really want to argue then how about the fact that you couldn't even collect the reports from my students yesterday. I guess the only thing you were concerned about was getting through the day and getting too the pub. am i right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any kind of warning he grabs you by the face pinching your jaw open by pressing his fingers in your cheeks. \u201cLook here you little bitch, I... \u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott stands up, and Interrupts him \u201cL, L, Leave her alone!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns his head too Scott \u201cOr what? you gonna St'St'Stop me P'Porky?\u201d He starts laughing again, you use this distraction to your advantage and knee him in the crotch as hard as you can,he screams and pushes you by your face and you slide across the polished floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brian set on his knees holding his groin Yelling, and cursing \u201dYOU FUCKING BITCH! I\u201dM GOING TO KILL YOU! YOU FUCKING BITCH!!\u201d You Shout too Scott \u201cRUN, GO GET CAMPUS SECURITY!\" and he takes off out the door, you get too your feet although your balance is a little off cause you only have one shoe on and you twisted your ankle on the fall, you limp back from Brian, and pull out the only weapon you have, The Shrinking device.<br>\r\nYou Shout at him. \u201cSTAY BACK!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stands back up slowly still clinging too his balls. \u201cYou fucked up you stupid half wet-back limey cunt. All I wanted was to get my bowl back, then I could have gone home and got high and none of this shit would have happened, but you couldn't just be nice could you. Nooo You had to be the British bitch queen, so now I'm gonna have to teach YOU a lesson.\u201d and he starts coming at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is your last warning I said stay back!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts laughing \u201cOr what? your gonna burn my retna?\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story was originally a section of \"The growing/Shrinking Terror\", but I wanted to prune that story to direct ist shape a little better, though I couldn't bring myself too delete this part...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI read threw it, and thought \"This could probably make a good stand alone title, and its a great way to explain where the shrinking device I use in all my other stories comes from..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, you play the role of Dr. Katherine M. Anderson, you are a 34 year old, single, white, British Woman. Despite having been born and raised in london you ended up looking mostly like your mother whom your father met while on working in Mexico. You have tan skin, long brown hair, and big dark brown eyes, and you stand at about 5.9<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou work at an American college as a professor in Mechanical Engineering. despite using your Doctorate in Mechanical Engineering to teach, you were somewhat of a child prodigy growing up, so you were able to finish high school early and over a long path as a student you now hold varying levels of education in Human Biology, Microbiology, and Medicine from this same university. the only real reason you even have a job here is because the you were offered a job here about 7 years ago and your parents encouraged you to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n:THE RULES:<br>\r\nAs you can imagine, a device that can control the size of living/nonliving mater leaves for many interesting probabilities, so here's my simple rules...<br>\r\nRules updated on 1/24/2015<br>\r\nafter a few years I've decided that there are a few alterations that need to be made to the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Clothing doesn't grow or shrink with the target because Living mater and nonliving mater are two separate settings on the device so its impossible to alter the size of both the subject and his/her clothing in one shot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Death is ok... But when/if Miss Anderson dies its the end of that story \"NO CHANGE OVERS!!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n3. No transformation stuff. If you want to turn people into rats, snakes, and spiders, then you'll have to look elsewhere.<br>\r\nThis rule also applies to changing a person's age and/or a person's gender.<br>\r\nSorry, but this is strictly a Size Story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Please add good/well written chapters. I'm not trying to be a dick or pick on anyone here, but I'm tired of having to sift through shit in my own stories, so I'm going through and Editing or Deleting the bad chapters<br>\r\nDon't think I'm unfair, I don't mind minor spelling and grammar errors, but If you couldn't be bothered with READING the last couple chapters enough to keep from changing a characters name or screwing up the continuity of the story, then I WILL delete your fucking chapter.<br>\r\nthe same goes for broken English. I get that there's a lot of people here that aren't from an English speaking country, and I'm more than happy to have you read and add to my stories, BUT if your chapters are barely readable I will delete them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Anything else really goes though, I'm not picky. <br>\r\nGay, straight, toilet stuff, hard vore, feet crush, and anything else that gets you going is all good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Lastly and Most importantly. HAVE FUN. Don't be at all shy about posting......</td>",
