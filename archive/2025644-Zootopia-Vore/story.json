So, he'd held her close, and kept kissing her. Of course, it seemed that Judy wasn't the innocent farmer's daughter she made herself out to be, especially when she placed her hand between their legs, and gave his maleness a teasing squeeze, among other things. He had grinned at that, especially when she admitted to having done the odd buck herself, although they'd always wore a condom, so that she didn't get pregnant, especially since there was always that chance that they might be related.... but enough about that sort of thing - she'd enjoyed herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Nick's maleness reduced, and he was able to slip out of her. \"Well, that was nice,\" he said, as he got off of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice?\" Judy asked. \"I think you enjoyed it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled. \"Yeah, I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time though, let's get some lubricant,\" said Judy. \"You were a little bigger than what I thought you'd be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick smiled. \"I told you.

They close their mouths around predators, but they might open them up around prey-types.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any locations?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big nodded. \"Koslov, hand them the other list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear placed another sheet of paper on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick looked at the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're very generous,\" said Judy. \"Something tells me that you want something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing major, but I would appreciate it if your undercover officers were smart enough to, shall we say, look the other way when they look for these people at the places I own,\" said Mr. Big. \"It would be stupid if they outed themselves as police, unless they decided to go undercover as a corrupt officer, if you get my drift.

And I can see a few <i>business</i> possibilities. Let me know if it works. Might be a good way to make money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might be useful for other things as well,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big grinned. \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned right back. \"I'm sure you don't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later, Nick.\" The polar bear and the shrew left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick started to chuckle as Judy came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" the rabbit asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I told him about the pill,\" the fox said. \"I can think of a few possibilities he might use it for, both legal and otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can think of a few people he might try them on,\" said Judy. \"Especially a certain weasel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chief Bogo got the info?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and we can leave now,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Nick. \"Got another recommendation for that pharmacy; seems Mr. Big likes to go there at times.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled. \"We might have to check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, we could just go to your place, and test out that pill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, we could go to this restaurant that's open for nocturnal types,\" Judy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be nice.\"</span></div></div>",

See you later, Duke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Duke said, as the fox and rabbit started to walk away. \"You take care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at their car, the pair looked at each other, and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did say that <i>we</i> won't arrest him,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, and <i>we</i> won't,\" Nick said as he picked up the CB. \"Dispatch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" said Clawhouser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weasel suspect is Duke Weaselton, and might be in violation of his parole,\" said Nick. \"Suspect was selling movies, possibly counterfeits, and might be moving locations. Backup is requested to arrive silently, and can take credit for the collar if they catch him in the act. That being said, he was nice enough to offer us some information about some illegal Night Howler purchases, so I suggest that the officers take it easy on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night Howlers?\" Clawhouser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, buyer is a rabbit named John Lapin, staying at the King's Hotel,  and is said to be highly wealthy,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Clawhouser. \"I'll let Chief Bogo know, and we'll send out a couple of units, one to pick up Duke, and one to check out King's Hotel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a big 10-4,\" said Nick as he hung the CB up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy rolled her eyes. \"Stick to the correct lingo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled. \"You know you love me.\"</span></div></div>",

Judy was eating a fruit and vegetable salad, while Nick was also eating a Fish and Insect Bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This sure is a nice place,\" said Judy. \"I'm glad you suggested it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" said Nick. \"My mom liked to take me here. It was one of the few places we could go for free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had a rough childhood,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't easy, I'll tell you that,\" said Nick. \"People didn't trust foxes. It's not really a surprise that I did what I did to put food on the table for me and my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many foxes do you know happen to be in that situation?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty, and not just foxes,\" said Nick. \"Duke, for instance, would have been an okay person, if he'd been given a chance to do what he really wants to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would that be?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I might be wrong, and he might have been lying to me, but one time we were talking, just conversationally mind you, and he mentioned that he always wanted to be a game show host, or something,\" said Nick. \"Of course, he was looking at a really big and expensive television, so I'm not sure if that was just idle talk, or if I had prevented him from stealing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Judy. She then looked at Nick. \"About last night, um, well, I want to talk about my behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about it?\" Nick asked. \"You gave me permission. You never said 'No', or 'Stop'. Believe me, I wouldn't have done it if you told me to stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, part of the reason I went through with it was because I didn't want to hurt your feelings, and because I didn't want to worry you,\" said Judy. \"Also, there was that chance, and I wanted you to have a good memory of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Nick smiled. \"Tell me, would you mind doing it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled. \"Well, now that we have the stuff, I wouldn't mind doing it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got any more of those pills?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grinned. \"I'll have to talk to Chief Bogo about those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick gave her a kiss. \"Too bad we're on duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled. \"I know. Perhaps later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, later,\" said Nick. He took another bite of his meal. \"You know, there is a spot that's a little hard to get to, for most cops. Teenagers like to go there, because it's very private.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grinned. \"How private?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is cellphone reception, but most people don't bother going there, given what they themselves did there at that age,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, besides teenagers trying to get lucky, who else uses it?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, given the location, I have occasionally seen signs of drug use up there,\" said Nick. \"I don't know if any deals are going on, or if they are just using them, but it does sort of ruin the experience when you find someone that got high instead of getting lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Judy. She finished her meal. \"Perhaps we should check it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Nick, finishing the last bite of his bar. \"Best let Dispatch know we're checking it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy grinned. \"To be honest, I hope no one is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" said Nick. \"I'd hate for someone to steal our clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy chuckled. \"Dispatch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" said Clawhouser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me and Nick are going to check out a spot at the park, which has a history of being a spot for Teens engaging in sexual activity, as well as drug usage,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Clawhouser. \"The Chief has been wanting to get some people to check that spot out anyways. That being said, if it's just teenagers getting lucky, mind taking it easy on them. Just let them know that we'll be keeping an eye on the spot for a while. Of course, if something else is going on, be sure to contact us before moving in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do,\" said Judy. She looked at Nick, and grinned. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the pair had walked, and climbed, to a location near the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bit of a tricky hike,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's why most cops don't bother coming up here,\" said Nick. \"They don't want to use that shortcut between those crevices in those rocks. By the time they get here the long way, the people have heard them, and left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know about it?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned. \"Nothing illegal, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's be quiet,\" said Nick. \"Got a few more minutes before we get there.\"</span></div></div>",

Secondary path is that way, and not as well used, but is safe enough to use as an escape route, and has a few spots for lookouts. Then there's the path we came up through, no lookout spots, but most cops are too big to use it, like I told you, although that doesn't mean that smaller teenagers can't use it themselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about drug dealers?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never saw any while I did my hustles here,\" said Nick. \"I would have told Mr. Big about those guys.

Mind telling me what it was, exactly? I know that someone is targeting you, but I wouldn't mind knowing the details.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked at Judy, before looking back at Mr. Big. \"A fox and a rabbit were dressed up like us, murdered, and then dismembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big had an impassive look on his face. \"Were they a couple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not sure,\" said Judy. \"They could have been strangers for all we know, but they looked enough like us that the killer dressed them up as us. It was not pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Mr. Big. \"I'll ask around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to ask around about Night Howlers, and see who's buying them,\" said Nick. \"We know of a rabbit that's doing that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big nodded. \"That won't be a problem. For all you know, this could be connected to the plot to free Bellweather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy looked at each other. \"Something to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, anything about those pills I need to know?\" Mr. Big asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Nick. \"The size between predator and prey can affect just how tired the predator is after the prey gets out. Between me and Judy, I didn't have the energy to do much beyond sitting up. But, between the size of, let's say you and let's say Koslov, there shouldn't be much difference in energy drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big looked up at his bodyguard. \"Useful to know, if I have an unruly guest.\" He looked back at the pair. \"Like I said, enjoy your room, and call if you need anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the pair were at their room. The scale of the place had polar bears in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nice,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's bigger than your apartment room, that's for sure,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about the size,\" said Mr. Big. \"We don't often get overnight guests that are your size, and I know you're too big for a room my size. Something to think about in the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it would be,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, you have your own shower and toilet,\" said Mr. Big. \"You have a mini-fridge/freezer, and a few other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one bed though,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're adults,\" said Mr. Big. \"I'm sure you know enough to share.

That being said, you'll find some in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something to think about,\" said Nick. \"Thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later,\" said Mr. Big, as he and Koslov left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned and said...</span></div></div>",

Look out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned, and was confronted by the sight of Bellweather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear always works,\" the sheep said, as she aimed her weapon at him. \"Bye-bye, fox.\" She pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick tried to move when he felt a jolt of pain that forced his eyes to open, alongside of an ear-splitting scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick blinked, as he looked up at a polar bear. \"Kevin? Mind letting go of my ear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked over at Judy, and saw that she too was rubbing one of her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounded to me like you were having some sort of shared nightmare sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looked, and saw that Mr. Big was there with Koslov. He looked over at Judy, and saw that she was looking at him. \"Did you have one too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed a hold of him. \"Oh Nick.\" She started to cry in his chest. Nick held onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's our cue to leave,\" said Mr. Big. \"Kevin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin left the room, and the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was horrible,\" said Judy. \"I was being chased. I saw your body, and then it just got worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was just a dream,\" said Nick, as he kept a hold of Judy. \"That's all that matters. You're here, I'm here, and Bellweather is in prison where she belongs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked at him. \"She was in your dream too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick closed his eyes, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think she's behind the murder of those two innocent mammals?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she is, she'll pay for it, as will those who follow her,\" said Nick. \"And if it wasn't her, we'll get whomever it was. We have connections to both side of the law here. Chief Bogo will have the ZPD out searching the streets, looking in the ways that are legal, while Mr. Big has his goons search the back-alleys and the like in ways that the police can't. This sicko will be found, you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Judy. \"I'm a little out of my league here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, how many people told you that you'd never become a cop?\" Nick asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot of people,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And regardless of all that, you became a cop,\" said Nick. \"And while we might have gotten off on the wrong foot, you're the one who convinced me to become a cop as well. Here I am, Officer Nicholas Piberius Wilde, and I'm partnered to a very smart cop, who is braver than even she cares to admit, who is loyal, truthful, and was the first person to see me as anything other than a fox.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy looked up at him. \"Do you think that we can catch this guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Officer Hopps, you solved the biggest missing mammal case in under 48 hours,\" said Nick. \"Then, you found out what was making people go savage, and then you tricked Bellweather into confessing her plan, just as the whole of the ZPD showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you had to admit that luck was involved, and that we had some help,\" said Judy. \"Then there was that disaster of a news conference.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who doesn't need help at times?\" Nick asked. \"Who doesn't make mistakes? And sometimes, you need a little bit of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, how are we to get any decent sleep, after what we saw today?\" Judy asked. \"All I can think about is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick placed a finger over her mouth. \"Then, we're just going to have to think about something else, and an idea just came to mind. It might not work, but it might help.\" He removed his finger, and kissed her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that might work,\" said Judy. \"We have the stuff with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for the big question,\" said Nick. \"Do you want me to do you from the front, the back, or something more exotic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy smiled, and said...</span></div></div>",

It would only be fair to return the favor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot of problems with that scenario,\" said Judy. \"The least of which is that it might be illegal. Someone might consider it to be Cruel and Unusual Punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw what those Night Howler pellets did to people, and what happened as a result,\" said Nick. \"It would be ironic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just to be clear, you're talking about giving her the pill first, right?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Nick. \"I want her to be afraid of us, not dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, to pull this off, we would need some help,\" said Judy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick grinned. \"And I have just the people in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this pill protects the user from being digested?\" the owner of the pharmacy on Stripe and 7th said as he looked at the pills. \"Amazing. I can think of a few scenarios where this pill might enhance things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are we here?\" Lionheart asked, as he looked at the others seated at the table. \"Why can't this be discussed over the phone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phones can be bugged,\" said Mr. Big. \"That and we don't want any record of this meeting to be found, save that of memory, which can be persuaded to lie if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like it myself, but given what's been going on, I understand the need for this sort of thing,\" said Chief Bogo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's going on here?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bellweather is planning to escape under the cover of a rather large riot, which is partially induced by Night Howler pellets being fired at the crowd over at the courthouse over whether or not you should still be the mayor of Zootopia, due to your part in having the missing mammals captive,\" said Chief Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was over,\" said Lionheart. \"A hundred hours of community service, per person I held, plus two years supervised probation, and in return, I remain mayor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but some might find fault with letting a known kidnapper remain mayor,\" said Mr. Big. \"Especially a predator.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that was over and done with,\" said Lionheart. \"I did what I did for the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't,\" said Mr. Big. \"But the riot is a decoy, which would occupy a number of available officers, which would allow Bellweather's group to rescue her from prison. But that is nothing compared to the cherry on top of the sundae. During the confusion, Officers Hopps and Wilde would be separated from any and all backup, at which point, they'd be grabbed. Afterwards, they would be brutally murdered, with their bodies being torn apart by a really psychotic sicko, whom even the likes of those such as myself tend to avoid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how do you know all this?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helps to have eyes and ears in the various gangs, and it helps to know people who can do what we can't,\" said Chief Bogo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He took the high road, and I took the low road, and then we shared each other's maps to find any overlap,\" said Mr. Big. \"That and knowing a few people who know other people never hurts. Koslov.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear took out a smartphone, and placed it on the table. He tapped a few apps, and got to the necessary information, before handing it to the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionheart took a look, and gasped in surprise. \"She's done all this while locked in a cell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And to think that you never gave her a real chance to shine honestly,\" said Mr. Big. \"In a way, this comes back to whatever happened between the two of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionheart frowned. \"I suppose I was a little rough on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You backed her into a corner, and she found a way to fight back,\" said Nick. \"Everyone fights in a corner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be fair, you did just stick her in a broom closet and called it an office,\" said Judy. \"After that, and everything else you put her through, she got motivated to bring you down the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then she got motivated again, and figured out how to communicate with the outside,\" said Chief Bogo. \"Can't be through the guards; I can vouch for most of them, and those I can't personally vouch for are vouched for by those I trust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't any of the convicts,\" said Mr. Big. \"Even those guys wouldn't stand for what she did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a drone?\" the store owner suggested, as he came up from looking at the pills. \"I've sold more than a few of them, and there's ways you can attach cameras to them. Some are small enough to be missed, if the flyer is skillful enough. Hide it where the guards can't spot it, and you have a way to send messages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just plain crazy,\" said Lionheart. \"Who would even work for her after what she did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Talking to you is your chief of police, and right next to him, also talking to you, is the city's highest ranked crime boss,\" said the store owner. \"That is crazy right there. Besides, there's lots of crazy people out there, and not just the ones who buy my magazines. There's the crazier ones who burn them. I have pictures of those guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't make them the people we are after,\" said Chief Bogo. He looked at the mayor. \"That being said, she has managed to rally a number of speciest groups together, mostly Prey types, but there are a few Predators in the mix, all dangerous ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I avoid them myself,\" said Mr. Big. \"Too much hate is bad for business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's the plan?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already in progress,\" said Chief Bogo. \"It seems there was a bit of an increase in gang violence over the last few hours, which resulted in a lot of Probable Cause Searches and Seizes , who shut down a large number of labs that were making Night Howler pellets, and the arrest of over two hundred dangerous speciest group members, as of the present moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Warrant-less searches?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Bogo grinned. \"Don't need one when you have probable cause, and spotting suspicious characters breaking into places and fighting with the people inside is probable cause on the books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still going to be a nightmare,\" said Lionheart. \"And Bellweather?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't be the leader of a group if you don't have a group to rally behind you,\" said Chief Bogo. \"It's more embarrassing when you don't know they've been arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you going to do about her?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Bogo passed the pill bottle over to Lionheart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionheart looked at the pill bottle, and grinned. \"Not what I had in mind when I had them made, but I must admit, a part of me always did wonder how she tasted, if you know what I'm talking about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Page 34 of Lion and Sheep,\" said the store owner, putting down a magazine. \"It has mint jelly in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionheart looked at the cover of the magazine. \"Um, I don't read these things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah you do,\" said the store owner. \"I never forget a customer, or a purchase, and you've bought no less than a dozen of these magazines, through an intermediary of course, but I know that they shopped for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, if you don't want it, I might want to take a look at it for ideas on what I'm going to do to Bellweather,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that you're going to be the first to taste that, that, that ewe?\" Lionheart asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and Judy's going to help,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLionheart looked at her. He picked up the magazine, opened it to the page, and looked at it. \"Interesting.\" He then looked at the pair.</span></div></div>",

The worst news is this, these were just some random people this sicko picked up to use as practice for the real thing, and anyone with even half a brain can figure out who is being targeted! I don't need to state that I want this person found! However, this is only the beginning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projector changed its images. It was the rabbit that Duke Weaselton had spotted, and tailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Acting upon information passed onto us by an informant, some of our officers went to question this rabbit, John Lapin, over some of his recent purchases in regards to the controlled plant known as <i>Midnicampum holicithias</i>, or, in laymammal terms, Night Howlers. He was found in possession of several thousand bulbs, without a proper permit. When questioned, he became violent, and attacked the officers, who were thankfully able to subdue him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we know if there is a connection between the Night Howlers and the double homicide?\" a lion officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unknown,\" said Chief Bogo. \"However, the possibility is there. Then, there's a third priority; Rumors of a possible escape attempt at the Maximum Security Prison, involving one former-Mayor Bellwether. Thanks to some information from a reliable source, there are a number of people planning to break her out. We have pictures and video that has been offered to us by a number of store owners who have noticed these people. They are to be checked out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unknown,\" said Chief Bogo. We could be dealing with three separate crimes, or they could be connected, or maybe every wacko planned to do something this week on their own time, and we're stuck dealing with the mess; find them, and put a stop to them. Bend a few rules if you have to, and maybe a few papers might get misplaced, but I want these cases solved quickly. I doubt that this even close to being the least of our worries. Now, here's your assignments...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy looked at each other as Chief Bogo finished telling them what had happened on his end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did all that?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChief Bogo looked at them, and nodded. \"We look after our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And likewise, <i>I</i> look after my family,\" said Mr. Big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Also, a few hours earlier.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big sat on a desk, staring at the heads of the various crime families. Most were bigger that him, stronger too, and plenty could eat him in a single bite, and there was a few who he knew were making moves to remove him, but he hadn't gotten in charge of them by being nice himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have two cops staying here,\" stated Mr. Lobo. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to know?\" Mr. Big asked, civilly. \"What business is it of yours if I do have a couple of cops staying here, especially since the one is the godmother to my grandchild, and the other is like a son to me, a disrespectful son who went off on his own, but a son nonetheless, and both have done a lot of good for this city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some are saying that you're going soft,\" said Mr. Lobo. \"They say you're cooperating with the police. They say that you are planning to rat out all of us, so that you can take control of everything! Here's what me and my pack have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the wolf found himself grabbed out of his chair by a pair of polar bears, and a paw clamped down on his muzzle. The other wolves were about to make their move to protect their leader, when Mr. Big called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves looked at him. There was a look in his eyes that commanded every thought in their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolves sat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good boys, and unless you want your boss to end up dead, you'll <i>stay</i> sitting.\" He looked at his polar bears. \"Bring him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bears brought the struggling wolf forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you thought that you could make your move here in my place, I have to give you credit for that.\" The shrew chuckled. \"Now, you're wondering why I don't chuck you into the Deep Freeze right this moment, but that's because I'm feeling generous, and I'm going to let you live to tell everyone just how generous I am. Koslov.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoslov placed a pill bottle on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The police are planning to hire rodent officers, to help them patrol areas their larger officers can get into, such as cracks in peoples' homes,\" said Mr. Big. \"The problem is, what if they encountered a rude lout like our friend here, who decides to eat them to silence them.\" Mr. Big grinned. \"The solution is simple, enter the throat, pass through the digestive system, and come out the anus, as Mr. Lobo here will so kindly demonstrate, with the help of my guard Raymond, with the help of these pills, which those two officers gave to me. Let him speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe polar bear holding Mr. Lobo's mouth shut let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Lobo growled. \"You plan to kill me by having me become polar bear shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were planning to kill me just now,\" said Mr. Big. \"I'm giving you a chance to live, which is more than what you were about to give me. Of course, there's always the alternative.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a guard removed some floorboards, revealing the ice pool under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long do you think you will last in there?\" Mr Big asked. \"Thirty minutes, at most.\" He gestured over to the pills. \"According to my information, that pill will protect you from being digested for twelve hours, and aside from smelling like polar bear, you'd be safe. Of course, there's the chance it might not work, and you'd be dead anyways.\" Mr. Big looked at Mr. Lobo. \"The ice, or, as you put it, polar bear shit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Lobo looked at the ice pool. Then he looked at the pill bottle. He looked at Mr. Big. \"I'll take my chances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big grinned. \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoslov opened the bottle, and shook out a pill. He then walked over to Mr. Lobo, and shoved the pill down the wolf's throat. Then, he got out a muzzle and rope, and started to apply them to the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard of those who entertained thoughts of being prey, and those who entertain thoughts of being a predator,\" said Mr. Big as his guards finished binding their victim. \"Me, I think I'll just watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Raymond started to devour Mr. Lobo headfirst. The wolf tried to struggle at first, but the polar bear was stronger than him, and was assisted by several others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other crime bosses watched in horrid fascination at the punishment that was occurring in front of them, as soon the bear's mouth slipped past the wolf's shoulders. Within the space of a minute, all that was left was a bulge in the polar bear's guts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll be out in a few hours, and in need of fresh clothes,\" said Mr. Big. \"Now, who else wishes to challenge me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other crime bosses looked at the pills, and looked at the number of polar bears Mr. Big had; there was at least one for each other them, and plenty more to spare. They stayed put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big grinned. \"I thought you'd see it my way. Now, let's get down to business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Nick and Judy looked at each other. \"What happened to Mr. Lobo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When he came out of Raymond, he encountered Kevin, who made sure he took a shower, before making his apology to me,\" said Mr. Big. \"Seems he was feeling grateful for being allowed to live. Of course, there was other business to be done, much of which Chief Bogo talked about. After that, we swapped information, compared notes, made plans, got to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy looked at each other. \"Good to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Big grinned. \"Give Bellwether my regards when you see her. Tell her I'll be waiting for her if she escapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep that in mind,\" said Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you want to go home now,\" said Chief Bogo. \"I have a lot of work to do, and you need your sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we do,\" said Judy.</span></div></div>",

They believe they wouldn't get away with it because the victim was a fox. You felt not just hunger, but anger stir inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started to recall being muzzled as a kid because you were a fox. You hated guys like these for judging you.

He then took a good look at your weight. \"Didn't know the so-called hero fox was so fat.\"<br>\r\n\"I put on a few.\" You admitted. \"So, you two like messing with foxes, eh?\"<br>\r\n\"Pssh! I think we are doing this town a favor.\" One of the rhinos said with a smirk.<br>\r\n\"If you really believe that, then you are really nothing but criminals.\" You said. You then took out a tranquilizer gun and gave out a smirk. \"And my job.... is to get rid of criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Leatherman brothers shouldn't be, but they started to look scared of you.

Move....\" The brothers went.<br>\r\n\"I just hit you with paralysis darts. The tranquilizer darts will usually knock you out instantly. The paralysis darts prevent you from moving, yet you are still conscience.\" You tell them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get the cell key out and opened the cell door. You had a wide grin on your face and licked your chops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha.... what are you gonna do?\" One of the rhinos asked looking scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said. My job is to get rid of criminals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wanted to start with the one named Fredrick. You go to his legs and open your mouth widely. You begin shallowing your prey. The more you bring Fredrick into your maw, the most scared he got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop! No! Stop!\" The rhino pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course you did not stopped. You shallow him up until his head was in your jaws. With one big gulp, the Fredrick was now completely inside your belly. It also swelled up to three times the size. You then let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ate my brother!\" Calvin said in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"You will be joining him soon enough.\" You said to him. \"Now, I think for you.... I'll just start with the head.\"<br>\r\n\"Please.... Don't....\" Calvin pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't listened. You just opened your mouth and started to shallow the other rhino.

He then started notices that Judy was sucking in his legs and tail too. \"Hey!!! Let go!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf attempted to get Judy to stop, but the bunny was too determined. More and more of the wolf's body got sucked in by Judy and more into her stretching stomach. Eventually, the only part left for Judy to shallow waz the crook's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P.... please stop.\" The wolf pleaded.

Judy smirked, and licked her lips eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twisted the wheel, pulling the police cruiser into the alley and cornering the crooks- who all jumped up in surprise and alarm, now that a cop car had cut off their only exit. Judy leaned out of the window, calling out to the three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look at this.\" She said, a little smug contempt in her tone. \"I hope for your own sake that you guys are just lending each other some sugar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...wait a sec- You're that one bunny cop, who figured out the mayor was crooked.\" One of the gray wolves said, sneering a little as he tried to hide the plastic baggie he held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she let herself go a bit...\" The other grey wolf muttered, his companion swiftly elbowing him in the ribs \"shut it moron! Don't make this worse for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brown wolf snarled- \"Worse? We're busted! Run, idiots!\" He said, beginning to bolt around the police car- before its opening door slammed him in the face. Judy stepped out- the other two gray wolves trying to take advantage of her being distracted, but a few well aimed tranquilizers from her little dart gun managed to knock them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw- I was kinda hoping all three of you'd be awake for this.\" She said, smiling down at the dazed brown wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...awake for wh-\" he got cut off, as Judy gripped his ears, tugging him forwards- and shoving his entire snout into her own maw, effectively muzzling him. His eyes widened in confusion, as his panicked yells were quickly muffled as the fatass rabbit slurped him down. From his face, to neck, using both hands to help force in the shoulders- leaning back her head as she gulped down to his waist, and letting gravity cause him to slide down her throat- his large bare paws the last thing sticking out of her mouth, still kicking and wiggling in panic, before Judy's tongue lapped at his toes- helping to pull them in- along with her forceful swallows- until the entire wolf ended up packed into her bulging belly, which surged forth in front of her even more now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied huff, Judy gripped her belly with both arms, waddling around to the other side of the patrol car to the two tranquizlied gray wolves, laying on top of each other. Judy giggled, dropping her heavy, sloshy, wriggling belly as she prepared to repeat her feast. \"It's awfully nice that there are two of you...\" She muttered, chuckling to herself. \"One for each buttcheek after you're digested!\" She said, bending over and grabbing one pair of feet, bringing them to her eagerly awaiting mouth and sliding them in, toes first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy gulped and slurped down the two unconscious lupines, she found that they went down a lot faster than the others- probably because they weren't struggling. All the wriggling was fun, of course, feeling her pray squirm its way down inside her- but there was also something gratifying about smoothly, quickly gulping down a whole wolf in one clean motion, her belly filling up so fast that it blimped up in size all at once- the front of her suit actually finally ripping after swallowing the first grey wolf, exposing her own fuzzy gray belly. Not that that stopped her from slurping down the second grey wolf, just as fast. Now she was truly bloated- her fat, squishy body merely a base for the huge expanse of her belly, packed with three whole wolves, bursting out from the torn seams of her outfit, so big it touched the ground when she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy let out a resounding, proud, brassy belch- giggling as she rubbed her titanic tummy. \"I'd say that's a good day's work! Breakfast, lunch, and dinner- all at once!\" She beamed, before hoisting herself up into the squad car- having to tuck her enormous belly under the dashboard, pressing against her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy glanced at the clock. \"oh- Shoot! It's almost been an hour already? I'd better go back and meet up with Nick. Wonder what he'll think of all this~\" she giggled, pulling out of the alleyway.</span></div></div>",

It was irresistible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCautiously parking the car, the fattened, massively overfed rabbit with a belly full of wolves carefully lowered herself out of the car- holding her belly and approaching slowly- anticipation building as drool ran down her chin- as she eyes up that long, lashing tail- those big bare feet, toned calves and beefy thighs, and that bulging, protruding butt- wiggling temptingly side to side as the tiger crawled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy got down right behind the tiger- laying on her belly at first, but rolling herself forwards- so her face was close to the ground- to the tiger's big paws- and her torso was at an angle, her feet up in the air above her own head and her belly sticking out behind her. She was so close, she could smell the tiger's musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, she went for it! Catching the tiger by the toe- as it were- but certainly not letting him go when he started to hollar. She ran her tongue along his sole, getting a taste- before opening wide and slipping the toes between her lips- gripping the other paw and forcing it in similarly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to pull him in- feeling up his thick, heavy, beefy figure as she gripped him, using her paws to help push him in, as she savored the taste and feel of his meaty legs on her tongue and in her throat- even pausing for a moment once his pelvis crossed her lips, really taking a moment to savor the curvature of his sculpted pumped up glutes in her mouth, even running her tongue along the considerable bulge in his crotch as she continued to eat him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her mouth strain as his body sloped outwards, she <i><b>really</b></i> had to work to gulp down those dramatically oversized pumped up juicy pecs, and those broad, squared off, powerful shoulders. The brutish thief wasn't going down so easy- and Judy was learning that she <i>loved</i> her meals with a little spice~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing to go down was his bellowing head- Judy felt her mouth close around his eyes, his muzzle sticking out- unable to open with hers wrapped around it. And with one final gulp, he was down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Judy...was <i>huge</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ecstatically giggled- periodically letting out little burps like hiccups, as her latest pray continued to vigorously struggle and fight- her belly so much bigger than before, the ribs in her suit having been torn future into a big huge hole for her glorious fuzzy belly to balloon out from, so full that her fur was thinned at points, unable to cover all that space. Her strained skin visible as a ligh red, with a few stretch marks around the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy clumsily rolled over- sitting down on her fat butt with her legs out in front of her, as she lovingly massaged and kneaded her own sprawling wildly overfilled belly with both her fingers and her toes, as it was so big it stuck out further than her legs were long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, once her tumultuous tummy had settled down just a bit- still nowhere near digested (though she was looking puffier already)- Just enough stillness for her to comfortably waddle around clutching it, she made her way back to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven after adjusting the seat so it went back as far as it could, Judy could barely squeeze into the car- it was an even tighter fit than before. She giggled, burping happily again as she said \"rrmmm....breakfast, lunch, dinner.....and one <i>hell</i> of a good dessert... I should eat this well more often!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, she began to drive back- doing her best to press the tips of her plump toes to the pedals, reaching around that glorious gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Judy eventually did get back to the street where she and Nick had split up, she pulled over to his side, cranking down the window. \"H-<i><b>urrp</b></i>-hey, Nick~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's eyes widened for a moment, as he took in the dramatic growth of his partner. After a moment, he raised an eyebrow and said...</span></div></div>",

I'll take you home and then drop the car off at the station.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt of effort, Judy stumbled out from the car- her belly so big that even with both arms hugging it for support, it was touching the ground as she waddled around the car, sticking out as many feet in front of her as it was wide. She squeezed into the passengers side, moving her chair back as Nick moved his seat forwards again to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, wait.

She was now looking like she could compete with the weight of Clawhauser or a hippo. In fact, her cheeks and jowl started to resemble that of Clawhauser. Her belly was still massive, looking like it could fit another 3 wolves as it was only a few centimeters from touching the ground. Judy then patted her belly and it jiggled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it looks like plenty of my <i>breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert</i> stayed here,\" Judy said to herself. \"But....\" Judy then turned around to look at her butt in the mirror. \".... a lot of it went right here.\" The bunny said with a grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of the weight really did went to her butt. Her hips and butt were humongous. Wide enough to take up the whole back seat in the cruiser and enough to compete with a hippo. As she felt up her butt a bit, she was surprised by how doughy it was. She also realized how tight her panties were getting. Clearly, she had too much junk in the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm gonna need to buy some new panties soon.\" The bunny said as she pulled the sides of her panty straps. \"But then again, with the way I'm going, I might outgrow those too.\" She then let go of the straps. \"No doubt everyone is gonna be calling me Judy Hipps even more now. Not that I will mind it. You know what they say \"<i>If you got it, flaunt it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy then gave a little wiggle. To be so fat, you surprisingly mobile showed that had quite some strength in those hips of hers. She could probably be even better at her job now.

She didn't seem to mind it. Judy then walked up with Nick. Like everyone else, Nick had to make a comment about her Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My, look at you, Officer 'Hipps'.\" The fox said with a sly grin. He then circled around Judy. \"Looks like those meals of yours went to all the right places.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I know it?\" Judy commented. \"Now, if you would excuse me, I need to get a get a new uniform for all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Judy walked over to the locker room,  Nick grinned as he said \"Make sure to go up one or two extra sizes.

Might as well pick a size that will accommodate you especially if she was intending to down more criminals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting on a better fitting version of her uniform, Judy and Nick went on their patrol.

Or rather, who's on the menu?\" Nick asked knowing that her partner was probably hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's belly then growled loudly in hunger. After spending the whole time digesting everything, she had nothing but empty belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you have in mind?\" Judy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a small group of weasels that have been using counterfeit money Downtown, a group of sheep and rams that might be part of a group that helped Bellwether in the Rainforest District, or a large polar bear that's a druglord in Tundratown.\" Nick said. \"We got proper leads to each of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy was hungry enough for all of them.

It was close to the last place when they were at when they saved the Nighthowlers case. They even found an abandoned train cart that was being used. They weren't really original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick and Judy peered at the window of the train cart. The set up was a lot like the old one, but with way less equipment and no nighthowlers have been grown yet. Like Nick said, there were 5 of them. 3 sheep, 2 white and 1 black, and 2 rams, both grey. All males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy and Nick couldn't hear what they were talking about, but they were differently up to no go. It was clear that they intended to finish what Bellwether started.

Usually, her greatest asset in combat had been her small size, high speed, and agility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut looking at the immense pile of dough she'd managed to grow into, she realized that running in and fighting wasn't a great first instinct. Though, considering how utterly consumed in thick layers of lard her little legs were, 'running' would've been a generous term.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought that luring them out might've been a safe bet, but she didn't like the idea of them being stunned. Unconscious was more easy, but feeling the struggling was part of the <i>thrill</i> of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright...Let's go for cutting the lights- once they're in the dark, you go in. I'll assume position just outside the door at the end of the traincar.\" Judy said, smirking up at Nick- her pudgy face being squished by the ring of gently wobbling neck fat she sported. \"Once you're in, push 'em out the back of the traincar- try and aim for my mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick chuckled, the bunny still so much shorter than him despite ballooning outwards so much in all directions but up. \"Try and open wide- I'm sure it'll be a hard target to miss~\" he teased, before slinking off to the power box. Judy followed, shifting her considerable mass from paw to paw, surrounded by the satisfying feeling of all that heavy body fat of hers sloshing with each methodical, lumbering step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd reached the spot just outside the traincar's closed back door, she let out a soft sigh of relief- Walking was tough for such a heavy bun. Judy took a seat right there, her pillowy, comfy butt having grown so fat it made a pretty good beanbag chair- the bunny able to kick out her paws and lean back a bit, feeling the fat folds on her back bunch up against her head like a pillow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd made herself nice and comfortable for a nice big meal, she turned to Nick, giving him an affirmative thumbs up with her pudgy little digits. Receiving confirmation from his partner, Nick eagerly ripped out a fistful of wires- all the lights in the traincar going out instantly. Amidst the confused bleats of the car's occupants, Nick slipped silently inside through a window. And Judy excitedly opened up her mouth- tongue out, slightly salivating with anticipation...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the white sheep came tumbling out first- his back facing Judy as he fell onto her, a ludicrous amount of fat cushioning his fall. Before he could wonder what it was he landed on, Judy's fat little fingers closed around his muzzle, the blubbery bun grunting a bit as she yanked him closer- wrapping her lips around his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTingling with glee as he failed aimlessly, Judy would reach out her short little pillowy flabby arms as far as she could, grabbing mittfulls of fleece and pulling him up, shivering with every gulp as she felt the pressure in her throat, letting out a low, satisfied belch after he finally fully slipped down her gullet, and reappeared as a visible bulge in her gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost on queue, one of the rams tripped out- falling flat on his face on top of her. She didn't even have to pull him in this time- his snout managed to land perfectly in her awaiting maw. Joyfully gulping him down- letting her fat arms lay lazily on her love handles, Judy successfully swallowed up his head, shoulders, waist, hips, legs, and hooves in six beautifully smooth gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black sheep was next- somehow he'd fallen out legs first, allowing Judy to just grab him by the ankles and shovel his hooves down her throat. Desperately trying to claw his way out, his blunt hooves digging into her soft flab repeatedly only tickled- the bunny giggling profusely in between swallows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gut was already noticeably bigger, three sheep being a bit more all together than three wolves, her belly had gone from soft and doughy to rotund and firm. But the food didn't stop then- out came the second white sheep- bouncing off her belly and landing arm-first in her maw. This was a new one, but Judy rolled with it- simply using both pudgy hands to force him inside her, bending his neck in quite an uncomfortable way as he shimmied frantically like a fish out of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast of all, the second ram- who Judy was surprised to see Nick fall out with. It seemed the ram was putting up more of a fight than the others, and Nick had had to tackle him full on to get him out. The two landed on top of Judy- still locked in combat- Nick with his paws around the Ram's throat as its hooves repeatedly punched him in the shoulders, trying to make him let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, Nick realized that they'd both fallen out- Looking up in surprise...before smirking wickedly as he realized how close they were to Judy's face. With a burst of energy, he shoved the ram's head back, right at Judy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnthusiastically opening wide, Judy made quick work of the final ram- her fat arms again resting on her folds, as Nick did all the work to push the struggling ram down her throat- her belly bloating out far enough to press against the train now, a great round firm ball which was just as big, if not bigger, than the rest of the obese bunny (which, considering the size of her butt, was an impressive size for anything).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being filled up so much so fast, Judy couldn't stop herself from letting out a long, loud, reverberating belch- Accidentally hitting Nick directly in the face, the force of hot air washing over Nick, blowing his ears back like a stiff wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy huffed and puffed- worn out from the shock to her system of ingesting so much at once- But horrified and embarrassed at what she'd just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>huff...huff...</i>oh my gosh- Sorry! I'm...<i>wheeze</i>...I'm really sorry- I didn't mean to- it just sorta-\" her already flushed red face managed to blush an even brighter shade, as her apology was cut off by Nick, reaching out and grabbing hold of her soft, chubby cheeks, leaning in quickly as he pulled her doughy features close, and instantly locked lips with the bloated blob of blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy's eyes widened as she tensed up- before they fluttered shut, the overstuffed obese rabbit melting into her own enormity as she began to kiss her partner back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the fox leaned back, panting himself. He glanced over his shoulder at the firm gray orb of her belly, furiously jostling with her prey inside. Nick gently prodded it with his toes, promoting one of the shapes to violently kick and yell. Judy herself emitting an adorable, muffled giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back to her, smiling widely himself. \"Well....\" He said, \"I'd say planning ahead paid off, huh?\" Judy chuckled, \"In <i>spades</i>.\" She agreed, lovingly caressing the top part of her overfilled belly with her soft fatty fingers, similarly massaging the underside with her round fatty toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick leaned back, propping himself up against the engorged bun's belly, his rump finding a seat squarely between her overfattened breasts, as he lounged with his legs kicked out, wrapping around her neck fat, paws touching the crest of her back flab as he playfully used his own toes to tickle her tall ears. \"So carrot-cake,\" he asked with a smile, trying out a new nickname more appropriate for her figure, \"how'd you feel about your breakfast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy licked her chops, playfully swatting away Nick's feet from her ears with a doughy arm, before responding...</span></div></div>",

If he had his way, he'd eat this entire city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe van pulled up to the alleyway behind Jumbeaux's. Still wearing his little toot-toot costume, he pulled it up over his head and entered in through a back door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnnoticed, of course. Who would notice a runt like him? Late in the day the shop was closed, and sneaking between the back rooms on the floor, he found only Jumbeaux himself, counting the day's wages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick looked up at the massive beast before him, so many times bigger than himself, with a sense of rush in his heart. This was going to be impossibly amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a world of dumb, predatory and prey animals, he wouldn't have a change. He possessed no natural tools to defeat such a massive beast, but he had one simple little tool now; his brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an ice cream shop, that meant loads of coolants, refrigerants, in the compressors. He found some tubing, and hooked up a complex network of rubber hoses to leech fluorocarbons from the system. He tied the final tube into a slipknot, and climbed through the vents until he found the one just above Jumbeaux.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant was big enough that there were mere inches between him and the ceiling. Finnick--his mouth covered by his costume--lowered the hose gently and undid the slipknot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbeaux precessed slightly in his chair like a spinning top losing power. He rubbed at his eye with the end of his trunk before looking around and yawning. mumbling something gently, he tried to stand up, but started breathing more heavily, much to his problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for the elephant to weaken, and much much longer for the process to finally cause him to succumb, but the cold fluorocarbons washed over him with every large breath. Once the ball was rolling, it just picked up speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumbeaux crashed onto the floor with a weight that shook the building. Finnick tore through the ventilation shafts and turned on the fans, clearing the space of any debilitating gasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened the door to the back room, and saw his prey laying out on a pile of uncounted cash. Well, in for a penny, in for an entire day's receipts, why not, and Finnick took the contents of the till and the cash on the floor. An idea sparked, and he changed a few other receipts and the cash flow in the company records. If it worked, It would make it seem like Jumbeaux had embezzled and was likely to skip town. He even put a few travel sites in the elephant's search history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick looked over his meal, a mountain to the little fox. He felt so hungry, and so aroused by the prospect, he wanted to swallow him whole and live right now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the more sensible thing might be to quickly end him, and take him somewhere where he could be eaten over a long period of time piece by piece...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His sandy-furred belly was distended such that one could see every detail of the elephant he had eaten, and he rubbed it as much as he could with his limbs.

BUT, if I finish mine first, I get mine for free. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick leaned forward, his weight supported by the undercurve of his stomach, and extended his paw. The elephant considered this, looked him up and down, and seemed hesitant; who had ever seen a fox this size? But still, he couldn't possibly eat too fast, with a mouth that size. The elephant extended a trunk into Finnick's paw, and shook it. \"Deal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick still had a supply of the knockout drug he had used on Jumbeaux, not enough for a long sleep, but enough, in a vial in his bowling shirt's chest pocket. The waiter-elephant took one popsicle from the display and handed it to the fox. Then, while the elephant bent down to get a second one, he quickly dug for it. Momentarily losing his paw into the folds of his massive new bulk, he retrieved the vial and dosed the very tip of the popsicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" barked Finnick at the site of the second popsicle in the server's grasp. \"You think I need some kinda handicap, taking the bigger one for yourself? Give it here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant shrugged off an argument about them being the same size, and switched popsicles with the bloated fox. \"On three, ready?\" Finnick counted down, \"One, Two, THREE\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ate furiously fast, Finnick's smaller sharp-toothed mouth keeping up with huge swallows of icy cold fruit flavored treat. He watched side-eyed as the elephant ate the dosed tip of the popsicle, and from then he had already won. But it would be nice to win both ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick knew a trick, and when the server's eyes started to screw up and close tight to fight off the inevitable brain freeze, Finnick made sure to rub the roof of his mouth with his tongue feverishly to create friction and heat, staving off the cold from his sinuses. In a few huge gulps, gigantic swallows that bulged out the foxes throat as it sloshed into his gut making it grow another few inches in front of him, he grew even bigger and his stomach started to groan and slosh with its contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine dropped his bare popsicle stick onto the counter just as the server was swallowing his last bite. \"Well, I'll be.\" said the elephant. \"I guess you can handle one after all. How did you get to be so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick smiled at the question. The drug was having an effect, although the sugar and full belly would slow it down, it would still work, just after a period of prolonged loopiness on the part of the pachyderm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat,\" he said, baring all his teeth. The fox rubbed his stomach, what he could reach, while the elephant walked around the counter. \"This thing is always hungry and I love stuffing more and more into it, I eat and eat and eat.\" Finnick lifted up his massive gut, and let it fall to the floor, making the whole building shake like a deep bass thump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that, can I...?\" he reached out a fore foot, his eyes blinking very slowly, as the stupor caught on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" said Finnick, presenting his massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just so big,\" said the server, rubbing the massive bare sand-furred gut with first his feet, then his trunk, and eventually his head. \"So soft and warm like a massive warm-water pillow, you're as big as an elephant, maybe bigger! how big could you... possibly... *Yaaaaawwwwn* geeett\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see, in a moment,\" were the last words the elephant heard before drifting off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick rubbed his hands together and licked his lips.

He nimbly stripped the elephant of all his clothes, resembling what he had seen at the naturist colony on the edge of town. Looking around at what to do with the apron, hat, and other parts of his uniform, he shrugged and shoved them into his mouth, and swallowed them as one large bulge down his throat and into his stomach. He was going to digest them if he left them on, and this way, there was no evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpid managed impressive mobility for his newfound size, and turned over every massive bucket of ice cream on display, gallons of it, in rolled balls larger than he used to be, larger even than most mid-sized mammals. Eventually, all edible ice cream and dessert in a pile on the floor around this server, it resembled a sort of elephant banana split. All told, there was at least as much ice cream as elephant, perhaps more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnick rubbed his paws together and licked his lips, running his drooling tongue over each individual sharp teeth. He opened his maw wide, a gaping visage to his cavernous throat if the elephant were conscious to see it. Again, he swallowed up the elephant, trunk first, his mouth parting over the giant leathery gray skinned beast as massive swallows drew him up into his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his new weight, Finnick found he could anchor himself better, and draw this elephant sundae more into him than pull himself around it. Still, altogether, the sweet desserts dripping off the pachyderm, It was more than the massive fox now weighed. He had to stuff in huge balls of ice cream along with each swallow of elephant, until eventually it all was swallowed and stuffed into his enormous gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was absolutely massive now, the largest mammal in zootopia by a very wide margin. For all the fat that had accumulated around him, his stomach was bloated and stuffed so far he couldn't see over its horizon. He was as big as three elephants, now, and looked like he could grow bigger than the entire ice cream parlor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohhh,\" moaned Finnick, his voice deepened more and full of pleasure. \"Look at how fat you've made my big belly.\" He rubbed at what little he could reach of this two-elephant balloon in front of him, as it gurgled and sloshed with melted ice cream inside. It groaned in pleasurable digestion. \"that's it, stomach,\" said the fox, \"You just digest it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After eating two elephants and just about all the ice cream in the parlor, being  called fat or obese were an understatement. The fennec fox was gargantuan. His clothes were barely holding on. His pants were close to ripping while his shirt barely covered his top. His face and Joel grew fatter as well. Looking like it was holding a whole watermelon. He also spotted 4 chins now. His belly spread out to cover a good fraction of the store.

So eating a train might be an even better meal than the bus. Finnick loved the idea of stuffing himself with an even bigger meal than the last one. Especially if it meant getting even bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fennec then stomped around to where he could find a nice active railroad. With some luck, Finnick found a perfect railroad that was near a factory. Now he just laid his body flat on the rails until a train came. As he fell down on his belly, he shook the ground quite a bit. Next part the hardest part of Finnick, waiting. He had to wait for a passing train to come here and that was only if he was lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it seemed that Finnick's luck wasn't going to run out anytime soon. A long train was coming his way. A wide grin started to form on Finnick's face. The train looked like one of those factory trains that brings over materials to another spot. So, it looked like the only real person on the train was the elephant conductor. Seems like everyone elephant was doomed to go into Finnick's maw. From a distance, the conductor couldn't make out what was on the rails. It just looked like a round building-sized blob. As he gets closer, Finnick opens up his mouth impossibly wide. The conductor then realized what was about to happen to him and tried putting the breaks on the train. While it did slow down, it was too little, too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the same strength that Finnick used with the bus, the first part of the train was swallowed up and the rest of the train would come as he pulled more of the train into his muzzle. The second cart went into his muzzle. Then the third cart. Then the fourth cart. With each cart that went inside him, his belly grew more and more. As was as starting to have the shape of some of the carts. After 25 carts, the train was finally all inside Finnick's gargantuan belly. It was like Finnick had eaten 25 more buses as his belly as his stomach was still comformed with the shape of the many carts of the train he just devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling several times bigger than before, Finnick felt prouder and prouder of his stomach. Seems that no matter how big something was, his stomach could handle it. It was already starting the digestive process of the train and the elephant conductor.

Duke looked to each, nonchalantly, then to his wares. \"See there, coppers, nothing illegal about some fine hand-blown imported glass, now is there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick lowered his mirrored shades to glance over them as Judy picked one up. \"And where did you get these?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They fell off the back of a truck.

He grumbled to himself the ride through the downtown district on the way to the ZPD headquarters when he feels a shifting in his stomach, and feels something coming on him. \"Uh, guys,\" he says, trying to get his captors attention but to no avail, as his stomach shivers and shakes, a movement spreading throughout his body, when suddenly<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't control it!\" said the squirming weasel, before his fangs dripped and his eyes went wild, and he leapt at the fox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand with previously unknown strength grabbed at Judy while Nick slid past his lips and teeth, the fox going face-first streamlined down the weasel's long, wet throat. His heartbeat pulsed in the fox's ears, his face wincing while he pathetically attempted to writhe. In just a few swallows nothing but a pair of long feet and a huge bushy tail were outiside his mouth, the tail flailing wildly side to side. With his free hand Duke pushed the feet and tail in, and one last deep swallow filled his gut with fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJudy panicked as she visible saw the surface of Duke's stomach kicking, the soft fur parting and weaving left and right as her partner tried to free himself from within. Duke turned her to his face and grinned with all his teeth, licking them to get them wet again, and shoved her in after as one giant soft furry morself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed her in one lump, squeezing through his throat and landing down in his gut, on which he lazily placed his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis stomach was larger now than the rest of him put together, and he couldn't reach the far edge of it. It rested somewhere closer to between his haunches than up his tube-like form; it was so heavy, and weighed on him even sitting splay-legged in the back seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned against the inner car door and belched loudly, hiccuped, and belched again, proudly patting his gut.</span></div></div>",

Clawhauser lead him to a dark, grey room with nothing but a table, an overhanging lamp, two chairs and a file cabinet.

But it gurgled and moaned as it struggled to digest his two prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClawhauser hummed and wiggled his hips as he sorted through the paperwork on the filing cabinet, eventually coming back and laying a few sheets and a pencil in front of the weasel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just fill out this form with every detail you can, and then sign it there on the last page. If you need more pages let me know.\" He then produced seemingly from nowhere a chocolate-glazed donut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuke's stomach roared with hunger, loud enough that Clawhauser couldn't ignore it. \"Heh, you can't still be hungry after whatever it is you ate, now, can you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an enormous appetite,\" said Duke, smiling a crooked grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll tell you what, you finish that paperwork and I'll let you have the rest of this donut all to yourself,\" he said, waving the pastry in front of Duke's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chubby cheetah had to reach across the table a bit to taunt Duke, so when the weasel quickly snapped up Clawhauser's hand, donut and all, and pulled back, the cheetah fell forward and onto the paperwork.

There was a look of scrambling terror as Clawhauser realized what was happening and that he couldn't do much to stop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weasel pulled again, and opened his mouth wider, saliva dripping from his hapscrabble fangs as the cheetah's face entered in too, and soon that huge blubbery mass was sliding down his throat.

You in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle groaned in annoyance. \"I'm kind of in the middle of something, Vinnie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing I haven't seen before,\" said Vinnie. \"Open up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle glanced at one of the free tigers, who walked to the door, and carefully opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn came a pig. He glanced at Gazelle and the two tigers she was between. \"I guess you were in the middle of a tiger sandwich. Tell me that you used that one lubricant that I recommended?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle chuckled nervously. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the pig said, as he walked over to a table, and sat in a way that wasn't looking at her and the two tigers, as he got out the cash money from the concert. \"I always recommend that stuff to anyone who hires me, and happens to be as sexually active as you five are. I remember this mouse that once hired me, Frank Mousinatra - he <i>really</i> got around with the ladies, and the bigger the better. During the time he had me, he was involved with this elephant - Ella Phanta or some such thing. One time I came in, he was into her, in a <i>big</i> way, and was more than a little <i>stuck</i>. Luckily, I had bought some of that stuff for my own personal use with this female I was seeing, and so I applied it to my hand, and I was able to slip it inside of Ella, and get Frank out of her. He gave me a Bonus for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGazelle chuckled nervously. \"I can imagine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That always seems to be the problem though - going through it without thinking through it,\" said Vinnie. He turned, and looked at the three, before glancing at the other two tigers, and then back to Gazelle. \"I have no issues with mixed-species sex acts, so long as you realize that your body isn't going to be readily acceptable to the other person's anatomy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've used plenty of toys to get myself ready,\" said Gazelle. \"And I've had sex with all four of them before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But not more than one at a time,\" said Vinnie. \"Still, it looks like you've done <i>some</i> planning on how to do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know to pull out if I'm having trouble handling the weight,\" said Gazzelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Vinnie, as he turned back around. \"In that case......\"</span></div></div>",
