as she removes her final pieces of clothing, causing you to blush and avert your gaze \"-But the ones that tell her as much, always end up wet, and often needing them during the day sometimes, Ms. Williams is really nice but you don't want her thinking your a liar-\" she cuts off her train of thought as she notices you haven't said a word since she started talking and that you haven't started getting changed yourself yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you haven't see a naked girl before...Your not a guy infiltrating the girls dorms are you?\" She says striking a over the top sexy pose, with a cheeky smile, causing you to blush and turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, I'm just teasing, I'm sorry\" she says, as she embraces you in a tight hug from behind, you can feel her quite developed breasts against your back, these feelings you've never had regarding another girl before are to overwhelming and you start to tear up and shiver a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya turns you around and looks you straight in the eye, you quickly avert your gaze again but this time the tears rush forward, she once again pulls you into a tight hug as she pats your hair and whispers \"You'll be fine, I'll help you\" and repeats it a second time a bit louder and firmer \"You'll be fine, I'll help you, after a few nights dry she'll know your telling the truth and I'll back you up ok?\" she says placing a hand on your chin and turning your face to meet her eyes, shell shocked you just nod unable to form words, She pulls you into one quick last hug, before letting you go and giving you a big smile, picking up her nightie and pulling it on herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cannot help but admire her, even with your gaze firmly at your feet, she notices your discomfort and mistakes it for fear over getting diapered, she comes over again kneeling to get below your eye level \"You really should get changed, your going to have a hard time convincing her as it is, making her mad isn't going to help\" She says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to mumble out a weak \"Y..ea..h\" but your brain is still to over worked with the strange emotions running through you, noticing this Tanya asks if she can help, this time words don't form and you manage only a slight nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" she says softly \"Arms up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your arms slightly, as she gently lifts your top up and over your head causing your arms up further as well, tossing your top onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe presses her chest against yours once more as she unhooks your bra and toss that onto the bed, your hands reflexively cover your breasts, earning a small but warm smile from Tanya \"Still shy, you'll get over that quickly here\" She gives a small laugh, before her warm smile returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to help with your pants?\" she asks, when you don't reply, she starts to unbutton them, causing you to squirm a little \"Its ok, we'll be seeing each other like this quite a lot\" She says, giving you a pat on the check as she lets them drop to the floor \"Foot up\" she says indicating your right foot, as you lift your foot she moves the pants out from under your foot, she merely points to your left and you comply again, before your pants are thrown onto the bed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe points to your underwear, your hands shoot to your crotch to protect it, before realising you have uncovered your chest, your arm shoots back up to cover yourself, as you shake your head, \"Ok, Ok, say no more\" She says picking up your nightie \"Since your new she likely won't be annoyed, but shes going to tell you to have them off in the future\" this time you don't need to be asked as you lift your hands up so she can help you into your nightie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, she gives you an affection pat on the head and plonks down on her bed, you can't help but blush a bit as that causes her nightie to give you more of a view than is 'lady like', you lower yourself much more gently onto your own bed, causing the waterproof mattress to crinkle beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't snore or have any other bad habits, do you, need some kind of secret I can tease you about since you know mine?\" Tanya asks, with a playful grin as she glances at her own crotch, clearly trying to release some of the tension in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can answer, there is a knock at the door \"Girls time for bed\" you recognise the voice as Ms Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanya gets up and unlocks the door, before returning to her bed, allowing Ms Williams to enter with a small cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Danielle I hope Tanya and the girls have been nice and shown you around\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Tanya Both nod, with Tanya saying that they have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Williams noticing your embarrassment and assuming its about needing diapers \"Don't you worry everyone here is in diapers at night, some even during the day, no need to be embarrassed, nobody will tease you here, and if someone outside of our dorm gives you any trouble you come to me, once I'm through with them they won't be making fun of anyone needing diapers ever again\" she says shifting between warm and nurturing too fierce and protective and back again, ultimately leaving a caring motherly smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching to her cart and pulling out a diaper that she lays on Tanyas bed \"Now I wasn't able to get the specifics from your parents about your needs\" she asks turning to face you \"...Normally thats done before the child is left at the school...\" she says with an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the feeling that this happens all to often with how she says it, which gives you an idea if you can't just come out and say that you don't need diapers, if what Tanya says is true, than perhaps you can down play it or maybe it is better to just come straight out that you don't need them perhaps Tanya was underestimating Ms Williams, she seems fairly understanding and kind at least of what you have seen of her so far...although the way she talked about disciplining those that made fun of bed wetters...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...your train of thought goes another path as you notice Tanya on the other bed, they did say they tend to avoid others so as to not be teased, the thought of leaving the dorm and not being as close pains you in a way you don't fully understand...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle? Normal? Light? Heavy?...Number 2's? Day Time? Help me fill in some of the blanks here if you could?\" she asks holding up a rather thick diaper, you notice Tanya's gaze on you as well as you answer.</span></div></div>",

One is baby blue, the other is pink. The pink one is simpler. It has a full-length skirt, puffy selves and a ribbon tied in a large bow around the waist. The blue one is more childish.

The urinal had a large poop in it. Wet toilet paper was flung all over the walls, there were multiple smashed glass bottles. There was even a baby changing take that was completely filthy with stains all over it. There was even a used baby diaper left on the floor filled with several day old mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaged nearly vomited but you were actually pretty badly in need of a pee and poop, so decided to make your way over to the toilet itself which was filed almost blocked with poop, pee and toilet paper. You couldn\u2019t stand it almost physical sick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pulled down you panties and quickly tried to push out your business as fast as possible and just think about your happy place. It only took a few moments to be done but to your horror there was absolutely no toilet paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCrap you thought. This is going to leave a mark\u201d you thought looking down on your white unicorn panties disapointed and a little embarrassed they might have a poop stain soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever if you made it home in time they will be fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou emerge form the bathroom not wanting to go near the disgusting sink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKate, I don\u2019t feel so good can we head back.\u201d You ask not wanting to admit you needed to get home to wipe your butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I was going to say the same thing, I need to go pretty bad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that you head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut can Kate hold her bowels for the 40 minuets Walk back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kate however looked extremely uncomfortable but once you got about half way there you were pretty sure Kate was going to make it home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about Five minutes away from Kate\u2019s house and along the same street when you realized you shoe laces were untined and with a little embarrassment asked Kate \u201cCan you do my shoe laces please?\u201d <br>\r\nAs you had allways found it hard to lean how. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked pretty stressed with a red face and anxious facial expression she said \u201cYeah sure let\u2019s do it quick though.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plonked yourself down on the high curb and lifted your leg who had bent down on one knee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate did the laces pretty effectively and very quickly and soon enough you were standing up. As you did so however you smelt something very similar to the putrid toilets earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tuned to see your cousin now in complete tears as you realized the source of the foul smell was her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren\u2019t quite sure what to say. In fact you, yourself were a little taken back by the fact a 15 year old had just messed her pants in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just an accident Kate. I had one the other day. Let\u2019s get home and your mom will help you get some clean pants and panties.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis only made Kate cry out more as you realized what Kate had told you earlier but her not so recent accident as you also remembered you aunties \u2018two strikes them diapers rule\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. It\u2019ll be okay, it\u2019s not a big deal I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t be in diapers for that long.\u201d You said proceeding to hug your older cousin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you held hands as you walked home, Kate in obvious disgust and discomfort having to walk with what she had in her panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery close to the house you saw a mother and child who was about Sarah\u2019s age stop next to you at a Zebra crossing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked to the air with a disgusted look on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJessie have you gone poopy in your undies sweetie?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Kate feel awful as the mother pulled up her daughter skirt attempting to check for an accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Kate obviously embarrassed as her now dry face burned a crimson red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother finished her check and looked at Kate with a very concerned look making Kate feel even worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you made your way home at about Severn o clock with auntie welcoming you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh hey girls how was your...\u201d she looked very concerned at both of us. \u201cHas one of you went number two in their panties?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate ducked her head in shame as you shake your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSarah can you get mommy the diapers at the bottom of Kate\u2019s wardrobe.\u201d Miss Smith shouted at her daughter who had returned to playing in the front room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHas Danielle had another accident mommy.\u201d The curious girl asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop being nosy Sarah.\u201d She said to her daughter. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Danielle sweetie I\u2019ll be with you in a minute but I\u2019ve got some business to atend to first... help yourself to a sandwich.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were a pretty symptrtheic to Sarah feeling really bad that maybe your holdups led to her accident, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a cheese sandwich and went to se Sarah in the living room,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little curious about what Kate\u2019s punishment was you decided to ask her sister. \u201cSarah what actually happens when you get put back in diapers.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLast time I was back in them the bathroom was off limits for 3 days and for the rest of the week It\u2019s similar to potty training with limited use of a potty or toilet where we make our way form diapers to pull-ups and back to panties.\u201d She said with a frown on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s very embarrassing.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right. This mad you feel really bad for Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after finishing your sandwich you headed to the bathroom to wipe up form earlier realizing there was now a pretty big brown stain on your panties, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew since you only packed for the weekend you were out of clean panties so went to Kate\u2019s room to ask Miss Smith for some of Kate\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knocked on the door, knowing Kate was being changed in there you didn\u2019t want to just walk in. Miss Smith opened up and looked back at you with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m out of clean underwear, can I use some of Kate\u2019s?\u201d You ask shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss Smith looked concerned \u201cWhy\u2019d you need them sweetie? Have you had an accident again?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-n-no!\u201d You say a little off guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome In sweetheart\u201d she sad a little confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk in you see Kate spread out on the bed lying on a un-tapped diaper. But what shocks you more is your aunty swiftly pulling down your jeans to reveal your brown stained undies in front of Kate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat to me looks like you\u2019ve messed yourself too Danielle.\u201d Your auntie said disappointedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment ... if you say you did Mess yourself you could help Kate out and show she\u2019s not the only one in diapers. But was it really worth the risk? Maybe you should just explain yourself, she\u2019d understand, right?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was wet to the touch and had a very clear aroma of urine.

Only one more day dry and I get big girls panties.

Before your aunt pulls it back and insects the backside of the goodnite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFalse alarm sweetie, but I can see why you would think that. You certainly did a number on that last night Danielle, how much did you drink?\u201d Auntie Jessica says as she pulls your PJs back into place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are so embarrassed you want to cry. At least you didn\u2019t actually go number two in your goodnite and you were pretty sure you never would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour auntie stokes your head and hands you a few crayons and your bed wetting chart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo get some breakfast and fill in your chart and I\u2019ll take you upstairs to get changed.\u201d She says giving you a reassuring kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCh- change me?\u201d You sayBlissfully unaware of what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh i forgot to tell you another one of our rules when it comes to bedwetting, if you have an accident in a goonite or diaper then I have to change you, it\u2019s not a punishment it\u2019s just to make sure you are cleaned properly so you don\u2019t spread germs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u201d you say still somewhat fully aware of what she meant do to it being so early in the morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s five minutes later while finishing of your rain cloud and toast with butter that your eyes widen and you understand that you\u2019re about to have your first diaper change in a decade. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You think. I can\u2019t have a diaper change I\u2019m 13. I\u2019m a high schooler I can\u2019t have a diaper change! I understand that some kids my age still wet the bed, I mean they wouldn\u2019t make goodnites in my size otherwise... but diaper changes!? No one over the age of two has they\u2019re diaper changed. This can\u2019t be happening. I\u2019m, i\u2019m Not a baby!\u201d Tears begins to form on your cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s at this moment when you auntie walks in and places two lunch boxes on the table and leaves one in her left hand and extends  her right hand to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand up you are once again reminded of the soaked pull up strapped around your waist and feel like even more if a baby as your tears begin to pour down your face as you waddle up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one look at your pathetic state your aunt knows what\u2019s wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ashamed sweetheart you Wet the bed and there\u2019s Nothing wrong about that. You saw me changing Kate last night, it\u2019s what happens when we have accidents, we need to make sure we\u2019re clean and comfortable and that\u2019s what I\u2019m hear for that sweetie, not to embarrass you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made you feel a little better but you were still distraught. You were once again taken to Sarah\u2019s bedroom and directed to lie down on your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss smith then soothes you by stroking your hair and reassuring you with a \u201cnothing to be embatesed about\u201d said in a soothing voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour PJs are once again removed by your aunt revealing a very wet buterfly goodnite, you close your eyes as your feel your aunt carefully undo each of the straps as you feel the soggy pull up being removed from your waist, instantly making you feel a cold rush into the area. Your aunt then walks over to Kate\u2019s closet and grabs a pack of wipes before returning and swiftly wiping you clean or your own pee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce finished she takes the wipe and puts them inside the goodnite before wrapping it up into a very saturated ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost done sweetie, wasn\u2019t so bad was it?\u201d She says as you continue to blush extremely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I want you to answer my question responsibly, because you had an accident when we were out the other day I\u2019m worried this could happen again today. So do you want to wear a goodnite or are you confident you can keep your pants dry? I\u2019m only asking because I don\u2019t want you to embarrass yourself by peeing yourself in front of Sarah\u2019s entire class. If you choose to wear th pull ups only me and your teacher will know. No need to tell the girls. So what will it be?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t need to wear protection in the daytime.\u201d You say quietly frankly being embarrassed that the question was being asked at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay sweetheart, that\u2019s fine I just suggested it because I didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen.\u201d Says your aunt with a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019ll just go fetch you some of the chlothes your Mom dropped of late last night.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt walks out the room leaving you still lying down with an exposed lower half but returns only two minutes later carrying what looked like two sets of chlothing and puts some jeans, panties, socks and a tee shirt on the bed beside you for you to change into. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to get dressed but glance over at your auntie who had pulled a small, bright pink bag out of the closet the bag was decorated with very childish pictures of ponies and was clearly meant for someone much younger then yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hope it was for Sarah but that wish gets immediately shattered when you see your aunt placing your lunch and some one of your skirts into the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confuses you and you quizikly ask \u201cWhat\u2019s the extra skirt and skirt for?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt stops packing the childish bag and looks up at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know how Kindergarteners and preschoolers are, they could spill something make a mess of their clothes. It\u2019s just school policy for students to have a change with them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s fair enough\u201d you say pretty content with the reasoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it became immediately apparent the skirt wasn\u2019t just for spillages when you aunt placed one final item into the rucksack, a pink goodnite with a cartoon owl printed on it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh- why are you packing that!?\u201d You say in a distraught tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt looks back at you. \u201cThe school wants the kids to wear something... a little more protective if they have a bit of a potty mishap. Like I said it\u2019s policy, I didn\u2019t make up the rules. Sarah has a pull up in her bag too but I thought you\u2019d rather one of Kate\u2019s goodnites,\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut- but you said I didn\u2019t have to wear one.\u201d  You whimper <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunt walks over and gives you a hug \u201cOh honey, you worry about everything. You only need to wear them if you had an accident and you told me that wasn\u2019t likely to happen.\u201d She let go but bent down on one knee and confined to make direct eye contact with you. \u201cI know your nervous about everything today sweetie, going back to kindergarten, having an accident last night and being away from your parents can\u2019t be easy. You must feel that you are being treated like a toddler but just remember none of this is your fault, okay? I know going back to Kindergarten must feel weird but it\u2019s onky for this week and I bet the time will fly bye, okay sweetheart? Let\u2019s get downstairs and get the other girls ready before we end up being late.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour aunts words were reassuring and definitely made you feel better but there was something about packing spare chlothes that hit close to home. Even at 13 your mom still took spare pants and underwear anywhere reasonably far from home. She\u2019d been doing it your entire life and was really embarrassing. In fact one of the most embarrassing moments of life was last year at euro Disney when you actually needed a change after a bad experience with a full baldder on ten toy story ride which was only seconded in terms of sheer embarrassment by the \u2018toys r us incident\u2019 a year earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your pony backpack and made your way downstairs with your aunt, thankful that you no longer had a wet pull up was no longer sagging down your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go sit in the living room and watch cartoons for twenty minutes or so while your cousins got changed out if they\u2019re pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon everyone\u2019s ready and and your aunt shouts through \u201cDaniele, it\u2019s time to go we\u2019re going to be late!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock of the TV and realize that you have a noticeable need to pee after not going to the bathroom for your morning pee this morning. After this weekend you really didn\u2019t want to take chances when it came to the toilet but you would also feel real bad about making everyone late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When Sarah is wearing diapers she's not allowed to take them off. That includes to use the toilet. That's what diapers are for. You will have the same conditions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to use the diapers?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you can hold on for a day and a half.\" She say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the other option?\" You ask.

You would also not be allowed to dress, feed or bathe yourself. You would have constant supervision.\"</span></div></div>",

It's a girly romantic comedy, one of your favourites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen dinner is finished Felicity tells her friends. \"Excuse me for a minute. I have to get my little sister ready for bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Sarah crossess her arms again. \"I'm not wearing diapers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Felicity asks her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because Danielle doesn't need to wear diapers.\" She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would Danielle need to wear diapers?\" Samantha asks, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She peed her pants yesterday.\" Felicity explains, making you turn red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then.\" Asheigh says. \"It's only fair that we put Danielle in diapers too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity laughs. \"Good idea. We don't want to clean up any accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get the impression that she's not just teasing.</span></div></div>",

You escape her grasp but as you close your door she stops it with her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends are close behind and with the weight of all three they easily force your door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity runs off yelling. \"Make sure he stays in the room.\" and a little while later returns carying a diaper and a camera. \"Hold him on the bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer friends pin you to your bed and Felicity removes your shoes and socks. Then she unbuttons your jeans and pulls them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say goodbye to your big girl panties, oh wait these aren't big girls panties.\" Felicity teases. This must of been the worst day to wear your Barbie Panties, \"These look like little girls panties.\" While pulling your underwear off. Then to her friends. \"Lift her legs.\" Samatha does so as Felicity unfolds the diaper and positions it under your bottom. Then Samantha lowers you onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelicity pulls the front of the diaper up firmly between your legs and fastens the tapes. \"There, now we're safe from any more accidents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picks up the camera and takes a few photos. \"If you take your diaper off, or you tell Mom what we did I'll make sure everyone at school sees these photos. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Let her up.\" Felicity says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leave the room as your left in just a diaper, quickly Danielle we're going to have some fun</span></div></div>",

It is time for her to start high school but there is only a primary school nearby. She has a few options, what she doesn't know is that whatever she chooses she will end up in diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are adding to this story please keep it in the style of a \"choose your own adventure\" type book. That is keep the point of view 2nd person (The main character of the story (Danielle) is refered to as \"You\" - the reader) and limit options to choices Danielle can make, not events outside her control. Eg \"Which door will you open? 1) The red door 2) The green door\" is good but \"What do you find behind the red door? 1) An over-sized nursery 2) The girls' locker room.\" is not.</td>",
