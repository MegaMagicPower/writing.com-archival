The girl was glad that things had returned to normal after Rikka's mother returned, however Tooka opted to remain in Japan, saying that it was more important to fix family relations before she pursue other opportunities.  The only thing the girl hated was that Rikka had formed a special 'contract' with Yuuta, which meant that she was spending much more time with him and less with her. She was losing valuable training time too!  Finally reach the 'Summer of Far East Magic Nap Club' doors, slide the door open with a loud bang, causing the two occupants to flinch and separate from each other. Dekomori was highly naive so she failed to see that Yuuta and Rikka were having an 'intimate' moment. Running up to the girl with black hair and an eyepatch over her right eye, she gave her a big hug, a large toothy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, master! Guess what!?\" she exclaimed, looking up at the one she considered her master. With a gasp, Rikka listened intensely to what her friend had to say. Perhaps she held knowledge on a new Even Horizon?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me Dekomori! Or do you have grave news on what the Organization is planning to do?\" Chuckling at their actions, Yuuta sat back, giving the pair their space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that, but we're gaining a new ally! My dear brother is returning from lands unseen with great knowledge about the world itself!\" By lands unseen, she simply meant that her brother was returning home from college. The young man had studied abroad for his degree and was now returning home. He would always indulge Dekomori in her little fantasies and would always play along. After all, its important to take it easy every now and then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well then I eagerly await his return. Have you informed him of our current situation with the Organization?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've told him everything. He's coming back this Friday, so he'll be able to help us quite soon.\" gushed the blonde girl, happy that she would be able to see her brother after so long. And she wouldn't hesitate to introduce him to Rikka's older sister... </span></div></div>",

It\u2019s been over five years!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuuta opted to sit by and watch as Sanae paced back forth, or skipped back and forth within the confines of her living room. The blonde opted to invite the fellow club members, including for some odd reason Nibutani as well. Sanae wanted to \u201cshow the Fake-Mori Summer what she was dealing with\u201d. The class rep merely rolled her eyes and wanted to get away from Drama Club scouts any way possible, and thankfully Sanae\u2019s home proved to be a welcome place. For some odd reason, the scouts knew where she lived, and it creeped her out a little, and the brown haired teen agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your brother like?\u201d Asked Yuuta, head on his palm. The twin-tailed girl turned, smile threatening to split her face in two as she took her twin tails and spun them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy older brother was something of a mentor before I met the warm embrace of my Master,\u201d Sanae said matter-of-fact. \u201cWhen I found the Mabinogion I learned it\u2019s secrets alongside him!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinka, who was drinking from a water bottle, nearly choked and turned on the blonde, eyes wide and color drained from her face. \u201cHe what!?

Now Yuuta turned towards her with quirked eye.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA car is coming.\u201d Said Rikka, as she was sitting by the couch closest to the door. Sanae perked up and got into a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Asked Shinka with narrowed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanae let loose a deep breath, as if a cat ready to pounce\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s on all fours\u2026\u201d Shinka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike an Olympic Sprinter\u2026\u201d Finished Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSanae focused her gaze on the door\u2026</span></div></div>",

A figure appeared from the door, a tall young man with blonde hair and hazel eyes with a playful smirk on his face. He knew what was coming, so he readied his body into a stance, his legs bent and arms folded. Waiting until the girl was in range, he caught her, spun her around three times, placed her on the floor and hugged her tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a while sister hasn't it?\" asked the young man, gently rubbing her head. Smiling, she let out a giggle as she let herself be petted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it has big bro. Let me introduce you to the fellow club members.\" she said as they parted their embrace. Turning around she pointed to each and every member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is my master Rikka and her faithful servant, the Dark Flame Master. Next to them is Kumin, our sleeping maiden. And finally we have the Fake-Mori-Summer, the one I've told you so much about.\"  Eying the group, they seemed to be a nice bunch of kids. Growing up, Sanae never had close friends. Sure she was popular due to how cute she was and her naive personality, but that created a barrier of sorts between her and other people. He knew that this was also the reason that she adopted her 'chuuni' personality and why he would humor her from time to time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's always good to meet a fellow warrior in the crusade against the Organization.\" said Rikka as she ran up and shook his hand. Yuuta walked up and did the same. He had heard about the pair from his sister many times, and they looked quite cute together. Nibutani simply brooded in the corner, deciding not to speak up about the whole misunderstanding about her identity in front of Sanae's brother. 'I'll get her later on. How dare she slander me in such a way!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a pleasure to meet you all. Now, since I believe class is over for you all, may I treat you all to dinner? It'd be a great way of getting to know all of you and to catch up with my darling sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you haven't told us your name yet.\" said Yuuta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right, well its...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I never got to see while I was in the States.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't call me that...\" Yuuta sighed. \"It's Togashi Yuuta...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Togashi Yuuta huh...\" Akihiko said putting a finger to his lips. \"Well, it's always nice to see my sister has been making both girl and guy friends.

When your sister described me and Rikka's relation as master and servant, it actually means we're dating. She just hasn't really picked up on that yet.\" explained Yuuta, which caused the brother's temperament to ease up. Looking at the three girls who were squabbling with one another, he noticed a few things. First, they seemed to be a bunch of good friends, and second, it looked like his sister was 'growing' because of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, it was love at first sight?\" The younger teen's face lit into a slight flush. He had to admit, ever since that evening where she came down to his room, he had always been interested in the eccentric girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't help that, its just one of those things really.\" Before he could add in on his own input gathered from experience, Dekomori ran up to her brother, her mouth chatting up a fierce storm. Placing a firm hand on her shoulders, he gently shook her from her frantic speaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, remember what I said about overusing ancient verses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, its just that I want you to come to Rikka's apartment to meet her older sister.

Its never proper to intrude after all.\"  His sister tended to overlook the finer details in things, but general respect is always important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, she even thought of the idea herself. We can take everyone in the car can't we?\" Patting her head, the girl went to go tell the others of the news. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has she always been like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you have no idea.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The trip itself to the apartment complex was quite rapid and there were no problems along the way. Rikka, Nibutani and Cumin were quite excited by the idea of traveling in such a fancy car, Nibutani could tell that she had to be much more friendly with the ever bratty Dekomori. The aforementioned blonde sister was quite hyper and could not wait to introduce her brother to Rikka's sister. As soon as the car reached Yuuta's and Rikka's home, Dekomori bolted from the car, dragging along her dear older brother. The rest followed and soon after, they were at Rikka's doorstep. Looking around quickly, Rikka walked up to her door and pressed some buttons on a calculator she had taped to the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I don't sense anyone around so I think its safe!\" shouted the blonde as she rushed over to her master. Yuuta sighed at the sight, believing that his girlfriend would have toned down her 'special nature' at home. Her brother was quite amused and decided to play around a bit. Walking up to the calculator, he feigned excitement at such a device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dekomori, you never told me that your master had access to the 'The Lock!' Such a device was only heard in legends. Pray tell, where did you come across such a wonderful treasure?\" asked Akihiko with a frantic tone. Rikka let out a 'sinister laugh' as she covered her face with her dainty hand. Dekomori joined her quite quickly while the Nibutani and Yuuta looked on in the sidelines trying to forget the times they had done such embarrassing gestures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I ventured into the Everblight Hollow just to retrieve it after battling countless demons. It was worth the risk as the Trillion Digit code is nigh impossible to crack!\" Dekomori swooned as such bragging and Akihiko seemed to be enjoying himself as well. \"Now everyone stand back as I cause a time disruption in order to input the password.\" said Rikka as she turned back to her door and pressed random numbers on the calculator. A few seconds later, the girl made a 'whooshing' sound with her mouth and put her key inside the door. With a 'pan' sound, she opened the door and motioned every one to come inside.  Rikka then told everyone to gather in the living room while she went into the kitchen. There, the one eyed girl found her older sister, Touka at the counter, dicing up some veggies. Touka was a few inches taller than Rikka and had long flowing black hair compared to Rikka's shorter length. The girl also dressed quite comfortably at home, wearing a simple black t shirt, some jeans and a red choker around her neck. Another noteworthy detail about the older woman was that she had bright red eyes compared, a strange coloration in modern society. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"High Priestess, I have returned with guests, including my servant's older brother. He wishes to have an audience with you. Worry not, he does not seem to be under the influence of the Organization.\" explained Rikka. Touka understood her sister's strange words and nodded. It was always nice to she Rikka with friends no matter how weird they turned out to be. </span></div></div>",

She had been thankful for Yuuta as he helped her sister in so many ways that she could not. She also found the pair together highly cute, but she would never mention such a thing, after all, she had her image to maintain. There was one individual that she did not recognize, and that was who she assumed was Dekomori's older brother. He looked to be older than all of the others and she guessed he was already out of high school. His hair color matched his sister's and his eyes were particularly clear. Likewise, Akihiko got a good look and Touka and something clicked in his mind that he shouldn't do his chuuni stunt when greeting her, a sort of self preservation mechanism he guessed. The young man stood up and offered his hand to Touka as a friendly gesture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, the name's Akihiko. It's nice to finally meet you, I've heard a lot of things about you from my dear little sister.\" Touka took his hand and shook, taking in his words as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and what things did you learn?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah not too worry, only things that someone would know within five minutes of meeting you, like your hair color or the fact that you're a chef.\" answered the young man honestly. He wasn't the type to dig information from others as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your word on that then. Everyone, since I wasn't expecting a large crowd, dinner will be ready in a few hours, is everyone fine with that?\" The group nodded, not wanting to offend anyone making a free meal, especially considering that the someone was Touka. As she left, Akihiko let out a breath, he had been slightly nervous in her presence. Dekomori bounced right up to him, her eyes gleaming because of their first meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think? She's incredibly cool right?\" said his sister in an excited tone. Akihiko nodded, not bothering to mention how she caused a bit of fear in him. Yuuta looked towards Rikka and saw that she had a rather excited expression as well.  Even Rikka, the ever oblivious chuuni could tell that her sister had a lack of interactions with those her own age, due to taking care of her so often. Now that she had Yuuta to depend on, Rikka wanted her sister to 'branch' out a bit and enjoy herself more often. She could tell that this was going to be a good thing for her. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dinner itself was a rather simple affair. Touka served a simple vegetable stew with breadsticks and wine for herself and Akihiko. Everyone chatted during the meal, discussions stemming from simple school talks to the fantasy realms that Rikka and Dekomori adored. Touka herslef kept quiet like usual, feeling no need to join in the conversation unless someone called out to her.  She was often like this, ever the quiet 'queen' with few willing to speak to her. Even at her work at the restaurant, few fellow employees talked to her, unless there was an emergency. As the meal continued, Akihiko finally noticed how Touka was silent, having been busy speaking to his energetic younger sister. As he was sitting next to the young woman, it would be easy to strike a conversation with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Touka, what kind of restaurant do you work at? Rikka here tells me that you're quite the talented chef and judging by this meal, I'd have to agree highly.\" said the young man, a wide grin on his face. She looked at him with her default expressionless face, clearly not interested in the topic at hand. Work was work to her and she greatly preferred cooking at home where she could see others enjoying her food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well its an Italian Restaurant and considered a high class eatery which is why I never take Rikka there. Most of our customers are people with money and many of them are quite obnoxious.\" calmly explained the young woman, her tone as bland as ever. Akihiko winced at her less than kind explanation but simply rolled with it. He began to make small talk with her, bringing in his own background, his current work plans and a bit more personal things about himself. Yuuta would look at the pair every now and then, finding it surprising that Rikka's sister was getting along with someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuuta?\" Looking towards his left, he saw that Rikka was staring right at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, what is it Rikka?\" The black haired girl motioned for him to move his head closer and she gently whispered into his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The High Priestess is quite content. We should ask for mystic confections before her spirit energy fluctuates too much for our powers to handle.\" From her strange words, Yuuta assumed that Rikka wanted to ask for dessert, having finished the hearty meal. Looking around the table, everyone was practically finished with their meals, so the request wasn't unreasonable. Rikka continued to stare at him, her eyes practically pleading him to ask for the sweets. Letting out a sigh, he decided to comply with his quirky girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um Touka, it seems that everyone is finished eating. Did you happen to prepare dessert as well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I didn't expect this many people for dinner, but I have a few cakes in the refrigerator from work. Let me clear the table first.\" responded the older woman, standing and started to gather the bowls and utensils. Akihiko stood up as well, helping her with the table. As they left for the kitchen, Rikka poked Yuuta's shoulder, a happy smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well Dark Flame Master, this pleases me.\" With his own smile, he gently patted her on the head. Next to Nibutani, Dekomori had a smirk on her face, so far her plan was going very smoothly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Soon, my almighty brother will have the High Priestess under his thumb.' thought the pigtailed girl, a clear awkward grin on her face.</span></div></div>",

Fresh Ice-Cream Cake on the house!\u201d Akihiko exclaimed as the blond came walking into the kitchen with two circular plates in both hands, and on top of each was a vanilla-frosting cake with the icing looking incredibly decorative. Dekomori and Rikka let out sounds of awe while Nibutani and Yuuta looked impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cItalian places offer Ice-Cream Cake?\u201d Asked Yuuta as Touka entered the kitchen behind Akihiko carrying one cake. The dark haired beauty shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe owner likes it, so he placed it on the menu in case people were too confused or weirded out by the way too foreign cuisine. I mean, we have some Italian desserts, but we also have some simple ones too. Now, I have Chocolate-ice cream, Vanilla, and Strawberry. Who wants what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll go Strawberry,\u201d Nibutani raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVanilla-desu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want the one what oozes the powerful of the dark and murky Abyss,\u201d Rikka posed, looking up at Akihiko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate right?\u201d He turned towards Yuuta with a smile on his face. The younger male rolled his eyes and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChocolate. I\u2019ll have the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two adults set the cakes down and sat down at the table once more, Akihiko reaching over with a cake-knife and cutting some slices and putting them on each of the occupant\u2019s plates. He handed out spoons and the Dekomori and Rikka cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cItadakimasu!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were far more subdued. \u201cItadakmisu.\u201d And they began to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Akihiko turned towards Touka. \u201cGot any other family or is it just you and Rikka?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have a mother and my grandparents are still alive,\u201d Touka responded emotionlessly.<br>\r\nThe sound of someone eating like a woman possessed made the two of them look away from each other and at the sound\u2019s source. And there was Rikka, who already finished her slice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I have the Cake-Sword of Granheit? Cardinal?\u201d Touka looked at Akihiko with a twitch in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCardinal?\u201d He leaned in to whisper in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI play along with my sister who is a Chuuni.\u201d He said into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSanae?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouka sighed. \u201cHonestly, I understand Rikka and Sanae is young. But you\u2019re a college grad. You're too old to be acting like a Chuuni.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I have fun and you can\u2019t stop me.\u201d He smiled ear to ear as he gave Rikka another slice of chocolate cake, to which she began to eat fast again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCareful Rikka,\u201d Yuuta said, not even halfway done with his slice. \u201cOr else you\u2019ll get-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwwwwie~!\u201d She gripped her head. \u201cMy head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrain freeze\u2026\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dessert continued on and on until all the cakes were depleted and the girls would attain very rigid middle for all of their sweet troubles. Rikka moaned in discomfort as she leaned against Yuuta, the teen simply grinning at how cute she was. One hand wrapped around her currently stuffed belly, it certainly did feel quite nice. Dekomori was leaning against the equally stuffed Nibutani, the two forming a sort of competition with each other to see who could eat the most cake. There didn't seem to be a winner as both of them were near the point towards passing out. With Touka, it seemed that she did eat a bit more than she usually did, but she wasn't in any discomfort or anything like that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, it looks like the desserts were a hit.\" said Akihiko as he witnessed the damage done around him. Touka gave out a small giggle, an action that betrayed her usual stoic personality. Yuuta noticed this small event, finding it quite interesting. Writing it down as a mental note, perhaps it could be useful for when Touka would try to blackmail him once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Yuuta, my mana reserves are overflowing. Please aid me...\" moaned Rikka. As Yuuta was fluent in 'chuuni' and Rika's actions, he knew that she meant that her stomach was too full and that he needed to rub it. Happily doing the favor, he reached his arm over and began to rub her belly, earning him a tired smile from her. Akihiko witnessed the rather cute scene and a few fond memories replayed in his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, it seems like those two are pretty close.\" commented Akihiko. Looking at him, the sincere smile on his face reminded her of something as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, makes me want to puke at how 'lovey dovey' their relationship is. Though I'm thankful for all he's done for her.\" she said, recalling the difficult times she's had with her younger sister in the past. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do you mean?\" he asked, curious to what Touka's past contained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, perhaps it's a story for another day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoh, that means that you'd like to meet again sometime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I wouldn't be adverse to the idea. After all, our younger siblings do get along.\" said Touka with a smirk. After about another half hour of small talk and resting from the meal, Touka and Akihiko cleared off the table and went to go wash the dishes. Finally feeling better, Dekomori regained her senses just enough to see her brother and the priestess walked away chatting it up. With a smirk, she quickly fixed her position away from 'fake' Mori Summer who was still feeling stuffed from the cakes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hehehe, only a matter of time before the priestess and Master will be tied into my family.' </span></div></div>",
