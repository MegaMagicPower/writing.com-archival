When your eye adjusts, you immidiately make out Liz, looking out the window. She's dressed in blue jeans, red tank top and thongs. From the looks of her blonde hair, she's just had a shower. \"Oh, Morning Brother\" Liz greets with a smile. \"Hey, morning,\" you reply, \"What are you doing ?\". \"You see, I have a confession to make.\" Liz says. \"Oh?\" you ask, with a tone of curiosity. \"Yep. It's just that, starting today, I'm legally allowed to tell people who I am, and use my power freely\" Liz mutters. \"Huh? Come again?\" You ask her. \"Ok, here goes nothing... Mike, I'm a Witch! I have been for the last 8 years and turning 16, I'm allowed to use Witchery anywhere and anytime I want!\" Liz almost shouts. \"Umm, you weren't kidding about taking drugs at the boarding school, were you?\" You ask with a tone of teasing. \"Grrr, I knew you wouldn't understand! Not many would anyway! Well, get dressed and come down, we are going to cut the cake. Actually, don't bother dressing, you won't be needing it.\" Liz says with a frustrated face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When you get out of your pajamas and get down to the kitchen table, you see your parents sobbing. \"What's wrong? Shoudn't we be celebrating?\" You ask. \"And celebrating we shall do, Mike,\" Liz adds, \"Make a wish Mike, I already made mine\". \"Hmm okay.\" You say. After your wish, you say \"Let's skip the song, it's getting old now. Ready Liz? Three, Two, One!\" and you blow with all your might as your senses blow up in series of blinding light, loud noises and odd smell and taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n When it all stops, while you are still blinded and unable to move, you hear as Liz says \"Happy Birthday Mike. As I promised to you long time ago, now that we are 16, we will be forever together! Me as your mistress and you as my...\"</span></div></div>",

When you still refuse to look at her luscious body, she gets angry. Grasping you firmly in both hands, she rams you deep into her vagina. You close your eyes, and despite yourself you get a boner. Liz feels it, an laughs. \"Looks like someone is enjoying himself!\" and with more demented giggling grinds you around. Her cunt is secreting juices, and is close to orgasm. Finally, she cums and sends her fluids flying across the room. As she does this, a shriek of pleasure rents the air almost deafening you. Liz is gasping \"The bonding...is almost...complete...\" when your girlfriend comes barging through the door. Jasmyn, Darker-haired, olive skinned, generously gifted in the bust, a ghetto ass, and acts really sweet. You knew this belied a personality that was keenly smart, confronational, and not one to ignore an insult. You knew from experience when a couple of guys on a street-corner had tried to grab her. You had stood up to them, but she just knocked a few of one of the creep's teeth out and broke all the fingers on the other guy's hand that had touched her. On this occasion, Jasmyn had a leather jacket, tight jeans, and dark boots. Her green eyes blazed in fury, and her hair flew in a cloud like a flock of angry hawks.<br>\r\n      \"You sick bitch, get him outta there! I don't care if you're a witch...\"</span></div></div>",

So you don't want to be my little pet, bro?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Liz's paralysis spell was beginning to wear off. You still couldn't move your body from the neck down, but you were able to move your head now. This meant that you were also able to talk, and you immediately yelled at your sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I don't want to be your pet, Liz! Why the heck would I want to be reduced to a pet by my own sister?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Liz's face shifted to a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But bro, you agreed to it! Remember when we were just 10 years old, and I said that we would be together forever once we turned 16? You nodded and accepted it, you never said no! This is what I was talking about back then! I'm going to shrink you now, and we'll always be together from this day forward... And I'm not gonna let you take back your promise now that I'm so close to having you all to myself, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even respond, Liz pulled out a wand and began chanting something in a language you didn't understand. The tip of her wand began to glow, and what appeared to be a magic circle started to glow around you as well. Soon your body began to diminish in size, and your twin sister simply smiled at you as she observed your body shrinking ever further. Soon the glowing magic circle faded away, and your shrinking ceased at the pitiful size of three inches tall. By now the paralysis spell had completely worn off, but it didn't even matter anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even giving you a chance to get to your feet, Liz reached out and pinned your tiny body down using only her index finger. You struggled as hard as you could, but your enormous sister's single finger was easily enough to overpower you given your current stature. She simply giggled playfully as you struggled against her without any real hope of escaping. Liz knew that soon you would exhaust all of your energy with these futile struggles, and then you would have no choice but to submit to her wishes. She was right, as you soon ran out of strength. By now, you were panting in exhaustion while your massive twin sister simply gave you a cute smile from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So <i>little</i> bro, are you done playing around yet? I'm sorry if you don't like this, but the thing is... I really love you, bro. I don't ever want to be separated from you again, and this will let us be together forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Liz, if you really do care about me, then why would you want to make me suffer by forcing me be your pet like some kind of animal?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me little bro, I don't want you to suffer. That's the last thing I would ever want to happen. If you don't want to be my pet, then there are still two other options...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that you were completely at your sister's mercy, you let out a sigh and decided to have her tell you your other options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sis, what else is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting her finger off of you and allowing you to stand up again, your sister begins to speak. You knew that it was pointless to try and run away, as you were too exhausted to get very far, and at your size Liz could catch you again with minimal effort anyway. So, you just stand there and listen to what your giantess sister is saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well bro, you already know by now that I'm a witch... And if you've ever read any books about witches and wizards, you should know that we each need to form a contract with a familiar. Usually a familiar is an animal like a cat or an owl, but that isn't a hard-set rule. As long as it's a living being, it qualifies. So, if you want to, I could form my contract with you and make you my familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, and what would that involve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a simple deal, really. The familiar is basically just an assistant to a witch or a wizard. You'd go wherever I went and help me out whenever I needed you to. In return for their help, a familiar is granted a small portion of their master's magical power. Usually just enough to allow an animal to talk, but I'd be willing to give you enough to let you fly and even cast some basic spells on your own. The only drawback to this deal is that the contract binds the familiar to the life force of their master. While this would make you  immortal under normal circumstances, the issue is that if I were to die, you would too. The ritual is a simple exchange of spiritual energies, which is accomplished via... A kiss on the lips.\" Liz blushed slightly as she said the last sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about that offer for a bit. Being able to fly and cast magic seemed like a pretty sweet deal, even if you did have to spend the rest of your life at 3 inches tall, but the last part worried you a bit. You weren't sure you wanted to bind your life to your sisters', and kissing her on the lips would probably be one of the most embarrassing things you'd ever do in your life. Sure you had kissed her before, but that was a just a quick peck on the forehead back when the two of you were too young to even comprehend the emotions behind a kiss! You were blushing even more than Liz was at just the thought of kissing your sister full on on the lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, do you think you could tell me what the third option is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you know how I said I loved you earlier? Well... I didn't mean like 'brother and sister' love... I know that it might not be normal, but I've always had a huge crush on you bro. I think it might have been because we hardly ever saw eachother thanks to my boarding school, but I've never really been able to think of you as only being my brother. So, I'd really like it if you would agree to be my boyfriend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But Liz-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know... It's not right for a sister to fall in love with her brother... But I just couldn't keep it a secret anymore! Anyway, it's your choice bro. You can be my pet, my familiar, or my boyfriend. But no matter which one you pick, you're going to be by my side forever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, this is it. You've got three options, but you're going to be stuck with your sister no matter what you choose to do. After a bit of thought, you make your decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I just needed to make sure I had somewhere to leave you if you refused to keep your promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe goes back to work on the circle as you ask, \"why do you care so much about a promise made when we were kids.\" She stops drawing either judging her work or considering the question. \"I had to go years away from you cause I was considered dangerous without training.\" She hesitates, \"Part of the original reason was to get back at our parents cause they took my childhood from me so I'm taking the rest of your life, but the more I thought of having you constantly at my side the more conferring the idea was.\" Your not sure but you think you see a tear form on Liz's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bad for her you quietly watch her complete the circle. Wen she is done she points her wand at you and with a spell you grow to about a foot tall. She picks you up and holds you in front of herself for a moment. \"I hope this doesn't hurt to much.\" she tells you before planting a kiss. As soon as her lips touch you feel week. Like she's sucking the life out of your body. You feel half dead by the time her inhale ends, Then she exhales and you feel a rush of power flow into your body, her power which you can tell feels different from the life force she took out. This continues until you only feel Liz's power inside you then comes a rush of knowledge and spells. You suddenly understand spells like floating, transformation, and size changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't move during the ritual but now that it is finishing you start to flail in your sis's hands so she puts you done on the table. At first all you can really do is sit there on all fours coughing, but soon you recover. Then you realize that your body feels completely alien to you like you are in someone else body. As you are trying to figure out the feeling you hear Liz, but not out loud, from inside your head. \"Are you ok.\" You answer out loud, \"Considering I pretty sure I just died... ya I think I'm alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you didn't die your life force was just exchanged.\" You interrupt, \"with your raw energy, ya that was part of the forced knowledge input.\" You hold your head in your hands for a moment before you even realize how rude you sounded. \"Sorry just trying to process what happened,\" trying for reassurance, \"the splitting head ache goes away eventually right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but, there is still the mark.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mark?\" you ask. But then feel a burning sensation over your left eye. You hold your hand over it as you roll on your back screaming in pain. Soon the pain subsides and Liz holds up a mirror to show you now have a tattoo from your left eye up to the back of your head. You examine it for a bit before looking up at Liz to ask, \"Whats next?\" Liz says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't feel like something you know but, more that a box filled with knowledge was placed in your mind and you can open it and learn from it. You look up to Liz, \"Is this knowledge from your mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your cleaver aren't you,\" She reply's with a smile. \"Since you are going to assist me you need to know what I know which took me years to learn so it's easier to just let you barrow what you need.\" Then silence falls on the room as she quietly watches you as you focus on the info you have access to. You understand the steps now but, you ask anyway, \"This is just knowledge referring to abilities I can is the last step more knowledge.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically Full power and knowledge transfer all at once can overload some familiars which can cause lasting effects.

Mom and dad face Liz as she seemed to appear out of nowhere. They watch intently trying to find out what she did to you and Liz clearly enjoyed the attention. She points to you and informs them, \"This is my new familiar Mike.

You scream in horror, but the only thing that comes out of you is a thought. \"This can't be right! This isn't real! I'm still dreaming!\" is all you can think to yourself. As you calm down you notice that you can still hear and see, even through the plastic rapper and applicator. You can even still feel as the applicator holds you tightly in place while Liz teases you by holding you at waist level in plain view of her camel toe bursting through jeans.  Liz bites her lower lip and pauses for a moment as her smile turns into a evil grin. \"Truth be told Mike.\" Liz says as she grips you in her hand, \"I was going to go easy on you, even make life a little better for you.  I can do many things, even improve your life, make you the perfect man, or destroy it and make your wish you were dead. I can't make any promises but if your good to me, and don't let me down, anything could happen. How you prove yourself to me will determine your outcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today however,\" Liz adds, \"Is the first day of my monthly curse and I'm all out of pads and tampons.  I was trying to use your sheets for that last night but you apparently didn't notice. Since you didn't believe me for being a witch I feel that it's necessary that I teach you a lesson on who's in charge here. During my period I always get really bad cramps, heat flashes, and I can barley move. Instead, my curse will be your curse. As you are my tampon you will feel my pain so that I won't have to. After I'm through with you, I'll either flush you or throw you into the trash bin.  Then if I need a new one, I'll recall your existence into the form of whatever I need, and use you again.  This is the way it will work until I change my mind.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"> It's the night before you and your little twin sister Liz's 16th birthday...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are the older brother Mike, but to be honest, you barely know her as she's been attending a boarding school since she was 8 and you've been just attending a local high school. Still, she's quite friendly with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe funny thing is, your parents never actually told you why, but then again, you never did ask them. Anyhow, tomorrow morning, there's going to be a small party with just you, Liz and your parents. However, that night, you have an odd dream. In the dream, you see Liz, when she was around 9 or 10 years old, right after she got back from her boarding school, saying to you \"Big Brother, we might be seperated now, but we will be together forever once we turn 16\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in cold sweat, and you almost scream out in horror as you see Liz, sitting on top of you naked. \"What the fuck man?\" you manage to whisper and turn your head away. \"It's okay Mike, you will be accquainted with a lot more than that, starting tomorrow\" Liz whispers in your ear, rubbing her moundful chest along with her erect nipple on your chest. \"Uh...Umm... Have you been... Taking drugs at the boarding school?\" you dare ask her. \"Hehe, you could say that. Infact, I made most of the \"drugs\" I made.\" Liz tells you as she makes quotation marks with her hands. \"Whatever, Liz, just go back to sleep\" you scold her and pull the blanket over your face, to hide your blushing, although you doubt that it's even visible in this dark. \"Awww, so cold are we?\" Liz teases as she slides off the bed and heads toward the door. \"Good night Big bro,\" Liz says \"Happy Birthday to us\". \"Yeh, Night\" You tell her as you close your eyes and fall asleep...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is about Mike, who's going to become a property of Liz, who is a trainee Witch! She can use spells and potions to alter Mike, to be useful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nNo Gay Interaction<br>\r\nNo Interaction with Parents.<br>\r\nLiz is allowed to go back to the \"Boarding School\" with you<br>\r\nNo short chapters with less than 4 lines.<br>\r\nLeave adding \"Other\" Choices to me... Adding to these options are just pointless.<br>\r\nMust use Capital Letters or the chapters will be deleted<br>\r\nI will give around 1000~1500GP depending on the quality of additions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy!</td>",
