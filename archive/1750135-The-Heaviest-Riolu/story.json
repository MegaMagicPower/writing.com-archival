            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sun rose to signal a start to the crisp summer morning in the dense forest. The beams of light soon found their way to the closed eyes of a little Riolu that was lying lazily on a tree branch. The sun rise caused the young pokemon's eyes to slowly open and eventually wake him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Riolu sluggishly got to his feet and let out a yawn, rubbing the last bit of sleep out of his eyes as he did so. This peaceful start was soon interrupted by a rather loud growl from Riolu's scrawny stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it's time for breakfast...\" he muttered to himself, rubbing his belly with his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu then swiftly made his way down from the tree and onto the forest ground. He'd only arrived in this forest a few weeks ago. Quite a few other pokemon lived in this forest as well, but Riolu had kept to himself, and since most of the others simply tended to their own business, everyone got along fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother grumble from his belly made Riolu quicken his pace to where he was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dashed around the trees until he came to the spot he was looking for: a small pond that was surrounded by enormous trees which had massive, bright-red apples hanging from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu licked his lips as he gazed at the succulent fruit. He gathered all the strength he could and gave the tree a hard kick. Several apples fell to the ground around the tree. Not wanting to waste another moment, Riolu strained to picked up one of the huge apples with both paws.<br>\r\nBut before he could take a bite, the earth beneath his feet began to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" moaned Riolu. \"Not HIM...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tremors became bigger and bigger as a giant Machoke came running to the pond, his footsteps shaking the ground as he ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis Machocke was a lot bigger than a normal one. Not just in height, but weight. His arms and legs were thick with fat and he had an enormous belly which hung out over his black belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, shrimpy!\" he bellowed when he spotted Riolu with the apples. \"Almost didn't see ya'. 'Cause you're so tiny! Har har har!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just leave me alone...please,\" said Riolu, annoyed but trying to sound polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" mocked Machoke. \"I couldn't hear you...'Cause you're so tiny! Har har har!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(You already said that, moron,)\" muttered Riolu, thankful that Machoke didn't hear him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you got me my breakfast,\" continued Machoke, slapping his stomach. \"This gut needs some grub!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then grabbed the apple that Riolu was still holding onto and lifted it up with Riolu still holding on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" yelled Riolu. \"This is mine! Go get your own!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bug,\" said Machoke. \"But this belly needs food to stay BIG and STRONG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then flicked Riolu with his free hand right in his nose, causing Riolu to fall flat onto the ground. Machoke then proceeded to eat the entire apple in one bite, he then grabbed to others and gulped each one down, one by one. Once he'd eaten all the ones on the ground, he shook the tree with his meaty hands and all the apples in the tree hit the ground, which he then continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu tried to get his paws on another apple, but Machoke purposely grapped to ones Riolu tried to get or simply knocked Riolu away.<br>\r\nThey continued to do this until Machocke had managed to eat all the apples in the area around the pound. When he finished, Machoke let out a massive belch and smacked his even bigger belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was some good eating!\" Machoke said happily. \"Too bad your not big enough to deserve food like me. I'd would've let you have some, but my belly needs it more than your puny one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Machoke laughed to himself as he waddled away, the ground still shaking as he left. Riolu, however, stayed at the pond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of his body hurt too much for him to care about the empty feeling in his tummy. But what hurt even worse was what he saw staring back at him in the pond. Riolu's reflection showed a very small and violently treated pokemon who couldn't even have breakfast all because he was small.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe average Riolu weighs about 44 pounds, but this one was terribly malnourished, as it was very thin and probably only weighed 30 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hardly stood a chance against that Machoke, which had to weight 255 pounds at LEAST. But there was hardly anything Riolu could do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid, Machoke...\" muttered Riolu angrily as his belly let out another loud growl. \"I deserved those apples, but just because he's bigger than me he has to eat ALL of them! What about pokemon like me? Because of that jerk I haven't had a decent meal since I came to these woods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make sense why Machoke choose to pick on Riolu; the two had never met before Riolu came. Maybe it was because they were the only Fighting-types that lived here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could give it another thought, Riolu's stomach gurgled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" he moaned, clutching his crying mid-section. \"...so...hungry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could pout any further...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just then, a powerful scent reached Riolu's nose. A sweet, almost yummy smell. Whatever it was, he wanted it. While his belly still grumbled loudly, Riolu fallowed the scent through the forest grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the scent grew stronger, Riolu could make out the smell. It was moist and sweet like apples, but these apples smelled different, like they were...warm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could apples be...warm?\" thought Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he drew closer, he began to smell other things: honey...bread...and maybe even...milk.<br>\r\nThe barrage of scents pleased Riolu's nose to no end, he HAD to have whatever they were coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scents finally lead Riolu to a small, red farm-house at the edge of the woods. The place looked abandoned but the sweet smells were definitely coming from here. And surely enough, five apple pies were neatly placed along a musty window sill to cool.<br>\r\nRiolu had never seen pie before; he didn't know apples could be prepared that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer ignoring the cries of his belly, Riolu snatched one of the pies without thinking and shoved the piping hot pastry into his mouth. He moaned with rapture as he chewed each warm, fruity bite passionately.<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the entire pie tin was licked clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mercy! You sure seemed hungry, eh pard'?\" said a gentle, southern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu looked back up at the window to see who had spoken to him. Standing by the window with the other pies was a Miltank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the fastest I've ever seen anyone eat one of my pies,\" she said, a soft smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" gasped Riolu, realizing what he did. \"I'm SO sorry! I didn't mean to...it's just that I was so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, shucks,\" Miltank interrupted. \"It's alright. I could go without a pie or three. I make these for a living, see. Come on inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu made his way through the front door and into the dank but still rather functional kitchen. He almost jumped when an egg timer started ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" said Miltank. \"Done already?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled over to the outdated oven and pulled out a tray that smelled just as scrumptious as the pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those?\" asked Riolu intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey biscuits,\" said Miltank. \"Would like one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\" said Riolu, his face beaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, ya'll: they're still hot...\" advised Miltank as Riolu took one off the tray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more bland when compared to the fruity pie, but it was still warm and sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So delicious...\" moaned Riolu before taking another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, take some more,\" said Miltank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I couldn't...\" said Riolu, wanting to be polite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I insist,\" grinned Miltank. \"Have some more pie as well if you like. I've also got plenty of milk too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu seated himself at the wooden table and MIltank placed the pies, biscuits, and a giant bottle of milk in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and dig in, I know you youngin's don't give much for table manners these days,\" she said. \"Besides, you could use some meat on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu was more than happy to let his stomach take control. He started with the biscuits, he polished of each one in about three bites each. He also grabbed a piece of pie every so often and cherished the fruity confection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry the place is such a mess, pard',\" said Miltank as she placed more pies into the oven. \"It's been like this since I first came here. I've been meanin' to fix the place up, but an old gal like me just doesn't have the oomph.\" She popped her hip to emphasize her lack of youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay,\" Riolu said, swallowing another mouthful of biscuit. \"I'm just grateful that you're letting me have this food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no trouble,\" said Miltank, stirring batter in a big bowl. \"Like I said: I does this for a living. You look like you could use a good meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks loads,\" said Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen his throat became dry from all the bread, Riolu finally opened the milk jug. He placed his mouth on the end and slowly lifted it with both paws, causing the cold, creamy liquid to flow freely into  Riolu's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly chugged the yummy and nutritious milk, too distracted by the refreshing taste to notice the slowly expanding bulge in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes ticked on into almost an hour and the biscuits and pies soon became cakes and souffles, and the bulge in Riolu's gut grew larger and larger, almost as big as a beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya'll ready for another slice of cake?\" asked Miltank cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...*burp*...\" muttered Riolu, rubbing his heavily bloated stomach. \"(Oh...I feel like I'm going to explode...but maybe I'll have... just one more).\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu took the final slice of chocolate cake off the platter, slowly took bite after bite of the wonderfully tasty dessert, and let out a small belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No more...please...\" he moaned. \"I can't eat another bite...*urp*...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should think so!\" exclaimed Miltank. \"Ya'll look almost as big as I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(Yeah...)\" thought Riolu, getting a good look at his belly. \"(I'm...bigger!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking Miltank once again for everything, Riolu struggled to stand up from the chair and waddled carefully out of the house and back into the forest, his belly sloshing around as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I keep eating like that...\" thought Riolu, patting his stuffed tummy. \"...I'll be bigger in no time!\"</span></div></div>",

I mean, I don't wanna mooch or anything...\" he rubbed his stomach a bit, mouth watering slightly at the delicious aromas. In spite of his massive meal the day before, everything had digested almost back to its original state, owing partially to his Fighting type; though he had no way of knowing, they tended to have fast metabolisms (which made Machoke all the more unusual...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank merely chuckled, taking a large apple pie out of the oven and placing it in front of the young Pokemon. \"I already told ya, young 'un: it's nice to have the company.\" She made her way over to him, ruffling the top of his head playfully. \"Besides, it's not often I see a kid as well-mannered as you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu, blushing a bit at the affectionate gesture, nonetheless laughed and rubbed the back of his head. \"Heh, thanks!\" His stomach suddenly rumbled, reminding him why he'd come in the first place. Blushing a bit, he reached to take a handful of the pie...and quickly yelped and withdrew it, blowing on it frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank laughed. \"Careful there, pardner; ya gotta let it cool a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt made sense, Riolu thought, but that didn't stop his brief look of disappointment. Nonetheless, Miltank caught it. \"Oh, don't be like that.\" Smiling, she went over to the fridge and opened it, withdrawing a small tub of some kind. Shutting it, she made her way back over to the table and set the tub. \"Here; why don't ya snack on this while ya wait?\" She pried the lid off and slid it over to Riolu. Curious, the young Pokemon peered into it; it contained a thick, white substance of some sort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu tilted his head as he looked into the tub. \"Huh? What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank's eyes widened momentarily in an expression of surprise, but it was quickly replaced by a smile. \"Oh yeah, fergot you lived in the forest.\" She gestured to the substance. \"This here's ice cream; it comes in a lotta different flavors, but all of 'em are mighty tasty. This one's vanilla.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanilla, huh?\" Curiously, Riolu dipped his paw in scooping some of it out (and wincing as the cold treat contacted his slightly-burned paw), he lifted it to his face and took a few licks. As soon as he did so, his eyes widened, and his mouth dropped open a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank smiled, placing an arm on her hip. \"Well? Whaddaya think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Pokemon looked at her, a smile slowly growing across his muzzle. \"This is really yummy!\" Licking his lips, Riolu slurped what was left off his paw, only to dip it right back in and scoop an even bigger serving out. Now grinning, he stuck his whole paw in his mouth, only to withdraw it a second later sans the ice cream. He repeated this process a few times, but eventually decided he wasn't eating it fast enough. Getting an idea, he held the still nearly-full tub up to his face and stuck his muzzle in, slurping it down and kicking his feet slightly, greatly enjoying the sweet, cold dessert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching him, Miltank chuckled. \"Easy there, pardner; make sure ya leave some of that ice cream ta have with the pie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Riolu lowered the tub, his face ringed with white. \"Huh? How come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiltank gestured to the still-cooling pie. \"I'll tell ya how come, kiddo; there ain't nothin' tastier than piping hot apple pie topped with just the right amount of vanilla ice cream.\" She winked at him. \"Ain't sayin' ya can't keep doin' what you're doin', just don't eat it all 'fore the pie cools a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Riolu turned back towards the tub. \"Thanks; I'll save some. Till then, though...\" He lifted the ice cream back up to his face, continuing to slurp it down, albeit at a slightly more controlled rate.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Over time there were definitely noticeable effects on his body. His face had gotten quite chubby with bloated cheeks and a double chin forming. His chest had also tubbed out and began to drool downwards. His belly was certainly now starting to push back against the table, and it jiggling furiously as he eat. His rump was growing at an incredible rate. His butt cheeks had gotten rounded with loads of fat. His thighs complemented the grunt his butt put on his lower torso by thickening out. He soon looked to be slowing down after only getting through a quarter of the ice cream bucket. \u201cC\u2019mon Riolu! I thought you wanted to prove everyone wrong!!!!\u201d <br>\r\nMiltank\u2019s comment gave something the timid, courteous Riolu never had: a competitive fire. He ignored the pain in his belly and the stress of his expanding body and center of gravity. He began to eat at lightning pace; if you focused on him you could\u2019ve sworn to see lighting bolts in his eyes. He was all about speed: get the large amount down as quick as possible. No pain he could face from overeating could match the pain of being outcasted for being too small. The weight gain exponentially increased with his pace. His butt had become the size of a small shelf and barely dropped of the sides of his rather large chair. His man boobs were pulling down further and hung as loose fat on his champion body. His cherub cheeks expanded out but didn\u2019t hinder his vision in the slightest; he had kept his competitive glare at his ice cream the entire time. If Miltank was saying anything about his now massive pillowy belly stacked with rolls of fat, he couldn\u2019t hear it. He wanted to be massive. He needed to feel powerful. The speed stat was overrated anyways when he could have raw power to stand up and intimidate other Riolu and even Lucario that opposed him. You could\u2019ve sworn to see a slight smirk as his face as he was close to finishing the ice cream. While the weight gain effects had slowed, he had been left with a blobby booty that swing and jiggled as he bobbed up and down to finish off the ice cream. His tummy was a just a big ol\u2019 commanding and intimidating gut fit for an experienced and competent leader. His thighs had lost their gap and now rubbed against each other every now and then. Being playful, Riolu smirked as he gave his booty a hearty smack, stopping for a moment to laugh and then finally finish off the ice cream. <br>\r\n\u201cWow kid. Look at \u2018cha. You\u2019ve made the first major step: you now have the spirit to become the biggest and baddest Riolu out here.\u201d \u201cHeck yeee\u2014\u201c Riolu was cut off as the chair supporting him finally gave out. He still landed softly on his plush rear. Both him and Miltank laughed the situation off as she gave him a hand in adjusting to his new center of gravity. \u201cI need to train now and harness my raw power.\u201d \u201cI would call it new figure. We\u2019ll build the muscle with time, but it\u2019ll be hard.... ehh with the spirit I saw you give, I\u2019m not worried one bit.\u201d Riolu embraced Miltank in a big, flabby hug. Even Miltank needed to catch her breath from his constrictive and flabby hug after it put pressure on her. \u201cGeez, maybe you did get stronger... wheeewww, almost got me to faint from that squeeze. Let\u2019s train you as a grappler!!!\u201d \u201cAlright!\u201d<br>\r\nRiolu\u2019s first exercise became... </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Riolu got to work the next day flipping tires, lifting boulders, and shoving other large objects around to increase his strength. These regimes would take up his whole day with his horrible stamina limiting him severely. Especially when pushing, Riolu found it embarrassing to feel and see his body jiggle frantically. His man boobs would flail widely, bobbing up and down. His tummy swayed fast from side to side and caught all of the sweat from his sweaty form. His thighs rubbed against one another, and jiggled from side to side like pudding. His cheeks would jiggle too, making it hard to see at times. Most embarrassing of all however was his ass. Especially when he had to engage his posterior to push through heavy objects, the fun bags for his ass cheeks shook wildly even when he moved normally; working out, it looked like he was constantly flaunting it. It always made him blush to think about it.<br>\r\nAs Riolu trained, Miltank surveyed the efficiency of his training. Rather than just see training, however... she wanted to see him. Riolu had been an incredibly kind partner by helping her around her settlements with lifting and sorting other objects. Afterwards, he was never mean spirited; he always laughed and gave her a big smile. She had certainly fallen for him, but hadn\u2019t the courage to tell him.<br>\r\nRiolu had gone through a few days of training at this point. His diet had consisted of vanilla pudding for breakfast, loads of French fries with vanilla pudding for lunch, steak with vanilla pudding for dinner, and dessert of vanilla pudding and weight gain vanilla ice cream. He needed the vanilla pudding to keep his form flabby so as to allow for his big frame to stay while he put on muscle. This diet of course had its consequences however. It mainly put weight on Riolu in... embarrassing places. His cheeks were rounded spheres at this point but were obscured by the fact that his face had grown with his gains. His activity had eliminated weight in his neck, forearms, feet, and allowed for his thighs to have the slightest of gaps; essentially, Riolu was happy to just not have to chafe himself from it. The embarrassment of fattening still certainly settled in his thighs however. They were absolutely massive. Fat oozed off the sides of his thighs. The top parts had flubbed outwards with stacks of fat just below his ocean of fat on his stomach. The very top of his thighs had the cutest little pool of flubbing out flab to them. His navel on his belly had been choked flat; he had several rolls of ample, bubbly fat on his stomach. It was a wide, lardy base for his torso. His man boobs had shrunk from his chest building, but they were still double Cs in cup sizes. His love handles were particularly embarrassing. They made the bottom of his tummy fat flub out like a pudding cup. It didn\u2019t help that Miltank made it a point to tease Riolu by tightly squeezing and pinching them. And just below the lovely handles was Riolu\u2019s biggest embarrassment: dat thicc ass. Built muscle had it allowed to stop dropping as much, but no matter what he did, Riolu\u2019s ass was eternally growing. The bottom of his bottom folded it\u2019s fat against his bloated thighs. Dimples were all over it. It always moved. It was porky, flabby, bubbly, perky, hoggy, lardy, hushy, smatty... it was down right thicc, and Riolu had to deal with it.<br>\r\nAs Riolu thought about why he was going on with his training, he suddenly felt an admiration for what Miltank had done for him. Even a sense of... something more than a friendship. He knew what he had to do. He had to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I ughh- \u2014\u201c Suddenly Miltank embraced Riolu in a kiss, and Riolu slowly let the joy overcome him. He knew they loved each other. He sunk his hands into her massive rump. She in turn grabbed a love handle and booty cheek of his. They gave each other devilish grins and shook each other\u2019s belly, breasts, and thighs, and pinched each other\u2019s cheeks. They soon made their way over to their bedroom to enjoy each other\u2019s company in privacy. <br>\r\nRiolu woke up not believing his luck.

She also started taking on his diet to make her own gains. With an already heavy set start and rapid gains close to Riolu\u2019s, her mass swelled. Her cheeks gave her a cute, more attractive face. Her boobs had reached the FF range; they were incredibly huge. Her stomach was now rivaling Riolu\u2019s for mass; she made it a point to belly bump him with a devilish smirk on her face. She too was embrassed off her loved handles. Hers were far more pooled with fat than Riolu\u2019s, leaving a thick pudding cup band around her waist. The top parts of her thighs flubbed out further than her love handles. Her thighs had grown larger than Riolu\u2019s and looked like flabby cake ready to be eaten. And of all the things she wanted weight to go to, she got it in one area, that sweet sweet ass. Oh lord, it beat Lucario\u2019a by a mile. Her ass cheeks smushed each other, leaving her butt crack as a thin line. It look like a sizable shelf. She had begun to use it for lifting heavy objects by itself and balancing them and was getting good results off of it. Riolu was honestly jealous of her newfound ability. He had begun to embrace his huge ass. Miltank certainly embraced it, and he did hers. After a hard days work jiggling and building muscle, the two went off to...</span></div></div>",

She threw Riolu belly first onto the bed and thrust her hands into the middle of his bubbly rump. She squeezed and massaged it hard, making Riolu moan in pleasure. She squeezed his love handles and shook them about. This got a disappointed yet couldn\u2019t hold it back turned on moan from Riolu that gave Miltank a devilish laughter. She then turned him over and pinched his fattened cheeks. She then grabbed a hold of his man boobs and played with them. She motor boated Riolu and shook his boobies around. She then made her way to his tummy gut and let her hands go crazy exploring his mounds of fat accumulated around his waist. They both began to moan as she did so. He was so doughy and fun to mess around with. His thighs were her next victim. She smushed them to get her over and over again and proceeded to put both of her hands on each individual thigh and shake them from side to side.<br>\r\nAfter Miltank had finished, Riolu began his dominating examination. Riolu started with the front, making his way to Miltank\u2019s fat cheeks, playing with them for a while. He even flicked her neck fat around for a minute. He next grabbed a hold of her FF breasts and massaged and kneaded them and shook them all around. He motorboated her and started to hear her whimper with excitement, in turn getting him excited. Her next massaged, shook, and slapped her gut. Miltank particularly liked to be reminded of her tubby figure, so Riolu obliged to tease her about her bountiful belly. Her moved to her udders next, pulling them up and down and sucking on them to get some milk. She was mowing now for sure. With milk falling from the side of his cheeks and mouth, he then rubbed and massaged her thighs. He also gave her hoofs a massage. Riolu had a thing for Miltank\u2019s hooves and let out little spirts of excited gasps. He then flipped her over and got to work on her pudding like love handled waist line. Miltank wanted to be called Pudding during this part to turn her the heck on, and Riolu of course obliged, enjoying the power the term Pudding gave him from Miltank. He then got to his favorite part: the booty. He groped, he smacked, he had her wiggle; made her twerk, got a full on jiggle! He\u2019d bite, he\u2019d kiss, he\u2019d lick as well; he knew that booty nice as hell.<br>\r\nAfter asking for permission that indeed got, Riolu entered from behind, and the two then moved and loved wherever that took them. <br>\r\nAfter they had finished, Miltank had something she\u2019d wanted to discuss.

Eheheheheh!\u201d Riolu couldn\u2019t help but be really turned on by Audino\u2019s cutesy nurse foreplay. He decided to play the part, saying, \u201cOhhh nurse, my tummy really hurrrts!\u201d \u201cWell dats no good! Les assess!\u201d If Audino was truly a specialist at anything, it was for having the perfect balance between succulent, soft and luscious, groping touches on fattened, thiccy bodies. She lurched her soft paws all over the expanse of flubby fat that was Riolu\u2019s tummy. \u201cLet me jiggle just a little bit, okay?\u201d Audino then practically kneaded Riolu\u2019s ocean of torso fat and kept back her giggles behind the most pure and radiant smile the world had ever seen. She of course had to tease the boy about his rolling love handles, squeezing them to get Riolu to laugh. She broke out laughing with him, saying, \u201cIt appears the liddle pudgy boy is sensitive in his wuvvy dubby handles, eheheheeh!\u201d She then touched his thighs so delicately yet forcefully that you could defitenly see Riolu getting excited. <img style=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/wink.png\" alt=\"*Wink*\" class=\"emoteZ\" title=\"Wink\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> \u201cNow my patient there seems to be only one other place to check for these supposed bruises...\u201d Audino then got a sinister gleam to her expression and licked her lips. She then flipped the excited Riolu over and herself got extremely excited. Audio loved booties. Which between a man or woman fat or THICC ones were on didn\u2019t matter. She loved all fat asses. She greedily groped and shoved her soft paws all over Riolu\u2019s arse. Each touch more aggressive than the last, Riolu began to orgasm hard with each passing ass grope. Soon he lurched for his iPod and played his new fav: \u201cVibe\u201d by Cookiee Kawaii. As it started, he lurched over and groped Audino\u2019s soft fat onion ass and rubbed his fingers all around his groped blobby ass fat. \u201cNurse,\u201d he said, \u201cI think you need to just have a little fun, eh? Work must be soooo hard,\u201d he said as he pushed her booty cheeks up and down. <br>\r\nWith that Audino and Miltank flipped their fat asses towards Riolu and followed the instructions of the middle of \u201cVibe\u201d and threw it back on Riolu at the same time. Both of them together got Riolu intoxicatingly horny. With his special power, he split his length into two, fully formed lengths and entered behind on both of the pokegirls as they shook their fat asses on them. Riolu took both of his hands and stuck his left hand into Audino\u2019s ass fat and did the same for Miltank\u2019s lard blob below the waist with his right. He felt like an absolute king. He had them go faster so as to make him relieve himself faster. It lasted for a while half hour however and it was the best. Riolu just got the best birthday present ever... and he wanted to give back.<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished, Riolu used his horny energy to stand up and began himself to throw it back. The girls spanked him hard and groped his ass cheeks. He was blushing so hard on his globular cheeks and stuck his tongue out and closed his eyes in euphoria. He was unstoppable; this feeling was the best thing ever. All of his training was paying off. He not one but two beautiful wives who were insanely THICC, hot, and as horny as himself. They had told they had wanted many babies, something the prideful Riolu had always dreamed of as a scrawny, picked on kid. He went from a scrawny, I wanted runt to soon creating a lineage of thicc babies to carry on his training and legacy. <br>\r\nSoon one of the three had the idea to turn on a camera and record themselves twerking to \u201cVibe\u201d together. It was a sight to behold, so much fat going everywhere all at once. The three were the perfect triangle for each other that\u2019d never be broken. Riolu loved both of his wives infinitely; Audino and Miltank loved being bi; Riolu loved them being bi. They understood each other more than any group of Pok\u00e9mon could. They finished their birthday session in paradise by groping each other\u2019s fattened bodies and calling each other empowering compliments such as king and queen. It was the best they\u2019d ever had and ever would have.<br>\r\nBut after a few days, the best was yet to come and the gifts weren\u2019t over!

He was completely stuck to the chair despite his struggle to get out. \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on here,\u201d he shouted. Soon a large figure emerged out of the dark room. It was Snorlax herself, acting all sexy bu striking several poses to accent her fat butt and tits. \u201cLet\u2019s make one thing clear, blue boy. I\u2019m not your typical lazy Snorlax; I like to get wild. I like to feel in control so you\u2019ll do as I say during this session and I think you may just end up liking it.\u201d \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t listen what happ\u2014\u201c Before Riolu could respond, Snorlax shoves her fat left tit into his mouth. Riolu, feeling devilish, started to suck on Snorlax\u2019s tit, only to find that after drinking her milk for a while, he was feeling... heavier. As soon as Snorlax began to cackle in laughter, she took her tit out of Riolu\u2019s mouth and gave her speech. \u201cAhhh what a naughty widdle boi, I see you wanded some of mommy\u2019s bweast milk.\u201d Soon Snorlax\u2019s voice took a more sensual, adult tone. \u201cWell mommy seems to notice you\u2019ve gotten a bit more hefty my boy. Ooooh, could it have been my milk causing you to grow so biiiig!?\u201d Snorlax was soon playing with Riolu\u2019s heavier body, starting with his new GG sized breasts. She grabbed viciously and licked and jiggle them over and over. She got some milk to squirt out of them and let it spill over her face. Mommy was having a lot of fun. She soon fastened her hands to his love handles and worked her ways massaging around his tummy and thighs. \u201cSee? You like it, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cYeeeees! Yeeeeeessss oh gawwwwd yes!\u201d \u201cAnd how do you address me boy!?\u201d \u201cYes mommy!\u201d Smirking, Snorlax got a sense of lust, pleasure, and power off of Riolu\u2019s submission, and shoved her hands into Riolu\u2019s new fatty tush. \u201cOhhhh my boy if I must admit, you seem to have put on a bit of weight that looks rather worrisome. First you grew a flat tire on your stomach, your moobs look ridiculous and... and... seeexxxyyy... *Snorlax was starting to slip* uhh ugh... and it seems you\u2019ve gotten a rather wide load of a bum. Ooooh but wook at how your widdle bum jiggles. UwU sooooo cuwwute!!\u201d Snorlax was full on spanking, groping, and biting Riolu\u2019s huge ass at this point. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve let yourself go!!\u201d \u201cAahhhh, stoooop, that hurts!\u201d \u201cYou didn\u2019t address me! Do it! DO IT!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d \u201cWho are you sorry to huh!?\u201d \u201cMommy! Mommy, I\u2019m sorry! I\u2019ve been a baaaad boy! My booty\u2019s too fat and my body is a big old tub of lard!\u201d Snorlax finally snapped hearing those words. She was turned the fuck on. A menacing glare hit her face. \u201cOooohh hohohohoho!! She shoved both of her own GG breasts in Riolu\u2019s fat mouth. \u201cHowl like a wolf with an uwu for mommy! Do it! DO IT!\u201d Riolu had become so turned on as to follow orders on command. \u201cUWUUUUUUUU! UEEEWEEUUUUUUUUU!\u201d \u201cOh god my boy you\u2019re so hot! Come here, come now!\u201d Soon Snorlax was grinding against Riolu until her entered her, causing both of them to practically shout in orgasm, Riolu attempting to do so while shouting through a mouth full of tits. Snorlax\u2019s milk came flooded off the sides of Riolu\u2019s mouth. Snorlax started sucking Riolu\u2019s fat titties to try to get some milk back. The same milk she had soon came out of Riolu\u2019s tits and she too put on weight from the same type of milk she gave Riolu. With milk running down the sides of her mouth, she realized her suction and turned her fat tush around for Riolu too see. \u201cWitness it, blue boy.\u201d Riolu simply stared as Snorlax\u2019s already ginormous ass grew and grew, constantly filling with fat until it stopped. She swung her booty around it his lap, begging for sexual stimulation. Riolu got the hardest he\u2019d ever been and entered from behind. Both of them were practically screaming in orgasm. Rookie felt like his stream was never going to stop. Snorlax kept sterling her mountain of tush against Riolu\u2019s huge tummy and pelvis. She began to scream, \u201cOooooohh you\u2019re daddy now! Ooooh you\u2019re daddy neeeooooow! Oooooh yess yes yes oh yeah oh yeah!!!\u201d Rookie was screaming in uncontrollable spirts of orgasm, soon breaking the chair and bindings that bound him before. With Snorlax now pinned against the floor, Riolu shoves his fat paws into her slippery, wobbly booty cheeks and groped her ass, forcing the morbidly obese milk filled Snorlax to enjoy every second of his length. \u201cHow do you address me now, huh? Huh???!!!\u201d \u201cOh, my bawwwwd, yes daddy keep going, keep pushing, ooohh it feels so gooood daddy!\u201d \u201cYou bet it does! God, you have the best ass ever! Perfectly slippery and playful! Oh my god yes! Ahhh oooohh ohhh yeeaaaah!\u201d \u201cYou conquered this wild stallion, my big blue buddy! Now keep it in there! Keep it going!\u201d Rolling kept pounding Snorlax from behind, soon groping all of the luscious fat of her love handles, cheeks and her face, back fat, THICC thighs, GG breasts, huge tummy, and especially her thick triple layered neck. He began to grope her neck, causing her to orgasm from being controlled and powerless. Using his immense strength, Riolu flipped Snorlax over and entered from the front, some of his sentiment getting all over her in the process of flipping her over. He sucked on her left tit, growing fatter and fatter, applying more pressure and pleasure to the well equipped and padded Snorlax. They locked lips in a passionate kiss and ended the sex soon after, panting heavily afterwards. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think,\u201d Snorlax said afterwards?\u201d Riolu said it was... </span></div></div>",

Which he was more than happy to start scarfing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few weeks, Riolu had visited Miltank every day, eating his fill of her scrumptious food every time.<br>\r\nMiltank would prepare endless amounts of pies, strudels, biscuits, and cakes all for Riolu to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all that excessive eating was really starting to show on Riolu. His once rail-thin body had plumped out in great size. His arms and thighs had grown very large and thick, his face had also become noticeably rounder and softer. <br>\r\nBut nothing compared to his belly, which made him look like a big, blue ball with legs, arms, a head and a tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued to visit, Riolu's appetite increased almost as quickly as his belly had. He would often eat a little more with each meal, he now ate about twice as much as he normally did, which only made him grow even faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his change in weight, Riolu didn't have much trouble getting around. He could walk (er, waddle) like he normally could, but walking for a long time or just running would cause him to lose his breath. All that Milktank milk was certainly doing his body good, but he was still rather large for such a normally small pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu even had to sleep on bigger tree branches to make sure they wouldn't snap under his new girth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Raichu awoke an hour or so before Riolu did, stretching as little as he could manage with his own fattened frame weighing him down and hindering his movements. He smiles as he gave his huge gut a pat, sending ripples through his blubber, thinking about and feeling grateful toward his friend Riolu, for helping to stuff him and fatten him up to this size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought there was no better way to show gratitude for being fattened than to fatten up his fattener, craning his thick neck to get a better look at his companion. Taking note of how Riolu wasn't really that far behind him, quite the tubby puppy in fact. His legs and arms had plumped up nicely, but most of all that blue belly had grown, sticking out much further and wider than before they started their feast. But alas, try as he might, the Raichu could not stand up. Too fat, too rotund to even get good footing let alone stand up or even really roll. The only thing he succeeded in doing was making himself jiggle and work up a light sweat from the effort.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJust as soon as he had begun lamenting his inability to pay his friend back for the feeding,  dark object with purple swirls fell from above and onto the Raichu's doughy chest, sinking in lightly into his fat. It was well within the reach of his own stubby limbs, and the swirls seemed to glow purple as he stared at it. After taking a closer look at it while holding it in his paws he discovered that it was, or at least looked like an apple. Even the outside seemed to smell abnormally delicious to him. \"This would make a nice little present for Riolu, but it might not even be safe to eat. I've never seen an apple like this before. Oh well, nothing ventured, nothing gained\" Raichu thought to himself, licking his lips as he began to feel drool welling up in his mouth, anxious to sample the hopefully delicious morsel before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe curiously brought it to his mouth, feeling it faintly pulse in his paws as he took a small bite and almost choked on how utterly... Delicious! It was. He couldn't find any other way to describe it, it was just a perfectly appley apple with a nice mixture of sweet and sour flavor, and plenty of juice. The juicy fruit and even the juice itself seemed to lightly buzz in his mouth, and then his throat and stomach once he swallowed the chunk he took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat settled it, Riolu was having the rest of it, the Raichu decided. Looking forward to feeding his friend so much that he almost missed the effects of the unusual fruit he had consumed, his body adjusting and growing. Limbs growing to better touch the ground and reach for things. Bones thickening and muscles changing and growing (though still buried underneath all that flab) to support his otherwise immobile frame. His body growing taller and slightly less \"fat\", though no less round as warmth and energy seemed to course all around inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it was over, the Raichu stood about slightly less than twice his previous height, and was actually able to stand. And move, quite well. Something he couldn't help but demonstrate to himself with a short hop that caused him to crash back onto the ground with a resounding, heavy thud. Leaving cracks in the ground around his feetpaws from the impact of his heavy frame falling back down to earth, regardless of how high he actually managed to \"jump\". Luckily, Riolu wasn't disturbed by the small quake, or even the resulting noises from all around as other pokemon reacted to the tremors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a big grin on his chubby face, Raichu went about gathering up more of the chocolate trees, and their fruit and even the marshmallow plants. Gathering small clusters of fruit from the trees and berries from the bushes and holding them against his plump chest with his now larger, thicker, stronger arms. Easily able to reach around most of his chest where before his \"growth\" he was too fat to do so. And once the fruits were all gone from the chocolate trees he had chosen and gathered into a neat little pile near his sleeping ball of a friend, he proceeded to barge into the bare trees with his bare belly. Even with the great big ball of his gut being soft and doughy from all that blubber, with his weight and newfound strength behind his charges the trees didn't stand much of a chance, either snapping right away or bending until eventually the Raichu's tummy won out and brought the more resistant ones down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pile of food slowly grew and grew until the Raichu had brought back enough chocolate filled fruit, marshmallows, and chocolate trees broken into smaller pieces for easier management, that each pile stood about as tall and as wide as he was. He gave a prideful snort and puffed his already puffy chest out, feeling quite content with the feast he brought for his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaichu sat down next to his heavy sleeper of a friend, cracking the ground and sending another tremor through the area as he plopped himself down, reached down toward Riolu's belly, and shook it, sending wobbles through the aura puppy's padded frame. Surprisingly, being touched made his friend wake up quite quickly. The Riolu sitting up as much as he could manage and rubbing at his eyes, letting out a yawn and letting his gaze fall upon his friend, having yet to notice the pile of food nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmnnh... Good morning Raichu.\"<br>\r\n\"Morning Riolu, Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n\"After everything we ate? You bet, I think it must've been what they call a food coma. We ate soooo much!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, well hope you're still not stuffed. You hungry?\"<br>\r\n\"Actually. Yeah.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Raichu smirked as he pointed off to the side toward the pile of food he'd gathered, watching with a smile as the Riolu's expression changed from confusion, to curiosity as he turned his head, and then jaw-opening surprise at the several Raichu-sized mounds of food nearby, with a black apple sitting at the very top of a pile of chocolate apples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did all that get there!?\"<br>\r\n\"While you were sleeping. C'mon, get up and go over to it. It's your turn to be fed now, Riolu. I'll feed you until you're even bigger than I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt from competing with his recent weight gain while standing up beside Raichu, Riolu was surprised again to find that Raichu stood at least twice his previous height and was now... Mobile.<br>\r\n\"Odd\" Said Riolu. \"How did you get so big so fast? And I don't mean fat. I mean... You're taller now, and your arms and legs are bigger.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. That. It was because of that weird black and purple apple in the pile. I tried it out to see if it was safe to give to you because I felt bad that you got to feed me so much and I ended up immobile before I had the chance to return the favor. And for some reason, well, it made me grow.\"<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it'd work on me...\" Riolu smiled, his chubby tail wagging uncontrollably from side to side as he turned to and squeezed Raichu's squishy wall of belly in a big hug, feeling the Raichu's arms wrap around him and pull him closer into that soft tummy.<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I can't see why it wouldn't. I think you should save it until after you've fattened up some more, and even then, only eat a single bite. Don't worry, I'll put it in your mouth if you can't move.\"<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why should I only have a bite?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just a hunch, but. Just a little bite took quite a bit of my fat and made me taller and stuff. I dunno what'll happen if it \"takes\" more than you have, if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Come to think about it, you look less plump than you should've been if you just grew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleasing Riolu from his paunch, the Raichu began to walk with his friend toward the pile of food, being mindful not to move too much so that his bulk didn't swing into and knock his friend over.</span></div></div>",

He nearly fell over when a Banette appeared out of no where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Hello...\" greeted the ghost pokemon in the same, whispery voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi...\" Riolu said meekly. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Banette...\" said Banette as he bowed slightly. \"...and I believe I may have the solution to your problem...Come inside, and I'll explain...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu followed Banette into the cave. Upon entering, Riolu noticed several small bottles with all kinds of strange objects scattered across the cave, ornate bookshelves with hundreds of old books stacked along the walls, and a cauldron filled with a glowing and bubbling green substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You see...\" began Banette. \"...I dabble in...Hmm...'unique' studies...I use this knowledge to help pokemon in need...such as yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...still don't understand...\" said Riolu. \"What do you want from me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh...I already have what I want from you...\" said Banette, inhaling deeply. \"...Your...hatred...your...anger and....your hunger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu's stomach gurgled loudly again on that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can use the power from these...emotions...to...\" continued Banette slowly. \"...grant you...a wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wish?\" exclaimed Riolu. \"As in: anything I want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak your deepest desire to me...\" said Banette. \"...and I shall make it real!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu's first thought was to get something to eat. But a big smile spread across his face as he thought of what he really wanted: to be bigger than Machocke! If he was bigger than Machoke, he'd never have to worry about food ever again! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish for something that will make me bigger!\" said Riolu eagerly. \"I want to be bigger than Machoke!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well...\" said Banette. \"...I believe I have just the thing...for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanette floated around the cauldron in a rhythmic pattern. Muttering what sounded like gibberish to Riolu and occasionally tossing in something off a shelf.<br>\r\nThe potion in the pot slowly thickened and stopped glowing, the result being a disgusting black sludge that continued to bubble slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanette reached his arms into the cauldron and eventually pulled something out of the goop. It appeared to be a black apple with several purple swirl patterns on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" asked Riolu, a bit afraid of the peculiar object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This...er...'apple'....\" explained Banette. \"...shall grant you that which you desire...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I eat this...I'll grow big?\" said Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll do the trick...yessss...\" wheezed Banette, handing the 'apple' to Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks!\" said Riolu. Without another word, Riolu dashed out of the cave with the 'apple'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I best get...going...\" muttered Banette to himself. Both he and his possessions slowly started to fade away. \"...don't want to get caught up in...this one...hmm hmm hmmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he left the cave, Riolu looked at the strange fruit he'd received. It certainly looked good enough to eat. But should he eat it now, or eat it right in front of Machoke?</span></div></div>",

Taking big, merciless bites, he polished off the dry, semi-sweet 'apple' within a matter of seconds. He even managed to swallow the core, thus leaving no remains of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" thought Riolu. \"I don't feel any bigger...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Riolu could think about it any further, a sharp pain grew in his stomach. He yelped in pain and clutched his aching belly as it growled loudly. Riolu felt like he hadn't eaten in months, his stomach need something in it NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even thinking, Riolu plucked handfuls of grass from the ground and shoved them into his mouth, swallowing them instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need...*gulp*...food!\" Riolu moaned, still trying to make a meal out of the grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped eating for a moment, looking rather absent-mindedly at a nearby tree. His eyes began to glow an unnatural shade of pink as he stared at the natural beauty. In the zombie-like trance he was in, he walked to the tree...and took a massive bite out of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire section of bark, in Riolu's mouth, then gone in one big gulp! He continued to chomp away at the tower of wood, swallowing each bite without chewing. When the tree's base no longer had ample support, the whole thing came crashing down with a loud THUD! But Riolu didn't stop, with the same pink glow in his eyes, he continued to eat the fallen tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBite after bite, gulp after gulp, Riolu's belly grew at an alarming rate to accommodate the amount of 'food' Riolu was inhaling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, all that was left of the tree was its chipped stump and some scatted leaves. Everything else was stuffed into Riolu's ENORMOUS belly, which towered over the forest grove. The weight of his gut caused him to fall back onto his rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that's what the apple does...\" thought Riolu to himself, snapping out of the trance for a minute. \"...I can now eat ANYTHING I want to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed his belly as much as he could with his puny paws, cherishing how big he really was. But that tree was hardly enough for him; he still felt famished!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu then spotted a boulder that was a bit smaller than his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?!\" mocked Riolu to the boulder. \"You're not that big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pink glow returning to his eye, Riolu bent over the boulder and with unnatural strength, lifted it up to his mouth and SWALLOWED it whole! Riolu nearly doubled in size, not just his belly this time, but his whole body.<br>\r\nHe then lifted himself back up with the help of his bigger and stronger legs and waddled over to another tree, shaking the ground as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then started to eat the other tree even quicker than the first (thanks to his bigger mouth and stronger arms).<br>\r\nRiolu continued to swallow entire mouthfuls of tree, reducing the once magnificent symbols of nature into worthless pieces of splintered wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu also grew even bigger with each tree he ate. His legs, arms, and head grew a bit more into equal proportion of his monstrous stomach, but his belly was still quite large and round. But he had now gotten big enough to up-root an entire tree with just his paws, and then chomp away down the trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile, eating all that wood made Riolu pretty thirsty. Luckily, he had returned to the area with the apples trees and the pond by then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling onto his huge belly, Riolu lowered his head down to the expansive body of water and began to drink the pond water. It didn't take long, due to his new found size. In a matter of minutes the pond was reduced to a hole in the ground with a few Magikarp flopping away for their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving eaten his fill for now, Riolu rolled onto his back, filling in the hole that once held so much water. Water that was now gurgling in Riolu's colossal stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the...?!\" said a loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu rolled over onto his tummy to look at the source of the voice. Only to find that Machoke, that one pokemon that had mocked Riolu for his puny size, was gaping at the big, blue pokemon that had just drank the massive pond dry. Machocke was just barely bigger than Riolu's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the HECK did ya' get so big?\" asked Machoke, still in unbelievable shock and quaking with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" said Riolu in a booming but still quite childish voice. \"...I almost didn't see you. Cause you're so tiny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Riolu picked up Machoke with a giant paw, and straighted his body upright so that Machoke could see just how big he'd gotten. This didn't calm Machoke in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Put me down ya' freak!\" yelled Machoke. Struggling hopelessly against Riolu's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, bug,\" said Riolu, the pink glow returning to his eyes. \"But this belly needs food to stay BIG and STRONG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again under the influence of the apple, Riolu opened his maw, dangled the tiny pokemon over his tounge (which pathetically protested) and dropped him. In one gulp, the once arrogant and selfish Machoke was no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu let out a short burp, and then rolled onto his back again to resume his comfortable position. Yawning slightly, he closed his eyes and drifted into a very relaxing sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Riolu yawned and opened his eyes. It was now nighttime. His little nap lasted longer than expected. Riolu shrugged and began to turn onto his mountain he called a belly but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the-\" <br>\r\nRiolu was tied in place with floating water that seemingly had no gravity but was still strong enough to keep the glutton in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE!\" A loud booming voice yelled, Riolu looked around and saw a massive shadow, at least 3 times the size of him. Riolu panicked and began to try and break free. \"No! No! Please don't eat me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow drew nearer and Riolu felt really silly, a vast swarm of tribal-looking Slowpoke appeared out of the shadows. Unlike other Slowpoke, these Slowpoke looked angry and dare he say it, smart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA chubby Slowking stepped forward, nowhere near as big as Riolu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Cheif Ekopwols of the Psywave tribe. But you can just call me Cheif. You drained our lake, you shall now be punished!\" The Slowpoke and Slowbro surrounding Riolu took aim with bows and arrows made out of shells and swords made out of clams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow was the time to panic, if any of them shot Riolu he would surely pop, or worse, fart. With quick thinking for the clever fighting-type he is, Riolu made up a lie. A great lie the Slowpoke couldn't turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOW DARE YOU TREAT YOUR GOD LIKE THISSS?!\" Riolu bellowed, louder than the Slowking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the Slowpoke looked pale, they quickly sheathed their weapons and immediately bowed, Slowpoke and Slowbros broke out in thousands of cries and shouts. Riolu smirked. The only one who didn't bow was the Cheif. He stood there shell shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'm so sorry my liege...\" Cheif muttered, \"Whatever can we do to repay you, we're sure the drinking of our lake was a great reward from you, we solemnly apologize. Now, please don't eat us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu sneered, \"It is too late for that! I will devour every single one of you!\" The Slowpoke cried in protest, \"Unless...you do something for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, anything you desire my lord!\" Cheif panicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"First, I want you to release me of this watery prison!\" Riolu bellowed,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slowking went pale, \"I'm afraid I cannot do that...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why not?!\" Shouted Riolu, a bit panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those cuffs are made to trap our worst enemies until it strangles them, so I-uh-we can eat them. That is how I-erm-we hunt my obeseness.\" Cheif took a few steps back. \"You see, I've always wanted to be the largest Pok\u00e9mon in the world, so I could appease our God, and here you are. They say you give blessings to become large like you. I crave your fat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Riolu got an idea to break the chains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course! Here, lie down next to me underneath the chains, we shall both feast and break these sacred bonds. We both get what we desire, you become humongous, and I become humongouser and free!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Slowking did as he was told and lay down next to Riolu, clearly excited to become a blob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But beware, becoming a blob like me has great conveniences and great consequences. Once you start growing, you will never stop. Now, order your minions to bring us food, I'm starved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheif nodded and shook with excitement, Riolu turned his massive head to look at the Slowpoke go and retrieve food for him. Due to his head movement, a piece of the apple fell from his jowels and landed in the Slowking's mouth. He willingly ate the apple, rubbed his tummy, then his eyes went pink as he smirked maliciously. </span></div></div>",

He stretched his arms over his head and laid them back onto the gigantic mass that was his belly, loving the feeling of his paws sinking into the waves if fat. \u2018Yesterday was amazing\u2026\u201d Riolu cooed, relishing in the comfort his body was giving him as he laid in the remains of the lake. \u201cI\u2019m so big now...and hey! I\u2019m not hungry anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, the once little Pokemon\u2019s stomach no longer cried out for more food. Not to say that he was full, in fact his stomach was completely empty from digesting it\u2019s massive feast earlier. Yet despite that it did not growl or gurgle, content and placated like a tamed pet. Riolu gave a sigh and muzzled his fluffy moobs, taking immense pleasure in playing with his new flabby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, all things had to come to an end, as Riolu heaved himself up with ease and stood in the middle of the former lake. To his surprise, it turns out that while he slept, he must have shrunk! He was still huge, but his whole body did not plug up the lake like it used to. But he wasn't particularly worried about that. Riolu still towered over the forest with his enormity, and he never had to worry about bigger Pokemon bullying him, because he was the biggest!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with a newfound appreciation of life, Riolu began to march wherever his feet led him, trampling the Forest underneath his fat paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow...everyone looks so tiny from up here!\u201d Riolu exclaimed as he looked down at all the Pokemon running away from him, not wanting to get stomped on like the others. They all clabbered to get the farthest away from Riolu\u2019s fat soles as they slammed into the Earth playfully, leaving huge pawprints inn their wake. \u201cHello down there!\u201d He said cheerfully, not understanding that they were afraid of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a strange scent came to the giant Pokemon\u2019s nose. Riolu closed his eyes and sniffed the air inquisitively, trying to find the source of the smell. It was sweet and sugary and reminded him of the human food that they had in the cities. Riolu opened his eyes once he was in direction of the scent, and gasped in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, there was the outline of another one of those Human cities, probably chock full of delicious treats and goodies for him to eat. \u201cI said I wasn't hungry anymore.\u201d Riolu\u2019s eyes flashed pink for a moment. \u201cI never said i wasn't full!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he got down on all fours, his belly colliding violently with the rest of the forest, and began to sprint towards the city, tongue hanging out as he imagined all the food that was waiting for him.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pretty soon, Riolu came to a skidding halt on the outskirts of the city, kicking up huge plumes of dust and unearthing several trees in his wake. He looked down on the city with big, curious eyes. \u201cTeehee! You all look like bugs!\u201d He said childishly as he picked a nearby building. It was a Human house, with the owners in question trying to get out before it they were too high up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu brought the house up to his nose and took a big whiff of the structure. To his amazement it smelled like...baked goods! Of course it was not, it was made of wood and metal, but to Riolu it was like he was in food heaven. With a happy smile he tossed the house into his open maw and swallowed it without chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning, Riolu got back down on his big, fat belly, causing the Earth around him to shake under his weight. He than began to lazily shovel in parts of the city into his eager mouth, loving how the his tastebuds were assisted with all kinds of pleasant flavors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe populace of the city tried to escape the wrath of the hungry Pokemon, but as he plucked more and more buildings from their foundations, more and more humans were getting eaten as well. He barely chewed with his eyes half closed, in a ultra relaxed trance as he ate and ate and ate\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAl the while, Riolu\u2019s belly eagerly converted the \u2018food\u2019 into more plush blubber. Hundreds of pounds formed on his frame, expanding outwards and upwards with every passing minute. His posterior became bigger than two wailord stir each cherk, the two jiggling orbs tossing over the rest of his body as he laid on top of his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what a belly it was! As Riolu went on from the suburbs to the City\u2019s financial district, his growth skyrocketed. His hyper soft belly oozed onto the earth, smushing anything and anyone that was too close to it. \u201cMmm...so good\u2026\u201d Riolu murred as he began to chow down on ice the cities last remaining skyscrapers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until an entire army of Pok\u00e9mon Trainers had arrived to help the remaining inhabitants of the city. All at once, they got their strongest Pok\u00e9mon to fire their most effective moves at the Giant Pokemon in unison. The collaborative attack simply bounced off Riolu\u2019s quivering blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGah! Nothings working!\u201d The trainer in charge said as Riolu move onto the industrial district. \u201cWhat can we do?! It\u2019s going to eat everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Riolu continued his feast with vigor. Steel factories and textile mills fell into his gut and became fat in his thighs as he glutted.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he glutted the remains of steel and textile into his ever-expanding gullet, one Legendary Pokemon was made aware of this. A Jirachi. As she arrived on the scene and surveyed the damage, she floated in front of the Riolu who was in the middle of eating another factory and blasted him with a powerful Psychic, knocking him on his back and making it harder for him to get up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop this assault on this city! The people!\" Jirachi shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Riolu smiled as he got back up, licking his lips. \"I haven't eaten any bugs Jirachi, they are too cute for that. But you're not a bug.\" He then charges towards the Jirachi, leaving giant prints in the ground and covers her in his giant paws. Jirachi tried to break free, but his paws were so fat and hot that it was difficult for her to charge up an attack or plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited that he had captured Jirachi for the time being, Riolu began doing a little dance, causing massive quakes and leaving giant dents in the ground. As this was going on, Jirachi continued to feel the heat wash over her as well as her oxygen beginning to wane. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Riolu was no longer satisfied with Jirachi and decided to nom her as well. But as he opened his mouth, Jirachi was freed and stopped her descent with her energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, don't eat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Riolu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because who else will keep you company. Think about it, you've already gotten really big, so who would stop/help you from consuming the planet if you ate me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu pondered this for a moment before coming to his conclusion. \"All right, I'll let you live. As long as you help me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi breathed a sigh of relief. \"Of course Riolu.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu smiled. \"Yay. Now then, it's time to finish this city.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with no opposition, Riolu continued his rampage across the city. Scooping up buildings in one hand and dirt/gravel in the other and shoving it down his throat at once. With one final cannonball, the city was destroyed and Riolu was very happy. He had not only devoured an entire city, but he had a wish-granting Legendary at his finger tips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Riolu was making a dirt-angel in the debris with a big grin on his face, Jirachi appeared in front of his big flabby face with a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a thank you for sparing my life, you are entitled to as many wishes as you want. So, what is your first wish?\" Jirachi asked. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the big grin plastered onto his flabby face never leaving, Riolu closed his eyes and thought hard on what he wanted to wish for from Jirachi. Without thinking, he lifted both of his hand paws up from the ruins of the city beneath him and plunged them into his great, big sphere of fluffy fat that was his belly. He let out a soft murr as his fat paws rubbed his blubbery belly, feeling as content as can be.The childish Pok\u00e9mon truly loved in how fat he was. It felt amazing to be so big and powerful, always warm and soft. The plush padding around his body ensured that he was comfortable at all times, flesh bouncing and jiggling with every movement. The only thing Riolu\u2019s mind seemed to gravitate towards was more food to eat so he can get even bigger. To his credit, he did attempt to think of other things. He tried thinking of wishing to see Banette again so he can give a big hug as thanks. He tried thinking of wishing to resurrect Machamp so the two of them could ply. But try as he might, the urge to eat and grow was just too powerful, not that he minded terribly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu opened his eyes and sniffed the air delicately. There was another delicious scent wafting through the wind, so good a thin line of pristine, clear drool rn down his plush, blue fur. He turned his head lazily to the origin of the scent, and saw the same forest where he had came from. His already large smile got just a little bit bigger as he licked his lips, not seeing his former home and testament to nature\u2019s might, but another all you can eat buffet. But he was so relaxed spareld out on the ground, and the woodland was so far away...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Riolu came up with the perfect wish to solve his problem. \u201cHey,\u201d the overgrown puppy turned it\u2019s head back to Jirachi, an eager and curious look in his eyes. \u201cUm...what\u2019s the name of that thing you did earlier, when you hit me without using your hands?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi tilted it\u2019s head in confusion, not understanding the question completely. \u201cYou...you mean my psychic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it!\u201d Riolu suddenly grabbed the small legendary out of the air as he sat up. \u201cI want one of those! I wanna be a psychic like you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi grimaced, knowing fully well that such a hunger mixer with psychic abilities would have devastating results. Nevertheless, she promised the baby Pokemon he was entitled to as many wishes as he liked, so she had no choice but to grant it. \u201c...very well.\u201d She sighed, closing her eyes before she began muttering some ancient enchantments. Soon, a bright flash erupted from her body, blinding Riolu a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey're, your now a psychic type.\u201d Jirachi grunted, feeling the heat from Riolu\u2019s pudgy paws warn her body up to uncomfortable levels. \u201cSo...what now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Riolu hummed, rubbing his neck in contemplation. As he fiddled around with his neck rolls, an idea popped into his head. \u201cOh, that\u2019s perfect!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d Jirachi asked, not liking how the baby Pokemon was able to dominate her so casually. Unfortunately, she was about to get her answer as Riolu lifted up her small body to his neck, and with a gasp she was plunged in between his cheek and neck roll, smushing her body without mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, That tickles!\u201d Riolu giggled as Jirachi tried to wiggle herself free. With his personal wish granted stowed away, the puppy Pok\u00e9mon tried to test his newfound psychic powers. He looked around and saw a small house that he must have overlooked during his rampage. He lifted up one of his paws and focused on it, and before long an aura outlined the structure that lifted it up from it\u2019s foundations. With a delighted squeal, he brought the small structure to his mouth and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a happy sigh, Riolu leaned back into the smushed earth and closed his eyes. He lazily wagged one of his fat fingers, and focused on the great woodland he once called home. One by one, the trees and foliage of the forest began to uproot themselves and hover they're way to Riolu\u2019s slightly ajar mouth.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Curious and, for reasons he did not yet know, sad, he momentarily halted his massive binge to inspect himself, leaving his powerful belly to catch its metaphorical breath. The baby jackal Pokemon was confused with why a frown was creeping up on his pudgy visage, for he had everything he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu\u2019s warm and comfortable blubber would make sure he would never go cold again. His stomach, while impossible to truly fill, had sedated his hunger. No Pokemon or human could ever hope to bully him ever again due to his massive size and newfound strength, as well for him having eaten their homes. So why was he feeling so depressed? At this time, Jirachi, having grown hot and bothered smooshed up inside her new master\u2019s neck rolls, wiggled out and flew out in front of his face with an irritated expression. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d The legendary wish maker shouted, getting Riolu\u2019s attention. \u201cJust because I grant you wishes now, doesn't mean you can go and treat me however you want!\u201d At first, he was annoyed that his new toy was talking back to him like that, but as he stared at her, he realized the cause of his sudden sorrow. He was lonely. He was used to the solitude before, living in isolation with the forest, but he wanted more now. He wanted a friend that he could track to when he was down, somebody that could cheer him up with their presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Riolu stared at Jirachi, an idea to remedy this began to form in his head. \u201cI\u2019m...I\u2019m sorry, Jirachi.\u201d He apologized with genuine feeling, catching the little legendary by surprise. \u201cI got carried away, I guess. I just wanted to get bigger so much!... I forgot that I can hurt people when I\u2019m big, though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi expected the baby Pokemon to act like...his age, essentially. She had no idea how Riolu got so powerful in the first place, but she knew that, like all kids, he would bratty, selfish, and throw a tantrum when things don\u2019t go their way. So, hearing that he was actually sorry for his actions towards her made her feel more sympathetic towards her new captor. He was a kid, and didn\u2019t know what he had been doing is bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell...thank you. Just don\u2019t do it again!\u201d Jirachi scolded, to which Riolu let out a pained whimper that almost melted her heart. \u201cUm...hey, why don\u2019t you make another wish? That\u2019ll cheer you up!\u201d She tried to lift the spirits of the overgrown Pok\u00e9mon, knowing in the back of her mind it may very well cause more destruction and chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s really fun to be like this,\u201d Riolu explained, patting his soft tummy gently. \u201cI\u2019m big, and warn, and soft, and strong! But...it stops being fun when there isn't anyone to do it with.\u201d Suddenly, he grabbed Jirachi out of the air as gently as he could, careful to not crush her this time. She was surprised but was comforted that he was trying to rein in his strength for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJirachi\u2026\u201d Riolu made his wish known with a small blush on his bulbous cheeks. \u201cI wish you were just like me so that we could be best friends and get bigger together.\u201d Jirachi was taken aback slightly. She had made many a greedy wish true by selfish mortals, but she would never have expected one if the rare, good-natured ones to come from the monstrous Pok\u00e9mon that demolished an entire city. He looked on to her form with expecting eyes, waiting for a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi blushed back and gave Riolu a small smile. \u201cYour wish is granted.\u201d With that, she closed her eyes once again and began to channel forth some long-dead language that Riolu didn\u2019t understand. She thought that by granting this wish, she would be able to curtail his destructive tendencies, assuming that she herself would not give way to gluttony. But the nature of the wish was for her to become just like him, and before she could realize what that meant, the deed was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJirachi\u2019s body began to glow pure white, blinding Riolu\u2019s eyes and forcing him to close them shut until the light disappeared. When it went away and he opened his eyes to the world again, what was sitting in his pudgy palms was not the legendary Pok\u00e9mon he knew, but a little Riolu just like him. \u201cH-huh?\u201d He blinked at this new Pokemon, who just smiled and waved back at him in response. \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSilly, it\u2019s me, Jirachi!\u201d The other Riolu giggled with a feminine voice as she wiggled her way out of the main Riolu\u2019s grasp and flew up to his face to hug his fat cheek. \u201cOr, at least I was. But now I\u2019m a Riolu, just like you wished for!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaha! H-hey, stop that, it tickles!\u201d Riolu laughed with his sense of loneliness disappearing rapidly, Jirachi now filling the dark space in his heart. \u201cHmm...but you\u2019re not quite like me yet. You\u2019re still so tiny!\u201d He playfully smooshed the legendary turned jackal with his cheek into his shoulder flab, prompting a cute giggle from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe right now I am, but not for long!\u201d Jirachi grinned at her new best friend. Her whole personality had changed to Riolu\u2019s, it was almost as if there wasn't a speck of the original left save for her being a girl and still having the power to grant wishes. She flew down from his face and took a perch on his mountainous stomach, snuggling and nuzzling the plush sphere of fur and fat before laying back on it in comfort. Like he had done earlier, the first once again began to diminish as she took her fair share, trees and bushed ripping up from the ground and into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...is that how I look like when I'm eating?\" Riolu awed at the sight of Jirachi rapidly ballooning outwards with soft blubber across his stomach. \"I must be cute as a button because you sure are!\" Jirachi blushed and gave the bigger Riolu a happy wink, signaling she appreciated the compliment. She would have just said so, but her mouth was too preoccupied at that point.</span></div></div>",

Just a little more, and he was sure to have a feast fit for a growing giant such as himself. He can picture it now: countless exotic delicacies gracing his tongue, and later his soon-to-be-growing belly with their presence. Riolu could barely hold in his excitement! Not even that brownish thing hurtling towards his face will-wait, WHAT?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oww,</i> was all Riolu could think. In one blow, he was sent tumbling to the ground, dazed and unaware of what just happened. \"Hurry, pin him down before he recovers!\" By the time Riolu was able to fully process that command, it was already too late. One by one, his wrists and ankles began to stick to the ground, as if someone was holding them down. Looking around, Riolu quickly realized no one was grabbing hold of him; this was the work of a Psychic-type pokemon. But who in the world would have that kind of power, given the Fighting-type's size? It was then that he saw it: right by his head, there were 5 pokemon staring up at him. But they were no ordinary pokemon. No, these pokemon were from stories Riolu's mother told him when he was very young. These pokemon were the stuff of legends. These pokemon were practically gods. They were none other than the Swords of Justice, accompanied by Celebi, who, assuming the glowing blue eyes and outstretched hands were any indication, is the one responsible for holding him down like this. \"Whoa......\" the smallest Sword of Justice, Keldeo, remarked. \"I've never seen a Riolu this big before! I had no idea they came in this size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't,\" replied Cobalion, the group's leader. \"This is far from natural, the size of this Riolu. This almost looks like......\" Virizion, who is said to be the most graceful Sword of Justice, finished the sentence. \".....Black magic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now hold on,\" bellowed Terrakion, who, in retrospect, was most likely the thing that hit Riolu just a moment ago. \"Didn't we snuff out that practice centuries ago? We even had Heatran burn up all those books they used.\" Cobalion nodded slowly, lost in thought. \"We did, we did............or did we?\" Bemused looks surrounded him. Before long, he spoke again. \"Riolu, I want you to tell us how you came to be this size. And be honest.\"</span></div></div>",

Which he then promptly followed deeper into the forest. After awhile of chasing the loud quakes, Riolu finally found the obese Machoke waddling through the forest grove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you!\" yelled Riolu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Who said that?\" mocked Machoke when he heard Riolu's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, fatty!\" Riolu yelled, trying to get the self-centered pokemon's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Ohhh, hey, shrimpy!\" said Machoke. \"Almost didn't see you, cause you know: you're so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiny,\" interrupted Riolu. \"I know. That's only the 100th time you've said it! It's not that funny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not,\" said Machoke. \"But it's still true! Anyways, whatcha got there, flea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this?\" said Riolu, holding out the apple proudly. \"Just a little something I found...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad I just ate...\" said Machoke, slapping his large gut. \"Otherwise that food should go to me! Cause I'm just sooo BIG!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke rammed his belly right into Riolu, knocking him onto his back. Watching Riolu scramble to get back on his feet made Machoke let out a hearty laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A puny runt like you doesn't deserve food like me!\" continued Machoke. \"Only pokemon as big...\" he patted his giant stomach \"...as I am deserves to eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMachoke continued to mock Riolu for his smaller size, while still quite stupid, his comments infuriated Riolu to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT DOES IT!\" shouted Riolu, scaring a flock of Taillow in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout another word, Riolu ate a bite of the peculiar apple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're gonna eat your scary apple?\" teased Machoke. \"Ohhh! I'm so scared!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Machoke continued to laugh at the seemingly pathetic action, he failed to notice the pink glow beginning to shine from Riolu's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Machoke said in a fake-scared voice. \"The tiny, itsy-bitsy bug is going to eat a freaky-lookin' apple. Whatever shall I do? Whuh? Hey! Put me down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince he was too busy teasing to notice, Riolu had lifted Machoke in an unusual display of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put me down before somebody sees!\" demanded Machoke. \"If anyone sees me being lifted by a whelp like you...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Machoke could say anything else, Riolu opened his mouth as wide as he could, and in one big *GLUP*...the Machoke was gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh.......!\" moaned Riolu, toppling over onto his back and letting out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis once thin body was now stretched to its bursting point, trying to contain the amount of mass it just ingested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww...\" whispered Riolu, rubbing what he could of his dangerously bloated mid-section. \"...my tummy hurts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he ate a bite of that apple, Riolu felt like he could eat everything. But the effects must have worn-off, leaving the poor pokemon with a giant tummy ache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced back at the bitten apple, sitting a few inches away from him. Maybe eating some more of it would help ease the pain?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite it being so close, Riolu hardly felt like moving at all with his over-flowing belly.</span></div></div>",

All the Pok\u00e9mon from the forest came here one way or another to get a drink of water or bathe or just play around in. Riolu had always meant to come here, but he couldn't truly appreciate its beauty when he was starving. Instead of taking in the sights, the cute little thing looked around for anything to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope. Just water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiolu moaned out of frustration and pain. \"I just wanna eat. Is that too much to ask!\" He said to no one in particular. Riolu went to the water and sat down on the sand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do I have to be so small\" Riolu started to cry. \"I train myself every day so I can get stronger and evolve, but no matter what I do, I'm still the cute and small Pok\u00e9mon every one takes pity on!\" Now Riolu really was crying. He broke out into a waterworks of tears and was only compounded by the empty feeling in his stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Riolu's blubbering suddenly halted as he smelt something in between his sniffles. \" 'Hic' it smells like...smells like...\" He opened his eyes wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FOOD!\" Riolu shouted with upmost glee. He instantly got up and ran to the source of the smell. It smelled so good, it was like nothing he ever experienced before. This was the first time that he ever got so happy about eating, but after that incident with that bully Machoak, he needed to prove he wasn't the weakling everyone thought of him.

I don\u2019t have anyone else to give it to, you can have another if you want.\u201d He didn\u2019t understand what she meant until a smelled another pie, just as good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Knowing the woman wouldn\u2019t understand him if he talked, he uncovered his face and nodded. \u201cOkay then, give me a sec.\u201d the lady went back inside and went to the window to pass him another pie. Riolu then swallowed a few bites slower then before until he finished. His stomach was poking out a little more again as he did a baby burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like you enjoyed that, didn\u2019t you sweetie?\u201d The Riolu nodded again. \u201cI\u2019m glad you do; I\u2019m sorry but I gotta go to sell the rest nearby, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d She walked off as Riolu waved and headed to the other direction. This was going to be interesting. \u201cHow lucky was I?\u201d Questioned Riolu.</span></div></div>",

He remebered a man, whose shirt had the same logo as the truck, running away from the forest. Riolu decided this was that man's truck. Riolu opened the truck and found some human food. He thought 'Well, technically the man ran away, so it is not theft' and dug in. He started by eating some donuts, then began munching on  hot dogs. His thin frame was getting filled as his stomached rounded. Riolu haven't eaten for a long time and enjoyed stuffing himself. After he ate, he fell in food coma.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When Riolu woke up, it was already night. He stood up, feeling different. He saw a puddle close to the truck and went to it. When Riolu looked at it he saw that all the food was digested but not without a mark - he had a small belly. 'If I keep eating like this, I will get bigger than Machoke. And I like stuffing myself... I will show that moron who is stronger!' said Riolu. Just then his belly rumbled again. 'Better get some food' he said. Riolu went back to the truck. He began eating. When Riolu felt full, he continued eating, begin impatient to outweight Machoke. After stuffing himself to the brim, Riolu began sleeping.</span></div></div>",

It seemed that with each passing meal, Riolu grew just a little wider, a little rounder, a little softer. By the end of the week, his stomach had effectively doubled, maybe even tripled, in size. His thighs were beginning to swell outwards, ballooning with fat. Bit by bit, Riolu was growing, and he couldn't be happier. Well, except for one thing. Maybe two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes, whenever Riolu felt especially lonely, he would hug his tail, similarly to how human children would hug their blankets or toys. But with his added girth, Riolu began to notice that it was becoming harder just to grab the darn thing to begin with. Not too much harder, but enough for him to see a difference. And just an hour ago, he tried testing his new size by lifting nearby rocks and punching the truck in hopes of making a dent. Moderately sized stones that originally weren't too much of a hassle to throw were now nearly impossible to lift off the ground. Punching the sides of the truck had little effect, even when putting all of his might into it, which only succeeded in hurting his arm. It was as if his muscles were disappearing, rather than growing. Brushing his worries aside, Riolu continued eating the block of cheese he had opened. Maybe he just needs to eat a little more. Suddenly, Riolu's ears perked up, detecting noise nearby. Nervously, he walked towards the source of the strange noise, but before he could exit the truck, Riolu found himself face to face with.....</span></div></div>",
