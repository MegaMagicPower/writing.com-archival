            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> I crouched on a thick branch at the top of a large oak tree, snarling down at the uniformed men like a savage. Still I kept quiet enough for them not to notice me over the crunching of their standard issue boots through the leaves. There were maybe two dozen of them, all in crisp blue coats, with military style hair cuts, short and neat. Everything about them was stiff and methodical, maybe a private army. They poked around the forest, pushing back braches and peering up into trees, none of them looking high enough to spot the branch I had made my perch.I could just see through a gap in the leaves to a clearing off to my right, in the clearing stood even more men, they too had a stiff, cold demeanor, but these men stood in black suits, just as crisp and clean, and occasionally one would raise a little black box to his lips and talk into it as if it could hear him. They had black vans with tinted windows that I couldn't see inside. I didn't know who these men were, or what it was that they wanted, but there were two things that I did know. The first, was that these had been the men that had destroyed my people, that had attacked my clan, they had been the ones to take away my parents, my friends and all twelve of my siblings. I was the only one left, which brings me to the second thing I knew, they had seen me, they I knew I was here, and now they were looking for me. <br>\r\n I had sent out a message to my people, desperate to communicate the way my whole clan did, telepathy. I projected my thoughts as hard and long as I could, trying to send a stronger signal to anyone who may be still alive, but I got nothing, either everyone was dead or they had been taken out of my range. I may have been communicating through the mind my entire life, but my power was still relatively weak compared to the older folk, the person I wished to communicate with had to be within a certain range, or my thoughts would never reach them.<br>\r\n \"Hey!\" I heard a voice call from below, \"up there in the oak!\" one of the blue coated men stood below my tree, pointing up at the branch on which I sat, I hissed down at him like a panther, showing him my yellow teeth, and baring the canines that I had sharpened into \"fangs\".<br>\r\n In an overwhelming rush I suddenly found ten or so men under me, a lot of them yelling up at me all at the same time, making it hard to understand what it was they were screaming. If that wasn't hard enough they were all using their mouths to speak, a method that was completely foreign to me, it was hard enough to understand one man trying to communicated in this fashion, much less all ten. I brought my hands up to cover my ears, continuing to hiss down at the strange men below me.<br>\r\n I watched in confusion and instinctive terror as a small group of blue coated men trotted off toward the  black vans, opening the back and taking out a large net and a some sort of tube with a handle attached to it. With these instruments the men jogged back to the base of my tree, spreading the net out among the men, having each soldier hold a section of the edge. I watched as one of them, the only one who did not hold a section of the net pointed the opening of the tub at me.  <br>\r\n My wild eyes widened with fear and I scrambled higher into the tree top, desperate to get away from the strange object pointed at me. I gave a yelp as I felt a sharp pain in my left thigh. I looked down at it to find that a sort of dart, like the kind my older brothers and I liked to make to throw at small animals like squirrel or chipmunks stuck out of my leg. I barely had time to wonder about this odd dart, something was wrong with the forest. Why was it spinning? The forest didn't just spin. It must've been the working of the blue men. I twisted to face them below be, intending to take up hissing at them once more, and that's when the world went black.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Would you look at that?\" came the amused voice of a man. \"This kid's filthy, I can't even tell if it's a girl or a boy. Heck I don't even know if it's human!\" I opened my eyes very suddenly, that voice, it had been inside my head that's for sure, but these men, they spoke using their mouths, didn't they? I tried to turn my head, but it throbbed with such a deep pain that I didn't bother to try again. Through the corners of my eyes I could see that two of the blue men sat on either side of me, each on a bench which protruded out of the wall, even as my head swam I could make out the dark squares of tinted windows. I was in one of their vans. As I started to gain my senses I began to hear more comments inside my own head, they all belonged to one of four voices, two of which must have belonged to men I couldn't see. This all confused me, everything that I was hearing didn't seem to be open for all to hear, so why was I hearing it? Did they not know how to guard their thoughts? That was a skill that every child in the Luna clan learned at a very young age, now the process came to me by second nature, I hardly ever gave it a second thought. How else did you keep others from reading those few privates thoughts that you never wished to be heard? It was all so overwhelming, all of that information bombarding me at once. Though I was awake my head still swam, hindering my concentration, I closed my eyes, trying my best to block it all out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, when I had finally managed to ignore the voices to the point where they were merely faint whispers in the back of my mind I again opened my eyes to the world, taking in much more than I had the first time. I managed to lift my head just enough to glimpse the tight leather straps that bound my arms to a sort of metal table that rose in the middle of the van. I couldn't see them, but I could feel similar straps around my thighs, ankles and waist. I glared at the straps, almost as if I could set myself free just by scowling at them. I Tightened the muscles in my arms, causing the straps to dig further into my flesh, crisscrossing over the dark, swirling tattoos that curled up my forearms, a symbol that showed I belonged to the Luna clan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the men I had noticed earlier spoke in their odd fashion, and I didn't bother to listen to their thoughts, but I did glare at the one on my right, that was the one who I had traced the first voice back to. \"I'm a girl!\" I spat his way, communicating with my mind of course. I watched him jump, trying to keep his stiff demeanor. I opened up my mind to his thoughts, still trying my best to ignore the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be going crazy,\" I heard him think to himself, \"Hearing voices and things,\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Over here idiot!\" I thought back, \"You know, your prisoner?\"  I saw his expression change from stiff, to scared, to surprised. He shifted his weight, moving more toward the edge of the bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you hear that?\" he asked the guy sitting on my left, of course, using their strange method of talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear what?\" the other man asked in a bored tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" I projected to both of them, were they stupid or something? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time I watched the other man jump, his face going through the same rapidly changing emotions. Both pairs of eyes were now fixed on me, both men inspecting me, taking in my long brown, tangled hair which had never been cut, the leaves, branches and twigs that snagged in it, some worked in so deep that my hair curled over it, growing on around it. I watched as their eyes examined my tattoos which swirled up my arms, legs, sides, ribcage and shoulders, as their eyes passed over my skin, darkened with dirt and by the sun, and my green eyes that matched the colors of the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finally got sick of them staring at me like I was the strange one. \"What are you looking at??\" I thought at them both, no reply, \"cat got your brain?\" I asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shared a look of amazement, which baffled me, what was so weird? I mean I understood that they talked to each other in a different way than was normal, but surely they were telepathic as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-is that you?\" the man on the right asked out loud. He stood over me now, staring down at me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes, \"No it's the forest monster,\" I thought at him sarcastically. \"seriously now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" he stuttered, but he didn't get much farther than that, because after he muttered his second I, he fainted.</span></div></div>",
