This feeling did not last long as you quickly discovered that you were now about three inches tall and shrunk out of your clothes. Fear swept over you as you realized the severity of the situation. You had to find someone to help you quickly before the unthinkable occurred. You slowly crawled down the side of the bed and eventually reached the floor. Everything was huge to you, this would be quite an adventure there was no doubt about that. You had always had a fantasy about being in a similar situation but you never thought you would have to live it out. This was real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     As you reached ground level you knew that there was no use staying in your room. So you headed towards the door in search of someone to help you. You have no idea how they will react to seeing you at this size but it is your only choice. Now at the door, you must decide where you are heading. There would probably be people in the kitchen, as well as the living room. However, Tiffany and Melissa could still be asleep. Eventually you made your choice and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you make your way to her room you hear whistling coming from Tiffany's room and realized that today was cleaning day which meant Jane was over. As you came to the entrance of the room, you saw that Tiffany was still asleep, and Jane was dusting. Her beautiful body slowly swaying back and forth to the music from her CD player. This presented you with a whole new opportunity. You had always had a crush on Jane and figured she would be willing to protect you. Though, the last time she was over, you did yell at her for loosing your shirt. She could still be mad at you. Just then, you realized that you couldn't just stand there all day. You needed to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do to be found?</span></div></div>",

As you approached the top, Jane picked up the bucket, the sudden shift threw you into the bucket. There was no way to escape so you decided to just stay calm. A couple of hours later, you realized that Jane was getting ready to leave. As she reached her hand into the bucket to retrieve her supplies, the bucket belong to your family, you decided to let her grab you. As she lifted you out of the bucket, she stopped for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you notice you?</span></div></div>",

She lived in a small home and normally watched over her two nieces. The two girls were twins of 19 years old. They both had blonde hair, green eyes, athletic builds, great busts, but different personalities. Caroline was more motherly and tender, while Grace was more social and wrapped up in the equal rights scene. You had seen them once or twice but never really spent much time with them. Until now, that is. You had always thought Caroline had a thing for you. You wouldn't mind being her little pet. Grace had always scared you, who knows what horrors she would expose you to. As Jane put the cleaning supplies inside, you let go of the bottle and landed safely on the table. You looked around and realized the strangeness you were now presented with.

It was a good fifteen minutes until Caroline returned with food. She had brought you a cupcake. \"Here you go.

It was hard to grip the denim but you held on as Melissa got into the car. You were just about to grab onto her white blouse just as the air conditioning started up even before she shut the door. You were caught off guard and was lifted into the air. You tried to direct your fall but to little avail. You looked down to see where you were going to land.

You knew someone would be willing to help you. The problem was, where were you going to look for help. You were only so big and the mall was a huge place to you. You needed to make up your mind. You knew a blonde haired female who worked at the food court since high school. She seemed to have liked you. However, you know that Kelly's best friend worked at the Victoria's secret. She would probably help you but not for certain. You were also kind of hungry, so you kind of wanted to stop by the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you go for help?</span></div></div>",

Your downward velocity was about that of a small rock, and with the wind tugging at your body as you dropped it feels the part. You had since given up on trying to maneuver, and your understanding of gravity makes you realize that where you land is entirely up to chance. Finally, you do land, yet earlier than you hoped. The first thing you notice is that you're not dead or in multiple pieces, which is good news. The sensation of landing in something that was not entirely solid hits you, and a brief imursion in what could only be described as swamp-like befalls you. Upon opening your eyes which were forced shut by the speed of your descent, you quickly find out what your situation is as you bop to the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in Melissa's yogurt cup, covered in the lactic goo. Not too bad in terms of a soft landing, and you weren't complaining. As you start wading through it toward the side of the cup, you feel the expected jostling of your container in Melissa's left hand. This is was probably due to the car's movement out of the drieway. You crane your neck upward, and using the woman's mountainous breasts directly overhead as a landmark, realized you were being held at about chest-level. Melissa's other hand, just out of your span of view, rested on the car steering wheel, as she hummed softly to herself (loud enough in your ears to be the distinct tune of a song you recognized) while driving. Now that you knew you weren't in immediate danger, you had to begin planning. There was no way you could stay in this yogurt... there was no telling when she'd decide to eat from or discard it.</span></div></div>",

Upon hitting the ground, you realize that your prediction was correct: you had landed outside, through the door Melissa had just opened seconds beforehand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou find yourself on the forgiving ground of your house's door mat, with the enormous staccato lettering of \"WELCOME\" plastered across it. You landed in a sitting up position, virtually unharmed save for some shoot pains in your wrists -- a consequence of trying to break your fall out of pure reflex. Your addled vision cleared at last, you find a much more startling view in your sight now. You had fallen ahead of your older sister, and your current location was right in her path; and you realize in fright that in a matter of seconds her thunderous footfalls would become footsteps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking forward to becoming two-dimensional so easily, you jolt up to stand, with life-saving adrenaline surging through your veins. The flip-flop clad foot of your towering, redhead sister hovers above you, the encompassing shadow of it dwarfing you in its radius. But you don't let the hopeless sight deter you as your legs are forced into motion, and you make a desperate dive roll to avoid being crushed by those enormous feet. The sound of the door shutting (defening in your ears) forms the backdrop as you brace for impact, hoping that your last minute grope for survival would be enough. </span></div></div>",

Her name was Kelly and she had jet black hair, green eyes, and a great personality with a body to match. You use to go to work with her and watch as she made all different types and kinds of sandwiches that the grocery store would then either package and sell or sell fresh. You were especially fond of her vegetarian sub, and pressed lettuce, tomato, and cheese sandwich. Eventually you made it to the bakery section. You then started the long climb up the counter.

A second after you heard those sounds, one of the other girls while reaching past the plate for some bacon from a basket, bumped the plate, turning it just enough so that you could turn your head to the left and look up to see who's plate you were on. You were just in time to see your younger sister, Tiffany, wolf down a large three-layered section of pancake. She chewed thoroughly and you watched her neck bulge a little as she swallowed.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You were panicked, but confident that she would see you, because at three inches, you weren't exactly invisible, especially to someone that would be looking down many times at the plate you were on. You figured that once she got to your section of her breakfast she would have to see you; you just hoped you didn't get a fork in your back before she noticed. One problem was that you weren't sure on how your sister would react to having you on her breakfast plate; she did have a strange personality and she also loved to eat all the time, though some how always stayed in shape. You didn't think she would intentionally eat you. Your confidence in your sister was weakened as she remarked a few seconds after swallowing that first bite, \"Mmm, these pancakes are so yummy. I'm so hungry this morning, I might eat anything that ends up on my plate.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What she said, increased your fear that this situation would be ending with you becoming a part of your sister's balanced breakfast. Looking up at her, you frantically waved your arms around. To your happy amazement, when she looked down to get ready to cut out her second bite, she gasped almost silently as she saw you. Her mouth stayed open slightly; she didn't say a word. You were happy because you thought that this meant that she was going to free you and get you help, but the longer she sat thinking, you wondered if you were safe in her care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

However, you became aware of the fact that before Tiffany hid you, you could see her mouth the word \"later\" to you. She was probably going to eat you later, you had to find a way to escape before that happened. As for now, you were trapped in between Tiffany's waistband and stomach area. A few moments later you could feel Tiffany get up from and table. You had heard her say something about going out for the day. You knew she had other plans for you, and you were scared. You could each step as Tiffany got into her car and began to head out for the day. Once she was in the car, she pulled you out of her waistband and licked you clean of the sticky syrup. \"So, I see you've been shrunk, little bro.\" she said with a smirk, \"I may have saved you at breakfast but don't think I'd do it again. But right now we are going to have fun all day. Just brother and sister time.\" You gulped as she mentioned her intentions. \"Here's the problem,\" she began again, \"I don't know where to go first. We could go to the mall, my friend, Karen's, house, or we could head out and enjoy the beach. It is your choice.\" You thought for a moment. You wanted to choose wherever gave you the best chance of escape and survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did you choose?</span></div></div>",

Just then, Tiffany recognized one of her friends in the distance. As she went over, you found it hard to keep a handle. It was not long before you found yourself no longer with Tiffany. You look around and see that there were some avenues of help nearby.

They seemed to be having a great time as they were enjoying their picnic. As you got close enough you saw that they were eating a huge lunch. You tried to get their attention and before too long one of them noticed you. \"What do we have here,\" the female said. She had a very tan complexion and it was obvious she was Latina, blue eyes, and a great body with long brown hair. You tried to explain your situation but she was not listening to you. Instead, she was busy talking to the other female. The other female was of Asian heritage, she had an athletic body, long black hair, and green eyes on a great face. You couldn't believe your luck, they both seemed very nice and you were attracted to both of them. However, your feelings changed as the Latina looked at you again. \"Ok, little man. Here are your choices. You can either join our picnic or you can be our slave. Your choice.\" You contemplated both choices, you were hungry, and it was very nice of them to invite you to join their picnic but you wouldn't mind being their slave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was your choice?</span></div></div>",

Helena rattled off the list of the contents in the basket. Everything sounded wonderful to you and asked if you could just have a salad wrap. Naomi began preparing the wrap, as she spread salad dressing on the tortilla you couldn\u2019t help but realize that the tortilla was massive. Then she piled it with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, and a dash a pepper and then proceeded to roll the wrap. Naomi placed the wrap in front of you and the size of it loomed over you. Naomi and Helena just stood back and admired you as you ate. It was a little unnerving but you didn\u2019t think of it. <br>\r\n     While you were eating, the two women were whispering to each other. You overheard Naomi mention how tasty you looked. This set off a flag and you tried run away. But before you could escape Helena\u2019s hand grabbed you. \u201cWere you just going to eat and run, little guy?\u201d the Asian beauty asked. Before you could respond the two goddesses stuffed you in the picnic basket and then headed back into town. They were roommates in the city and now you were the prisoner. A half hour later, you found yourself on the kitchen counter of the apartment. All the picnic supplies was put away and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. There was no one around and the door was open, you could escape if you wanted but where would you go? It was a toss-up.<br>\r\nWhat did you do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From her actions, you got an answer that definitely wasn't in your best interest. You watched as Tiffany's slightly open mouth turned into a smile with her teeth showing, then her lips came together and her tongue came out and ran across her upper lip. With her deep green eyes staring hungrily at you, you knew that your lovely raven-haired sister had decided that you looked tasty and would be good breakfast food. She brought her fork down to slice out the section you were in. You still couldn't wiggle free; you winced as you closed your eyes, figuring that you would be skewered by her fork. To your amazement, her fork came through the pancake, but not you. It had just barely missed you, even so, you weren't safe. You were still trapped between two pieces of pancake on the fork, as she brought it up to her mouth. Being stabbed by the fork would have been painful if it had happened, but you knew that what was in store for you would be worse. Tiffany wasn't the type of girl that swallowed her food whole. You knew that she loved to savor her food as she chewed it, and she would savor you just as much as she crunched and munched you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tiffany was obviously prolonging your agony of waiting for her to do the dead. She just stared at you thrashing about in between the pancake on her fork as she periodically licked her lips. She even took a few cute sniffs of you. Your sister, like she savored her food, was savoring the moment of having you on her fork like a normal bit of food about to feed her belly. You knew why she wasn't speaking or saying anything to you. She obviously didn't want anybody to notice you flailing on her fork. They might not look highly upon her devouring a member of the family. You knew Nora definitely wouldn't want her boyfriend to be chewed into pieces. Tiffany was done with the moment and was ready to eat you. You looked into her mouth as she opened wide, her eager tongue was salivating in anticipation, and you could see the darkness beyond. She moved the fork closer and closer and....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

She looked down and gave you sly little wink, which was basically her way of saying goodbye brother. After that you were shoved all the way into her gaping maw. Her mouth closed and you were encased in darkness. You felt as the fork was pulled out from under you and out of her mouth. You threw your arms around her undulating tongue. Survival wasn't an option at this point, unless your idea would work. You thought that maybe if you could survive being on her tongue long enough she would let you live. You held onto her tongue as tight as you could, as she chewed up the piece of pancake that had entered with you, while she was doing that, she did her best to shake you off her tongue. Since it was quite slick, it was hard to hold onto; the ring that you had made around her tongue with your hands holding together wasn't the tightest hold around her whole tongue, so almost constantly you were sliding back and forth along her warm and wet tongue. Though you were terrified about being devoured by your lovely sister, you couldn't help being turned on by the warm and wet massage feeling you were getting along the front of your body, you couldn't hold it and let loose some cream onto her tongue. You couldn't believe it, but she liked it and \"Mmmmed\" and \"Aaahhed\" at the extra flavor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Since it seemed like she wasn't going to get to chew you up because she couldn't get you free of her tongue, she decided to swallow the pancake and try and swallow you whole along with it. It almost worked. The suction created by her throat muscles swallowing the bits of pancake that tumbled past you, was very strong. You nearly lost your grip when your feet slid part way down her throat and it closed around them. The swallowing whole method didn't work so she pinned you tightly in between the roof of her mouth and her tongue and began sucking on your intensely. The full body sucking was actually so pleasurable that you accidentally let your grip with your hands loosen and you let go. Sensing it, she lowered tongue and quickly maneuvered you over to the left side of her mouth and down came her teeth, ending you. She munched and crunched on you thoroughly, savoring the moment that she won and her prize was making her brother just another part of her balanced breakfast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tiffany moaned in satisfaction as she swallowed your chewed up body down to her belly. She moaned again as she licked her lips. Melissa turned to her and said, \"What is with you Tiffany?\" Tiffany just smiled at Melissa, took another bite of pancake and said through chewing it, \"Oh nothing, it's just that these pancakes are incredibly tasty.\" </span></div></div>",

Before you can be engulfed by Tiffany's mouth, you see that Melissa spotted what was going on. Her sparkling blue eyes were open wide with intrigue instead of expected surprise. She smiled like she had an idea, and it became clear quickly. Melissa reached over and grabbed the fork out of Tiffany's hands. \"Hey! That's mine,\" Tiffany shouted, but not loud enough that others in the house could hear. You looked up at your new holder, your lovely older redheaded sister. Her plump red lips had more of an impact on her look compared to Tiffany's lips. Even though Melissa is your sister, you still loved the way she looked. She had a kind of  plump, middle of the road, body style compared to her sister's athletic appearance. She also had a magnificent pair of D-cup breasts. You were hoping that she would take you off the fork, save, and help you. Though her actions were just as unpredictable as Tiffany's usually were.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Melissa was a selfish person and just now, she showed her character by pointing out why she did what she did, though it didn't instill confidence in your situation on if you would survive this breakfast. She looked at you and giggled, \"Tiffany, I know what you planned on doing to our cute 'little' brother. I agree, it is the perfect use for him. One problem, I am the older sister, I get first dibs on how to deal with our 'little' brother situation.\" She licked her lips while you renewed your wild wiggling, knowing that you escaped being food for one sister, only to switch to be food for the other. Tiffany stormed off in protest. Melissa smiled, \"You're all alone with me now, with only one place to go. This should be an honor for you. I have seen the way you look at me, I'm your favorite sister, I'm easier on the eyes, having all the right curves. Well, this is where you get to become nourishment to improve the lovely body of your sister. I have nothing against you Sam, you have been a nice brother, but I can't pass up the chance to see what it is like to devour a scrumptious looking person like you.\" <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With that, she quickly and eagerly stuffed the fork full of you and pancake, all the way into her mouth, closing those fantastic plump red lips behind you. The fork came out clean. She rolled you around in her mouth to taste you. She liked your taste, giving many \"Mmms\" and \"Aaahs\". You situated yourself so that your head was facing the entrance to her mouth as you were trying not to slide backwards down her throat, by wrapping your arms around her tongue. This unintentionally helped further her love of your flavor, because it was hard to get a permanent hold on her tongue, so you slid back and forth on her slick, warm, and wet tongue, which you couldn't help be pleasured by it and her occasional sucking moments; this all ended with you depositing some of your cream on her tongue, to her liking. You had to admit that while you were scared about what was going to happen to you, the ordeal so far felt great. Though, it is a tight fit with all the pancake; some of it did end up falling back and getting swallowed. \"Sis! You've had your fun, yes I taste great, but there is no need to eat me. I'll let you do this whenever you want if you don't eat me,\" You shouted, but your pleas fell on deaf ears, because Melissa was too into the moment to care about your life. You are hers now, her ideal breakfast. You know there are only two ways for this to end. You felt it would be more interesting to be swallowed whole and roam around in her belly as she went about her day, but being chewed up, while it would be painful, it would be quicker than slowly digesting alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Melissa deal with you?</span></div></div>",

You had never been faced with a situation like this and had no idea how to handle it. Then, a very professional looking woman walked by. You grabbed on to her shoe strap as she walked down the hall. She had brown hair, green eyes with glasses, a tall body and a nice bust. You figured she was a professor. As she entered one of the rooms and sat down, you were able to climb her with more ease.

After a barrage of questions, Sarah asked one last question,\"Samuel, how would you like to be my pet?\" You thought about the question for a while, she was a very beautiful woman and she seemed nice enough. You saw she was getting impatient so you answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did you respond?</span></div></div>",

There were several lunch lines, each one serving a different kind of food. You looked around and saw that there was a good number of the summer school students here as well. If you could get away, you might be able to hitch a ride on one of them. However, you had to first figure out a way to escape. \"Well, my little morsel,\" Sarah said with a grin, \"What are you hungry for today?\" You examined the lines and tried to use foresight to figure out from which you could escape the easiest. \"Well?\" Sarah said impatiently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did you decide?</span></div></div>",

Obviously, you could tell that she was doing it to hide you; she didn't want anyone to know what she planned on having for lunch. You overheard the student explaining to Sarah that she needed an extension on a paper assignment. Sarah sighed, \"Fine Melanie, you can have the extension on the paper. Now please leave, I would like to enjoy my lunch in peace before I have to be in class in half an hour. I expect you to be there; you can't miss another class, if you do I will have to drop you.\"  \"Thank you Professor Sarah,\" Melanie said, as you heard her walking away. Sarah's hand lifted and you saw her looking around to see if anybody else was around. There was nobody, even within hearing distance; the dining hall hardly ever got full enough for people to be sitting in the back corner. That is why Sarah chose the place to sit down for lunch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mmm, no interruptions now,\" Sarah said with a beautifully wicked smile, \"Now, do as I commanded before, climb on into my sandwich.\" Reluctantly, seeing no other options, you climbed up onto the top middle of the triple decker sandwich and laid down in along the middle. The lettuce was like a cool bottom sheet on what would be an extremely dangerous bed. \"Prefect, right like that,\" she said, wanting you to hold still, \"A girl like me doesn't need ham on her sandwich when she's got Sam.\" You looked on as she laughed lightly an smiled as she tore open two ketchup packets, squirted some around the you, and then the last bit on you. She then placed the third piece of bread on top of you and smooshed it down. Of all the things you thought might happen today, you never expected that you would end up in the sandwich of a beauty like Sarah, bent on you being her lunch. She picked up the sandwich and brought it up to her face. Your head was slightly sticking out the front end. You look down to see her wonderful cleavage, then up to look into her mesmerizing green eyes which were focused on you, and finally, you looked forward at her lovely plump red lips, just in time to see her tongue sexily slide across her lips in anticipation of the meal you are going to become. Even though you were scared, you couldn't help be turned on by the thought of feeding her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well little morsel,\" Sarah said, \"Enjoy the view while I devour you.\" You cringed as you saw her mouth come forward, but as you heard the deafening crunch, you realized that she was starting with the parts you weren't in first. You watched as she slowly chewed and then swallowed, seeing the lump travel down her gullet. You knew that you would soon be making that trip, whether you would be in one piece for the journey, you didn't know. She took another bite; this time she took it out of the other corner next to you. After she swallowed, she looked at you, smiled, and her mouth opened. In you went, engulfed by her hungry maw, her damp but sweet breath washed over you. You figured she was prolonging the bite down to toy with you. It didn't last for long, as all the light disappeared as her mouth came down around the whole part of the sandwich that your top half was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next? Did you get chewed or swallowed?</span></div></div>",

She savored the bite, munching and moaning until she finally swallowed it a minute later. \"Mmm, scrumptious,\" Sarah said as she licked her lips to get a bit that had stuck to them. It didn't take long for her to savor the rest of the sandwich to finish her lunch. She let out a cute little burp and rubbed her belly, \"That was the best sandwich I have had in a long time. I wish I knew how the little morsel shrunk; I wouldn't mind getting to eat other people.\" She got up and put up her tray, then went to her class. She decided to give her students a pop-quiz. The whole time her stomach churned her special lunch and she really started to feel energized. She normally finished a teaching day tired and rundown, but today she finished feeling like she could do anything. She got home and finished a few career advancing projects she had been putting off, and went to bed late. She got up the next day feeling more rested than ever before. While getting ready for another day of teaching, she noticed that her skin felt and looked smoother and like she was five years younger. She also noticed that her ass looked rounder and more shapely than before, so she wore a tight pair of dress pants to class and loved the attention she was getting from the male students, and even some of the female students.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sarah came to the conclusion that eating you had had a profound effect of anti-aging and bodily development. For weeks, she was on the look out for more shrunken people; she wonder if the effects would build up, because she definitely loved looking like she was in her early twenties. Then one fateful school day, she walked into her office after having gone to check her mailbox and noticed a pile of girl's clothing on the floor. She then felt a little prick on her foot and looked down. There next to her foot was a three inch tall redheaded girl jumping up and down, waving up to her. She bent over, picked up the little girl, and brought her up to face level. It turned out to be one of Sarah's problem students, the busty and beautiful Melanie, the one who pestered her a few weeks ago for a paper extension, almost ruining her lunch with you. \"Help, help Professor Sarah,\" Melanie shouted, \"I don't know what happened!\" \"A wish come true,\" Sarah said licking her lips, \"You are just in time for my lunch.\" </span></div></div>",
