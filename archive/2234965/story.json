The Guardian was shocked at what he heard as he turned to look at Tikal, \u201cAre you suggesting that use this to forcefully transform people?!\u201d His ancestor would nod showing a strong look of sadness on her face, \u201cI said it was something I wanted to avoid using for a reason but we are being left with seemingly no other choice just be careful as I believe this tool can corrupt the user my father was a surprisingly kind individual who only used it originally to have enough people to protect our homeland so we could live peacefully but he grew to want more and more taking over and converting many other civilizations over time I may have been unable to help him but I can certainly do whatever possible to keep you from becoming a monster.\u201d Knuckles sighed as she was likely right and he was happy that he had someone looking over his shoulder to keep him in line but he still wasn\u2019t completely comfortable with the idea as he grabbed the statue and left the underground area just to see it close back up upon leaving. \u201cI guess I should start recruiting...\u201d</span></div></div>",
