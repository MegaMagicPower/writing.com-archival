How dare he endanger Kyrie and kill the head priest and act so cocky and nonchalant as though he did nothing wrong. He murdered members of Nero's church, aside from Credo they were practically his home whether or not he actually enjoyed the \u201cHail Sparda\u201d bullshit. His arms tensed up as he prepared to feel flesh rend from bone as the sword, the order gave him, should have been cutting through the other halfbreed. But there was nothing there, just air, the force and momentum Nero had thrown into that attack caused him to stumble forward. Before he could regain his balance he felt a heavy blow to his back that knocked him to the floor and then felt the tread of Dante's boot pin him there and grind into his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all too easy, but the kid had spirit, the older demon had to at least give him that. He grinned at the younger demon under his boot and gave it another twist, making the platinum hair male cry out in frustration. \u201cI told yah kid, you wont beat me. I've killed demons with ten times the experience and power than anything you've thrown at me.\u201d The older male brought a hand to his mouth and yawned before rolling the male over with his foot and planting his heavy boot on top of his thick chest with enough force to knock the air out of him. Was this kid really another halfbreed with Sparda's blood? Who cares, the fact was he had his brother's sword. If he was going to swing that sword around he better damn well be deserving of it, that sword did not belong to any coward. \u201cTell you what, I'll letcha keep that sword. But.. well why do you need it so bad kid? You got a perfectly fine one that nutjob Sanctus gave yah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe platinum haired cocky youth snarled. That was all this was to the older male.. a game to see whether or not he was worthy to wield the yamato? \u201cKyrie is gone and there's gates opening up all over the fuckin world. Why the fuck am I explaining this to you, you've seen it. I need that power so I can stop all those demons and protect my city. What the hell do you-- GAH\u201d The boot ground its heel into his chest to shut him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKids, always dart around questions. No you dumbass I'm asking why THAT sword. That thing belongs in my family you know, I'm not gonna just letcha take it just because you think it looks spiffy.\u201d The demon chuckled to himself and then crossed his lean, toned arms getting a little impatient with the kid. Maybe he should just take the sword back and finish off all these amateur demons himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess that makes us bros then huh?\u201d He spat at Dante. \u201cMy devil powers, my arm and leg they react to the sword. They get stronger, a lot stronger when I have it. And when I'm not using it... it somehow just gets... sucked up into my arm as if they're one. I need that power.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the kid WAS an heir to Sparda, not only that but he could subjugate weapons and objects enfused with Sparda's energy or the energy of his descendents... \u201cInteresting...\u201d Dante mumbled to himself, tapping his lip with a finger but still keeping that mischievous grin of his. He couldn't just kill off another member of his family, even if this kid was very distantly related. But he couldn't let that sword risk being lost again, or worse captured by that bunch of retards, the Order. \u201cI gotta test your willpower. Sure you're gonna fight and keep fighting but.. are you willin to do -anything- to save your city. No matter how strange or humiliating? What happens if you're thrown in a situation and you can't rely on just senselessly brawling your opponent down. I wanna test your resolve.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't know how many times I gotta tell you I'm fighting to protect that city regardless of what the fuck I have to fight. Even if it's you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo no no you dork, not fighting. Are you gonna do anything to keep that sword, from what you said your victory depends on it. You willing to--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYES!\u201d Nero shouted, the strength of his voice causing the stronger demon to jump a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay. Kiss my boot. You humble yourself to your elder and I'll consider it you forfeiting this fight. And as such I'll letcha keep that sword. Hell I might even help yah out a little.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero's eyes widened for a moment, thinking this was some kind of sick joke. He didn't submit to anyone, sure he respected Credo and the Order but he wasn't some servant to them, but this... demon wanted him to demean himself to being a fucking boot licker? \u201c You gotta be--\u201d His face was pinned to the ground as the treads of Dante's big boot smothered it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon give righty a kiss, show him you love him and we can all move on.

He didn't imagine kissing a rubber sole would be the worst thing in the world. And if it would make that annoying dickhead in the red coat go away it was worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante raised a brow and then pulled his boot away. His lean shoulders dropped with disappointment, The test was supposed to make Nero fight his ego not just piss him off. \u201cToo easy I guess, you're not done kid.\u201d The younger but thicker male snarled, baring his teeth like an animal. \u201cThe test was supposed to test you so... lets make it harder huh?\u201d He cupped the heal of his boot with his muscular hand and slowly withdrew his socked foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the lip of the boot the round, white cotton bound heal emerged and immediately the thick scent of sweat from a whole day of nearly nonstop fighting filled the room. The younger male gagged and whipped his head to the side. He breathed through his mouth to avoid the rancid smell. Dante chuckled to himself. \u201cChill kid, that's the smell of a hard days work. You pull off those socks of yours and they don't stink you wern't doin enough that day.\u201d His foot continued to pull out, the sole was stained with a brownish coating. A mix of blood and dirt that accumulated over the course of his fights. The ball of his foot and his arch had holes where the thick rough skin poked through. The younger male only continued to glare at the other in disgust. \u201cOkay this time you'll have a two part test.\u201d Dante positioned his foot so that Nero had a view of his dirty sole as he spoke. \u201cThink of it like one of those annoying essay questions you have in highschool... wait you are in highschool right? Yer pretty young looking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d The halfbreed spat. He had just turned 18 only a day ago but he knew the other was just trying to get a rise out of him. </span></div></div>",

Anyway first part is gonna be pulling my sock off, with your mouth...\u201d He scrunched his toes up and uncurled them to taunt the poor guy. Nero gave Dante a look of pure bloodlust, at the same time his lips curled into his mouth as if he were protecting them from the anticipation of touching those drenched, dirty sock. \u201cFor the sake of Sparda! How god damn old are those things!? Have you ever heard of a washing machine.. Their disgusting!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red clad male just bellowed a laugh. \u201cWhen you're fighting demons you don't always have time for a clothes change. Besides the smell of sweat and dirt after you're covered with the blood of the monsters you just killed, chicks dig that. Anyway after you do that you'll notice my foot, especially righty, is pretty filthy from all this bullshit your Order started. Since your part of the order you're gonna make up for it by cleaning my foot. Just pretend you're a cat and lick it all up, don't be afraid to get in my toes.\u201d His white eyebrows narrowed and a sick grin drew across his face, already tingling from the thought of the lesser demon lapping at his toes for forgiveness like a groveling puppy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d <br>\r\nNero's brows arched in dismay, his lips uncurled to speak but before he could Dantes foot smothered his face from view. The foot glided all over his face until the demon felt the poor guy's nose trapped in the hole in the arch of his sock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nero could cuss with facial expressions alone he would be right now, he tried to curse the elder but the louder he got the more the older male forced his heal into the boys mouth, muffling him. The teen's back arched as he tried to resist breathing, with Dante's heal in his mouth and his arch over his nose.. the kid would have to breath in the musky scent of the males foot. Who knows when the last time he showered was... his chest contorted painfully and as if sensing his frustration he twisted his foot some more, coating his soft, perfect skin with a thick layer of oily sweat. The male grunted and winced in pain until finally he could take it no longer and inhaled deep enough to fill his lungs. A muffled snarl escaped as rancid scent filled his body. The smell was so powerful he could taste salt in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, now that you know what your up against you can take it off.\u201d Dante said with a little chuckle, his chest rising more knowing that sweet, wet tongue of his would soon be stimulating his foot. He watched the other with anticipation as he slid his foot down the boys face, the rough damp sock and thick skin scraping against the halfbreed's pillowy skin. His toes gave an excited twitch before forcing their way into the teens mouth. Not wanting to wait too much longer his toes felt around inside the males mouth and pinched his tongue between them. Nero twisted his head, trying to pull away and snarled in frustration, trying to suppress the urge to vomit. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cC'mon just get a grip on the sock and you can be done with this part.\u201d Those fiery dominating eyes of Nero's glared at the other for a long moment before he clamped his mouth down on the toes, pulling on the sock with his lips and catching the material between his teeth, all the while keeping that powerful look in his eyes. A look that said \u201cI'm doing this because I have to.\u201d Not the look of a broken man, he was nobodies bitch. Dante slowly pulled his foot away, his lightly haired dirty foot pulling emerging into view as the sock fell away onto Nero's face. Immediately he spat the sock away and his chest heaved. First this guy shows up and kills members of his church, sure he didn't buy the whole Sparda is our Savior crap but Kyrie was into it and he was still a member of the 'family' having been adopted by Credo, another ranking member of the Order. Ever since that.. other demon showed up demon gates start popping up everywhere, Kyrie vanishes, and now he wants to break him? Sure according to that... mad scientist Sanctus was alive and now a demon but what does he know? Credo despises demons of all sorts, he'd never side with a demon. Nero wasn't even sure what Credo would do if he found out he was a demon. This guy.. brought all these problems here and Nero had kissed his boot, sniffed his dirty foot and even licked and mouthed the socks off of him but that was as far as Nero was willing to go. The man had never kneeled to anyone he wasn't going to kneel to this fucker either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil bringer, the devil incarnate right side of his body including his right foot and hand, began to glow. His muscles twitched and seemed to swell a little as he drew energy from the sword he had absorbed. Blue and violet energies swelled around him, rending his clothes apart exposing his muscular frame beneath. He let out a sanguine cry and smashed his right arm into Dante. Dante watched the whole scene unamused and allowed the male to strike him, which only knocked him back a few feet despite the energy of the yamato powering Nero's attack. \u201cKid I told you it's useless. You've hit me with that thing a hundred times before, it wont do shit.\u201d Dante scolded, shaking his head at the idiot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero's intimidating frame looked truly menacing, his fair, soft, white skin that made up his muscular build contrasting sharply with the deep blue flames that curled around his clawed hand and foot. Only the shoulder and left sleeve of his shirt remained and everything below his calves had been burned away by the power as well. \u201cYou caused all this shit! I'm gonna pound you and that cocky fuckin attitude into the ground and spread your ass like paste all over the floor. I'll rip your ass apart feed whats left to the wild dogs, you're not worth more than dog shit anyway fuckin demon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante raised a brow but kept his arms crossed. \u201cI love it when you dumbasses think demon is an insult.\u201d He mumbled. This time he was gonna let the idiot waste his energy hitting him, he'd have to just show the retard how much weaker he was by ignoring him like a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero brought his arm back and the demonic energy he had been emitting gathered into the palm before he fired his arm itself at Dante, the hand magnifying hundreds of times until it was large enough that he could crush the other in his palm. The older demon forced a yawn just before the giant hand smashed into him, slamming him into a wall. The younger demon retracted the giant arm and palm attacked the wall he had smashed Dante into again. The barrage continued over and over until dust filled the room and Nero had run out of energy. His tired form arched forward, chest heaving and sweat dripping off his brow. \u201cI was pissed.. but man I didn't think I still would have enough energy to throw that attack at your punk ass that many times. Yer not sayin nothin, take that as I knocked your ass out? Hope I knocked your fuckin head off.\u201d He clenched his fist and walked through the debris cloud to the pile of rubble. His glowing blue eyes scanned over the crumbling bits of god knows what happened to be in the way of his mighty fist. But there was no sign of Dante. \u201cHuh... theres.. no way he dodged the hall is too narrow I'd have noticed him moving even at his high speed. Fuck! Where the hell are you Dante!? You fucking coward!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You fucking coward!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Dante was in plain view. <br>\r\n-backtracking-<br>\r\nAs the fist caught the older male the force was enough to get a small grunt out of the demon as he found himself flying backwards into the wall. The speed at which he hit the wall had pressed him deep into the stone, deep enough to imbed him there. Of course with demonic strength he could easily break away the stone and probably snap that Devil arm's wrist at any time but the point wasn't to do that. It was to do nothing at all so Nero would realize the gap between them and stop being an idiot and listen. He watched with bored orange eyes as the palm reared back for another strike, and another. The demon winced lightly with each hit and mused to himself how Nero seemed to solve all of his problems by crushing it with that arm of his. \u201cI'm gonna say he's outta energy now.\u201d The demon mumbled to himself after the fourth hit, pulling himself from the wall and stepping toward Nero. He wondered if the kid could even see him through the debris field, didn't matter though. Then something caught the legendary demon slayer off guard, a strong gust of wind knocked into Dante. \u201cThe hell?\u201d He casually rubbed debris from his eyes in time to catch sight of the giant blue dragon palm about to smash into him. \u201cAgain?\u201d Dante was surprised by how many times this kid could reproduce that attack of his but continued to ignore it. This time was different though. <br>\r\nAir left the demons powerful chest, causing him to cough and keel into the hand as it smashed into him, and then forced him into the wall. When the arm retracted Dante fell to his knees and glared at Nero through the cloud. \u201cI don't know how but he just got stronge--\u201d He was cut off by the palm suddenly smashing into him again. \u201cAnd faster...\u201d Dante thought to himself, finding himself in true pain for once in this fight. Any and all air that he had managed to reclaim after that first blow was crushed out of him in this one. The contours of the scaled and leathery skinned palm ground into his body, even if he possessed the strength to throw the hand off, he was crushed by the hand, none of his muscles could move under the pressure. Not even his chest. When the hand pulled away the force of the previous blow had pressed the air both out of Dante and out from between Dante and the hand for a moment the demon found himself plastered to the Teens palm, but that was just long enough for the giant fingers to curl around his body and pin him there as Nero prepared another blow to the wall where he believed Dante was. This time he kept his arm in a fist and through the last bit of his power into the hit, the force obliterated the entire stone wall and caused Dante to grunt in pain from inside the hand. \u201cWhere the hell is this power coming from.. that last attack should have drained him... he shouldn't even be standing anymore.\u201d He narrowed his eyes in the confines of the hand. \u201cThe yamato shouldn't be giving him this power...\u201d That was it, Dante knew what was going on and a look of horror dominated his normally collected demeanor. \u201cThat half of his body can subjugate power from Spardas line... he's sucking up my power and hitting me with it without even realizing it. Fuck... Dante you got yourself in a damn good mess this time.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero cancelled out his demonic energy and the arm returned to its normal size and more organic appearance. But the weakened Dante did not emerge. \u201cHn.. that bitch ass demon must have packed his shit and ran. What ever, I have the sword, I'll find him sooner or later. When I do I'll be even stronger, if he got chicken shit over this I can't wait to pound his ass when I'm even stronger.\u201d He casually paced over to one of the larger rocks, his bare human foot padding softly against the floor while his demonic foot effortlessly crushed and trampled over debris, lacking the sensitivity or need for protection that a soft useless human foot would. The young male took a breath, his sweaty muscular chest rose and bits of debris that had stuck to his sweat fell off, bouncing along the contours of his defined muscles before hitting the floor with a soft thud. Another breath of cool, fresh air that was now flooding the room due to the absence of a wall relaxed the male. His fists unclenched and a much smaller Dante fell out from his palm and landed between Nero's feet. Not seeing the tiny Dante, Nero sat down on a large stone and folded his arms behind his head. The cold air felt amazing as it washed over his nude, hot body. \u201cAhh.. I havn't relaxed since that fucker showed up. I forgot how nice it is to just sit back to catch your breath.\u201d He told himself, stretching his legs and unknowingly running Dante over with his demonic foot, mistaking him for rubble. As the male daydreamed he began to play with the rubble with his feet, rolling it around and grabbing at the rounder pieces with his toes. The stone floor and the rubble its self got cold fast from the winter air outside the castle, the chilled rock soothed his hot, sore feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dante was too shaken up by the whole thing to hear Nero talking, his head was spinning and he wasn't sure where his arms began or ended. It was like someone shook him so hard that his bodyparts themselves were jumbled, or thats how it felt anyway. \u201cDammit.. why did I let him hit me? I'm such an idiot. I coulda just beaten his ass but no. I let my ego get in the way and now look at me. When the hell is he gonna stop using his devil arm and go back to normal so I can get outta here?\u201d Dante didn't realize Nero WAS back to normal. Like its control of the Yamato the devil bringer had changed Dante according to its size and manifestation. It seemed its powers over the Sparda bloodline didn't just stop with objects and weapons, but people too. When Nero stopped to sit down and the hand released its grip the tiny demon continued to be stuck to the leathery palm for only a second before he found himself falling to the ground. On the way down Dante stared at the blurred image before him. Shrunk or not he still maintained his Devil heritage, it didn't take more than a second before his senses returned and his vision adjusted. Mountains of soft white hills flashed by his view, two of them had a small valley in between. <br>\r\n\u201cWhere the hell..?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing he saw was torn, scortched cloth which made its way down less than half of two giant towers covered in thin whispy... hair? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFuck... is that did he use my power to turn into a giant?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante thought to himself as he hit the ground, the fall hardly phased the devil, he laid there for a moment just staring at the colossus of muscle, fair skin, and an asshole attitude before him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, cant let him see me like this. He'd never let me live it down.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched the others face, it was pointed toward the sky. The giant pecks rose more than Dante's body height with each breath, and each breath was slow and deliberate. The giant ornery teen was either asleep or day dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhew, he wont notice me then. I just gotta figure out how the hell to undo this. I gotta find a way to contact Lady..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes scanned the area around him for the easiest, and sneakiest way out of the room. As his surprisingly placid eyes scanned the never-ending expanse that was the room he couldn't help but lock gazes with the bane of all things tiny... the foot of something bigger. In this case Nero's human foot, the male never thought something as sensitive, soft, and well low could be so intimidating. Considering feet stay hidden most of the time and you never really see it aside from a whole body length above he had never realized the sheer dynamic musculature of the foot, and how this was the last thing many insects and small animals see before being crushed to death. From the leg it sweeped down at an almost beautiful angle to the toes, each thick and muscled from extensive training and free of defects like crooked or swollen toes, probably due to having demonic blood.. stuff tends to correct faults in bones. Each nail was glossy and clear and had an almost imperceptible white outline to the squared off end, obviously Nero was more careful when it came to preening himself than Dante (who could just hack away and not care about the look of it.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTch, the guy's a metrosexual... figures.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The foot was covered with thick veins and contours of larger muscle attachments. His big toe rolled a small rock around before he began to roll the chilled stone under the length of his foot. The underside was taut, the skin by nature was strong but there were no excess of loose skin, no calluses and no flaking crap. Areas like the ball of the foot and the heal had collected dust from debris and Dante could see despite the smooth appearance the skin there still rugged and strong, not soft and silky like the feet of the many girls Dante had banged or worked with (..or both) With each movement he could watch the skin and muscle shift and adapt to even the tiniest change in substrate. Amazing how a simple change of perspective can make something look so powerful.. and this was just a human foot. Shaking his head to get rid of his fixation on the foot he backed up only to knock into something hard. The male spun and saw the demonic paw so close to him he could touch it. It looked the same in regards to shape as Nero's other foot only coated in a thick reddish skin and the top of the foot was protected by triangular scales much like the hand. The nails were replaced by thick claws and the toes were a little thicker, there wasn't as much difference in size between the toe pad and the shaft, it was more even and allowed the toes to press down and grip with much more power. The demon gasped, he'd had enough trouble with Nero's hand the last thing he wanted right now was to be crushed by a giant demonic foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright I'm getting outta here before that dick wakes up and thinks I'm a roach or something.\u201d He pulled himself up and began to walk away from the demonic giant, feeling no need to rush since the boy was asleep. The ground began to rumble causing the tiny demon to lose his footing. His head shot to the side to see what was going on. Brows raised and his eyes widened. \u201cSon of a...\u201d Neros giant demonic foot was heading right toward him, the heal grinding on the ground and the thick leathery sole of his foot facing Dante. Toes splayed and claws flexed as the giant male stretched his legs. There was nothing Dante could do, by the time he could even pull himself up the foot had ran him over. Dante grunted as the rough heal slid over his body. He could hear a deep bellowing yawn come from the giant as he finished his stretch. The demon pulled himself up from the ground he had just been pressed into and gave the foot behind him a glare as he dusted himself off. It wasn't over though, once the guy finished stretching he pulled his foot back to himself, dragging the thick sole over Dante and the debris around him. Dante coughed as his body became trapped under the giants arch, he tried to pull his face away from the musky scented leather but the giant demon pressed down harder as he pulled more debris in toward himself, forcing Dante's face deep into the folds of skin. Thinking Dante was just rubble the giant demonic paw rubbed down on Dante and rolled him from the ball of his foot to heal. Being a demon this thankfully didn't hurt Dante, who was simply squirming and thrashing trying to escape being a toy. Nero was getting annoyed with the fact that he wasn't really feeling the rocks under his demon foot he pressed harder which made Dante grunt uncomforably. It seemed the foot was realizing Dante wasn't a rock, rather than roll him it began to press down and shift ontop of him, twisting and turning until the entire foot and rubbed down upon the miniature demon. Deciding it was merely a piece of cloth rather than rubble he pulled his foot away. Dante lay face up panting and sweating from all the heat and pressure he had just endured. The foot panted its self next to Dante, he was hardly a third it's length. Toes began to grip at the floor, feeling around for something. Realizing Nero was feeling around for the \u201csoft thing\u201d he rolled over and started to crawl away, narrowly dodging the big toe, which almost grabbed his leg. The demon's hair was a mess and his chest was rising and falling like mad he was having a harder time escaping a foot than he had with even the most powerful demons in the past. Dante ran, or tried to but ended falling flat on his face, his coat was snagged on something.. He turned and saw the giant claw of Nero's big toe had hooked through his coat tail when it missed his leg. Worse the giant toes were still grasping at the floor and the foot inching around to find its toy.. him. Panicing Dante tugged again but the coat wouldn't budge. \u201cShit!\u201d The foot was coming right at him this time, he pulled his left arm out of the coat and just as he was pulling the right one from the snag a shadow overtook him. Dante jerked frantically but he couldn't escape. He could only watch in horror as splayed, clawed toes descended on him, the middle toes being as thick or thicker than his torso. The toes pinned him, his body tangled in the pocket between the toepads and the ball of the giant foot. He squirmed as he watched the world begin to vanish as the toes curled. The might of only three of the toes was enough to pin him. The giant digits relaxed finally but the space between the bottom of the teens foot and the pads of the five toes was not large enough to allow Dante release, he was stuck and none of his extremities could move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\nNero yawned again and crossed his biceps over his eyes. \u201cMmmm.\u201d Nero rolled his toes. He had very dexterous feet, when he was a child he wouldn't wear shoes if he could avoid it and he felt great pleasure trying to do everything people did with their hands with their feet. When you're an orphan you find weird dumb shit to do like that to entertain yourself. It helped that he had big feet with toes that were not only thick and muscular but long as well. Of course after he was in his teens using his feet to write or open doors was no longer a cute childish antic but just weird so he stopped to a degree. He would still toy with objects, dirt, or his dogs fur with his feet, and went shoeless where ever possible. When he slept he often would toy with the corner of his blanket or his other foot, and when he'd daydream or think he'd roll something around under his arch or pull his foot out and toy with his shoe. Assuming Dante was just rubble he had captured him with his toes and almost instinctively maintained just enough pressure to keep his toy stuck. He squeezed Dante with all five toes and then with one toe at a time before he fell asleep. As the demon slept the torture wouldn't end however, his toes would continue to squeeze and play with their captive, and in his sleep he wouldn't notice the squirming of the demon-turned- toejam but the stimulation of all that squirming would only make his toes play with the tiny man harder, like his thrashing was some sort of challenge. Each time he moved the toes would wrestle their little pet into submission. Dante, the strongest demon of their time, heir of the demon Sparda was now the pet to five giant sweaty toes. </span></div></div>",

At least in the dream world he found solace, dreaming he were having a normal day back at the shop with Lady and Trish, full of pizza, beer, and toying with weaker demons. It was a normal dream anyway until the ground started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunderous crashes were heard from outside and with each crash the next successive one was louder and louder. Dante dismissed it as another giant bird demon trying to attack him at the shop, nothing Lady and Trish couldn't handle. At least in his dreams he got to boss them around. He sent the two women outside and lazily reclined in his couch until a scream pulled his attention to the window. One of the girls was knocked onto her back by something, before the demon could tell what had attacked her a giant human foot descended from the sky and crushed her. His eyes widened and he raced to the window, his heart was in his throat and his legs were shaking. Did that.. giant just kill his employer and partner? He looked up only to watch the other female dangling from her legs from the giants massive scaled hand. \u201c...Nero!?\u201d The giant was fully clothed except chose to not wear shoes, probably to taunt the three tiny demon hunters with the size and stench of his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's eyes were aglow, as red as the fires of hell themselves, and as his thin lips parted his ivory fangs were like that of a dog. The platinum haired hunter could only try to swallow the fear that had gathered in his throat as he watched the woman fall into Nero's toothy maw. The beasts tongue unfurled and caught her like a slide, directing her towards the back of his throat. It curled around her body just before the mouth closed. Dante watched the small lump in his cheek shift from left to right a few times. \u201cHe's just... toying with her.. that monster...\u201d The demon opened his lips just enough for the woman to force herself through the opening in a desperate attempt to escape. He caught her by the tips of her feet with his teeth, the woman screamed as she was slurped back in like a noodle and then ground to nothing by the giant teeth. The giant turned his strong jawline down to lock eyes with the small demon staring through the window. Dante took a step backwards, his heart pounding painfully against his chest, that giant devil looked right at him.. like he knew Dante was watching the whole time. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe I'll even spare your worthless little demon ass.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon raised his human foot, exposing the blood and dirt coating the ball of his foot. The moonlight cast shadows across the contours of the shiny rough sole making it appear all the more menacing. With a simple sweet of the appendage the entire shop was obliterated. Dante reacted with cat like agility, he effortlessly weaved between the falling studs and walls and just before Nero's kick would hit him, he ducked under it. The rough sole of his foot gliding over the top of Dante's head, pulling his hair backwards and leaving it damp with sweat, blood and debris. As Nero brought his foot back Dante swung at the heel with his sword, but the skin was just too thick the blade just bounced right off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man snatched the blade but his timing was off, before he could jump out of the way the leathery dirty sole knocked into him and the man found his head caught between Nero's toes. Despite Nero not knowingly grabbing the hunter like that the toes seemed to have a mind of their own. They wiggled around Dantes face and squeezed his head deeper and deeper between them while the others grabbed at his back and shoulders with painful strength. Dante pulled but it was no use, his eyes burned from the salty sweat, he inhaled it and when he gagged he got a mouth full of toejam and sweat which burned his very soul as he swallowed it. The five giant toes continued to pull on his tiny body, eventually two got hold of his arm and used it to drag the rest of Dante into their sweaty, bloody grasp. They hugged him with a painful grotesque embrace but before they could force the demon hunter back into submission they had to splay out as their ignorant owner was about to bring his foot to the ground.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dante used this split second of freedom to drag himself out, he forced his body through the larger gap between the first and second toe and stood atop the foot triumphantly Despite smelling like feet and dripping in Nero's foot sweat and covered with toejam and debris he felt empowered. He'd bested the captors that had made him their bitch in the real world, now onto the giant body they belong to. The demon hunter ran a hand through his hair. His once platinum bangs fell over his face in their usual style, only they were stained and looked more blonde and greasy than anything with the foot sweat and god knows what that had rubbed off onto his head. Before the giant could realize Dante wasn't killed by the kick Dante jumped off foot and ran up the leg. The size of a mountain or not Dante never had a lack of stamina, he unloaded a few shots from his gun into the demon's stomach as he ran. The bullets just bounced off. He drew the yamato and released his devil trigger lunging straight at the giants chest. He'd stab the sword in and kick it right into Nero's heart. But that didn't happen, Nero caught sight of the tiny male and caught the sword between two of his claws only just before it could stab his chest. Dante released the sword and lunged right at the giants face, aiming his guns at Nero's eyes which burned with fire as bright as two suns. The giant's grin turned to a foaming snarl as one of the bullets landed its target, causing the giant to wretch his face away and grip at the eye with his flaming devil arm in pain. \u201cSo you do have a weak spot. Eat this.\u201d Dante landed on Neros face, his legs onto of his giant lips his arm holding onto the nose and his other gun unloading bullet after bullet into the giant burning eyes. Nero growled and contorted in pain, trying blindly to swipe Dante off his face but with grace in his step the small male dodged each attack and continued to unload his endless barrage of ammo into the teen's head until the teen fell to the ground, face up, and the glowing eyes stopped glowing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devil hunter panted and pushed the rancid smelly bangs out of his face. \u201cDisgusting..\u201d He gagged, lifting the tail of his red gunner coat, and using it to try to towel off the oily sweat that had soaked his hair and covered his face. It was no use though his body was just caked in the stuff, someone could dunk him in water and he'd be pulled out completely dry from all oil that had drenched him. His clothing, including the leather gunner were soaked. The male sat down ontop of the dead giant's head and ripped his soaked clothing off. He pulled his boots off and turned them upside down, watching the thick salty sweat pour out. His own socks and boots were even soaked with more of Nero foot essence than his own. \u201cUgh, battle 'scars' or not I have to get this shit off..\u201d His nose still burned of the scent he was caked in. Thunder clapped overhead, Dante's heart gave an excitable beat but dropped in disappointment when no refreshing rain came to wash him off. The demon under his ass gave a twitch, Dante jumped back a few feet, staring in horror before calming himself down and spitting at the face of his foe. \u201cI forgot he's still like me, He'll recover from those shots to the brain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe male jumped off and snatched up the Yamato, he gave it a slash and cut Nero's shirt away exposing his thick musculature. He climbed back up and hiked over the mountainous abs, his sweaty body was slick though, without his boots he didn't have much traction. He tripped on one of the valleys between the abs and found his head plunged into the males belly button. Growling in irritation he punched the rock hard ab the rest of his body was laying on and tugged on his head. It was stuck. <br>\r\n\u201cYou got to be.. fucking kidding me..\u201d He mumbled, pulling again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally He gave one more great tug and toppled backwards, landing on his ass in the giant valley between Nero's pecks. He spat out a mouth full of lint and almost licked his arm to get the rest of the hair off before he remembered what his body was still covered with. With a triumphant grin he stabbed the sword into Nero's chest, no killing blow sure but once Dante rested a little, he could channel his energy through the blade and kill Nero for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry kid, but there's only room for one heir of Sparda and you take up way too much room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow about this.. stuff.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't even want to say to himself what ungodly substance he was coated in. <br>\r\nThe male looked around for a source of water, his shop was destroyed so was everything in site and though the sky swelled with water and blue streaks of lightening it refused to relinquish even a drop, as if the gods were taunting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC'mon.. just a drop\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pleaded to the sky, as if to taunt him again the sky released a single drop, twenty feet ahead of him. \u201cFuck you.\u201d He grumbled before setting his eyes on Nero's mouth. \u201c......hmn... I..\u201d He kept imagining his partner getting eaten as he stared at the giant maw. Nero was still alive but not going to wake up for a while. I can recharge my energy while I wash myself off... but.. in there? He asked himself, he looked around again but there was nothing. The sky gave another thunderous crash of lightening no more than a hundred feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cFine fine... ugh if this is Karma I must have done something just terrible.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hot steamy breath hit him immediately, normally he or anyone would cringe at the sight and feel, but when you're covered in rancid foot sweat an open mouth is as appealing as a sauna. He slid the lower half of his nude body in and then allowed himself to drop down into Nero's giant mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lips pursed shut and Dante could no longer see. Underneath him he could feel the giant muscular tongue, it throbbed with a slow pulse and oozed thick liquid saliva. The small bumby texture that covered it's surface raised in the small area the man layed in, the taste buds stimulated by the salty flavor, and the taste of the demon hunter himself. Under one of his feet he could feel a hard surface, a tooth no doubt. He traced over it with his toes to get an idea of its size, the one massive molar alone was probably the size of two of his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He felt the roof of the mouth, it was firm, wet and covered with circular ridges that grew larger toward the back of the mouth. He stared at where he knew the throat started and remembered his friend vanishing down the tunnel after being chewed up and burnt to oblivion from the hellish burp. \u201cLets get this over with.\u201d Using an encouraging tone to bolster his own iron will. The heat and humidity alone in the damp cave was enough alone to relax the muscles and lull one to sleep if they allowed their mind to wander. Dante disregarded the surprising comfort and began to awkwardly rub his body against the tongue, he pressed his face into the raised taste buds and scrubbed away the grime. His hair weaved between the raised buds as well as his body writhed against the tongue, which shifted and began to move on its own either by instinct or Neros mind awakening. Once his back was clean he flipped back over and wrapped his legs around the giant muscle for support. In this position he could only shift himself up and down as the tongue flexed underneath him and began to excrete more viscous saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Drenched in spit, Dante had to grip harder against the tongue. Taste buds swollen, tongue throbbing and shifting underneath him.. particularly underneath his cock.. it felt like a body. Heat and slick lubricating spit and the motion of both his own hips and the tongue filled the Demon's veins with hormones. His demonic sized cock swelled and bulged with veins like the arm of a body builder. He moaned and ground his hips against the giant throbbing muscle. Ramped up already from the stress and excitement of the battle before, and his triumph over the near invincible giant. His body shook as he was overtaken by heat and spit. He thrusted against the tongue harder and harder, the tongue, like the toes seemed to have a will of its own and smashed the demon against the roof of the mouth. As Dante continued to fuck the giants tongue the tongue smothered the pathetic form and dragged his body back and forth over the sensitive ridges of the upper pallet, dangerously close to the throat. It twisted and contorted, the hot rough muscle wrapping around him and playing with his body as the hard ridges rubbed painfully against his back. He cried out in pain and the tongue only responded by grinding his body harder into the walls of the mouth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pleasure wound up like pressure, a giant spring within his being that was compressed to its max. Finally that pressure released, Dantes eyes shot open as he orgasmed with such power it unleashed his devil trigger. Hot white seed sprayed in copious amounts, coating the tongue. The transformed demon gripped the fleshy muscle so hard as he continued, still, to pound into it that the tongue began to bleed. Once his cock was emptied of it's contents the male went limp against the tongue. The tongue too seemed to have had enough as it's torn, cum covered body fell back against the lower jaw the way it had been before Dante woke it. The male panted and his devil trigger, with his cock both receded. That had to be one of the strongest orgasms Dante had ever had. It was too bad the giant wanted to kill him, after that Dante decided he wouldn't mind having a giant boyfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill hormones flooded his system and the more he thought about what just happened the more the hormones prickled inside him and made his heart skip a beat. That orgasm left him wanting more. Despite being childish, Dante wasn't an idiot, he couldn't just sit around in the guys mouth all day fucking with it, eventually Nero would wake up and swallow him up. He shook off his dicks 'needs' and pried apart the giant lips and pulled himself out. Something burned against his skin, again and again. It felt like hot stones falling from the sky, the toned man rubbed his eyes with spit covered fists and looked up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rain, the heat of the mouth he was in, and all the friction from the tongue rubbing him down made the rain seem so cold it stung like flames. The rain continued for another minute and then stopped, it was like the clouds saw Dante. Thankfully the rain was enough to wash the cum and spit away, but now he was drenched and cold, and Nero's clothing was too damp to dry up with. The gods decided to continue to be cruel and left the stormclouds, and the powerful wind the way it was, there'd be no sun to dry the demon hunter. Dante gave the sky the finger and looked around, water had pooled in places it seems it rained the whole time he was in Nero's mouth. He tried to ignore the dampness but his skin was not so forgiving. After being soaked in footsweat his pores emptied themselves of all those natural oils to try to keep from being clogged. When he was in the mouth the enzymes in the spit had eroded a few of the dead layers of his skin and with no oils or sealed layers his skin was getting itchy from absorbing water. His hands and feet were pale and would soon prune. \u201cUhg..\u201d 'Maybe Nero was wearing layers..' He thought to himself. The chest was bare and when he checked below the cut-away shirt there was no undershirt or dry material. Not that he'd go anywhere near the toes anyway, but Nero neither wore sox or shoes. That only left...</span></div></div>",

He pried the button of Nero's pants up and peered in. \u201cCourse.. they're dry.\u201d Dry and hot, he could feet his cold body hit with the musk laden heat that had been trapped in there. Worse yet for some reason Nero was wearing boxer-briefs, the athletic type that was practically skin tight. The devil hunter counted to three in his head and then crawled in. Light vanished as the briefs snapped shut behind him. He couldn't stand and he could hardly crawl, the briefs were tight and the damp pants ontop of them were heavy. If he were standing Nero's silver pubic hair would only be up to his knees, but being forced to army crawl his body was submerged in it. The thick wiry hairs tangled around his arms and legs, making trekking through them a difficult task even for a devil hunter. The smell was of sweat and a subtle hint of cum but there was something else too, Nero's musk. As it filled his lungs it made his dick twinge with sensation, only his willpower stopped himself from getting a boner. He refused to be turned on by the emasculating, humiliating prospect of being stuck in someones smelly briefs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pressed his back against the elastic material above him but it didn't do crap. It was too loose where he was to wick away any water and the thick pubic hair tangled around him was unbareable. He'd need to find higher ground where there wern't pubes and the matterial would be stretched tighter so he could drag the water off himself. Being a man he knew, to his own dismay, exactly where that was. He didn't have to crawl far before he found Nero's flaccid cock, even flaccid it was still as long as he was tall. He carefully grabbed hold of the loose skin and pulled himself on top. The elastic material didn't want to take up water, and even at this elevation it wasn't stretched enough to be forced to absorb the liquid. \u201cWell fuck...\u201d</span></div></div>",

The demon pressed both of his hands into the loose skin and began to rub. As hard as he might try the devilish cock hardly stirred and the devil hunter was getting tired. \u201cGuess Nero spoils you huh... you're used to bigger shit?\u201d Dante swallowed a nervous bump in his throat, and with it his pride. He laid himself down on top of the soft dick, the extra skin molded around his body making his arms and legs disappear in some spots. He rocked his body up and down, his neck craned back to keep his face out of the musky skin. Still no reaction. \u201cCan't get it up? I really fucking hate you right now, you got the sexiest man on the planet and you're not even turned on.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat struck a small chord with Dante, who was used to being, quite literally, a sex magnet. He was a seductive demon hunter pressed from the mold of the gods of romance and love himself, or so he liked to think. But he wasn't good enough for Nero's dick? All of Nero's other parts tried so hard get a hold of the devil but the cock was indifferent. \u201cSorry, I ain't his hand but I'll show yah. No fucking teenagers hand is better in bed than me.\u201d He huffed. His and arms wrapped as tightly as they could against the penis, he clenched his thighs as hard as he could, pumping the giant cock while his arms squeezed and twisted the flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperature began to rise rapidly and he could feel the blood pumping inside the growing dick with such might his whole body shook with each throb of the vein. He continued to jack off the cock now not only concerned with getting dry, but his pride was at stake here as well. Like a bull the dick bucked, slamming Dante against the crotch of the pants. Like a master bullrider the demon held on and only took the bucking as a challenge and pumped the cock harder. The mans arms and legs could no longer come even close to wrapping around the giant's member. And it's height was so great it seemed like a pillar to the man. With the size so great Dante could no longer avoid having his face pressed into the dick, nor could he move from his position. The penis had him crushed between its shaft and the pants wall. The veins throbbed under Dante with such might it made the demon shake violently, his stomachs contents were thrown around and his head spun from the power of throbbing alone. When ever the cock would buck, it would do so with such force Dante would cry out in pain, having his body smashed against the wall and then slammed with such force it would shatter even the strongest human bones of a man his size and splatter the poor tiny into a bloody pulp. Dante was a demon however and was to resilient to be popped like a bug by the dick's force, that didn't make it any less painful though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dick felt like it was well over two hundred degrees, even by devils standards it was almost burning to the touch, and with the boxers sealed tight the heat only continued to escalate. Dante was sweating, his brain shaken and light headed and his heart racing trying to cool him off. The man attempted to take a break, he held on but stopped thrusting. Only a few breaths were taken before the cock became frustrated with it's playmate and began to throb harder and jerk. Nero's hips even came to life and began to thrust and grind the penis into the helpless Dante. If the pathetic lifeform wouldn't finish what he started it was obvious the dick would finish it for him. Dante tolerated the tortuous pain for the first minute but as the giant throbbing tower came closer and closer to orgasm it pressed down on him and rubbed him mercilessly. The force had Dante trying to cry out in pain and beg for Nero to stop, but his cries were muffled with his face being smashed with the rest of his body. His body burned from the unrelenting friction, all of his skin was one big rug burn. His heart pounded as he tried desperately for an escape but his movement only stirred the dick more. Finally it seemed the dick blew its load, against his bruised and burnt chest he could feel the sperm fill the length of the penis and with a powerful throb the hot liquid sprayed out. With no where to go it sprayed down and coated the demon's little body. The thick viscous liquid burned at first but was welcomed with a joyous moan of content from the tiny devil. Being covered in Nero's cum lubed him up, it releaved him of the painful and endless grinding the penis had put him through.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Panting but calming down, Dante shut his eyes and waited to for the cock to shrink enough for him to climb away. However after the seed coated Dante the dick began to thrust against his body again. The demon let out a surprised whimper. \u201cRound... two?\u201d He gasped painfully. No, because the giant cock wasn't starting over, and there was no brief shrinkage in thickness. The dick was thicker and harder than ever before. \u201cNo that was just... oh god.\u201d He was cut off by another buck, this one nearly made the demon black out. Nero hadn't blown his load, that was only precum. Now crushed against the hotter and harder dick, covered in lube and cooking from the heat Dante was losing mental control of his own member. He forbade himself from getting turned on by this situation but it was a losing battle, the more the dick abused him the harder his own cock became. Musk flooded Dante's lungs and forced his hips into action, reciprocating the dicks senseless abuse with the grinding and thrusting of his own tiny penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his mouth to gasp for air he only managed to inhale and swallow more than a cup full of Nero's precum and the giant dose of sex hormones in the swallowed lubricant drove Dante into a sexual frenzy. His whole body writhed against the tower of a penis, He burried his face into the muscle and mouthed the salty soft skin, his hips shifted under the weight and he squeezed and pumped to the best his pathetic body size would allow. Nero's thrusting was becoming even more erratic, he the pressure made breathing near impossible and the thrusts would have knocked Dante out for sure, the adrenaline overdose was all that was keeping Dante awake and moving at this point. A loud snap was heard and pain surged through the little demon's body as the demon began to fuck the tiny one so hard it was crushing his rib cage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante's back arched and he moaned and shouted from pleasure. The penis slid down below Dante and came back up so quickly the tiny demon didn't even fall from his place. When Nero pulled back and thrusted the cocks head smashed into Dantes lower jaw like an uppercut, the dizzy demon spat out blood and snarled in pain only to be rammed in the stomach in the same manner and then in the face. The head of the giant penis swelled as it pinned the battered demon by the chest. Dante, still mindlessly controlled by his urges, wrapped himself around the head and viciously worshiped the sensitive surface and mouthed the rim of the slit. His broken body trembled violently with energy, his devil trigger activating and healing most of his wounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bent over on top of the dicks head and snarled like a vicious animal as he shoved his cock into Nero's slit. Even in his devil trigger Nero's cock was still beating the shit out of him but Dante didn't disband his mount and the broken bones and blood only drove him further into his rage, he pounded into the slit with no regard for his own body or the dick he had just topped. The cock fought back for control, smashing and bucking Dante, crushing more and more of his bones and bruising his toned demonic muscle but Dante ignored that still pounding into the slit with rigor that tore the inner lining. The cock jerked, this time of pain but did not shrink down. Hot fluid caressed the head of the small demon's cock, the feeling drove the sanguine devil hunter over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pressure he'd felt before was there again, only a hundred times stronger, it ravaged him from the inside and possessed his muscles. His hips thrusted relentlessly as he snarled in pleasure and arched his back, eyes aglow with the self servant intent of relieving himself inside Nero. He growled as the pressure moved to his cock and gripped it with painful control. Finally his trigger vanished in a flare of red flame and his seed exploded into Neros slit. The giant cock thrusted and jerked into Dante as the tingle of Dante's orgasm sent it down the same path. As Dante panted and recuperated from his orgasm, still oblivious to the world around him the cock smashed into him several times and then pinned him once again. The head swelled as it resisted the pressure behind it. Dante's white teeth glistened behind his battered and bloody face. \u201cBring it.\u201d He challenged. Nero must force himself to hold it for as long as possible every time he jacked off, because even in his half awoken state his cock kept it's slit shut. Dante laughed evily and mouthed the surface of the head, lapping up some of his own seed mixed with a combination of both demon's blood. The sensation broke the flood gates, Nero's cock gave one final thrust into the devil that had fucked it and then exploded with hot vats of thick white cum. The force of the fluid knocked the wind out of the tiny devil. Dante coughed and with his mouth open could not avoid swallowing large amounts of the thick liquid, practically filling his stomach with Nero's seed. Even with that large amount swallowed it still sprayed enough to completely smother the naked man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante laughed painfully when it was over and remained laying on Nero's cock as it retracted. He panted, desperately finding his breath and waiting for his heart beat to return to normal. The orgasm he had shared with his fight for dominance over the giant dick was so strong it took a good five minutes even for the devil spawn and his endless stamina to recover. His sexual urges met he crawled out from the other's boxers not caring that he was covered it Nero's seed. This time being covered in Nero's bodily fluids was a trophy of his battle not something utterly disgusting. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Wish we coulda been friends instead of this. Later.\u201d He dismissed the other and planted a foot on the hilt of the yamato. His demonic energy transferred through the blade and vaporized the giant demon from the inside out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas it was all a dream, both the giant and his little imp still lay there asleep. Nero's feet hanging off the side of the rock he'd turned into a bed. And nestled in between the giant's five demonic toes slept Dante a grin on his face and an erection in his pants. As the toes curled and uncurled around him while Nero dreamt Dante nuzzled the thick muscular toes with his body as he pressed his dick against the fourth toe and humped it, unconsciously acting out on the sexual images in his dream only to be stimulated more by the toes feeling him up and toying with him. Nero sighed softly in his sleep at the feelings of the little man worshiping him, and Dante writhed against the toes in pleasure and began to mouth the rough sweaty skin when they started to squeeze him tighter. The two remained like that throughout the night Nero oblivious to the real world Dante worshiping his feet, and Dante unaware of his own romantic affair with his captors big muscular toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long night of dreams of plenty dreams on both demon's parts Nero began to wake from his slumber. The muscular male yawned, his toes splaying as he stretched his legs. Dante, who was still asleep and dreaming reacted like someone had pulled the covers off him and only forced himself deeper into the other's sweaty foot. The platinum haired giant pushed aside his white bangs and planted a hand ontop of his giant crotch, feeling his morning wood, he was hornier than usual with Dante worshiping his godly toes as he slept. \u201cMmm..\u201d He sighed as he rubbed at his cock with his palm through his boxers. His eyes closed and he leaned back, thinking his sexual thoughts as he stroked himself. As the pleasure radiated through his body his giant toes began to curl and uncurl around their little pet. Dante, who was still asleep and very much dreaming reacted to the powerfull hug by groaning softly and rubbing himself against the massive toes, especially when the fourth toe would grip down, right ontop of his throbbing cock. His lips parted and with tongue and teeth he mouthed the powerful sweaty skin, the salty flavor making him sigh in delight as he imagined it as something else in his dreams. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His toes played with their pet twice as hard now, squeezing him with crushing force and rubbing him down with little regard for his safety. Dante's back arched and he writhed in ecstacy, grinding his whole body against the giant toes as they rubbed him down with almost painful riggor. Nero moaned. \u201cOh god that feels...\u201d he stopped, suddenly and sat up, bringing his demon foot to his lap so he could see what was in his toes... it was moving. \u201cWas I just wacking off to a little animal stuck between my toes?\u201d He stared with a curiosity at his thick foot sole. Caught on one of his claws was a bit of red fabric. He splayed his toes to see what was inside, when he saw his concern for the 'animal' vanished and that child like curiosity turned to a malevolent grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cDante... Don't know what you did to yourself but, thats where you belong. With my feet. Now what the hell do I do with you?\u201d He propped his feet up on another rock and toyed with the demon with his toes. \u201cI could just crush you right now.\u201d He splayed his toes enough for Dante to start to fall out but caught him with the much more sensitive toes of his human foot, so he could better feel his puny rival. He squeezed the tiny body hard, Dante squirmed. \u201cMmm you like that don't you? I bet it smells great. Serves you right, you piece of shit.\u201d As he continued to fiddle with the demon he decided to have some fun with him. Being shaken by moving to the other foot, and the sudden painfully rough play woke the devil up. All he could feel was heat and moisture as five destinct gigantic muscles pressed down on him and rolled him around. When he breathed it was salty, so much so he could taste it without opening his mouth. \u201cThe hell..\u201d He pulled, trying to pry himself from the grip of his captor, but it was no use. The toes allowed themselves to be pushed open for a second, before Nero, with a laugh squeezed down with all his might, making Dante cry out in pain and swallow a nice mouth full of sweat. \u201cMorning little guy. I thought you got away but I guess you were right where you belonged all this time. Stuck to my foot like the bug you are.\u201d Dante cursed at the man, but he could do nothing to fend off Nero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant demon laughed, stroking his cock as he gripped Dante with his human foot. \u201cHows that feel little imp? Your life isn't even in my hands, you're at the mercy of my fucking toes. If I wanted to I could crush you to death with my toes alone.\u201d The smaller demon felt those words stick like a blade at his pride, it was true, Nero could kill him as easily as an insect. Not wanting the demon to give up completely before he finished him off, he splayed his toes, letting the sweat-soaked demon roll down his sole onto the rock. Before Dante could get up Nero shoved his foot forward, knocking him onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he watched with brilliant blue eyes, Dante running to grab his sword from the rubble pile, he laughed with condescending glee. \u201cRemember how you told me I can't hurt you, and to prove it you just stood there and let me hit you. Didn't work out so well huh? I'm gonna do the same thing, I'm gonna show you how pointless fighting me is. I'll show you who the true heir of Sparda is!\u201d He rose to his feet and stomped toward Dante, stopping only a foot's length away from the tiny male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante threw the finger at Nero, how dare he call himself the true heir, this kid knew NOTHING about Sparda or their family. He was just some dumbass teen who happened to be blessed with a little demon blood. He didn't even have a devil trigger! His eyes burned red as he stared up at the alabaster mountain. Even with all of his hatred right now Nero was still intimidating, his giant abs and massive pecks many times Dante's size. His hands and feet that could grab and crush the life out of him in an instant.... His... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDante's eyes shifted to the teen's cock, it was still hard and throbbing, even bigger than it was in his dream. He swallowed at the lump in his throat as he imagined Nero's massive dick crushing him to death as the teen got off. His balls could smother him, his ass devour him, his mouth chew him to shreds and swallow him. Every single part of the giant could humiliate and destroy the tiny demon hunter, being crushed underfoot, dominated by a dick, or swallowed by a muscular ass... none of those were even honorable deaths. Still his dream had prepared him for this fight, he knew the giant could be hurt he just had to figure out how. Unlike in the dream Dante knew Nero wouldn't let him get close to his eyes, he had to find a soft spot in Nero's skin and destroy him from the inside out like he had in the dream. He lunged forward and unleashed a barrage of attacks at Nero. </span></div></div>",

Dante gagged and squirmed as the giant flexed his muscles, crushing the mans body deeper into the hairy, sweaty pit. \u201cYou're pathetic Dante! Show me you know you're pathetic, mouth up some of that rank pit juice. I'm gonna leave you in there till you do.\u201d Nero grinned, rubbing his arm back and forth, rolling the tiny demon in his massive sweat factories.

You murdered people I knew and caused all this shit. I'm just gonna kill your fucking ass and get it over with.\u201d With that he pinned Dante's legs under his demonic foot and raised his human one, obviously he was using the human foot so he could feel Dante's body break and snap under his stomps.

His body shook in pain below the teen's foot. So this was it.. he'd die with the smell, feel, and sight of a sweaty teens foot as his last moments... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNero shifted his weight and raised the demonic foot, stomping down, crushing Dante's lower half. His human foot raised again, Dante stared up at the male from the bloody foot print, begging for the torture to end. \u201cThis is for all the shit you put me through.\u201d He stomped down in pain. This time he could feel bones snap and hear a loud crunching as Dante screamed in pain. \u201cThis is for Kyrie.\u201d He lifted his demonic paw and crushed the demon's legs. Nero pulled his massive sole up, Dante's battered and bloody body stuck to it for a moment before falling back down. He could hardly breath anymore and all he could smell was Nero's foot and the metallic scent of his own demon blood. \u201cN----ner... o\u201d He gasped, unable to move his flattened body. Nero pulled his feet away and churned something in his mouth before spitting on the broken man. Dante coughed out more blood as the spit covered his body. <br>\r\n\u201cYou're lasted longer than I thought you would Dante.. its over now though I'm pounding your ass into a five toed grave.\u201d This time he threw all of his body weight into his stomp, crushing all of Dante's body underneath his human foot, twisting and grinding the ball of his foot into the demon, watching as more and more blood coated his foot and the demon's body made loud crunching sounds. \u201cAh...\u201d He sighed, scrunching his toes, feeling the demon's broken and completely flattened body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAssuming the demon to be dead he pulled his foot back. The broken form however still twitched and the chest raised with subtle motion. \u201cDamn.. you survived that? Well I guess I outta reward you huh?\u201d He stepped backwards, his human foot leaving bloody pints where ever he moved it. \u201c...n..nhh..\u201d Dante protested. \u201cDevils like fire right? Here.\u201d He raised his demonic foot over Dante. His Demonic energy manifested in the form of fire, turning the foot's sole into an oven. The male grinned sadistically and stomped down on Dante. There was a hiss as the heat burned the little demon. He twisted his foot a few times before stomping on the left over mess with both feet several more times just to make sure the devil wouldn't be getting back up. After he was sure he was dead his giant deadly toes felt the mess up until it found the broken, mixed up remains of Dante's body. The muscular pads gripped the paper flat demon, scrunching him up until he was securely stuck in between the giant clawed toes. \u201cYou ain't getting buried, yer toejam now Dante.\u201d He wiggled his toes over the corpse. \u201cMaybe I'll make you a coffin outta an insole, your eternal resting place can be under my foot, you don't deserve any better.\u201d He said, before walking off leaving the demon in between his toes and forgetting about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>The End</b><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
