He is a High Class devil now after doing excellent in the promotion exam and a senior in Kuoh Academy. He also has so many girlfriends now that the war is over and has made many great memories with the ORC but it started to get a bit boring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to right now where our hero is walking back to his home with a strange black book that was titled \u201cThe Book of Reality.\u201d Issei found this book in the bushes because he though he saw something fall from the sky and land outside. He decided to wait until after school to see what it was and luckily it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei went into his mansion where he saw a note on the table from his girlfriends no doubt. <i>Dear Issei, the girls and I are having a girls night so we\u2019ll be back in the morning. Don\u2019t stay out or up too late you do have your finals before summer. See you to tomorrow and know that I love you. Love, Rias.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei smiles at the note before remembering that his summer vacation starts tomorrow and that he has one final to take but first he wants to know what the book is because of the aura it gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei made his way up to his room and put the book on his desk before opening it to see that the pages were blank. He was surprised before flipping through the book noticing that the pages haven\u2019t ended at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJust what is this book?\u201d Issei pondered before he felt a shock on his right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! That felt worse than Akeno\u2019s lighting.\u201d He yelled as he clutched his hand. Issei was about to toss the book until he saw words appearing on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> \u201cCongratulations, Issei Hyoudou! You are now have the power to change reality and all you have to do is write it in the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately there are a few rules you must know. No one can see what you write unless you allow them to know what you did to them. The book cannot be used by anyone else unless you allow them. The book is also indestructible so it cannot be destroyed by anything unless you write it down in the pages. Don\u2019t believe me try writing something right now. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei stares at the passage before thinking it was some bull but found it interesting if he could actually change reality with this book. He decided to go ahead and do something.</span></div></div>",

Sona will call me and let me know. Also summer vacation will last until I decide it\u2019s time to end it.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei just laughed at himself thinking how hilarious it sounds until he hears his phone go off and answers the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello this is the Hyoudou residence. Issei speaking how can I help you?\u201d Issei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSona on the other end looks around to see if anyone is around and realizes she\u2019s alone. She blushes speaking to Issei \u201cWell I thought you would like to know you are exempt from tomorrow and I must say I\u2019m surprised with your grade. I mean a 100%, I\u2019m very impressed looks like all that studying helped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei looks shocked before composing himself and replying \u201c Thank you President that means a lot coming from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma silently giggles to herself before saying \u201cIt\u2019s no problem and I\u2019m curious so there\u2019s a new movie tomorrow that I want to go see and I have two tickets but I have no one to join me so I was wondering if you could join me tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei surprised started to think \u2018Is she asking me out on a date?\u2019 He quickly replied. \u201cAre you sure because you do know I\u2019m with the girls right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSona replies \u201cI know and I asked Rias and she seemed okay with it and I have something I want to confess to you face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei silently sighs before saying \u201cAlright I\u2019m in, so see you tomorrow at the station around 2pm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me see you then bye and have a good night.\u201d Sona replies before hearing a good night from Issei and was inwardly squealing like a fan girl meeting her idol.<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m going on a date with Issei and Rias is okay with this. She must plan I\u2019m spying on us tomorrow got to keep my guard up.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Issei, he was shocked to beyond. Realizing what he just did he felt some new power at his fingertips but realizes that he must be careful with this otherwise he would be no better than Vali\u2019s father.</span></div></div>",

It means more fun.\u201d The device appears as a toy gun with two settings: remove and modify. Ophis tugs his arm. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the school. Many options there.\u201d Issei agrees and they head to the school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei notices Matsuda and Motohama at the Kendo Club and decide to test it on them.

Murayama sighs as she says. \u201cI wonder what being a pervert would be like.\u201d Katase agreed and ponders the same thing. Issei fires the gun and all three of the bodies are brainless. Issei drags the two guys to the changing room and takes the brains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphis asks what\u2019s he up to. Issei just snicker as he uses the gun to modify the girls brains. \u201cMurayama and Katase. Modify. Personality. Issei\u2019s love for breasts.\u201d He picks up Kiryuu\u2019s brain. \u201cModify. Personality. Little boy in a girls body.\u201d He picks up the guys brains. \u201cIntelligence. Modify.

I want to kiss cute girls.\u201d She continues to walk around the school while playing with her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei is suprised by remembers how Kiryuu acted before he modified her. Murayama and Katase come out and see Issei. They run to him and Katase asks. \u201cHow was sleeping with Rias and her heavenly pair? Tell me everything.\u201d Murayama nods and Issei couldn\u2019t believe that they wanted to know about a woman\u2019s chest. Murayama grabs her own pair and fondles them. \u201cTell us and you can have a good time with our beautiful chests. Show us how to care for our lovely chests.\u201d Issei nods and tells them what he knows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMurayama and Katase are happy and have nosebleeds at the thought of being in Issei\u2019s harem.
