He is a High Class devil now after doing excellent in the promotion exam and a senior in Kuoh Academy. He also has so many girlfriends now that the war is over and has made many great memories with the ORC but it started to get a bit boring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich brings us to right now where our hero is walking back to his home with a strange black book that was titled \u201cThe Book of Reality.\u201d Issei found this book in the bushes because he though he saw something fall from the sky and land outside. He decided to wait until after school to see what it was and luckily it was still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei went into his mansion where he saw a note on the table from his girlfriends no doubt. <i>Dear Issei, the girls and I are having a girls night so we\u2019ll be back in the morning. Don\u2019t stay out or up too late you do have your finals before summer. See you to tomorrow and know that I love you. Love, Rias.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei smiles at the note before remembering that his summer vacation starts tomorrow and that he has one final to take but first he wants to know what the book is because of the aura it gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei made his way up to his room and put the book on his desk before opening it to see that the pages were blank. He was surprised before flipping through the book noticing that the pages haven\u2019t ended at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cJust what is this book?\u201d Issei pondered before he felt a shock on his right hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! That felt worse than Akeno\u2019s lighting.\u201d He yelled as he clutched his hand. Issei was about to toss the book until he saw words appearing on the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> \u201cCongratulations, Issei Hyoudou! You are now have the power to change reality and all you have to do is write it in the book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately there are a few rules you must know. No one can see what you write unless you allow them to know what you did to them. The book cannot be used by anyone else unless you allow them. The book is also indestructible so it cannot be destroyed by anything unless you write it down in the pages. Don\u2019t believe me try writing something right now. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei stares at the passage before thinking it was some bull but found it interesting if he could actually change reality with this book. He decided to go ahead and do something.</span></div></div>",

Sona will call me and let me know. Also summer vacation will last until I decide it\u2019s time to end it.</u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei just laughed at himself thinking how hilarious it sounds until he hears his phone go off and answers the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello this is the Hyoudou residence. Issei speaking how can I help you?\u201d Issei says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSona on the other end looks around to see if anyone is around and realizes she\u2019s alone. She blushes speaking to Issei \u201cWell I thought you would like to know you are exempt from tomorrow and I must say I\u2019m surprised with your grade. I mean a 100%, I\u2019m very impressed looks like all that studying helped.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei looks shocked before composing himself and replying \u201c Thank you President that means a lot coming from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoma silently giggles to herself before saying \u201cIt\u2019s no problem and I\u2019m curious so there\u2019s a new movie tomorrow that I want to go see and I have two tickets but I have no one to join me so I was wondering if you could join me tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei surprised started to think \u2018Is she asking me out on a date?\u2019 He quickly replied. \u201cAre you sure because you do know I\u2019m with the girls right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSona replies \u201cI know and I asked Rias and she seemed okay with it and I have something I want to confess to you face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei silently sighs before saying \u201cAlright I\u2019m in, so see you tomorrow at the station around 2pm?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWorks for me see you then bye and have a good night.\u201d Sona replies before hearing a good night from Issei and was inwardly squealing like a fan girl meeting her idol.<br>\r\n\u2018I\u2019m going on a date with Issei and Rias is okay with this. She must plan I\u2019m spying on us tomorrow got to keep my guard up.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Issei, he was shocked to beyond. Realizing what he just did he felt some new power at his fingertips but realizes that he must be careful with this otherwise he would be no better than Vali\u2019s father.</span></div></div>",

Range 1-10. 1 is dumbest and 10 being genius. No one will notice the remote and it can only be used by myself. There is also a timer and a reset button. When a person is modified, everyone else will think it is normal. The remote is indestructible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphis likes this and sees the remote in Issei\u2019s hand and asks. \u201cWhere should we go to test the device?\u201d Issei thought and had a wicked idea. He wrote another passage in the book and suddenly Issei and Ophis appear in the room where Rias and the girls are playing a few games. Ophis snaps her fingers in front of Rias and Rias didn\u2019t flinch or look at Ophis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Issei showed her the passage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOphis and I will appear in front of the girls. Both of them will not be seen by the girls unless either of us reveal ourselves to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei pointed the remote at Akeno. He set the remote for 1 and shot Akeno. Her brain on the scanner showed that it was now the size of an acorn. Akeno looked at her chest and squeezed them. \u201cHehe squishy.\u201d Rias looked at Akeno and said. \u201cAkeno stay playing with your breasts. I know your a brain is the size of a marble.\u201d Akeno giggles at Rias and continues to play with her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRias sighs but then gasped as Akeno started to play with Rias\u2019s breasts. \u201cRed has softer squishy. Dragon is strong and me want to play with Dragon and make babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei and Ophis watch this and Issei aims the remote at Ravel. This time the remote was set to 10. Ravels eyes were shocked until she smiles and looks at them. \u201cBy my calculations, the only ones who will give Issei a better time in bed will be myself and Koneko. The rest of you have trouble controlling your hormones but don\u2019t worry.\u201d She looks at Koneko. \u201cWe need to create a device that will help them with their mood swings.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was laughing at this and Ophis asks Issei. \u201cCan you make me dumb?\u201d Issei ponders and decided to see what a dumb Ophis does. He sets the remote to 0, no brain. He fires the remote and Ophis\u2019s eyes glaze over as she now had no brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at Issei and kissed his cheek. Issei was surprised until Ophis says. \u201cGo go ga ga.\u201d Drool comes out of the corner of her mouth and wants her Daddy to pick her up. Issei is so surprised he tapped the remote and it fired at all of the girls. The remote was set to 2. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had a glazed look until Koneko woke up and crawls to her sister and did the unexpected. She was sucking Kuroka\u2019s breasts. Kuroka moaned in excitement and let her sister suck her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIssei was surprised and quickly reset Ophis back to normal.</span></div></div>",
