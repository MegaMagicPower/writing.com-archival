You saw som pictures of sacrifices and gods, but you were really interested in the text. You started saying random things on the page but nothing happened, you knew this thing had to be powerful, but had no idea how to use it. You thought to go to the first page and start reading, maybe you have to trigger a specific spell first. You read the first 3 lines and tense up, dropping the hood to the ground. You felt good, stronger and more awake. You pick the book up and the paragraph you read glows slightly, you knew you triggered something now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you almost home, you see a neighbor down the street walking his Yorke. You thought you might as well try something and see what happens. You read, \u201cIllr megin,\u201d and the dog starts shaking. You see it start growing and loosing hair. It\u2019s teeth start growing and getting sharper, untill it\u2019s about 5 times the size and looked like a rabid saber tooth tiger. It jumps on the owner and bites his head clean off, then runs into the woods. Your standing there with your mouth open, not sure what to do.</span></div></div>",

You feel your jeans getting tighter and your shirt stretching. You look down, and a gut is starting to form, along with you getting wider. Your pants start ripping and your shirt rises up to your breasts. Your hairless body also starts to look like a lumberjacks, along with a huge beard. The chair your sitting in snaps and you hit the ground, sounding like a dresser falling over. You keep growing on the floor until your jeans are completely ripped off and your t shirt looks like a bra. You look at your feet as well, and they split through your shoes. You went from a  size 10 to like a size 16. You get up and look in the mirror, your body looks basically like this but 6\u20195 height and super hairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/G9vz12g\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/G9vz12g</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what you were going to tell your family, your friends, everyone you knew. You went from a 5\u20198, 160 pound \u201csoy-boy\u201d to a Viking warrior. You go into your closet and look for something that might fit. You\u2019d imagine your like a 3 or 4 XL now, and all your shirts and pants were mediums. You hear the door opening, and you jump in bed and get under the covers. Your mom walks into the room with a box. \u201cHey honey, your clothes cans in the mail today. I got you 4X shirts and a bunch of 3X sweats because those jeans are too expensive for you to keep ripping.\u201d She looks over at the ripped jeans on the floor. \u201cWhy did you even try those on? You knew they wouldn\u2019t fit.\u201d She chuckles and leaves the room after putting the box on your bed. You were so confused, why did she know you were huge now? Does everyone know? You put your new clothes on and go to the bathroom to get on the scale. Earlier you were 160... the scale broke at 400.. You wonder if that means your strong now, so you go into your room and try to pick up a dresser that you could barely push before. It felt like picking up a laundry basket. You realize this could be pretty cool if everyone already accepts who you are. You hear your mom call everyone to dinner, so you go down stairs. You get to the kitchen table and there\u2019s a huge living room chair at the end, along with some wooden kitchen tables. You start to sit on one of the wooden chairs, but halfway down it starts creaking hard. You were starting to realize how huge you are, and thinking of things you could do now you couldn\u2019t before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sits down and you mom brings KFC into the room. \u201cOkay guys here\u2019s our bucket, and here\u2019s your bucket Zeke,\u201d she said. You were surprised, you\u2019ve never eaten more than 3 wings before at a time. You take one bite of a leg and before you realize it you cleaned it. You start devouring chicken faster and faster before you finish the whole bucket before anyone else got to their second piece. \u201cThere\u2019s a bowl of mashed potatoes and gravy if your still hungry honey,\u201d your mom says. You grab the gravy and pour it over the whole bowl, grab a wooden spoon, and finish it in under 3 minutes. </span></div></div>",

It freaks you out and you put the book in your dresser, not planning to look at it anytime soon. You didn\u2019t even know what this spell was going to do, you just hope it didn\u2019t turn you into some horrible monster. You start to get really tired, which is weird since it\u2019s 7 PM. You lay down and before you can even plug your phone in, you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next morning to your mom shaking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom: Honey wake up, your gunna be late for school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her looking back at you with a confused face, then walks out. You rub your eyes and feel some fuzz on your face. You look at yourself in your camera and see a short beard. You never had facial hair before, and you figured it definitely has something to do with that spell. You rip the covers off and look down, seeing you have a little bit of a belly now. You were 140 the other day so you thought you might as well check again. You go to the bathroom and stand on it, shocked that it says 165. How the hell did you gain that UCB over night. You look in the mirror and your shirt is pretty stretched out. You notice your arms went from chicken bones to pretty big. You flex in the mirror and your muscles actually pop for the first time ever. You had to get to school, but none of your shirts s fit that well. You go into your brothers old clothes and get an XL AC/DC shirt. </span></div></div>",

Your conscience starts deteriorating and the lust for power consumes your mind. You read the whole section after about an hour, and by the time your done, you feel like a whole new person.

Your a 16 year old boy that\u2019s a Junior in high school, and are walking home with a kid you were starting to become friends with named Jake who moved in not too long ago. You walk to your house and pass a trail you\u2019ve never been on and explain it to Jake. \u201cLet\u2019s go down it, I\u2019m trying to learn more about the area anyway! Maybe we can actually discover something together?\u201d You agree and walk down it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 10 minutes, the trees get thicker and it seems to get darker. You walk up A small hill and see a stone rune with a Trikvetr Knot on it. The boys have no idea what it is, but Jake goes up to touch it. He puts his hand on the symbol and gets entrapped in a closing latch around it. It pierced his arm, making him splutter blood everywhere. The tune starts going into the ground and pulling him down with it. You grab his ankle and pull, but it feels like a semi truck is pulling him under. You slip and loose your grasp and he gets sucked under in seconds, cutting off his screams almost instantly. Your freaking out, you sprint home and grab a shovel and come back within 20 minutes. You knew in anyone found his body, you would be suspect number one for a murder. You start digging, but the ground is hard and takes about 19 minutes to get half a foot. After about an hour and a huge hole, you fall to your knees and start to cry. You don\u2019t know what your going to do, or how your going to explain how he disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your about to leave, you see a hand burst from the hole. You fall down in shock, as you see Jake come out of the hole. He looked very different though, with pale/grey skin and black eyes. He walks out with a book that had the same symbol as the rune. \u201c\u00deinn sacrifice hearne\u00f0r \u00fe\u00fa \u00feessi b\u00f3k \u00f3r limitless makt.

You had no idea what this book was or what Jake\u2019s \u201cbody\u201d said, but you knew you had some kind of power wielding this book.
