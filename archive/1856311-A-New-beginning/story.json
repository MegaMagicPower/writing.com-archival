And with that Olivia blew a kiss and turned off her webcam poor Rhys was shocked the love his life had just left him and he had no idea what's left or even if it's worth going on and continuing. Rhys walked across the room and flopped on his bed not sure what to do.\"maybe this is all a bad dream I mean Olivia wouldn't really dump me would she ?, she said she loved all the time and she knew how much she meant to me . Oh what's the point I was never good enough for her\". And with that Rhys quietly sobbed untill he fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

One day when walking home from school his phone vibrated it was a text message from talei , an old freind that he hadn't spoken to in ages, she was almost 2 years older then Rhys and from memory was only slightly taller but how could he forget her she was HOT! He remembered her as having black shoulder length her a nice bust and great backside. Rhys got on with her well and they became good freinds, she was a gamer like himself. Rhys knew Tallei knew that he had a thing for her (and he still does) she always used to give him hugs and make sure when this happened that his head ended up her sizable cleavage (CC to be exact) and every once and a while she'd give him the odd love bite but anyway back to the message \" hey Rhys it's Tallei I've got some great news I'm coming home!!!!! :) super keen to catch up if we can \". Rhys quickly replied \"OMG thats awesome yes we defs have to catch up\".  </span></div></div>",
