When it arrived, the dish of fettucini salad gave her an idea. She'd make them cook, more and more, even if she wasn't hungry. They'd be worked off their feet! Sure, she might not be able to eat that much, but who cares? The uneaten and half-eaten food that they shopped for and cooked, lying around the house going to waste, would surely just make them all the more miserable. Abandoning her food, she rang her English friend, Valerie, who lived in London, to gloat about her 'cunning plot'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nValerie put the idiotic American on mute and said 'Mm-hmm' occasionally. She'd stopped being Olivia's friend years ago and had actually moved countries to get away from her, but she just kept on calling, for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver two long years of waiting on Olivia, Jeremy had learnt that it was never a good idea to leave after giving Olivia a meal. She was as skinny as a rake and ate like one, too. She usually ate about two mouthfuls before he was summoned to throw out the rest. He'd been hired because he was a five-star Italian American chef but, since she only ate nothing but rabbit food, he never bothered making her anything that was any nicer than a cheap salad. They were She hadn't noticed a difference. He kept his skill by cooking five-star meals for the five beautiful ladies he worked with. It had all been quite fattening food, so they'd begun to grow, much to his delight. They didn't mind the extra weight, since the food was so amazing. But now he'd overheard her scheming, since she was ranting to herself. So, she'd noticed that he cooked for the maids, had she? Well, he had ways of scuppering her!</span></div></div>",

Jeremy decided he would inform the maids of her plan and tell them his own plan in return.<br>\r\nHe explained to them that Oliva had noticed that when there was no work to do they would hang around and eat, and he explained to them her plan of having them cook all the time and then clean up all the food that she didn't eat. Needless to say the maids were rather angry when informed of her 'master' plan. Jeremy however reassured them that he had a plan of his own so they could get their own back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe explained to them that they would pretend to be the ones who cooked the food for her whilst actually he would be the one to do so, since she never really left her room she would never find out. He would cook everything she asked them to cook and make it as delicious and moreish as possible, he would also make sure that everything was full of empty calories and were not very filling at all. This way she would eat more of the meals and consume as many calories as possible. The maids would play along as if they had been the ones to make the food whilst meanwhile they continue as normal, hanging around and eating the food Jeremy made for them. Soon he knew that Oliva would balloon up and start eating all the food given to her, no matter how unfilling or how loaded with calories they were. Also for Jeremy this plan had a second benefit, it ment that the maids would continue their easy living and therefore gain more weight as well, there was after all, nothing sexier than a fat girl in a french maid outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maids agreed to Jeremy's plan and they began to get to work. Oliva called the maids to her and demanded that each of them make her a stupidly large amount of hard to cook food, and they agreed, faking slight annoyance at being requested such a difficult chore when there already was a chef in the house. Oliva was estatic, already she was annoying the maids and getting her revenge, not knowing that infact they were all just relaxing and eating and laughing about her behind her back. Jeremy now had started up working on each of the meals, he was actually enjoying the challange of making five difficult meals to be as delicious yet unfilling and fattening as possible, however one by one he succeeded in completing the dishes and the maids took them to Oliva one by one, with about an hour's gap between each maid giving her time to eat as much as possible and let the food go down so she can eat more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say the plan seemed to be getting off to a good start, Laura returned to the others with the large plate of food containing only a third of it left. Oliva had eaten far more of it than she usual would which caused delight among the staff. Jeremy told Laura she might as well finish off the rest of the meal, explaining that there wasn't enough there to worry about in terms of it's fattening qualities and soon at the rate Oliva was going, there would be no left overs anyway.<br>\r\nHe lied of course and Laura gladly ate the incredibly tasty food.</span></div></div>",

Olivia's once slim and delicate frame, forged by years of doing nothing but sit in her room and use her mansions gym, was now slowly swelling with new curves, her once trim midriff was bulging out from under her shirt, a round, food stuffed orb, with small love handles beginning to form as her packed stomach digested its load. But that wasn't the only place that had been affected, Olivia's formerly small chest was now straining her shirt at double C cups, while her rear was beginning to bulge out from over her shorts.

Jeremy never cooked his best food for Oliva but he did for the girls and being surrounded by all this delicious food was like heaven. They paid no attention to what this would do to their figures if they kept this up over a long period of time, they were just enjoying themselves too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfact it turned out that Oliva's plan to have them cook lots and then not to eat it only served to add to his cause as the girls would just eat those meals afterwards as well.

Indulging on the treats Jeremy baked for them as they cooked for Olivia, finishing Olivia's vast leftovers, and eating extravagant dinners prepared by Jeremy.  Jeremy who finally had the opportunity to put his skills to the test, began concocting his most delectable meals, meals that the maids savored. Due to the astounding deliciousness of the dishes, the maids developed quite the affinity for food. The maids' appetites grew immensely and in such a short time. Once barely able to finish their dinners, every last maid now quadrupled her input. This had caused the previously slim maids to pork up to a rather corpulent form. Each maid had added multiple layers of soft fat to her body resulting in several new outfits more accommodating for their growing bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was lunch time and Olivia was lounging by the pool. \"MATILDAAAA!!!\" Olivia screamed for her maid. Eager to irritate her maids, Olivia demanded to have her lunch brought to her. Olivia planned to eat only a few bites in front of the maid who worked so hard and had spent so much time cooking it to add to the maid's distraught. \"Matilda My Food!!!\" Olivia hissed from her lounge chair. \"Coming mistress.\" calmly answered Matilda carrying a huge vat of pasta. \"Here you are Ms Olivia.\" Matilda politely spoke. \"Bout Time.\" barked Olivia. Olivia took two bites in front of Matilda who had labored all morning making this. \"Done.\" chirped Olivia \"Take it away. I shan't be eating any more.\" Olivia ordered hoping to see Matilda frown. However Matilda maintained a cheerful countenance politely responding \"As you wish Ms Olivia.\" and dutifully taking the pasta away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda's placid obedience befuddled Olivia. Matilda didn't display any signs of anguish. She had her working all morning on that complicated dish and now only two bites were taken. Olivia studied the unexpectedly merry Matilda walk off unperturbed by the event. It was then that Olivia noticed how fat Matilda was. Temporarily finding herself mesmerized by Matilda's quaking buttocks. \"My god she's gotten fat.\" Olivia than realized that all of her maids were getting large. Olivia than coiled in her chair angry that her plan failed to aggravate her maids. \"Grrr they should be miserable, instead they're just getting fat. Forcing them in the kitchen all day has made them enjoy food too much. So now they'll just happily eat my leftovers...Maybe I should start eating everything they cook.\" Olivia laid there trying to figure out how to make her maids miserable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatilda entered the kitchen bearing the delicious remains of Olivia's lunch. \"Alright ladies, time for leftovers!\" Matilda gleefully announced setting the huge vat on the counter. \"Oh boy I've been waiting for this all morning!\" confessed Toni grabbing a fork. The girls gathered round eager to sample Matilda's pasta. \"Great work Matilda.\" Laura complimented. \"Mmm hm\" muffled Ray. Christina simply nodded being occupied with rapidly scooping pasta to her drooling mouth. In mere minutes, the vat was scraped clean and the pasta rested in the five stomachs. \"Ah that was good.\" sighed Laura. \"You said it.\" Toni added. \"Alright back to work.\" Ray instructed grabbing a nearby cookie that Jeremy had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen was filled with treats. Now focusing his attention on the maids, Jeremy diligently supplied the laboring girls with loads of delectables making sure that they never ran out no matter how fast they ate. Huge cakes were baked allowing the girls to have a slice as they worked. Pizzas were cooked serving as a easy food to eat as they mixed ingredients. Tons of platters were provided loaded with various foods to keep the hard-working maids nourished. All the food had made the maids content.  To Olivia's frustrations, the kitchen had developed a pleasant ambiance. </span></div></div>",

He knew a man, an old friend who he used to work for called Jim Denver, who was a rich entrepeneur in the magazine industry. He owned the biggest personal printing press in the world, too. He occasionally made faux magazines for personalised gifts. He would make an almost identical replica of a magazine but adjust it to, for example, to fill it with articles about somebody in particular for their birthday. He would make a stack of about a hundred magazines, most being the weekly editions of famous fashion magazines, in which the main stories would be about the sudden rise of fat in the fashion industry and its popularity among the rich and famous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's mansion on the island of San Fortuna was empty of television, radio and internet. The reason being that Olivia's mother had bought it as a place to hide out away from the stress of her high-flying corporate position and just relax, at the beach or in the luxurious beach house. Jeremy thought it worked perfectly, as the only people Olivia would see for the next month would be him, Laura, Toni, Rachel, Christina and Matilda, and the people in magazines that Olivia had them buy for her when they went shopping. Magazines that would now be special editions produced by Mr Denver, designed to give the impression that, when it came to women's fashion, everyone who was anyone had begun to decide that bigger was better. And that these women had begun to act on that belief, till the issues that were ready for use at the very end of the month were simply full of incredibly, amazingly realistic photoshopped images of celebrities that the whole world generally accepted as being the definition of 'standard beauty', like Angelina Jolie and Jennifer Aniston, were now weighing in at 500lbs+.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Olivia falls for it, so she has Jeremy make sure that the mansion is filled with fatty foods all the time and starts gorging.<br>\r\nOption 2: Uh oh.

With no real reason to go outside she had fallen behind on fashion and if fat was in, she desperately needed to catch up. By the time she finished Jeremy's snacks, the threads holding her buttons on her pajamas were straining to their limit. She hiccuped and fell back into a comfy sofa, rubbing her distended belly. Not an hour later, Toni came in wheeling a cart full of the fattening food the other maids had prepared. She too had gotten an early start to the day, her gut sagging with the rich, heavy food prepared especially for her and her mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look who got up early!\" she beamed. \"I thought we could get some extra pounds on you sooner if I spent more time helping you through it so I had Jeremy make myself something earlier.

Bacon, omlettes with extra cheese, cinnamin buns covered with frosting, pancakes loaded with cream, and whole milk. Despite her stomach's load complaints, gurgling and sloshing with her early breakfast, her nose made her mouth water. The smell alone prompted her to crave everything on the cart. She tried to get up, but the weight in her middle wobbled as she feebly waddled toward the cart, causing her to plop back down on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning, she huffed up and whined, \" I guess you'll just have to feed me. After all, you are my servant, so I shouldn't have to do a thing if I don't want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You only have to ask,\" Toni smiled, trying to show that she vould get her way by being nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess,\" Olivia moped. \"Hey Toni..... don't stop, no matter how much I say it hurts. I want to eat it all. I want to be well into the latest trends as soon as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Toni curtsied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jeremy was working on how to keep the other maids gaining without telling them. He snuck into the laundry and took their uniforms and had them let out a little bit. With the tags all saying they were the same size, they'd think they were losing weight and would indulge more with the fatty food he was making for them. Once that trick had worked as much as it would, he'd get bigger uniforms and sew in tags of smaller sizes. It would work for a while, and hopefully the maids would develope bad habits and keep overeating before they realized what was going on. By then it would be too hard to stop. Jeremy's food was too good to resist once one got used to overindulging themselves on it.</span></div></div>",

A week had past since they had arrived on the private island. Every morning they staff would gather to talk about real news, progress with Olivia, and to make fun of the magazines Olivia was reading (though more recently they have been taking some of the fashion tips). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cEverything will be fine I\u2019ve talked to some of the staff on the boat and they are in on our little project we just have to act normal when she gets here.\u201d The chiefs calming voice had reassured them and the staff members went back to stuffing their faces. \u201cNow all we got to do is inform Olivia and keep her mouth shut about the older magazines. It could blow our cover.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div>  Olivia was getting thick. Once a small thing close to skin and bone she had grown considerably. Currently she was laying on a sun chair by the pool in a way too tight bikini and sun hat. Slurping on a high calorie shack and munching on a side of chili-fries she was in bless. Her thighs could no longer be held in between to hands her ass hand began to swallow her bikini bottoms. She took another sip of her shake as the chief and a maid approached her. Shifting her self to better see them you could see the jiggly of her stomach that began to hang over her bottoms, in-fact the you could barely ever see the top of her bikini bottoms as her saddle bags started to block the view. Setting her drink down she took of her sunglasses and placed them in between Her now double D sized breast it was by far the part that had grown the most. \u201cIs it time for second breakfast because I\u2019ve gotta say I didn\u2019t feel as stuffed after my last meal so I\u2019d like to request more food from now on. I\u2019ve gotta show off this bod to all of my friends when I get back.\u201d As she spoke she gestured to her whole body with her arms which if they had ever been toned it showed no signs underneath all the flab. Her face to was becoming soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cNo but I will keep your request in mind. Your mother will be here in a weeks time, now we were told that you shouldn\u2019t talk to her about the first week of fashion as she was slow on the uptake.\u201d The chief said calmly slipping the lie in to cover up their plot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \u201cForget about last week I can\u2019t let my mother see this twig of a body. I want you to two courses for each meal except dinner which will have three courses. I want to be woken up early for breakfast and have brunch a little after words. And a meal in between lunch and dinner. Dessert will be considered it\u2019s own meal. Finally those maids are still skinny as fuck I expect some gain before mom gets here.\u201d After her demands she chugged her shake and stuffed fries in her mouth not caring if she made a mess. The chief smile and nodded walking away joyous with himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"></div>***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\"></div> The days were madness the gorging was insane. It was non-stop feeding Olivia\u2019s body could barely handle it constantly being full of foods and doing nothing. One day she just slept her body dealing with all the food. Needless to say she ballooned out. Barely any of her clothing fit so she went nude most of the time as she ate. The maids on the other hand whilst thrilled at first began to have their doubts about the plan, as they now where putting on weight just to keep up the facade. Though meany of them did not put as much weight as Olivia.</span></div></div>",

Infact if there ever was anything she wanted, all she had to do was tell her personal maid and she got it that very same day. However there was one thing she wanted that money couldn't buy, and that was friends. As she sat there eating her ice cream she felt terribly alone, the room was huge and filled with all sorts of stuff, and yet it was so empty. Olivia never made friends at school, they always hated her for her spoilt attitude and her having everything she could ever want, they never even thought that she would trade it all for just one good friend, all they could see was the mountains of material possessions she owned and that caused them to writhe with envy. At school she would always sit alone but with her maid nearby, they hated that too. They did not see her sitting on her own, completly lonely, they saw her as always having a maid with her to do everything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one lunch time at her all girl's school (Olivia's parents didn't want their daughter getting involved with guys) the girls who disliked her most were again sitting around talking about her behind her back as she sat alone with the maid bringing her large quantities of homecooked food. The girls always gossipped about how much Olivia ate and the toll it was taking on her body, she was 16 years old and around 180lbs, however she was tall and beautiful with long brown hair and the weight piled on her hips and breasts giving her a very volumptious look, but despite that she did still have a pot belly and a rather soft round face. But despite her chubby frame, she was beautiful, another thing the girls resented. They figured it was because she was wealthy she had people who could do her hair, her nails and make up and just make her look beautiful. They spoke about how great it would be if she were to get big, well not just big but huge. Her body is sexy and volumptious now, but with another 100lbs of fat she would be an ugly whale of a girl, and what if she got even bigger than that?<br>\r\nThe girls loved these thoughts of fattening Olivia up to make her big and ugly, it seemed like it would show that spoilt bitch what's what. Eventually though one of the girls decided that rather than talk about it they should actually do it, the others were too nervous about getting committed in fattening her up and so the one who suggested it said she would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl came over to Olivia and asked to sit next to her, surprised by this Olivia gladly agreed and the girl introduced herself. Her name was Kim, she was a pretty blonde haired girl who had average sized breasts and a 'perfect' slender figure. Kim told Olivia that she looked lonely and thought she would come to try change that, taken completly aback by Kim's kindness Olivia almost instantly warmed up to the blonde haired girl. They spent the whole lunch time talking and getting to know each other and by the time the bell had rang Kim suggested that they go out together after school to a cafe and get to know each other some more. Olivia happily agreed and Kim smiled, she also then handed Olivia a bag full of candy bars and explained that her dad owns a candy store and is always giving her far too much and asked if Olivia would like them instead, which of course she did.<br>\r\nWith that Kim left to go to her class whilst Olivia told her maid what had happened, she was so excited she had absolutly no idea of Kim's scheme to fatten her up, she went through the rest of the day eagerly awaiting the end of school, abscent mindedly devowering the candy bars that she was given, the sweetness of the candy was to her the sweetness of friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the school day came to an end and Olivia eagerly went over to Kim's classroom to meet up with her. Kim was a drama student and an excellent actress, when Olivia arrived she happened to have been talking about her to her friends, all of them chuckling about their plans and departed from Kim to let her go and deal with Olivia. Kim asked Olivia where the candy was and was happy to find that Olivia had already eaten it all, this was going to be easier than she thought. But now was the time to take Olivia to somewhere that she could eat alot of fattening food...</span></div></div>",

This was partly due to her being a billionair and getting everything she wanted handed to her and never having to work for it,  but it was also partly due to her best friend Kim. Olivia didn't realise it but Kim had been in love with her for the past year or so now, not only that but she was a fat admirer who found that making a thin girl fat was the biggest turn on possible. As a result she had been spending alot of time with Olivia making sure that she would eat as much as possible without getting suspicious about it. Olivia meanwhile had just been enjoying the company, she was often a social reculse as she spent almost all her time in the mansion grounds either watching anime, reading manga or playing video games. She did enjoy swimming though and that was how she had managed to keep herself from becoming properly fat for quite some time, but Kim couldn't swim and so when they were together they just lounge around eating junk food and playing video games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls had been friends since childhood and so when Kim slept over they would share a bed, they had been doing it since they were 6 and so it was normal for them, or it least it is to Olivia. Ever since Kim became sexually attracted to her and fell in love it hadn't been so simple. She loved sharing the bed with her, she would wrap her arms around Olivia and fall asleep ebracing the blonde haired billionair. Olivia often found Kim sleeping with her to be comforting and found that she didn't sleep well unless Kim was there, so more and more she slept round Olivia's house which made them both happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim's parents also didn't mind as they were always at work and actually felt more comfortable that she was there in the safety of the mansion than home alone. Olivia's parents didn't really care, they had been told by one of the maids once when passing by but so long as they stayed out of trouble they didnt care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day Kim was on her laptop on her favourite Feeder/Feedee forums when she decided that she would go for it and properly fatten up Olivia, and perhaps as her weight grows Olivia's love for Kim might also grow. But how could she do it? She posted a thread and of all the options there were three that stood out to her.<br>\r\n1st option was to tell Olivia the truth and have her willingly become a Feedee and maybe her lover. On the upside it would be easier to make her gain if she was willing, but on the downside if she was rejected it could ruin their friendship.<br>\r\nthe 2nd option was to secretly replace her foods with higher calorie alternatives, feed her weight gain milkshakes and also exploit Olivia's weakness for cake.<br>\r\nAnd finally, the 3rd option was one that was interesting to Olivia since she was very into such things, but hypnosis and subliminal manipulation. She could use some very calming music that had subliminal messages encouraging to eat more, and try to gain weight and to love it, of course to make Olivia listen to it ment she too would have to listen to it which may make her want to also gain weight, but then she did like the idea of getting fat as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what would she try to do?</span></div></div>",

She decided that she would tell Olivia over a large meal of her favourite food, perhaps the deliciousness of the meal would tempt Olivia to accept her offer.<br>\r\nKim therefore spent the entire day working on the biggest and most delicious feast she could whilst planning on what to say. She was terrified that she could ruin their friendship by confessing, particularly if Olivia rejects her, but the thought of developing a closer, more intimate relationship with Olivia was worth the risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time dinner was ready she had worked everything out, she went up to Olivia's room and told the chubby girl that dinner was ready, Olivia was surprised as she hadn't even known Kim was round her's today, but Kim just smiled and told her that she had been secretly working on a treat for her. Excitedly Olivia hurled herself off her enormous bed and walked towards Kim. Olivia was wearing her Night gown that Kim got her for her birthday afew years ago, it was too small now and didn't even cover all of her pot belly, but Kim loved it. Downstairs Olivia's eyes widened with joy as she saw a huge feast of her favourite foods laid out for her,<br>\r\n\"oh my god Kimmy, you made all this for me?\" she smiled happily<br>\r\n\"yep\" Kim smiled back \"plus to make it extra special i  am going to pamper you all evening\"<br>\r\n\"what's the occasion?\" Olivia asked curiously<br>\r\n\"there is no occasion, i just wanted to do something special for you\" she said and led Olivia to her chair and then sat right next to her. Kim then picked up a fork and brought the first mouthfull of food over to Olivia's mouth \"open wide\" Kim smiled cutely as Olivia did as she was said and Kim began to feed her all the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed as Kim fed Olivia everything she had made, massarging Olivia's bloated belly with her free hand as she fed her, helping the chubby girl digest and eat even more. Eventually she was finished, every plate of food, including desert was gone, all washed down by several thick, high calorie chocolate milkshakes. Olivia slumped back into her chair panting, her belly stuffed to the brim as it stuck out as if she were heavily pregnent. \"ohh...my...god. That was the most amazing meal i've ever had in my life, thank you so much\" Olivia said and smiled happily to Kim.<br>\r\n\"I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU\" Kim suddenly said to Olivia, having nervously lost all of what she was going to say.<br>\r\n\"wait, what?!\" Olivia replied, completly shocked.<br>\r\n\"I am in love with you\" Kim muttered \"I have been for the past couple of years, I haven't said anything until now because our friendship is too dear to me and I didn't want to risk ruining it, but i cannot contain it any more Olivia. I love you and I want to spend my life with you, pampering you and feeding you like today. I want us to be more than just friends, I want to be your partner...your lover...your wife...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia looked at Kim with great surprise, she had no idea \"this...this is alot to take in\" she muttered \"you love me? Even though i am fat and useless?\"<br>\r\nKim looked deep into Olivia's eyes \"You are not useless, and you're not fat. You are beautiful\"<br>\r\nOlivia blushed brightly and looked away for a bit and then looked back to Kim and kissed her on the lips \"alright...let's give this a shot\" Olivia smiled warmly \"lets be more than just friends\"<br>\r\nKim's eyes started to fill with tears as she hugged Olivia happily \"thank you, I was so scared you would turn me down\"<br>\r\n\"well to be honest, I've had a small crush on you for a while now, not as much as you've had on me, but I am willing to try make this work\" Olivia said and kissed Kim on the cheek \"now lets go to bed, I am stuffed to the brim with food and i can't sleep without you there\" she giggled playfully as Kim blushed and helped Olivia up and to her room, where the two girls cuddled and went to sleep, excited for what the next day would hold for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Olivia woke up to find Kim entering the room with a trolly full of food. \"good morning beautiful, I've made you breakfast in bed\" she smiled as Olivia woke herself up and sat upright looking greedily at the large breakfast Kim had made for her. \"So, what do you want to do today then?\" Kim asked as she sat on the bed next to Olivia eagerly looking forwards to feeding her again.</span></div></div>",

Kim nodded, and began to cut up Olivia's pancakes for her. Olivia quickly caught on to what Kim was doing, and let her new girlfriend feed her. They took it slow, as that way Olivia could fit in the entire giant meal. She was stuffed afterward, but looked content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh.\" she sighed. \"You sure do know how to pamper a girl. Grab some snacks and get up here.\" she said. Any rich girl like her naturally had a TV in her room, positioned so she could watch it from her bed. Kim nodded, and after putting the remnants of breakfast in the hall for some maid to find, grabbed a few bags of chips and the like (Olivia's house was so big that it was only sensible that she keep plenty of snacks in her room instead of going to the kitchen every time) and hopped onto Olivia's bed. She was hesitant at first, but cuddled up next to Olivia, placing the snacks on their laps. Olivia giggled and reached for the remote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple hours, all the two of them did was eat, watch TV, and occasionally shift position, cuddling up to each other even more. Kim's heart fluttered as she felt Olivia's body against hers. Olivia was only chubby, not fat, but her pampered skin was soft, and she was already starting to feel softer. The two girls got through quite a few snacks - and not just Olivia. In her years of trying to encourage Olivia to eat, Kim had gotten used to eating quite a lot of junkfood herself, to make Olivia feel less unusual about the amount she consumed. So she didn't even notice as she slowly gorged herself, her belly rounding out slightly. Olivia noticed as lunch time approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, keep that up and you'll end up like me!\" Olivia said jokingly, first rubbing Kim's meager gut and then slapping her own more prominent one. A mix of emotions washed over Kim. Shame, for not noticing, but also excitement, at both the way Olivia had touched her just now and the idea of being as beautiful as she found Olivia to be. Still, Kim wasn't a stupid girl, and understood that there was significantly less maneuverability between a fat couple than between a fat-and-thin one. Still...</span></div></div>",

On her own, maybe Kim could've gained control over her habits, without being surrounded by plates of food, bowls of sweets, and entire buffet lines steaming under her nose. It didn't help that Olivia was always munching on something, filling her body with food right in front of Kim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also didn't help that Kim was lazier than she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery day was spent lounging about the mansion, either cuddling, watching movies, or eating. There was nothing else Kim could do to distract her from all the food. Even more alarming was that she had already put on more weight than she anticipated. Olivia took to stroking the miniature belly that rolled over the lips of Kim's jeans. It wasn't large, especially next to Olivia's belly, but it was more than she had anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kim one night ate more than Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia's eyes were wide as she regarded Kim's bloated belly. \"I can't believe you ate all that pasta.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the meat loaf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, it wasn't much, but damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia caressed Kim's belly, sending almost orgasmic chills up her spine. \"If you keep this up, you'll be a real fat girl.\" Kim had enough self control to restrain herself. After all, Olivia was supposed to get fat, not her. She'd remain thinner, more mobile and agile, so she could play with Olivia's expanding form more, and enjoy every inch of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Months pass by for Kim in almost a euphoic haze as almost every minute of every day is spent with Olivia.<br>\r\nThe two girls feasted almost constantly as Kim did her best to fatten Olivia, and yet as time passed she seemed to be consuming more and more, even surpassing Olivia in quantity consumed.<br>\r\nKim didn't realise it, but she naturally had a greater appitite than Olivia and was one of those people who could comsume monsterous amounts of food without getting full. Olivia on the other hand was not, she filled quicker despite her larger stomach as naturally her capacity is lower than Kim's.<br>\r\nOf course, due to the different lifestyles, Kim had never been able to abuse her capacity for gluttony whilst Olivia had, hence why Olivia had always been the chubby one. But it was becoming clear that the reason Olivia's slothernly and gluttinous lifestyle had not caused greater weight gain until now was because her body was physically less inclined to gain, whilst Kim's however was.<br>\r\nAs a result of this Olivia's gain, whilst magnificent, was actually less than Kim's. Olivia had now reached a beautiful 250lbs. Her body had really taken shape now as her belly bulged out a nice distance and hung down slightly over her pants line. She sported round soft hips and a glorious muffin top that too hung over her pants line. Her thighs now were flabby and rubbed together on the rare times that she walked and her breasts had swollen up a good few sizes, as now they hung down and rested on her fat belly. Her face had become round and soft, propped up by a cute second chin as her arms too had gained flab and the flesh hung down from them as it did everywhere that her fat was large enough for gravity to take hold of. Olivia was a short girl, only 5'3 so her form was bigger thanks to the amount of weight on such a small frame. She was deffinately an apple shape, and if it weren't for her personal tailors whom worked for her parents, she would've ran out of clothes that fit her weeks ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kim...her gain was greater as she had started from a lower number and had now also reached 250lbs making her the same weight as Olivia. However as she was 5'7 in height, it was not quite as much in the way of fat as Olivier, and whilst Olivia had formed into a beautiful apple shape with a big belly and breasts, Kim was more of a pear shape, her weight collecting more along her lower half.<br>\r\nAs a result of this her legs and thighs were far fatter than Olivia's, the fat of them squishing up against each other to a far greater extent. Her hips and waist too were wider than Olivia's as they spread out as far as they could with the fat that they had. Her stomach too had grown, though not to the extent Olivia's had, but compaired to what it once was, there was deffinately alot more there. Her face and arms were about as fat as Olivia's round and cute in their look, whilst her breasts had barely grown at all. They had gone up a few sizes, but their growth had been less than anything else on her now extensive body.<br>\r\nKim too would have run out of clothes, but Olviia's tailor had been keeping her clothed as well, not that the girls really needed them. Lounging around in bed binging almost constantly didn't really require a full wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though the euphoric haze had to come to an end, both girls had gained much and Kim's goals of staying thin were long gone, it wasn't until Olivia pointed it out whilst caressing her wide hips that Kim came to realise this. Infact, at this moment Kim came to realise she had gained almost twice the amount of weight that Olivia had, and if she didn't stop this, she would end up the huge one with Olivia caring for her rather than the other way round.<br>\r\nHer dreams had always been for Olivia to be the fat one being pampered, and whilst she had been excited watching Olivia's growth over the months, now she came to realise she too had grown, she was actually slightly excited by that prospect of herself growing fat too.<br>\r\nBut what should she do? Continue as is and allow herself to overtake Olivia? If she does she'll need to find how Olivia feels and thinks, she could not let herself get so fat that Olivia is no longer attracted to her, particularly as their relationship had now reached 3rd base. It would defeat the point entirely if she and Olviia broke up.<br>\r\nOr she could stop binging entirely and focus everything on Olivia, she quite liked her new size and so long as she didn't get much bigger it wouldn't matter so much, and at least with Olivia becoming huge she knows she will never be unattracted to her, for Olivia's growth is only making her crazier for the fat billionair....</span></div></div>",

So Olivia stuffed, and rubbed, and jiggled and cheered Kim on her ever growing gluttony. Kim had at one point worried that she would be bigger then Olivia but those fears flew out the window once she realized she could never hope of walking again. Now here we are, Kim's belly now touches the floor from the bed and she loves the feeling of her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was so proud of what she had accomplished, she wanted everyone else to see. So she climbed up onto Kim's belly and kissed her passionately, grabbing massive handfuls of both boob fat and belly fat. \"Hey piggy\" Olivia started \"Guess what I'm going to do with you?\" Kim could only let out a weak mmph. \"I'm going to show the world your beautifl body by getting you into the record books.

The music was very peaceful and soothing and Kim turned it up as they went into bed to go sleep, fully aware that within the music was secret messages that would make them soon start wanting to gain weight and grow fatter. Both girls slept peacefully and over the next week Kim played the music every night all night, day by day noticing a small change in Olivia and her own eating habits as they were both eating more than usual, until one day she decided enough time would pass and she would confront Olivia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Olivia\" Kim said as they were both getting ready for breakfast \"i want to ask you something thats kinda embarassing\"<br>\r\n\"ohh?\" Olivia replied blushing slightly<br>\r\n\"I...I was thinking that...well the thing is, I want to put on some weight.\" she blushed \"it's kind of been a fantasy of mine and I've always been too embarrased to do anything about it, but i was thinking, that you of all people would understand. The thing is I don't know if i should start intentionally putting on weight\"<br>\r\nOliva looked at Kim surprised, she had no idea but it made her so happy to hear that from her \"I can't believe it\" she said surprised \"me too!\"<br>\r\n\"what? Really!?\" Kim replied faking surprise<br>\r\n\"yeah, i've been steadily gaining weight over the past two years and have come to really like it and I want to get bigger, faster\" Olivia confessed<br>\r\n\"that's incredible\" Kim said happily, thrilled that the subliminal music was working \"well we should gain together.\"<br>\r\n\"yes we should!\" Olivia grinned eagerly \"we'll get very fat and sexy in no time, and if people don't like it, well to hell with them\"<br>\r\n\"damn right!\" Kim grinned back and hugged her \"lets go get breakfast, we've got along way to go before either of us could be called 'fat' \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the two girls began their quest to get as fat as they could. Kim continued to play the music every night, mainly to reinforce their goals, whilst now they spent all day every day stuffing their faces. Sometimes with junk food, other times with food cooked by Olivia's private chef and other times out at cafe's whilst on dates. Kim tried to hold back the amount she ate as much as possible to focus on Olivia's gain, she made it her job to make sure Olivia never went without food, that she was always snacking on some kind of junk food, and with all their time they were spending together trying to gain weight, they also got slightly closer as friends too.</span></div></div>",

At first she couldn't make heads or tails of it, and didn't move as she tried to figure it out. It felt like her belly was churning, but not with hunger. Actually, she was a bit hungry, but could tell that wasn't it. It wasn't painful either. Until she felt a sharp pinch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yow!\" she shouted, eyes opening quickly. In front of her was Olivia, a shocked and guilty look over her face. The covers had been pulled down so that they only reached to Kim's knees. Even more strangely, Kim's tight pajama top had been pulled up to leave her belly bare. After a week of an ever-increasing desire to gain weight, Kim already had quite a belly, a soft dome that stuck out a couple inches from her and made her bellybutton deeper. She had rather soft sides as well, not yet love handles of any sort. One of Olivia's hands was poised in midair right over Kim's belly. Kim blinked, and Olivia drew it back, blushing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia....did you just pinch my belly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to hurt you.\" Olivia said, soft face pouting. Olivia had had a head start over Kim, and by now was starting to look truly fat. Her cheeks were just a bit rounder, and 'rounder' described the rest of her. Rounder, fuller breasts that strained her top's buttons, a round little pot belly that peaked out of the top, smooth hips and legs. She was a chubby girl, no doubt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see how you stacked up. You're still so skinny, Kim!\" Olivia told her. Kim looked down at herself and frowned. She had been trying to hold back, but she felt so skinny....and disgusting. The subliminal messages had really taken root in her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know. Let's get breakfast.\" Kim said. Olivia smiled and patted her belly. That made Kim stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I just felt like it. Skinny or not, you're at least looking better with that belly of yours.\" Olivia told her. Not even trying to resist, Olivia had become increasingly focused on her newfound love of fat and gaining. She was still mostly the same girl Kim had always known and loved...just they had a bit more in common now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not half bad yourself.\" Kim said with a nervous smile. Olivia just smiled and gave a little laugh. It was encouraging. They were closer than ever, and Kim felt almost ready to confess her desires to Olivia. She felt maybe it was time to push things a little closer. She had one little suggestion for Olivia along those lines....</span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll be fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Oliva used the intercom to summon her breakfast in bed. Actually, the more she thought about it, the more it made sense to her, and the more excited she grew while waiting for their food. She had requested two towers of pancakes, and boy, the servants did not disappoint. In addition to that, they had their stash of junk food for midnight munchies. It was barely 10, and the two girls were already stuffing themselves silly. Kim really ate as fast as she could, drowning the pancakes with syrup; she even put some on her candy bars. \u201cWow\u201d she thought \u201cthose CDs really worked well\u201d. She decided that she\u2019d put an halt on them, at least for a while. Otherwise, she\u2019d become a slob, obsessed with food and food only. Oliva did not seem to worry though, she too was eating quickly. But she also wanted Oliva to be able to think about something else than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a feast that lasted almost an hour, the two girls decided to watch TV a bit. Kim\u2019s belly was sore, and was poking out even more so now than it was before. It was going to be another lazy day, but neither girl cared about that. The bed was still warm from the night, the meal had been good and the company was good. Why care about anything else? However, Kim noticed that Oliva was a little unsettled, as if she was trying to find the perfect position to be comfortable. After a few minutes, Kim was taken aback when Oliva found her position; she rested her head onto Kim\u2019s distended belly. Kim was a little a comfortable by this, mostly because the food in her stomach had now even less space than before. But when she felt Oliva\u2019s breasts and supple forms pressing herself against her hips and legs\u2026 she felt so good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not uncomfortable, are you?\u201d Olive hesitantly asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 not at all\u201d said Kim<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t\u2026 awkward, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope\u2026 I don\u2019t think\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they returned to their TV show, and other usual stuff. But Kim could feel that Oliva was snuggling more and more onto her. She could not believe it. In her imagination, she was the one doing things like that. Could it be that Oliva felt the same way? Or maybe she was just becoming snugglier. But Kim then thought that this evening, she could be the one doing this; after all, Oliva was definitely \u2018softer\u2019, more and more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But not only that I wanted to be her lover, girlfried perhaps ever her wife. Olivia I want to spend every day of the rest of my life with you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Night of the obese fat girl:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia Landon was a beautiful slender girl who was very proud of her perfect looks. Being rich she could have whatever she wanted and do whatever she wanted and with that she made sure she always had the very best, the best clothes, the best make up, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one day walking home from a shopping spree, acompanied by three body guards and a maid, two of the guards carrying all the stuff she brought. On her way along she was happily chatting to her maid about what she brought when she bumped into something large and soft and fell over. She looked up to noticed she walked into a large obese man who just looked at her, he must have weighed over 500lbs and he had been eating a burger. The man appologised even though she had been the one to walk into him and offered to help Olivia up when she got up to her feet and shouted at the obese man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"why don't you watch where you're going you fat bas***d\" she swore angrily \"or couldn't you see me with all that fat in the way, you hidious creep?\"<br>\r\n\"you know, those are not nice things to say, you walked into me, you are the one to blame\" he said calmly<br>\r\n\"Only because you take up the entire freakin sidewalk! Just get out of my way\" she snapped and stormed off followed by maid and bodyguards.<br>\r\nThe obese man watched her leave as he smirked sinisterly \"you will soon learn to treat fat people with some basic human conpassion\" he said to himself and waddled off, turning away from the girl and her staff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night as Olivia slept the obese man from earlier that day had made his way into her room, how? we may never know. He just did. As she slept he approached her bed and placed his hand on her forehead, the moonlight shon through the window onto her bed and the fat man started to mutter some kind of chant. \"From this day forth you too shall know what it is like to be obese. When the moon comes out your weight will increase, at a full moon you shall become as fat as I and gain 400lbs, at half moon you will gain 200lbs, and so on for quarter and three quarter. All you eat and all the weight you gain whilst fat will remain on your normal body during the day, but regardless of your size at night you will gain 100lbs for every quarter of the moon up in the sky\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that the curse had been set, as tonight was a full moon her body rapidly expanded. Rolls of fat started growing as her body got wider and flabbier. Her breasts increased by what must have been 10 cup sizes, her hips had gone from being petit to needing two full chairs to sit on. Her belly grew larger and larger, as it became so big that it would hang below her crotch when standing. Her thighs also exploded with blubber as they crushed togeher and bloated outwards turning the only petit 80lbs girl into a 480lbs SSBBW. Her face became round and soft, gaining not one but two extra chins whilst her pyjama's could not hold the sudden 400lbs incrase and exploded leaving her completly naked and also waking her up, the obese man had now gone but her weight hadn't. She screamed out in horror waking up the entire mansion and summoning all her body guards and maids.<br>\r\nThey were shocked to see what had become of their master, she was huge and naked and all the body guards couldn't look as they found her far too sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"what happened?\" her main maid and friend asked<br>\r\n\"I dont know\" she cried \"I woke up like this, i'm a hidious blimp and i'm starving\"<br>\r\n\"we'll call an ambulence and get you something to eat, ok?\" the maid said to her in a calming voice \"everything will be alright\"<br>\r\n\"alright\" she nodded as she continued to cry. The maid got all the other maids to make food and bring it to her whilst she then called for an ambulence. Afterwards she went to the fattest maid in the mansion who weighed about 350lbs and asked her for some clothes explaining what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ha, serves the bitch right\" the fat maid laughed<br>\r\n\"what do you mean?\"  the other replied<br>\r\n\"she's  got what was coming to her, she has spent her entire life mocking fat people and now she is one. Hell she isn't just fat but she's super obese! Ohh that is sweet sweet irony\" she grinned \"i think i'm going to go over and take a look. Just go into my wardrobe and try find something that you think will fit, it probebly wont but its the closest thing you've got\" she laughed and waddled out of her room to go and take a look at Olivia.<br>\r\nWhen she got there she found Olivia was huge and completly naked crying her eyes out whilst stuffing her face, her stomach roared for more food and with every delicious bite she cried more, for the fat maid this was probebly the greatest moment of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half an hour the ambulence arrived to take the obese girl to hospital, Oliva was now dressed in a pair of sweats that were by no means her size and were completly skin tight, showing off her huge legs completly as the top also could not even try to cover her belly and only served to keep her breasts covered. She was a mess and yet she was still hungry.<br>\r\nAt the hospital she immediatly was taken to a room, being a billionair she of course got preferential treatment. She had a specialist bed that could support her weight and soon had a team of doctors working on her to try and find out if she was alright health wise and what could have caused this increadible change in weight. However as they worked through the night the morning soon came and the moon faded over the horizon, her weight melted away before her very eyes and the eyes of the doctors, now her clothes she was wearing looked like tents on her, and though she was in the bed they just slid down unable to fit in the slightest. The doctors found this even more odd and decided to keep her in for the next few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next few days they discovered that her weight would balloon up at night, though they had not associated the moon with it, since it was in the cycle where it was full for the whole week each night she gained 400lbs, and each morning she lost it again. Eventually the doctors determined that it was beyond their scope and there was nothing at all they could do, she was not in any harm health wise whilst fat and the frequent changes did nothing to effect her health either. All they noted was that her hunger whilst at night was isatiable and though they did their best to keep her well fed it was never enough. They sent her home a week after the first incident as now she was getting used to the change, she didn't like it but until they figured out what was wrong she had no choice but to get used to it.<br>\r\nAll the staff prepaired that day for the night to come, they had spent the entire day prepairing food that could feed a feast of a hundred people and also buying fat girl clothes for Olivia to change into after the gain, and as expected her weight shot up that night to 480lbs, she got changed into her fat girl clothes and made her way to her feast, she was dying of hunger and could think of nothing else but eating, more and more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Olivia eats the whole meal and wakes up in the morning thin again but fatter than before.<br>\r\nOption 2: Olivia is contagious and those who spend time with her whilst fat also gain weight.<br>\r\nOption 3: Other</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia hated the common people. They were smelly, disgusting, and they looked as if they had dressed in the dark. She avoided being around them at all costs if she could help it, but some days, like that very day, she had no choice but to deal with them. All three drivers at her disposal were busy elsewhere, and Olivia didn't have the patience to wait for something so common as a bus. It was with a sigh that she realised she was going to have to rely on a taxi, and pulled out her up-to-date smart phone out of her Lois Vuitton bag, searching through the apps to find the one that would locate the nearest taxi rank for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyes so intensely focused on the screen, she didn't notice the scruffy young man until she had collided hard with him, almost knocking her Chanel sunglasses from where they were perched on the top of her head. Olivia gasped in disgust as she recoiled back, glaring at the young man as if he were no better than something underneath her expensive high heel shoe. \"Watch where you're going, you disgusting creature!\" Olivia snapped as she brushed herself down, \"How dare you? I bet you were just trying to cop a feel of me, weren't you?!\" With that she marched past the young man, who followed her with intense blue eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think that appearances matter,\" he murmured, brushing back the lank curls of dark hair that fell over his blazing azure eyes, watching Olivia's slender, retreating form, \"You'll see yourself thin even though you grow fatter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange feeling hit Olivia as she clambered delicately into the taxi cab, having pushed her way to the front of the queue with a flash of cash. She sank back against the cheap leather seat, holding a manicured hand to her flat stomach. She had felt something that felt like a gurgle, along with a faint pushing sensation. Shaking her head of long blond hair, Olivia sat back, and watched out of the taxi window as they finally pulled away from the rank. She swore she could see a dark haired stranger staring at her intently from the irritated queue, but he was gone the moment she tried to focus more clearly on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting him to the back of her mind, Olivia pulled out her compact from her purse, and began checking her make up critically. The foundation was still perfect, a pot of which came close to being someone's average salary for an entire month, and her eyeliner and mascara was absolute perfection. Olivia really was an unfairly pretty girl, with almond shaped green eyes and lightly tanned skin, complete with long honey blond hair that tumbled over her shoulders in perfect curls. Her figure was perfect, slender with just a slight flare to her hips, and long legs that she liked to show off whenever she could. Many people commented that Olivia's good looks were a complete contrast to the spoilt brat she was inside, but were wise enough to do so behind their hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn reaching the grand mansion that she had grown up calling home, Olivia stepped delicately out of the cab, thrusting a handful of bills at the startled driver, who took them quickly before driving off. She walked up to the main entrance, not even giving the doorman a second glance as she stepped inside, despite him bowing very low to her in respect. Olivia's heels clicked on the expensive mirrored hallway, and she shrugged off her expensive coat, tossing it aside to one of the maids who had come hurrying up to help their young mistress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Olivia's stomach let out a faint growl of hunger, and the young woman looked down in irritation. \"I want something to eat,\" she demanded to the young maid, a pretty Japanese girl called Yumi, who looked adorable in the French maid outfit, \"I want it bought up to my room.\" With that Olivia clacked away, her smart phone already back out and held up to her ear as she made a call to one of her many friends. Yumi bowed in response, before moving to hang Olivia's coat up in the closet that housed all of her coats, a good hundred of them the last time she had bothered to count, then making her way to the kitchens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, Tony-san?\" Yumi bowed her head to the young cook on duty, while she spoke English fluently, she had a habit of slipping Japanese words and phrases into her speech, \"Olivia-sama wishes for something to eat.\" Tony turned around from where he had been chopping onions, pulling a mock face at the order, Yumi had to mask a giggle. Tony was young, dark haired, handsome and cheeky with it. He made his feelings about Olivia clear, and wouldn't pander to her every need. It was somewhat of a miracle that he still worked there after so many years, it was a given that his good looks had led to him being allowed to stay; Olivia had gotten it into her head that he fancied her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet she does,\" Tony remarked with a good natured grin, and a roll of his eyes, \"I'll fix her something, Yumi. And what did I tell you about calling me -san all the time?\" he added teasingly, moving away to pull various ingredients out of one of the cupboards. Tony had grown up to a fairly average family, and it showed from how hard he worked. He was in his early twenties, and while he eventually wanted to open his own restaurant, the giant pay cheque he was receiving each month was more than enough to make him stay for the time being. That, and a certain Japanese maid he had become quite fond of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just twenty minutes later that Yumi bought Olivia a dish of delicious fish and pasta, displayed as artfully as if it had been going out in a five star restaurant. Olivia waited for Yumi to place the tray over her lap, before taking a bite of the dish. It was actually delicious, Olivia took a second forkful, led back on her four poster bed as she watched the wide screen television hung up on the wall. She made no sign that she had even realised Yumi was there, and the Japanese maid bowed politely to her, before taking her leave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Olivia demanded, and Yumi turned around, her expression meek and eager to help; just how Olivia liked it, \"I want more,\" she added, already halfway through the dish, \"I'm hungry. Tell Tony to do it for me,\" Olivia added, fluttering her eyelashes with a faint smirk that suggested he was just that into her, \"I'm sure he will.\" Yumi forced herself to bow, before leaving the room again. Olivia smirked, before leaning back against the bed to continue eating. She knew Yumi liked the cook, it was just so much fun to torment her that he clearly liked Olivia better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she wasn't quite sure how she did it, Olivia managed to pack away just over twenty dishes of food that night. Tony had lost his sarcastic and good natured edge, and was close to exhaustion when Yumi returned downstairs with Olivia's empty dishes. \"You cannot,\" Tony began dramatically, holding a hand to his forehead, \"You cannot tell me that she's still hungry.\" Yumi gave an almost frightened giggle as she set the plates down, before shaking her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia-sama is asleep,\" Yumi explained softly, \"She ate too much.\" Tony looked relived to hear that, setting about cleaning up the kitchen for the final time that night. While it wasn't technically a part of her job description, Yumi pitched in as well, helping to brush the floor free of debris so that Tony could mop over it afterwards. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Olivia was a very spoilt girl, she lived a life of luxury and never had to do anything for herself. Growing up being given everything she ever wanted Olivia had becoming incredibly greedy and extremely lazy. Day after day she spent her time lounging around watching anime or playing video games or surfing the internet whilst almost always stuffin her face with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlivia was a rather large girl, tipping the scales just over 200lbs. She was also short, which made her look quite a bit fatter. She had a soft round face and a cute pot belly, her breasts were small given her height but thanks to her weight they were a reasonable size, her butt was wide and soft and her thighs flabby and pressing together always. She had long blonde hair which her maids took care of for her, and every time her clothing grew tight they would replace them with a larger version. All in all she led a perfect lifestyle for someone who wanted to laze around and grow fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecently she had fired her personal chef who had started to cut down on her portions and switch her to low fat alternatives, upon confronting him about it he revealed that he was concerned about her inactive lifestyle and that if something wasn't done about it her health could begin to plummet. She was furious that he dared to treat her like some kind of stupid child and fired him on the spot and then told her personal maid that she needed a new chef, one who would make her all the fatty foods she wanted whenever she wanted, one who didn't care if she got fatter, one who would never use the low fat alternative.<br>\r\nHer maid agreed and began to look around for a top quality chef who would be ok with being responsible for sending a teenage girl down a path of extreme obesity. After looking everywhere she could not find one until she came across a professional 'feeder' on the internet. Curious as to not knowing what a Feeder was she assumed it to be some sort of chef,  she looked at the man's credentials and as it happened he was a 5 star rated chef over in England. She researched a list of his 'clients' and found that they were all obese women ranging from 300lbs to 700lbs, clearly he had no problem cooking for people who were obese.<br>\r\nShe immediatly took the phone and called the man, though they were in America, the cost of an international call was nothing to them. She explained to the man that she was looking for a top quality chef who had no problems with causing a 16 year old girl to become obese. She explained that Olivia was a very pampered girl, the daughter of two billionairs and she as a result was overweight and lazy, she fired the last chef for trying to encourage her to lose weight and now they needed one who would cook her all the food she wanted, no matter how fattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Englishman was very intersted in this proposal, to live in a billionair's mansion, paid to feed and fatten up a beautiful young woman, it was every Feeder's dream. He requested that he see a picture of Olivia first and gave the maid his fax number, she sent him a photo of her in a tank top and shorts relaxing by the pool, her belly bulging out and her beautiful long blonde hair flowing down her sides. The man immediatly agreed and with the maid's help set up the documents to immegrate to America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks passed as Olivia was forced to live off junk food due to a lack of a chef, she didn't mind so much but it did cause her figure to increase slightly. By the time their new chef arrived she had gained 5 pounds from her junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man arrived at the huge mansion, awestruck by it's splendor. After getting through security he was escorted to the front door and greeted by the maid who hired him. He quickly examined the maid to see that she was a rather tall woman with beautiful brown hair, not as long as Olivia's but just as well kept, she had a volumptious figure and though she was not overweight or anything she did have an ample pair of breasts and lovely curvy hips, dressed in a french maid outfit she was perhaps the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and though she was thin she had incredible potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe maid in turn examined the new chef, he was very tall and of a moderate build, neither fat nor muscular yet he wasn't thin or scrawny either, He had medium length brown hair that was tied back in a neat pony tail and on his face he had a smart pair of glasses, he was rather handsome she must admit, much better looking than their last chef. The maid then introduced herself as Constance, the personal maid to miss Olivia Landon. The man introduced himself as Stephen, and Constance couldn't help but love his british accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led him into the mansion and two other maids took his bagsm she showed him around a bit as they went towards Olivia's room, upon entering her room he saw a giant room with the biggest bed he had ever seen, there were book shelves filled with anime and manga and on the other side of the room there was a huge sofa facing a massive flat screen HD TV with all the consoles connected to it and a magnificent game collection near by as well. Stephen was amazed, was a massive game and anime geek just like he was and then he saw her. Olivia was lounging on the sofa in her pyjama's with her pot belly hanging out and the pant button undone, she was playing on one of the consoles and then paused it when she noticed Constance and Stephen enter her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen introduced himself and Olivia introduced herself, she asked him about his cooking as she wanted to make sure he wouldn't cook healthy foods, she explained she only liked good tasting fatty foods and particularly loved cake, he reassured her that those foods were his specialty and then found himself ordered to go make her some cake then. Stephen willingly agreed as he loved the fact that his job would result in this pretty girl growing very fat indeed.<br>\r\nHowever, what of Constance and her sexy volumptious body, she had such potential too.<br>\r\nAs he was taken to the kitchen he was grinning to himself, there were other maids in the house too, all rather attractive and all wearing their sexy uniforms. If he were to cook for them all he could find himself in a house full and beautiful fat women.<br>\r\nWho should he focus on?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Stephen decided that for now he should just make sure that he makes Olivia bigger and more beautiful, his job was to keep her well fed and happy and if he didn't do so he could lose his new job. He therefore got to work, he found out from Constance that Olivia's favourite cake was cheesecake and decided that he would make her the richest, most fattening and most deliciously morish cheesecake ever. It would take a while to make and until then he knew she would need to be kept satisfied with snacks, but luckily the kitchen he was given to work with was huge and he had everything he could possibly need to make several meals at once. After washing his hands and learning where all utensiles were he got to work, making not only the most fattening cheesecake ever, but a huge number of cookies and brownies as well as her dinner for later that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked on the cookies and brownies first since they wouldn't take long as he mixed them with dangerously large amounts of high calorie expensive chocolate and butter whilst working on a white chocolate cheesecake for his soon to be growing mistress. Once the cookies and brownies were done he went up to Olivia's room to find her laying on her sofa watching anime, a packet oreos were resting on her pudgy belly which remained completly exposed as it had ridden up whilst she was shifting to get comfortable and she just left it there. Stephen looked at her soft, smooth belly as it was flawless without dimples or stretch marks, thanks to her family's wealth she had her own spa treatment area and so her skin was always in the best condition possible.<br>\r\nStephen greeted Olivia as he brought the food to her but she told him to be quiet, he looked at the tv to see it was one of his favourite shows, handing her the plate of cookies and another plate of brownies he sat down next to her to watch, once the scene was over she paused the show and thanked him for the food, taking a bite of a brownie her eyes lit up and she ate it vigorously and soon the two got to talking. They had alot in common as they both loved anime and video games, fattening junk food and the internet, Olivia was amazed at how nice her new chef was, not only did he make the best tasting junk food ever, but he was just like her, he was kind and very charming and not to mention funny. Olivia couldn't help but blush as bit as she was charmed by the attractive young feeder.<br>\r\nEventually though the timer on Stephen's watch beeped and he had to leave Olivia for now, as he he had to attend to the cake and her dinner. He left the overweight young woman alone again to her huge pile of fattening treats. He smiled to himself as he made his way back to the kitchen, not only was she going to gain alot of weight but he could tell she was starting to develop a crush on him, he might be able to enjoy the benefits of fattening her up sooner than he had expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinnertime soon came and Olivia had devowered all the cookies and brownies and was now hungry again, she slowly made her way to the dining room only to find a huge feast of foods ready for her, from fattening things such as burgers, pizzas and some pastas. To less fattening but equally delicious meals such as some rice dishes, beef and other meats and vegtables. Stephen did not expect Olivia to eat it all but he explained to her that he made her such a large vareity to food to find out what she likes and what she doesn't like, as well as her own suggestions as to what she would like to make the meals better. He had made everything to a 5 star rating, but as a private chef what was important was making her happy and making food to her likes and dislikes. Olivia was thrilled, never before had a chef shown such interest in her oppinion and preferences, already she was thinking that he may well be the best chef she had ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStephen meanwhile knew that by doing it this way he would make Olivia eat far more than she otherwise would normally as she would be trying everything out, and also he knew that this was actually legitimatly a means to find what she did and didn't like as to make sure she would eat more food in the long run.<br>\r\nIn the end he knew that weather she ate everything or not she would need time before he presented his masterpiece, the greatest white chocolate cheese cake he had ever made.<br>\r\nBut would she manage to eat an entire feast fit for ten people?</span></div></div>",
