            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jone had droven all the way out to Tennessee country, which edged the Great Smoky Mountains, to watch his niece compete in a swimming competition. As he'd pull in the parking lot he'd check his clock, seeing it at eight-thirty-AM when he had to be here at one-PM, he sighed at his own impatience. The swimming building was located up a hill &amp; was the last of structures, the Smoky Mountain Nature Reserve taking up the rest of any commercial or residential potential..<br>\r\nJone noticed that there was a dirt path for a car leading up the hills &amp; a 'No Trespassing' sign there with it, but the iron gate stopping cars was wide open, &amp; this piqued his curiosity. Seeing no cameras, cars or people he'd decide to investigate, knowing it'll take his time up. Switching to four-wheel-drive he'd turn a sharp right that led him onto a steep upward road, it atleast was half a mile long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Going anyways through constant bumping &amp; being bounced some he'd get near the top &amp; stop as he started getting <b>weird</b> radio static. He'd try flipping channels just to have it follow, &amp; yelling in annoyance he continued over the hill- it was steeper than how he went up &amp; he slammed the breaks as now his car was slowly being dragged down it by gravity!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've figured!\" He hated on himself as he now was following the path &amp; kept the car straight as it gradually gained speed, even on the brakes. Shooting down atleast halfway the path was covered over with treetops &amp; slowly straightened out,   Jone barely stopping as his car slid around in mud &amp; almost hit a tree. <br>\r\nFlipping his lights on in the slightly-navigable spot he'd see he could turn right, but his car, he knew, won't make it up that hill. <br>\r\nAgitated he'd ruin his day by following impulse past a Trespassing sign he continued &amp; turned his car down the path- he figured if it was started by people it ends with people..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis path angled downward into one of the Smoky Canyons, unfortunately still covered over with tree's. Jone's radio intensified, \"Shad'up!\" He hit it lightly before looking up in shock &amp; stopping- <br>\r\nThere was a bowl of dirt making a huge hill with many huge trees covering it, nothing but darkness down the path that had to enter a massive cavern atleast eight feet tall, he judged from the steepness &amp; the.. Sheer width. Despite getting a gut feeling be should NOT go- he did! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe headlights illuminated a mossy stone ground as he drove down the eighty-feet pathway, the static <i>immediately</i> stopping once he was driving on the moss. <br>\r\nAhead the ground was unnaturally flat &amp; still covered in moss, &amp; all he saw in the distance was some light coming through holes at the top, he judged the cave to be likely a-hundred feet long! He'd turn his car right &amp; it would illuminate the cave wall barely- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-A massive pile of tree-trunks were stacked like a square brick atleast twenty feet tall.. They looked machine-cut to Jone as he drove around it, finding a depression full of discarded, burned logs in a <i>long</i> pit. <br>\r\nHe'd put the car in park &amp; step out as it faced the cave, taking in a breath of the fresh air. \"Definently not a normal cave..\" He mumbled to himself &amp; saw moss was cleared atleast fifteen feet from the logs- \"Is anyone here!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yell echoed throughout the cave atleast four times, &amp; there was no reply-<br>\r\n<b>\"Hurah.. Nmm..\"</b> A massive groaning sound came from the back of the cave, shaking the stone only barely. Joan freaked <u>out</u>, hasty to jump back in his car- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLarge, emerald green eyes glittered in the darkness when he looked forward, staring directly at the car. Jone was nearly having a panic attack, but as he didn't move for a minute, neither did the eyes- <br>\r\n<b>\"Who's? Not the caretaker..\"</b> he heard.. A female-sounding voice, the fact whatever it was spoke calmed him slightly. Rolling down his window &amp; then leaning out of it the eyes followed &amp; approached a few feet, staying out of the lights. \"My name is Joan! Hi- whoever you are!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that this being was <i>not</i> a person he'd freeze up as the eyes rose &amp; he heard groans, them locked onto his car as they rose up thirty-five feet! <b>\"Malakum, is my name.\"</b><br>\r\nThe definitely a woman said as she approached, Joan bringing his head back-in just to step out of his car ad the ground shook-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo massive legs came out from the darkness covered in a deep-green fur, Jone looking up to see it stop halfway up her muscular thighs. Then.. He saw her legs were covered in fur bristles &amp; she wore a loincloth that didn't cover her pussy or ass, giving him one helluva' sight. Her feet, however, were completely beast-like with two-&amp;-a-half foot claws- <br>\r\nShe knelt down &amp; he saw her stomach was covered in thin fur, giving him sight of her toned &amp; tanned chest- then her 'C' breast were like- uherm- two widened busses, barely held by boiled tree bark turned into a bra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum had caramel skin &amp; a human hand- covered in smooth furs up to her arms wenis &amp; <i>sharp</i> one-foot claws- &amp; shoulder-length brown messy hair. <br>\r\nHe'd lie if she wasn't a beauty, but her size was killing his imagination &amp; hope. Standing silent for a dozen seconds atleast she grinned her sharp teeth at him before bending down <i>to</i> him, her face only three yards away. With her head like a small house to him- he began regretting his decision to burn time. <br>\r\n\"Most scream, run. You &amp; few others have stayed, but I can say that can also be bad. Caretaker doesn't like outsiders..\" Whatever she was saying to him eased him some, but when she mentioned 'caretakers' his gut dropped. She kept her smile, but just then he'd notice large brown ears folded over &amp; a massive-brown-spotted tail swaying slowly behind her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it, he thought, he shouldn't care until he's in physical danger. <br>\r\n\"Who's that!?\" He questioned Malakum, who really wasn't appearing hostile, smiling wide. \"Humans who let me live, humans whom beat me in fight. Im 'classi- fa-e-ied' as <b>they</b> say.\" Her voice had a tone of some anger or something, he wasn't to perceptive. \"That's-\" as he was <i>about</i> to talk, his radio blared on-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delta-Zero-One, Zero-Three en route to feeding location. ETA ten minutes, out.\" Joan then got panicking, knowing no way could he escape, they were likely government! \"Caretakers deliver me message, though my box is off.. You have one, but aren't one.\" She pointed that out &amp; Jone was, frankly, impressed with this humanoids logic abilities despite living in the forest. However surviving this predicament was his goal, so he'd jump on this chance to ask her for help!<br>\r\n\"Malakum! I <i>really</i> need you to help me hide from these caretakers!\" He pleaded &amp; stepped forward a yard, closing the gap some as Malakum yawned.<br>\r\n\"I- hm.\" She stopped mid-sentence, thinking of what she <i>could</i> do, help this human or just kill him? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum really disliked her caretakers however, forcing her to stay in this cave. So she settled on helping him hide as Jone thought he might not be able to go see his niece, Malakum more happy that she'd be helping a human- thinking of the ones who defeated her..<br>\r\n\"Ok. Come up.\" Bringing her hand down with retracted claws to him, Jone was slightly anxious, her hand looking easily able to crush him. But knowing he'd likely get killed or, maybe let off, he didn't want to take <i>those</i> risks with people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd pull on some finger fur &amp; step on her hand, staring at Malakum's face as he sat down on her palm. She store back at him atleast two feet away, Jone able to smell her rank breath. <br>\r\n\"Not much place to hide, they look around.\" She told him quite lowly, sounding annoyed, her smile dropping. <br>\r\n\"Then hide me on you- until they're gone!\" Despite feeling like he might get squashed or hurt doing this, it was the best option. Malakum grinned some, making Jone feel slightly infatuated, with a giant lion woman &amp; likely going to be hidden by her..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Caves eighty-five feet tall.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum would cogitate on how to hide him for a few seconds, &amp; with time burning &amp; her desire not to let him be caught rising she made up her mind- to put him inside of her vagina. <b>\"I have a area. Don't move.\"</b> <br>\r\nJone quickly found out where this was as she got onto her knees &amp; lifted up her loincloth, bringing her hand down with him. He got a <i>huge</i> rush of lust &amp; fear seeing how her entrance was able to fit him, &amp; he hoped he wouldn't be crushed, but there were worse ways to go &amp; he stood still. Being handled by Malakum was uncomfortable, she'd softly grab his legs &amp; bend back slightly, Jone having a hard-on looking at her entrance, still clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out very hushed gasp as she pushed his legs in, Jone feeling the undulating walls around his feet. This made him feel slightly calmer as it was like a sticky-&amp;-wetish blanket, &amp; keeping his arms to his sides, Malakum lightly pushed him in fully. Jone, now surrounded on all sides, had his head about half a foot from her entrance. He felt his feet on a harder-squishy hole, knowing that as the cervix. Jone was five-foot-eleven &amp; frankly surprised she fit him- her walls periodically tightening around him &amp; loosening, &amp; repeating..<br>\r\nThe stickiness &amp; all wasn't bad, the movements of her giving him some weirdly-sweet air to breathe- the darkness was just eerie- he'd get periodic stimulation from the contracting walls. Malakum changed her position, sitting with her calves on the ground under her knees, making Jone's feet angle upward &amp; slightly squishing him. Fortunately her walls undulated often &amp; she easily stifled the feelings, Jone not moving &amp; still getting air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe radio blared once more-<br>\r\n\"Delta-Zero-through-Three are coming up on the feeding location- proceeding.\" Surely enough Malakum heard the sound of running engines- all Jone was hearing was her vaginas squashing &amp; bodies churning. Really hot, but really scary, he never expected this to happen. <br>\r\nRoaring of engines got louder until they were driving down the path, two Oshkosh PLS trucks with massive containers on the back drove down &amp; to Malakum, stopping ten feet away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Ford-F1's also came from behind the two PLS trucks, Malakum feeling slightly annoyed as they'd quickly drive over to Jone's car. <br>\r\nOut stepped from the two cars were four military men clad in black armor with Scar-H guns, grenades, &amp; radios. The highest rank was an Admiral, the one to tell the others to search Jone's car. Soldiers in the PLS trucks would jump out &amp; go stand next to a steel latch at the side of the two containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see you, Malakum!\" The admiral yelled rather sternly. <b>\"Nice seeing you all again.\"</b> Malakum replied rather stoticly, keeping very still, Jone could barely hear- only vibrations.<br>\r\nJone would remember he had nothing in his pockets- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey brought Jone's wallet &amp; phone to the Admiral, who opened the password-protected phone first. He'd hand it to one soldier who ran to the truck, then open his wallet to investigate the things.<br>\r\n\"So a human was here. Jone Miblight Veller- Ma-\"<br>\r\n<b>\"I ate him.\"</b> She'd say with a straight face &amp; look around at the soliders, that made them a bit nervous- but they always were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Jone was slightly hotter as her body was to, her walls keeping him in place with a steady stickiness. He'd start thinking of how everything was going to go when he gets out- her walls tightening some as her mood changed from calm to slightly annoyed...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Tiger, Fox, hook the car up.\" Two soldiers followed his orders, backing a Ford around the log pile &amp; coming out to latch it on the back. <br>\r\nThe other soldier came back with the phone unlocked &amp; gave it to the Admiral, he'd immediately check his messages, contacts &amp; calender. While he did that the two soldiers at the trucks would heave steel locks all-the-way around the containers, moving away from the truck &amp; standing with eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum was hungry &amp; slightly thirsty as she hadn't eaten until yesterday night- a woman her of her size had to eat atleast nintey-thousand calories of food every day. So bending forward some, which bent Jone only slightly, she'd roll the truck closer &amp; use one finger to open the latch that was <i>specifically</i> made for her. <br>\r\nIn the truck was a opaque half-container &amp; alot of escaping cool air- the five-foot steel container held cooked cow meat a foot from the top. <br>\r\n\"Malakum!\" The Admiral yelled to her, Malakum looking over at him with a frown. The truck towing Jone's car stopped next to her, one solider coming out to unlatch it. \"Smash the top, <i>lightly!</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hefty sigh Malakum brought her palm over his car &amp; pushed it into the stone, causing the top to fold inward &amp; the wheels to bulge some. \"GOOD!\" The Admiral yelled, Malakum quick to take the food container out carefully &amp; stop the crushing. Feeling slightly bad that humans were a threat to eachother as she brought the three-foot wide container to her mouth she'd swiftly shake it, having all the meat fly into her awaiting maw. <br>\r\nJone had been fine but was close to moving as she'd moved, angling his face in a crack that repeatedly squashed his face. The only reason he resisted it is because of his own safety, taking what air he could as her folds moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly biting down on all the meat a few times she'd swallow it all with a small 'huff' &amp; bring the other truck to her- this giving Jone a second of air before the folds crashed back into him. He'd cough some as her juices went down his throat &amp; her folds rubbed against him, her walls stopping any escaping noise. The sensations relaxed Malakum some, making her know he was still safe. <br>\r\nMany of the men talked to eachother as she'd open that truck &amp; pull out a two big carbonglass bottles of water, each easily five feet. The Admiral &amp; two others stood &amp; watched Malakum open a bottle &amp; chug it all down, speaking silently, she could actually <i>hear</i> them when she stopped drinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Make sure his family is notified- get the car to a station after this- -\"</i> No longer wanting to listen or be around these people she'd slide the meat container into the truck &amp; one of the water bottles- <br>\r\n<b>\"I'll use this.\"</b> Saying to them &amp; setting the bottle near the long-pit the Admiral huffed some. \"Really!? You know we can't always leave this here!\" He yelled at her, Malakum sighing. <b>\"You humans are ok. Just let it be.\"</b> Saying to him with a slight tone of sad, the Admiral gave in- \"FINE! Men- Pack up! We're back here at eight!\" <br>\r\nSoldiers ran to the PLS trucks to close &amp; secure them &amp; the others made way to their vehicles, one stopping to re-latch Jone's car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'll be waiting.\"</b> She said somewhat quietly, watching as the Admiral stared at her from a front-passenger seat. Their cars driving away with Jone's car-&amp;-information, he'd be pronounced dead with no body with his car as 'evidence.'<br>\r\nThey'd all drive in a line up the path they came down with they're vehicle's poweful engines, &amp; once out of Malakum's sight, she'd huff in agitation, shaking the ground under her. <br>\r\nJone kept still like he had been told-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum set one hand on her head &amp; would bend her calves up to lean on the cave wall, laying her legs out apart some. For Jone this was bending back &amp; then forward- her walls actually pushing his head out &amp; tightening around his body.. Jone gasped for the fresh air as Malakum was sitting there thinking about <b>something</b>, enjoying his sensations. <br>\r\n\"Malakum! Hey- Get m-\" <br>\r\nStopped by being surprised as Malakum arched one leg up he'd end up sliding out onto her awaiting palm, still having the warmth &amp; feeling sticky.. &amp; hopeless. His car was gone!<br>\r\nShe'd put him on her crotch near her loincloth, Jone deciding to not to try &amp; dry himself on her crotch fur.<br>\r\n<b>\"Caretaker said your dead.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at him as he looked up in some fear, Malakum was expressionless. Jone knew that this was a possibility &amp; it sure was the one to happen...<br>\r\n\"Shit- Damn- Are you-!\" He angrily stomped on her fur, Malakum huffing some as he did &amp; frowning, crossing her arms. <b>\"I had no choice. Listening 'en-shures' my life.. C-Caretaker really isn't nice to humans.\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJone had figured she had eaten humans before. That seemed fair considering how much 'panic' she had caused people, most who ran likely never got far. He wasn't to terrified as if he was already pronounced dead he'd likely be able to expose these government soliders- <br>\r\nBut then it hit him- they took his things. His plans &amp; car, their secrecy was beyond what he could follow. Exposing people to Malakum might end up in casualties or major fear, everything he <i>could</i> do to prove he was alive with herwould be in vain-<br>\r\nNobodies used to giant woman, only in fantasies. <br>\r\nHe looked into her eyes &amp; could tell she'd been merciless, even not being empathetic, he knew she still could be. \"You shouldn't be nice either! Your Caretaker hides the existence of YOU!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYelling to her slightly angry, Malakum <b>had</b> taken that into mind.. but- her past experiences were <b>really</b> an anchor..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jone felt powerless as he took in her size once more- seeing the bottle nearly as big as he is. She'd frown some- she despised her Caretakers &amp; felt like Jone might eventually get found. Having to listen to them <i>really</i> began conflicting with how she felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"They do.. Im safe, no risks.\"</b> She replied &amp; frankly surprised Jone, he thought she'd want exposure. He himself saw that the only option <i>would</i> be to expose her, but that could go many ways- or just stick with her. No more outside world, just living with a giantess beast woman. <br>\r\n\"So what now?\" He'd say up to her, deciding to sit criss-cross on her fur, definently warm. Malakum bent forward some, Jone viewing her green eyes &amp; cat-like pupils dialate, not breaking eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Eat what I give, drink. Hide. Live longest here.\"</b> The last part only scared him slightly, impending death has rose much already on his mind for today- 'live longest' can mean alot. <br>\r\nThough feeling that he's going to have difficulties living with Malakum- it's his own fault he's here, her hospitality is better than nothing.. <br>\r\nAlso he felt quite infatuated with Malakum, having being shoved in her vagina- thank goodness his hard-on died- &amp; thank goodness none of them mentioned it. Jone felt he was going to go there again later, somewhat antsy knowing he'll hide <i>every day.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..Thanks.\"  He said up &amp; looked up, seeing her smile some. \"..For helping me.\" Jone could feel his face lighting up some as Malakum then reached her hand down for him to hop onto, still smiling. He'd do so, jumping &amp; landing on her palm to sit down on it. <br>\r\nBringing her hand to her face carefully &amp; sitting back once more she brought him to her eyes, eyeing his bodies reactions acutely, with what skills she <i>has.</i><br>\r\nThe two felt lust for eachother- Malakum more than Jone. She felt like shoving him into her &amp; enjoying every tingle of her body surrounding his, but didn't, knowing it's only needed when the Caretakers arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJone had an infatuation with Malakum after being shoved down below, the feeling he got was unlike anything- it was ironic how neither spoke of their feelings. She really was calm for a beast. <br>\r\n<b>\"I'll try to, longest I can.\"</b> Malakum said quietly. Only slightly fearful in the presence of Malakum now, he was glad he didn't end up as lunch or a toy, or get captured by the agents. Trying to save him is all he could ask for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he'd then hug her palm, even with off-topic conflicting future thoughts, making Malakum feel slightly bad. <br>\r\n\"Malakum-\" he'd say, sitting again on her palm. \"-do you want to learn somethings?\" <br>\r\nHer interest immediately piqued, \"Yes.\" Jone decided to hit her with anything- \"Hm, did you know that there are animals like you? Smaller, they walk on all fours &amp; can sprint <i>very</i> quickly. Kill quickly, but they're in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I run much faster. Haven't, many-hundred days.\"</b> She sounded irritated, but still smiled. <b>\"Sometime. Tell me more.\"</b> Jone began contemplating what to say.. <br>\r\n\"Outside people don't <i>really</i> worry about monsters or evil beings, most fear other people, stronger people.\" He'd notice her ears drooping some, \"Like Caretakers?\" She asked, rather quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Jone replied simply. \"But- the others, they worry about things the people hide. Wether it's good or bad, wether it should be hidden or not.\" <br>\r\nMalakum started to feel sad, along with bad. Her history of care without people was great. <b>\"So this care, is care for them?\"</b> Asked in an irate tone, she frowned heavily, her brows furrowed some. Jone didn't know wether to be fearful or not.<br>\r\n\"Somewhat..? Im not them.\" He admitted, now making Malakum more aware of her life &amp; instigating her to go into deep thought.. <b>\"Thanks. Nice to know things-\"</b> Malakum couldn't stop herself- <b>\"-Know something, Jone?\"</b> Happier she said his name, he felt flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"I'll talk to Caretakers. Let people see.\"</b> Said seriously, Jone was thrilled, teaching her things <i>somehow</i> made a difference.. &amp; he wasn't really wet anymore, air dried. <br>\r\n\"I hope they see it.\" He adds, then watched as Malakum grabbed the bottle off the ground from near the pit.<br>\r\n\"Drink?\" She'd question, placing the bottle on her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter talking-&amp;-staring here with her for likely ten or twenty minutes he was parched, to focused on her to have realized it. <br>\r\n\"Yes!\" She'd lean the bottle on the hand holding Jone, quickly picking under the cap &amp; popping it off with her claws, surprising him with her stillness. Holding the bottle then to her palm she'd angle it to where the water barely touched her hand, Jone carefully stepping over to it, then bending downward to drink-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nJone only got four gulps in before pulling back to take a breather- then Malakum jerked her head toward the road, setting the bottle down. <b>\"Again. Should keep box on..\"</b> Malakum heard multiple engines roaring onto the path &amp; was quick to knock Jone back with her fingers, Jone didn't hear engines- but felt Malakum knew what was happening &amp; stayed silent &amp; still.<br>\r\nIn the rush to hide Jone she didn't care which way he went in, Jone slightly turned-on &amp; kind-of afraid as she inserted him headfirst into her vagina-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the tightness engulfing him more along with some more stickiness, Jone began to move some as his head was going deep into her- <br>\r\n<b>\"Your safe.\"</b><br>\r\nHearing this as she pushed his feet in, Jone felt his lower body get constricted by her tightening walls as she closed her feet together. His head bouncing off her semi-hard cervix, he could feel the hole &amp; her juices with his head, swallowing some of the sweet-ish liquids to take in air- stopping his movements, he settled inside her, her walls periodically tightening.. Goodness he wasn't naked, Jone likely would've came alot, his clothes do good to block out pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum <i>had</i> taken pleasure as she shoved him in her, letting her walls squeeze him when she closed her legs &amp; reveling in the feeling.. She'd love it, moaning lightly.<br>\r\nSoon though, she heard the engines roaring downhill, &amp; began to take on a serious demeanor. Frankly <i>she</i> was tired of these people, planning to talk without Jone. Her walls tightening some as her mood changed, Jone gagged some on the inflow of juices &amp; resisted moving out of where his head was- pinned between her cervix &amp; vaginal walls- her annoyance coupled with pleasure might not end well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<b>Vrr..</b> the engines of four black Fords all roared as they drove down the path, Malakum sighing as they'd stop in a semi-circle around her right-&amp;-left side. Surely enough- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malakum! We're here for Jone!\" This took her off-guard, Jone not hearing a thing &amp; focusing on swallowing &amp; breathing.<br>\r\nMalakum got slightly enraged on <i>how</i> they knew it, the Admiral, with fifteen weapons-drawn men stepping out of their cars. <b>\"The human I ate?\"</b> She played dumb, frowning quite heavily. \"N- Malakum! Where are you hiding him!?\" She remained quiet for a few seconds, furrowing her brows as she'd look down at everyone. <b>\"Nowhere. I want to ask-\"</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO-\" Malakum would hit her fist on the stone, the soldiers nervously aiming as she'd actually made a small crater, the Admiral looking shocked- <b>\"Why am I hiding? Why do no other humans know of me? why..\"</b>  <br>\r\nJone was close to moving as she'd tighten up again &amp; bend forward slightly, forcing his head into a tight spot as her folds began covering him- making it hard to breathe in this sticky, hot corner. <br>\r\n<b>\"-do you other humans see me as a bad animal?\"</b> Covering her face with one hand, the soliders began lowering their weapons slightly as the Admiral didn't know what to say- Malakum started to weep some.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Malakum- ha- your hiding because of our history, your life, people don't know you for their own safet-\" The Admiral froze as her angry-eyes glared at him from the side, Jone then now wiggiling some as she tightened around him to much- it hurt his entire body slightly, gladly it took only a few shakes for Malakum to relax, <i>easily</i> holding back any noise &amp; giving him air again.. But he was soaked even worse now, baking in her vaginas heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"So im not safe? I <i>am</i> a dangerous animal!? How are the humans safe from me if they don't know I am alive!?\"</b> Malakum began raising her voice, to them it was like multiple loudspeakers- &amp; Jone could actually hear some- before her walls squelched all around him &amp; filled his senses with nothing but tingles &amp; bodily tightness, thank goodness his head wasn't going any farther. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers then again rising their weapons, the Admiral was in slight shock, he should've known this would happen.<br>\r\n\"I- Malakum! I can see why this upsets you, but just speak with us- you fought &amp; killed past humans, we have you here so you don't <i>have</i> to-\" <br>\r\nThen, Malakum slammed both of her hands on the ground, the Admiral holding his hand half-up in an open-fire order. <br>\r\n<b>\"To deal with humans? I will deal with <i>nicer</i> humans.. Caretakers has made me kill other humans..</b> Looking at every soldier individually, most were downright terrified, the Admiral nervously stepping back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Don't fight me. I want to know humans out there- Not know humans who shove Malakum in a pit.\"</b> The Admiral really didn't know what to say, two soldiers nervously stammering back &amp; speaking silently into their radios..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>...After a few seconds of silence between the people &amp; Malakum the Admiral would lower his arm, out of his open-fire order. It took some soldiers longer to comply, some nervously looking at the somewhat-crying Malakum- <br>\r\nJone had some trouble breathing as her walls squashed &amp; lubed him, his clothes becoming more thin &amp; his body sliding back &amp; forth. He'd try moving her walls away from his head with his hands to have them contract, pushing his head against her hole &amp; making Malakum shake some as he'd hit a g-spot, giving him <i>some</i> air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Malakum- as long as Jone is HERE! When we return in one hour, you will get to go out soon, where we HAVE A SPOT!\" The Admiral was quite angry &amp; somewhat impressed that Jone seemed to be able to make her more assertive, knowing he was here was easy, with a secret two-way speaker on Malakum's big radio-box. <br>\r\nMalakum smiled some though, that making her feel better. <b>\"Will Jone be leaving?\"</b> she questioned- the Admiral feeling confused as the order for his 'death' was already givin' out in his haste. <br>\r\n\"Only with you!\" He yelled up, Malakum feeling a bit excited now. <b>\"Ok.\"</b> Bringing her hands down &amp; resting them on the ground the Admiral would start to feel anxious of how his superiors would react, pointing two fingers at all the cars &amp; having the soldiers return to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilent as he got into the truck, the Admiral was feeling his stomach drop thinking of Malakum's hidden rage. Having her go off after years of her being docile wouldn't be good for anybody, especially the <i>media.</i> <br>\r\nSo they'd back up &amp; begin to exit the cavern, driving up the path, Malakum watching them go til' the last car left..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n..Instead of arching her leg up to get Jone out or open her legs she would set one hand on her chest, slowly bringing her other hand toward her vagina. Then focusing on the sensation of Jone inside of her she'd tighten up some, forcing him to struggle as her folds covered his face &amp; drenched him incher juices. <br>\r\nNot caring much hearing the trucks drive away &amp; feeling him struggle, Malakum let out some light moans as she slipped two fingers in herself. Jone was feeling baked &amp; air-deprived, getting some gasp in as her cervix pulsed against his head- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers pushed in &amp; would cause her to tighten even more, seriously taking the breath from Jone. Going in likely almost a foot, Jone was quite happy when he felt her two fingers pressing against his sides, hoping to be pulled out. <b>\"Keep moving, Jone..\"</b> Able to hear past the squelching as her fingers held her walls slightly back, Jone really didn't care with his hard-on, feeling sexually stimulated as he began to try &amp; twist around.<br>\r\nMalakum's insides pulsed around him as he moved &amp; she thrusted her fingers in fully, pressing him into her vaginal walls- <br>\r\nPulling them out &amp; moaning louder as her walls squished him, Jone started to cough wildly as her juices began flowing out constantly. He'd jerk his hands &amp; legs around to try &amp; let them pass, this only causing her to go on edge &amp; start rubbing her crotch with her hand, lightly groping herself- her face slightly red &amp; her sweating some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn pain as her cervix surrounded his forehead &amp; pulsed down along with her walls, he'd throw his legs around &amp; end up kicking her g-spot <i>alot.</i><br>\r\nMalakum let out a quite loud moan that ended in a small squeal, climaxing. Jone was suddenly shot away from her cervix &amp; was drowned in her juices flowing out, most wetting her furs, his feet becoming stuck out-&amp;-between her legs. <br>\r\nGasping for air as there was more, her walls expanding &amp; contracting less, he couldn't tell wether he'd release himself or if it was just his senses fooling him with how hot &amp; wet he was.. That experience was thrilling though, despite minor head &amp; chest pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalakum reveled in the feeling for several seconds before opening her legs, her hand awaiting Jone, who slid out onto her hand huffing for cleaner air &amp; soaked in her sticky-hot juices.<br>\r\n<b>\"Are you ok?\"</b> She'd ask worryingly as she brought him up to her face, smiling however. Jone would flip onto his back &amp; look up at her, hard-on still visible through his soaked clothes. <br>\r\n\"Yeah.. Just need to relax-\" He said, only slightly annoyed she'd use him as a sex object after they left. <b>\"Caretakers said they'll be back in hour. Long as your here, they agree to let me go out soon.\" </b> Malakum sounded &amp; looked thrilled, but Jone was more confused then anything. \"Nice..\" He'd say, more-so waiting for them to appear rather then asking her to tell him what she could &amp; cooling off in the cave-air..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening his eyes after resting for a minute he was surprised to get a huff of her rather meaty-breath, seeing her sniff his body, &amp; rather lustfully sniffing his groin. Jone hadn't expected this, he was sure he wouldn't be eaten- but never expected to have oral sex with a giantess!<br>\r\n<b>\"Do you..\"</b> Malakum went silent as she looked down at Jone, who was smiling in anticipation &amp; in joy. \"Hold on-\" He'd lay up with some grunts &amp; remove his shirt, then follow with his pants-&amp;-boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEyeing his body all-the-way on her palm, Jone felt like a blushing schoolgirl, naked infront of her. Then Malakum would bring her mouth down to her wrist, opening it wide, giving Jone a view of her many sharp teeth &amp; slimy, hot &amp; moving tounge &amp; cheeks. He couldn't resist getting a full hard-on, slightly afraid because of the anatomy.. Stomach below &amp; all, but excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo taking this situation in his own hands he'd carefully walk toward her mouth, then yelp in surprise as her other hand plucked him off of hers &amp; held him high in the air- then panic as she held him above her maw. <br>\r\n<i>\"Woah! ah- car-\"</i> Then cut off as Malakum lowered his body into her maw, she'd close her lips around his breast &amp; damn well make sure not to touch a tooth against him, Jone moaning already as her tounge immediately began to taste &amp; molest him. All worries would float away as Malakum looked forward &amp; his feet touched her gullet, her mouth sucking on him in rhythm &amp; driving him to the edge quickly- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe load of semen Jone released was continuous as Malakum sucked even <i>harder,</i> enjoying the taste of his rather bitter cum as it flowed down her throat- Jone actually enjoying her mouths warmth, he began shivering some when she let him slide onto her palm- where his clothes were <i>still</i> at. <br>\r\n<b>\"Tasty water.. I like it..\"</b> <br>\r\nSeeing her bestial lust through her eyes he would try not to focus on his shortening hard-on, slightly lustful, but he knew she had <i>alot</i> more. \"More.. Ug- later.. Now can you get me warm?\" He'd ask, honestly, being warm or cold was a hard choice today. So Malakum then put him on her hair near her right ear.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod was it warm. Jone felt like he was surrounded in a fluffy blanket &amp; rolled some, it didn't take much of her hair to dry him off.. It was actually comfortable. <b>\"Rest, if you need. Im waiting for Caretakers, w-\"</b> stopping, Jone was slightly shook awake as his clothes dropped onto him- <b>\"-Thank you,<br>\r\nJone.\" </b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid to him happily, he was dozing off, giving a slurred <i>\"No problem..\"</i> before doing it, Malakum feeling the happiest she'd ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Too serious to be able to escape with. You try a door, but it's too deformed to open properly. In desperation, you kick it until your foot hurts like hell. Nothing.<br>\r\n That's when the roof gives way, and the cab gets crushed to half it's size. Quickly, you hide under one of the seats, balled up. It means you survive, but only for a little longer. A loud rumbling noise comes from outside, it's the Lioness purring happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, she stands up. Light comes through the windows again.

That's when she notices something stuck to her butt. She reaches behind her and peels it off, then hold it in front of her face and looks it over. It's shiny and grey on one side, yellow on the other, and in the middle of the yellow side there's a splash of red. It's dripping some red, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grins like only a feline can.

He's clearly lost, but you've been tailing him for a while now, making sure that no help will reach him. His khaki shorts and white T-shirt have been ripped and torn by sharp branches and thorns, and the man's starting to stumble from lack of water. You grin to yourself-the time has come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at 9 feet, 6 inches tall, you tower over the 5'8\" man. Your sandy yellow fur is a creamy white on your stomach and around your face, allowing you to blend in with the tall grass of the savannah. Your tail, about 3 feet long, twitches like a thing alive, eager to start the hunt, and your claws, each about half an inch claw, sheath and unsheathe as you patiently wait for the man to get closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn terms of body, you're a knockout: each of your two breasts are the size of large watermelons, and your butt is just behind them in size. You wear a layer of fat from your previous hunts, making you soft and curvy, but it's still easy to see the muscles rippling underneath your skin. Your stomach growls a bit, but you hold your gut in your paws and massage it gently. You haven't eaten in a few days, and you need to find something to eat soon. You start to crouch, getting yourself into a pouncing position as the man walks beneath your perch. This one's going to feel good in your stomach...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a human-like laugh, causing all of your fur to stand on end. <i>Hyenas.</i> Those damn predators will beat you to <b>your</b> meal! About to leap down, you stop for a minute. If one hyena's nearby, there will surely be the rest of its pack: far more meat than one scrawny human. Perhaps you could eat them instead and keep the man around for later-you could use a mate, after all, and you could just eat him later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEight large hyenas have appeared from the undergrowth, circling the man. As he backs up against the baobab tree, you can hear him whimpering in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

It seems best to keep him alive- for now. This environment isn't hard hunting in most of the year plus having offspring is best for long-term survival, your mind thinks best. You watched them close in around him &amp; were slightly entertained watching the helplessness, his whimpers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got close enough you <i>pounce.</i> You fell down perhaps twenty-so feet &amp; slammed both of your legs into a hyena's back, snapping it instantly. The man screamed incessantly almost over the hyenas yells, but hadn't ran away as three of the hyenas charged at you. You roared lowly before lunging at the nearest one. This one was severely outmatched as you sunk your claws into it's neck, throwing your nearly 500 pounds of weight on it &amp; crushing it's body. Recovering with a roll you saw that four of the hyenas were going for the man, him yelling in panic &amp; trying to run to just end up falling &amp; his ankle twisting. The other two came for you &amp; with the superior athletics you have you sprint on all fours, leaping over the ones coming for you to save the man-!<br>\r\nIt was instinct now to slaughter these prey as they threatened what you consider a temporary new 'member' to your non-existent pack, which you did with ferocity. You reached them quick &amp; would barely miss grabbing one, watching it jump back &amp; try to lunge for you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKicking your leg back you end up slamming ones face, sending it tumbling over it's fellow member. The one lunging at you turned out to be the Alpha- you dispatched it by hastily bringing both your hands to it's neck, slamming it on the ground like the other.. The hyenas near the man kept yelling, yelping &amp; laughing as you destroyed half their pack. You roared again &amp; watched as they scattered off East, the dazed-injured one looking back longer before going.. Then you turned around toward the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked to try &amp; back away with mostly his left leg &amp; arms, looking terrified, pale. You knew that he was hurt judged by his ankle protruding outward, dehydration prominent to. Knowing he is weak solidified your desire to bear stronger offspring, you would walk to him on both feet, watching his cowardice shift in uncertainty as your stomach rumbled. \"Please- don't.. Dont kill me-!\" 'Kill' was a word you knew &amp; you had no desire to.. At the moment. You showed that by grabbing his un-spraint leg &amp; pulling him with you toward the hyena nearest, ignoring his terrified &amp; pained pleads, then moving opposite of him. The guy looked on at you in a flurry of emotion, mostly fear, as you looked back at him while kneeling over the hyena.. Primal you were as you carelessly used your claws to start tearing open it's ribcage, him looking away &amp; appearing sickened, his whimpering almost done.. Hastily ripping innards was a quite grotesque thing you <b>love</b> doing, your tail swaying as you gleefully praise your own skill, chomping down on mouthfulls of food &amp; dirtying some of your facial fur &amp; hands, which are more like paws that look like them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hyena was eaten hastily within several minutes, you taking a deep gasp as you swallowed the last of what's preferred in it.. He spoke. \"What.. Tc-- re you gonna do?\" A pained question by him- you barely understand, at most you know he is scared of you, dehydrated &amp; hurt as to where he cannot walk. You saw he store into your green catlike eyes to see the blood of the kills on you as you saw defeat in him.. You then would walk over to him as the food settled in your stomach, seeing him slowly grow fearful again as you approached his side &amp; bent down some, feeble effort done to move away. \"No-! God No!\" <br>\r\nTrying to push you away was in vain as he was weak &amp; barely stood up past your navel, if he could. You would force a paw opposite of your face on his cheek, forcing him to stare at you whilst trembling. \"Do.. Me?\" Atleast thought of rationally, he looked puzzled- what your meaning is mating. Smiling.. Was like bearing your sharp teeth to him, he was a bit scared from it, now not as much.. It amazes you how quickly your instinct switched from kill to preserve however- even your conscious mind feels weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you carefully brought your snout-like face to his cheek, sniffing in his.. Somewhat sweaty &amp; stinky stench before licking him. He would turn away &amp; groan- <i>\"Phla- gross..\"</i> You let out a purr-growl as you moved to one of the other dead hyenas; dragging it toward you &amp; him &amp; devouring it just like the last, you watched him sit there faced away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....You finished two &amp; felt full, having eaten quite a few pounds of their innards.. Now you knew that water was a necessity given fact your fur is blood-soaked in specific spots &amp; the human is dehydrated- thankfully your den is well placed near a source. It is rather isolated at the scrubland's mountain border in a valley where many predators have been killed by you- explaining why you haven't eaten. Many animals are avoiding that valley. <br>\r\nOnly problem is the valley is about two miles North, two you'll be carrying your mate with, which will probably be only a little more strenuous. Though a bit irrate knowing you have to you don't care to much- you ate today &amp; got a partner.. Perhaps a later snack as a bonus. He likely knows he has no choice but to submit now.<br>\r\nForcing him on his back with sheathed claws you watch as he looked at you quietly, only grunting &amp; moaning in pain as you forced your hands under him.. Then lifting, his weight actually wasn't bad, maybe like sixty pounds to you. Staring down at him your tail sways in anticipation for tonight, he feels more.. <i>secure</i> you can see. It's what you want- easier to manipulate.. Perhaps he sees your beauty, but then again your just a humanoid-anthropomorphic thinly-furred in-places-lioness hunting to live.. He likely sees that, or has become infatuated with being 'saved' by you. Who knows- all you know is he is quiet &amp; just staring at you &amp; the environment, you beginning the trek back to your den near a pond..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The rest of the space consists in only a big room without any windows, in darkness the cabin was completely in silence.<br>\r\nWithout any warning a strange voice in a strange language interrupts the tomb like peace:  Travel for hyperspace ended, entering in the orbit of planet Tozslevn.

You'd only really grown an inch, but even that little tickly increase drove you wild! Whatever your past had been, it couldn't have mattered less to you now. Now, you were growing into a lioness of such magnitude that your breasts alone outclassed buildings! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger...\" you huff again, groaning lowly, panting sweetly as your thick tongue bobs in and out.

You purr harder, lidding your giant eyes as you giggle and swell larger, your breasts bulging and ballooning hotly before you, thickening pillars for teats. Inch after inch pulses into you, as you feel hundreds and hundreds of he more-brazen types rub up against your tremendous feet, countless little human hands caressing the bulging leathery pads as the grow and grow. 670 feet...675...680...690...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a rather sudden tingle and a grunt, you feel yourself burst a good deal larger, in one rude, (and utterly wonderful) spurt of growth, your hips crashing into the sides of the city block you now-all-too-easily cover, pushing the facades of small offices and restaurants until they crackle and cave in against your surging furry body. The littles collectively gasp and cheer, especially those who were hugging your feet; the crowd now wiggles under or flat-up against your heels as you grow more and more, many wriggling up in between your swelling toes. The wild, unprecedented surge slows, leaving you wide-eyed and beaming as you look your 740-foot body over. You were getting used to growing inch by inch, the last few days--time-elapsed newsfeeds had already shown you were smoothly growing by the hour--but this was new. This was dozens of feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis...was excellent. You must have hit some new peak in your powers, smashed through some plateau in your intake! From day two, you had assumed (with poorly-restrained, gleeful arousal) you would eventually become unfathomably immense...but to know the process was speeding up--that you could gulp now, instead of merely sip...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MORE!\" you boom, shaking the city, as your tail swishes about luxuriously. \"My little ones, chant more! Make me greater! Stronger! Make...me...BIGGER!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities flood into your mind, filling your every thought, as your huge fingers snuggle in a \"V\" around your sex, milking up and down against the titanic lips.

When the tourists weren\u2019t listening, the citizens of the small town would whisper to each about a giant living in the forest, feeding on those that dared trespass on its territory. Nobody completely believed the myths, but then again, nobody could explain the frequent disappearances either; every year, dozens of brave tourists travelled into the wilderness, never to return again. When authorities banned access to the forest, the disappearances stopped for a while\u2026 until people living on the edge of the wilderness started being found missing from their beds, their windows smashed open from the outside, as if a giant hand had reached in and snatched them away in the night. You were deeply intrigued by these events, and, on a day when you felt you had nothing left to lose, you travelled deep into the wilderness to find the truth. What you discovered changed your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter weeks of starving while travelling the forests, living off berries and streams, you were starting to give up\u2026 until you found her. A huge, slumbering giantess, her size taking up an entire field -- you figure she must be at least 5 stories tall! You circled her for hours, admiring every inch of her perfect body. The giantess seemed to be some kind of hybrid, in fact; with blonde fur, a long tail, and a lion-like snout. When she woke up to find you staring at her, you thought that she would kill you for sure\u2026 but she hesitated. She was used to her prey screaming and running away on the sight of her, but you, on the other hand, were just standing there...  complimenting her? She was obviously hungry, but also lonely and desperate for a companion. As the two of you spoke, you realize the poor woman hasn\u2019t had anybody to talk to in decades. You\u2019re the only person that ever gave her the time of day, and thus, she quickly became obsessed with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, she has a bonafide hatred for every human -- except you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, your influence over her has given you ample opportunities to realize some of your\u2026 fantasies. While she prefers to chew her food, she has since agreed to swallow her prey whole and alive just to please you, letting you watched as woodland critter and the occasional hikers get sucked down her cavernous throat, and letting you grind against her huge, soft belly as they digested within. She\u2019s even learned to enjoy it herself, as time goes by; savoring her squirming meals a little more each time. In the end, though, your kink has only been a small part of your relationship. Gulping down a few unlucky campers was just something nice she did as a treat for you every so often. Indeed, for the most part, the two of you just doted on eachother, alone in the woods, where the two of you can\u2019t be judged by the prying eye of society at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been together for months, and you were still bother enraptured by eachother, your love, while superficial, undying. During the days, she would carry you around through the forests, keeping you cradled between her soft breasts, as you chatted and helped eachother find food and water. While she didn\u2019t seem to want to talk about her past, she loved hearing you tell stories about life in human society; and for the most part, the two of you felt like a normal couple. Though, the sexual aspect of your relationship was a little unorthodox. Mutual masturbation was about the best you could do sometimes, given your size difference; beyond that, you had to get creative. Being a giantess fan, you were content with just worshipping every inch of her body; however, you sometimes wished you were big enough to truly, personally satisfy her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, the two of you lived an idyllic life, as far as you were concerned. It helps that you were always a bit of an outdoorsy person, and enjoyed being alone with her in the wide expanse of nature. You, yourself, lived in a large cabin out in the middle of the woods, after you had the lioness swallow its previous occupants. Every morning, you wake up, get ready, and lean out the window to see your lover\u2019s huge, smiling face staring back at you. She\u2019d snatch you right up from the window sill sometimes, adorably excited to begin the day\u2019s adventures. Still, you sometimes missed the luxuries of your home town. The two of you have agreed that you can\u2019t hide forever, and at night, you often dream of ruling one of the small towns in the wilderness hand-in-hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever you decide on, soon, this little neck of the woods was never going to be the same...</span></div></div>",
