She should handle this rather well. Now, let's see...how small should she get? How about as tiny as we were in this creepy house ? It will bring back good memories ! Well at least, for me...\" Piper said pulling the trigger. A beam of light flared through the room and hit Paige. The latter instantly disappeared in a flash. Piper got closer to the bed and was now looking for her victim.<br>\r\n\"Where is she ? Gosh, I hope she didn't shrink into nothingness !\"<br>\r\nThe elder sister of the Charmed Ones found this out while starring at a small, human-looking thing lying on the surface of the bed. \"Here she is !\"<br>\r\nThe now tiny blonde witch was still fast asleep. \"Alright ! Now let's see how she's going to react once awake !\" Piper then got out of the room, making sure to be as silent as possible.<br>\r\nA few hours later, Paige slowly opened her eyes, rubbing them with the back of her hands. She looked around her, gazing to a huge and dark cave composed of soft walls and floor. \"Strange...I know dreams can be weird but...this one really makes no sense !\" While she was trying to progress through all that mess, she suddenly stopped walking, disturbed by violent quakes to the ground.\"What the...?\" The quakes were getting stronger and stronger. Paige began to think that all of this may not be a dream but rather a nightmare. \"I'd rather find a way out before this thing collapses on me!\" She started to run and make her way in all this chaos, when suddenly a very loud voice roared: \"SHE SHOULD BE AWAKE BY NOW\". At this moment, Paige asked herself: Where does this voice come from and what does it mean by \"awake\"? Is all of this really a dream ? If it is not, then where is she ? What is she supposed to do ? Paige did not have to wait long to find the answer. The mysterious cave's ceiling and walls quickly rose and were soon replaced by a blinding light. Paige instinctively covered her eyes with her forearms, trying to understand as best as she could what was going on.<br>\r\nRight after this, all what Paige could see was a giant version of Piper, lifting with a single hand what was supposed to be the cave from her said dream, realising this was a huge piece of cloth. Paige looked around her again, this time out of fear. \"Wait a second...don't tell me that is my bed ? Then why is it so big ? Why is everything so big ?\"<br>\r\nPiper decided to give her a clue by grabbing her with her powerful hand.<br>\r\nShe then...</span></div></div>",

What does all of this mean !? Put me down immediately !\"<br>\r\n\"Wow...you sound so cute like this...if I had known, I would have shrunk you way sooner !\"<br>\r\n\"Do you hear what I say ? Put me down !\" Paige said angrily.<br>\r\n\"Putting you down ?\" Piper repeated sarcastically. \"I think not. See, I have found this little toy -she showed the raygun off- and I am certainly not going to stop having fun with it.\"<br>\r\nPaige struggled even harder, shouting:\" I am your sister, how can you do that to me !?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yes I can, my dear HALF- sister.\"<br>\r\nPaige's face released a sheer expression of terror.<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you ? You're completely insane !\"<br>\r\nPiper replied with a grin smile.<br>\r\n\"Me ? Insane ? No, I've never felt so well since a long time, and I think it would be too bad that you could not take advantage of my luck as well...\"<br>\r\nPiper then drew a string out of her pocket and attached it to Paige's back. She finally put her improvised necklace around her neck, and said:\"I think a little walk should help you enjoy this moment.\" Paige tried to summon fire in hope to burn the string and break free, but the flames she produced were too weak.<br>\r\n\"The shrinking process must have reduced my powers as well ! It won't be as easy as I thought ! At least I hope someone will notice me and do something about it...\"<br>\r\nAs if Piper had heard her, she grabbed Paige and hid her inside her pullover.

Paige licked her lips thinking of all the ways that she could get back at Cole for all the pain and torture he had put her and her sisters through.  She smiled as an idea formed in her mind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige walked over to kitchen and grabbed a cloth from the counter.  She turned on the faucet and wet the cloth and walked back over to where Cole was lying.  She squeezed the cloth and watched as the water dripped onto the unconscious man.  Cole came to with a start, gasping as the cold water droplets hit him.  He looked around fuzzily realizing something was off, but not quite able to make it out.  His eyes came to rest on Paige as everything suddenly snapped into sharp focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\"  he moaned.  \"I'm in hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige laughed.  \"No Cole.  This is most certainly worse than hell.  I've been given a gift here and I am going to take full advantage of it, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole started backing away from the giant woman slowly, hoping she wouldn't notice.  \"What have you done to me?\"  he asked fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came up with a way that I thought would vanquish you.  Apparently it didn't work because of your invulnerability.  An invulnerability that I'm going to put to good use I might add.  Let me tell you Cole, we are going to have SO much fun together, you and I.  SO MUCH FUN.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you shrunk me instead?\"  Cole kept inching further backwards.  If he could just get to the bathroom he might have a chance of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shrinking was an unexpected side effect.  Definitely a most pleasant one.\"  Paige noticed Cole trying to slip away.  \"And where do you think you are going, little man?\"  she said as she grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole tried to struggle out of her grasp but found that due to his small size he couldn't.  He tried using a fireball, but Paige easily deflected it with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you are way too weak and insignificant now for your powers to have any effect on me,\"  she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole was really terrified now.  She truly was a giantess to him in every way.  Heck, she was practically a God.  \"What are you going to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige looked at him.  \"Lots of things.  But first, you remember the adage that 'Revenge is a dish best served cold' don't you?  So get cold Cole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Paige opened up the freezer and tossed Cole inside.

Hurry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige went over and opened the door to the microwave.  \"Cole the Bug!\"  she started to scold.  \"There is no reason to be screaming like a.........whoooo boy,\"  she commented as she took in his appearance.  \"It seems you got bigger.  Your larger than you were when you originally shrank.  I wonder what's going on here?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige took Cole out of the microwave and set him on the kitchen table.  \"Okay, let's think about this.  First you shrank down to 10 inches.  That was because of a backfire with my attempted vanquish of you.  Then you shrank even more when I put you in the freezer.  Now you've grown quite a bit after having been in the microwave.\"  A light suddenly went off in Paige's head.  \"I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige went over to the sink and poured two glasses of water; one hot and one cold.  She took the glasses over to the table and dumped the hot one on Cole.  Cole felt the tingling sensation and cheered silently as he saw himself getting larger.  Cole grew to be about 2 feet tall.  \"Not bad, \"  Paige mused quietly.  Then she dumped the cold water on Cole.  Cole screamed in frustration as he saw his surroundings grow around him once again.  Paige watched in gleeful fascination as Cole shrunk to 4 inches in height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hot makes you bigger and cold makes you smaller,\"  she said happily.  \"Oh am I going to have a blast with this.

She filled it with some cold water and went back over to the table where the 4 inch Cole was standing.  \"Let's see,\"  she said as she dripped a couple of droplets on Cole.  As the cold sensation hit him, Cole shrank again.  Soon Cole was 1/4 of an inch tall.  Paige licked her lips.  \"This is precious.  You're not Cole the Bug, you're Cole the insignificant flea.  You'll be whatever size I want you to be.  Maybe if you're good I'll let you be a little bigger later on, but for now this suits me just fine.\"  Paige picked Cole up with a pair of tweezers and put him in a shot glass.  \"Just sit there and think about it for awhile,\"  Paige told him as she walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Paige was right,\"  Cole told himself glumly.  \"There are worse things than Hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sunshine!\"  Paige chirped as she entered the room.  \"What a glorious day it's going to be today!  I slept better last night than I have in years!\"  She winked at Cole.  \"And just think my little insignificant flea, it's all thanks to you.\"  Paige stretched and yawned.  \"Okay, today we experiment.

Okay, let me get my supplies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole watched as Paige put a magnifying glass, the eyedropper, the tweezers, a microscope, four slides, some weird kind of fluid and two glasses onto the table.  He was definitely starting to get a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach.  This was going to be very very bad.  Paige turned the light to the microscope on and put one of the slides next to Cole's shot glass.  Cole felt himself being lifted out of the shot glass with the tweezers and deposited onto the slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got this idea from an old rerun of Felix the Cat I saw last night,\"  Paige said.  \"I figure I could try it out on you.\"  She took the dropper and hit Cole with the cold water.  Cole watched as the slide began to expand outwards, growing wider and longer with each passing second.  Soon the slide had become an expanse to him.  He couldn't even see the ends of it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige picked up the slide and slid it into the microscope.  She adjusted it and watched as Cole came into focus.  \"Wow\" she murmured softly.  \"This is the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I wonder if I would be able to see you shrink more while in this this thing.\"  Paige dripped more water on Cole and watched in gleeful amazement as Cole continued to shrink smaller and smaller.  \"You know, if I keep making you shrink I might even be able to see into a micro universe.  I wouldn't be able to really tell anyone but it would still be a wondrous thing to see.\"  She dripped even more water on Cole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole couldn't tell he was on the slide anymore.  It has long ago ceased being an expanse and had become hills and valleys.  The hills and valleys had become giant depressions.  The giant depressions had become a continent.  Soon the continent had become a world.  All Cole could see was a bright light that faded more and more as time went on.  He wondered if this was truly the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cole felt a burning sensation.  He realized that Paige must have poured some hot water on him.  The light was getting brighter again and the world was again was becoming nothing more than an expanse.  Soon after that, the expanse had become a slide.  Cole felt Paige remove the slide from the microscope.  She put it down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it?\"  she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\"  he honestly replied.  \"There was a light I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, I bet you thought it was finally over for a minute or two there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige laughed.  \"Okay, I have a really HUGE surprise coming that I know you will just die for.  So, I'm going to make you a little smaller and cover you with the shot glass and I'll be right back.\"  She shrank Cole again until he was too small to see with the naked eye.  Paige picked up the magnifying glass and made sure Cole was safe on the slide.  She then put the shot glass over him and orbed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have the feeling that this was a picnic compared to whatever surprise she's got in store for me,\"  he moaned.</span></div></div>",

Why are we here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige removed the shot glass from over the slide and handed Phoebe a glass of hot water.  \"Just pour this over that slide,\"  she told her sister, \"and you will get te best present ever in your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe looked dubious but shrugged.  \"Okay.\"  she said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe and Paige watched as Phoebe poured the hot water onto the slide.

Phoebe watched as the man grew when she got the shock of her life.  The man on the slide was her demonic ex-husband, Cole Turner!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole cursed inwardly.  He should have known that Paige would get Phoebe involved.  Now his nightmare would never end.

She turned to Paige.  \"How did this......I mean he......what....what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige explained everything and told Phoebe the whole story and her eventual discovery that hot makes Cole grow and cold makes him shrink.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe reached out a trembling hand and pick Cole up.  She peered at him nestled in the palm of her hand.  \"Wow,\"  she murmured.  \"You are so tiny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can be even smaller.\"  Paige said.  She handed Phoebe an eye dropper filled with cold water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe dripped a couple of droplets onto Cole and watched in amazement as he shrank down to 8 inches.  She dripped another and watched him shrink to 2 inches.  \"Amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige grabbed the microscope.  \"You want to watch him shrink in this thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey put Cole back on the slide and shrank him to an eighteenth of an inch, then stuck the slide in the microscope.  Phoebe and Paige had fun watching Cole get larger and smaller while inside.  Later on they grew Cole to 10 inches and played badminton with him.  Cole thought his insides were going to burst from all the flying through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige showed Phoebe how Cole shrank in the freezer and grew in the microwave.  Phoebe spent a few hours wearing Cole as a necklace around her neck then forced him to wear Barbie clothes and play tea party.  Cole's size varied from 2 and a half feet down to microscopic during the next few days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe found a mouse outside the penthouse and brought it in.  She shrank Cole down to half the mouse's size and pitted him against it.  When she realized his fireballs were  hurting the mouse, she made him even smaller.  Cole realized that the mouse's tail was three times as big as he was, so he ran and hid by the shot glass.

Two ice cube trays were next to Paige.  Both girls realized what was going on at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHEY WERE STUCK IN THE FREEZER!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe saw a note pinned next to the freezer door.  She read it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Phoebe and Paige,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for the fun of the past few days.  You both have taught me so much and I wanted to impart some of what I have learned.  You have given me a great gift and I promise to use it wisely.  Piper and Leo will get a letter in the mail telling them where you are in the next couple of weeks or so.  Until then, I'm sure you will do just fine with what I've left you.  As for reversing your condition, I'm sure the Elders will eventually come up with something.  I left them a clue in the mausoleum if they need help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, you'll never see me again.  I promise.  I never knew that two witches could be more evil than I was but you sure proved me wrong.  Anyway, enjoy your present. I'm sure the two of you have lots to talk and think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove always,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige and Phoebe screamed until their lungs gave out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar away, Cole Turner ate his ice cream cone and pondered how right Paige had been when she said the Revenge was a dish best served cold.  He looked up and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a beautiful day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHE END</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This occurs during the first season when Prue was working at Buckland the auction<br>\r\nhouse. It is just before closing when a Special Delivery package arrives addressed<br>\r\nto her. She signs for it and inspects the package. On the outside is a notation that<br>\r\nonly Prue was to open it and that she must be alone. After taking off the paper she<br>\r\nsees written on one side in BIG BOLD CAPITAL letters. Congratulations, Prudence<br>\r\nsince you've lived up to your name, you're being rewarded. Packed inside for you is<br>\r\nthe means to \"Gain a new perspective, More or Less.\" Using this with an appropriate<br>\r\nmind-set will permanently transform your life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon the completion of reading the message her first thought is, \"How did the sender<br>\r\nknow that I would follow the instructions? Anyways, let's see what was sent to me.\"<br>\r\nShe carefully opens the box and it is packed with a lot of material. \"Obviously, this<br>\r\nitem must be very valuable and fragile to ship,\" she thinks as she carefully removes<br>\r\nit from the box and sets it down on her desk. Looping around its base there are several<br>\r\nlines written in Classical Greek which she can easily translate. \"Oh goody,\" she says<br>\r\n\"for once, one of these items comes with an owner's manual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it may take her some time to figure out just what this item is, Prue decides<br>\r\nto call Piper and tell her that she won't be home for dinner anywhere's near her usual<br>\r\ntime. Telling Piper to not worry she'll call for some take-out in a couple of hours or<br>\r\nso when she starts getting hungry. Piper says, \"Alright, I came home early to fix<br>\r\ndinner and it's some of your favorite things, too bad.\" Hesitating for a few seconds<br>\r\nPrue hangs up and starts her research. After she has finished her translations she<br>\r\nis perplexed with what she sees written. Every line can be interpreted in 2 directly<br>\r\nopposite ways. Mystified at that she decides that it's time to study the base more<br>\r\nclosely. Using a magnifying glass she sees that there is more writing between the<br>\r\neasily visible lines. This writing at least explains why the 'large print' is like it is. It<br>\r\nexplains what this is supposed to do. It also details how she can use the special<br>\r\ncatches to open the base for the \"real\" prize. After fiddling with it for nearly an hour,<br>\r\nPrue succeeds in unlatching all of the catches that open several new compartments.<br>\r\nWithin those compartments are the items that will give her, 'A new perspective on<br>\r\nthings, More or less.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing that her office seems to be getting a little chilly, Prue looks at a clock and<br>\r\nrealizes that she is suddenly very, very hungry. Before calling a local take-out, she<br>\r\ndecides to call Piper to find out if she's finished putting dinner away. Piper was just<br>\r\nstarting, so Prue asks her to bring all of the left-overs down to her office. Continuing<br>\r\non, she tells Piper to ring her when she arrives so that Prue can go downstairs and<br>\r\nunlock the front door to let her in. Being a nice sister and having nothing else to do<br>\r\nanyway, she agrees. So while Piper is packing up Prue's dinner, Prue looks at the<br>\r\nnew items she found inside the base. They are replicas of the base and the cones<br>\r\nthat were attached to it built in a scale of 1:8. Stacking them up randomly Prue at<br>\r\nfirst doesn't notice that the the smaller set has become illuminated, they were now<br>\r\nactivating themselves. When the larger set also starts to light up she notices it, but<br>\r\nas she approaches them she starts feeling much warmer. So warm in fact, that she<br>\r\nquickly strips down to her bra, panties and socks. Since it's now fairly late at night<br>\r\nshe's unconcerned about being seen because there's no one else left in the building.<br>\r\nBesides Piper has seen her in her skivvies lots of times. Her phone rings. It's Piper<br>\r\nwith the food, she has just parked her car and is walking to the first floor entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrive at the door simultaneously. Quickly hustling Piper in, seeing Prue in her<br>\r\nlingerie Piper asks her, \"are we going to have to have a slumber party?\" Prue says<br>\r\n\"No, it's very warm in here tonight &amp; besides we 'ARE' sisters. You're welcome to strip<br>\r\nafter we get up to my office. Someone sent me some interesting cones and I'd just<br>\r\nbegun to assemble them when you called.\" Piper tells Prue that she's very concerned.<br>\r\n\"I really think that now that we know that we're witches we should be very careful about<br>\r\nany mystery packages. We have no idea which demon might have booby-trapped that<br>\r\npackage.\" \"Relax Piper,\" Prue said, \"I've been studying what was in the box all night.<br>\r\nSince I talked to you nothing at all has happened to me!\" \"OH REALLY, Prue. Isn't<br>\r\nyour current attire a little too casual for the office, and what's with your boobs? They<br>\r\nseem to be bigger!\" \"It must be the new support bra I treated myself to on my last<br>\r\nbirthday,\" Prue replied. Three minutes later they arrive at Prue's office. There is now<br>\r\na very bright light coming from inside the office, it concerns Piper even more, but she<br>\r\nfollows Prue into the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Prue begins opening the door Piper grabs her free arm and turns her around.<br>\r\nIn a raised voice she repeats, \"Prue, are you absolutely sure your boobs haven't<br>\r\ngrown bigger lately?\" Then noticing she's looking up at Prue, Piper also mentions<br>\r\nthat. Prue waves it off. Piper then becomes more insistent, \"Prue I'm looking up at<br>\r\nyou and your in your stocking feet, whereas I've got heels on!\" That last part has<br>\r\nfinally gotten Prue's attention. Prue then said, \"Well, you always have looked up<br>\r\nto your big sister. So I guess that neither of us has noticed that I'm still a growing<br>\r\ngirl.\" Prue then turned back to open the door and they entered her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cones are all shining brightly and it's not easy for the sisters to see. Prue<br>\r\nmakes the comment that, \"I wonder if anything important happened while I was<br>\r\ndownstairs letting you in, Piper?\" At this point, Piper is absolutely certain that<br>\r\nsomehow these cones have made Prue larger even if she's unwilling to accept<br>\r\nthat occurring. Piper notices that just as Prue had told her, Prue's office is quite<br>\r\nwarm so she does strip down to her lingerie. However, they're now wearing only<br>\r\nbras and panties. Both are unwilling to become the first that's totally nude. So<br>\r\nthat's as far as they go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter standing silently for a minute, looking at each other's bodies Piper decides<br>\r\nto break the ice. Not intending her voice to be so sexy Piper asks Prue, \"Well,<br>\r\nwhat are these cone thingies supposed to do?\" Twice Prue starts and quickly<br>\r\nstops her explanation. On the third try, she says,\"I think these were supposed<br>\r\nto be microscopes somehow. I'm don't know why there are two complete sets<br>\r\nhere in different sizes.\" Getting back to why she came in the first place, Piper<br>\r\nmentions the food and drink that she's still holding. \"Well let's get to it, Prue!\"<br>\r\nIt takes Prue several seconds to realize that Piper meant that they should start <br>\r\ndinner and not something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying everything out on Prue's desk, Piper moves the cones to one side. The<br>\r\nsmall set rearranges itself without either sister noticing. It is pointed directly at<br>\r\nwhere Piper is sitting. She mentions to Prue, we'll need some glasses for the<br>\r\ndrinks. Prue says, \"I'll get some from the break-room down the hall.\" When Prue<br>\r\nleaves she closes the door a little to hard and the vibration activates both sets<br>\r\nof cones. A rainbow light flashes through both of them and then continues right<br>\r\non to Piper, hitting her in the face just as she had stuck her tongue out at Prue.<br>\r\nHer tongue is bathed in the light. Because it was already so bright in the office<br>\r\nPiper doesn't notice it hit her tongue. Her tongue feels like it has been somehow<br>\r\nburned by something very, very hot. She screams from the pain. Prue drops the<br>\r\nglasses (which don't break) and runs back to Piper. As soon as she opens the<br>\r\ndoor to her office Prue's blinded by the intense light. Unable to see anything, she<br>\r\nimmediately stops at the door. Half a minute later, the light goes out entirely and<br>\r\nthe office is dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrue flips the switch near the door a couple of times before the regular lights do<br>\r\ncome on. Looking at Piper who quit screaming from the pain when the cone lights<br>\r\nwent out, Prue is mystified. Within seconds, she's giggling at Piper's predicament,<br>\r\nwhich doesn't go down well with Piper. Piper glares at Prue and tries to tell her to<br>\r\nstop laughing. That only makes it worse as Prue is now laughing even harder. \"So<br>\r\nwhat's so funny about this?\" Piper asks with great difficulty. The cones had caused<br>\r\nPiper's tongue to become elastic-like and grow several feet in length. It wasn't any <br>\r\nwider than before. It also was prehensile so at least Piper is able to fully retract it<br>\r\ninto her mouth which she realizes fairly quickly. When she does that her speech<br>\r\nbecomes normal. By this time, Prue has collapsed onto the floor from laughing so<br>\r\nhard at Piper's new tongue. Which then really gets Piper mad at her. Yelling at the<br>\r\ntop of her lungs,\" Alright Prudence, what's so _______ funny about this?\" After a<br>\r\ncouple of minutes Prue is finally able to tell Piper, \"Piper loooook at yourself, the<br>\r\nnext time Phoebe does something she really shouldn't have, you're now equipped<br>\r\nto give her a tongue lashing she'll never forget.\"  Pondering that a moment, Piper<br>\r\nsuddenly realizes that Prue is right and she decides to give Prue a demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this\" says Piper just as her tongue shoots out at Prue. Fortunately for Prue<br>\r\nshe was far enough away from Piper to use her power on Piper's tongue before it<br>\r\nwrapped itself around her body. It deflected towards the door hitting it with a loud<br>\r\nplop. Piper yells at Prue, \"Hey, that hurt!\" \"Well, that serves you right.\" Prue said.<br>\r\nNow Prue is curious about how this all happened in the first place. Piper hasn't<br>\r\na clue. All she knows is that when Piper slammed the door she heard something<br>\r\nclick and it suddenly became much brighter in the office. Her tongue felt like it<br>\r\nwas being burned and that's why she screamed. When the office went dark the<br>\r\npain stopped. Somehow, those __________ cones did this to me and I want it<br>\r\nreversed, Prue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRereading her translations and after pondering things for a few minutes, Prue tells<br>\r\nPiper,\"Well I guess these aren't microscopes.\" Piper replies, \"Yeah, I kinda figured<br>\r\nthat one out by myself.\" Prue then continues, \"I think somehow these cones were<br>\r\nmade to focus magic somehow to make it stronger and maybe weaker.\" \"That's not<br>\r\nhelping the girl with the over 8 foot tongue.\" Piper chimes in. \"You shouldn't worry<br>\r\nto much about this, I'm sure we'll figure out how to fix you someday. Besides, look<br>\r\nat the bright side.\" Prue says. Piper starts getting angrier and says, \"What bright<br>\r\nside, Prue?\" Continuing with her rant, \"My new tongue is much longer than I am tall<br>\r\nand Prue you're (So preoccupied with her tongue Piper hadn't noticed that Prue was<br>\r\nnow over 8 feet tall with an excessively large bust.) YOU'RE enormous. I was sure<br>\r\nthat you were growing.\" Now at the top of her voice, \"This is just so unfair, Prue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to cheer Piper up, Prue tries to remind her, \"Piper look at yourself, you have<br>\r\na forked tongue that's several feet long. Think of what you can do with it, once you've<br>\r\nhad some practice.\" Piper is about to complain again when she realizes what her<br>\r\nsister has been hinting at. \"Ya Prue, you do have a point there. This tongue can<br>\r\nbe very useful. Maybe you shouldn't hurry too fast with finding a way to reverse<br>\r\nthis.\" It takes a while for Prue to find some string. When she does, she uses it<br>\r\nto both see how tall she has grown and how just how long Piper's tongue is now.<br>\r\nThey find out that they are both now a bit over 8 1/2 feet (2.6 meters). Something<br>\r\ndawns on Piper and she starts smiling saying. Oh Prue, \"This may not be so bad<br>\r\nfor me, but tell me how you're going to explain your height on Monday morning?\"</span></div></div>",

Prue then says triumphantly to Piper,<br>\r\n\"Monday morning, I'll just call in sick. After all, right now I'm not myself.\" Piper<br>\r\nreplies unhappily, \"Oh, alright that'll work for a few days but what happens if it<br>\r\nshould take us more than a few days to discover how to reverse this? You know<br>\r\nI'd like to keep at least some of this tongue for awhile.\" Stepping back a couple<br>\r\nof feet Piper then starts extending her tongue towards Prue while she's looking<br>\r\naway. Piper extends it all the way out of her mouth without Prue noticing. She<br>\r\nthen taps Prue on the shoulder. Piper plans on sticking it in Prue's mouth when<br>\r\nshe opens it to say something. Unfortunately for her, when Prue turns towards<br>\r\nPiper and sees the tongue she immediately grabs it and yanks. They are both<br>\r\nsurprised at the sensations that they feel. Piper's tongue hurts from the pulling<br>\r\n(it extends another 12 inches) and Prue suddenly grows another foot taller with<br>\r\nthe rest of her body also growing proportionally bigger. Prue moans just like a<br>\r\nwild tiger from the intense orgasm she feels throughout her body. That feeling<br>\r\nis so intense, she faints landing on her back. After retracting her tongue back in<br>\r\nher mouth Piper dashes over to check on Prue. Prue is unconscious and Piper<br>\r\ncan't wake her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this situation Piper decides to call home to see if Phoebe has returned (She's<br>\r\nnot answering her mobile). Phoebe is home and see's not alone. Kit the Cat is<br>\r\nnot the only one there with Phoebe. She had stood up Tommy three times in<br>\r\nless than 2 weeks. It was always 'a family emergency' (always fighting demons<br>\r\ndoesn't leave a girl much time for socializing). So she was surprised when he had<br>\r\ncalled her that morning. She immediately, showered and dressed up very sexy.<br>\r\nShe left her mobile at home just so they couldn't be interrupted. After downing<br>\r\na big dinner and much wine Phoebe was ready to be dessert. They only got as<br>\r\nfar as the living room couch when they both started stripping off their clothes.<br>\r\nJust as they were really getting into each other the house phone rang. It was<br>\r\nPiper looking for Phoebe and so when she didn't answer it, Kit jumped up onto<br>\r\nTommy's back with her claws extended. That quickly ended the night for them.<br>\r\nAnswering the phone while still naked, Piper only told her to bring the delivery<br>\r\ntruck from where Piper worked (she was allowed to use it on weekends to pick<br>\r\nup orders) and bring it down to Bucklands loading dock. Twenty minutes later<br>\r\nPhoebe drives up to the loading dock, knocking on the door she's amazed to<br>\r\nsee Piper dressed only in her lingerie. Mentioning it to her Piper just says, \"that<br>\r\nthe _________ heat won't go off in the building. Hurry up, I need your help with<br>\r\ndragging Prue down here from her office.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill baffled about what Piper had just said, the go up the elevator in silence. It's<br>\r\nclear to Phoebe that Piper is worried about their sister, which then makes her<br>\r\nnervous. As the elevator doors open on the floor where Prue's office is, Phoebe<br>\r\nraises her voice at Piper and her insistence that Phoebe has to see Prue before<br>\r\nshe'll understand what's going on. Just then Prue has finally awakened from her<br>\r\nlatest growth surge. Hearing them out in the hall, Prue says, \"The big sister can<br>\r\nhear you guys, out there.\" Phoebe then interjects, there she goes again, \"She's<br>\r\nalways talking about being the 'BIG SISTER'. Piper starts laughing her head off.<br>\r\nPhoebe turns and scowls at Piper. Prue is still a little unstable so just as they<br>\r\nget to the door she stumbles against the table and upsets the cones. The one<br>\r\ncloser to the door reverses direction and fires a rainbow beam at Phoebe just as<br>\r\nshe opens the door. Catching the full effects of the beam, her body appears to<br>\r\nexplode like a Fourth of July skyrocket. Piper screams at Prue, \"What did you<br>\r\ndo to Phoebe?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrue looks at Piper funny, she then points to Phoebe who's standing inside the<br>\r\noffice door. She's now only a little over 5 inches tall. The first thing out of Piper's<br>\r\nmouth is her tongue. The next thing is, \"this is just great, now what are we going<br>\r\nto do with her.\" Turning around to look at Prue (who is now close to her normal<br>\r\nheight with some of her expanded bust) Piper blows her top. As Piper yells at<br>\r\nPrue, Prue starts laughing uncontrollably. Shooting her tongue out at Prue, this<br>\r\ntime Prue doesn't see it in time and Piper succeeds in wrapping it around both<br>\r\nof Prue's arms real tight. As soon as Prue starts calming down, Piper asks her,<br>\r\n\"alright now, what's so _______ funny?\" Pointing at Phoebe, Prue says, \"Well,<br>\r\nPhoebe's always complaining about being the little sister &amp; now she really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Prue now triumphantly tells Piper, at least on Monday I won't have to<br>\r\ncall in sick. Suddenly the telephone rings, Since it's late on a Saturday night,<br>\r\nPrue decides to ignore it but it keeps ringing. Probably a wrong number, she <br>\r\nthinks. After about 20 rings she finally answers, because the caller hasn't quit.</span></div></div>",

Continuing with her rant, \"You've shrunken<br>\r\nPhoebe smaller than a Barbie doll, stuck me with this ridiculously long tongue<br>\r\n(which I do admit does provide me with some interesting possibilities) and you<br>\r\nPrue {finally noticing that her bust is still much larger than when she had arrived<br>\r\nearlier} are the only one of us who has benefited from this mess. I'm not about<br>\r\nto loosen up OR calm down. Prue finally able to get a word in says, \"No Piper,<br>\r\nI meant for you to loosen your tongue so I can answer the phone. It's now been<br>\r\nringing for a couple of minutes and I should answer it, no matter who's on the<br>\r\nother end. With a REAL dumb look on her face, Piper just says, \"Oh.\" and does<br>\r\nloosen her tongue just enough for Prue to answer the phone with her right arm.<br>\r\nIt's the guy who sent Prue the cones and things in the first place and he IS NOT<br>\r\nin a good mood. First berating Prue for mis-using them, he then asks her for a<br>\r\nfacsimile number he can use to fix the mess that she has made. The indicators<br>\r\nshow a major malfunction and it needs correcting soon before the items become<br>\r\nirretrievably damaged and whatever changes have occurred become permanent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTelling Prue to switch the over to the speaker-phone which she quickly does,<br>\r\nhe then tells Prue that she is to stay just where she is right now and send Piper<br>\r\nout to retrieve the fax and read it there. He then asks Piper if she knows German.<br>\r\nShe replies \"No, but I can read and speak French.\" Prue then jumps in asking,<br>\r\n\"Piper, you didn't take French in High School so how come you know French?\"<br>\r\nTriumphantly Piper replies, I'm a chef and all the really good ones know French.<br>\r\nFurther asking why the fax can't be read in her office, his short reply is, Piper<br>\r\nis the only one to SEE what's going to happen because you've messed things<br>\r\nup pretty bad. Piper now feels much better about herself. He then tells the girls<br>\r\nthat it will take him a few minutes to rewrite the message into French and also<br>\r\nfor him to dress. He then hangs up before Prue can ask him anything else. She<br>\r\nthen says out loud, \"I wonder why he has to dress to send a fax.\" Piper cuts<br>\r\nin saying, \"As long as everything gets fixed, MOST especially your boobs Prue,<br>\r\nat this point I really don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to dash over to the fax room Piper forgets her tongue is still wrapped<br>\r\naround Prue so when she goes to leave she almost knocks herself out with a<br>\r\nwhiplash to her neck. Yanking her tongue again causes Prue to experience<br>\r\nanother one of those orgasms as Piper's tongue is stretched even longer than<br>\r\nit already was. Not passing out this time, Prue just thanks Piper for all of the<br>\r\n'love' she's given Prue tonight. That draws a great deal or grrr-ing from Piper as <br>\r\nshe then says,\"Oh, this is just GREAT! My tongue must be well over 10 feet by<br>\r\nnow and you are having the time of your life with your inflating boobs!\" It's then<br>\r\nthat Prue reminds Piper not to step on the Phoebe doll as she leaves. Which<br>\r\nshe's careful not to do. Piper then leaves to go wait for the fax to arrive in the<br>\r\nbreak room at the other end of the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n                                                                                                                  </span></div></div>",

Then his body inflated itself back into it's normal stature and he could move. \"What the hell just happened right there\" he said very confused. \"Anyway, I gotta get the girls and get their help to solve this\" Chris tried to port, but at this size all of his white-lighter powers were gone and he realized he has to do this the hard way.

He passes out only to wake up a minute later to find out that he grew, just a little but he grew none the less. He was now 2 inches tall, which is still bug size and extremely hard to spot unless you're looking for something or for him. He then said screw it and continued on his quest for his mother Piper. \"Well I made it to the dining room and Aunt Phoebe still hasn't come back.\" Right as he said that Piper came in to the Dining room to finish making the table and dinner. He has to find a way to contact her and he has to do it now. She was moving way to quickly for him to grab on to anything. Seeing how Piper was wearing black leather high heel boots, some gray dress pants, and a black long sleeve shirt. He could have tried to jump for the pants but they were way to high for him. So he decided to climb the side of a chair being able to see the cracks in it, he started to climb it at incredible speed, probably because of his size. In two whole minutes he makes it to the top of the chair and sees Piper and starts to wave his arms at her yelling. He was too small for his voice to even register in her ear, and she reached to put something on the table and her front crotch area bumped into the chair sending Chris plummeting toward the cushion below. All he saw was Piper's front crotch area slowly disappear as she didn't even notice the young white-lighter fall to the cushion, so she continued to set the table putting the food in the center as Chris continued his fall, his size making the fall a lot slower. He then hit the cushion, but the force from the fall knocked him unconscious. He awoke to many different loud voices coming from above, laughing, chatting, and welcoming. Chris then looked toward the cushion and saw that his foot was stuck in it. He tried to pull it out, but nothing would work. Then a shadow appeared above him, and he looked up to see his Aunt Phoebe smiling as she pulled the chair he was on back. \"Aunt Phoebe, don't sit on me! I'm down here!\" His voice couldn't be heard by his huge Aunt. Phoebe started to sit down slowly as Chris watched to see his Aunt's butt slowly head towards him, blotting out more and more of the light from above. Chris then started to pull harder on his foot trying as hard as he could to get out of the way, but it now seemed inevitable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe then lowers herself into seat not realizing the the young white-lighter was under her. She then adjusts herself in her seat to get more comfortable, scooting her ass from side to side, pushing down into the cushion. Chris sees his Aunts black dress pants slowly lower on top of him, pushing him into the cushion. He feels pressure on himself and again starts to deflate. \"Well how could this get any worse.\" he spoke in a mumble as his face was shoved into the soft butt cheek of his Aunt. Chris then feels the cushion start to shake, just then his aunt started to adjust herself into the chair freeing him from his cushion prison, but moving him closer to her crack. She finally stops adjusting in the chair and Chris is stuck in between her butt cheeks. He knew he could do something now, he could try and wiggle his way out of the predicament, and find another way to contact them. Or he could stay where he is and maybe he will be safer that way. Not knowing if he could still die in other ways... </span></div></div>",

Cole Turner, Phoebe's boyfriend and half demon helper, threw an energy ball of his own back at the demon.  He was glas Piper had listened to his warning.  He didn't want Phoebe to lose another sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige and Phoebe were trying to get around the back of the demon so they could throw a vanquishing potion on it.  Unfortunately, the demon was too fast for them.  The demon took out what looked to be a magic wand, like the wand from the Harry Potter books.  Then it leveled the wand towards Phoebe and muttered an incantation in some ancient unknown language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole saw what looked like a lightening bolt shoot forth from the wand.  With a cry of \"Phoebe, no!\"  he launched himself in front of his beloved.  The bolt struck him instead and threw his body across the room where he collapsed unconscious onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon looked annoyed.  \"Damn,\"  he said.  \"That wasn't supposed to happen.  Still, might get a chuckle or too out of it.\"  He looked down at the still out of it Cole.  \"Don't know what will come of this Belthazor, but I don't think you're going to enjoy it much.  Ciao for now.\"  The demon shimmered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoebe ran over to her boyfriend.  \"Cole, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCole nodded as he let her help him up.  \"Yeah, but whatever that was sure packed a wallop.\"   Phoebe led him over to the couch, where he sank onto the cushions gratefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige came over.  \"What did he mean with all that something happening to Belthazor stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiper shrugged.  \"Probably just stupid demon big talk.  You know how they are.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Come on. let's go have dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the Charmed Ones, Cole and Leo had a nice dinner and later on went to bed.  In the middle of the night, the demon that had zapped Cole silently appeared in the manor.  \"I curse you Belthazor, let thee be zapped.  Let it cause you and your loved ones pain and suffering.\"  The demon finished his final incantation and chuckled.  \"Okay, Belthazor, let's see what you and the Charmed Ones are really made of.\"  Then he shimmered out without another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now Cole has been cursed.  Every so often his body will charge up and he will feel a jolt that will zap either him or other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho does Cole's zapping affect? </span></div></div>",

Then, put a \"Growth/Shrinking\" option before entering the story. This is mainly to keep variety in the stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun and add.</td>",
