Paige tiredly got out of the bed and picked out her clothes for the day. Letting out a yawn, Paige settled on a Brookside lacrosse tank top and a pair of Nike short shorts. As Paige walked downstairs, she was greeted by her dog Bailey, panting and wagging his tail. \"Finally,  you're downstairs for breakfast.\" Elizabeth said, clad in a workout outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, so what did you make?\" Paige asked, taking a sip of orange juice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some egg whites.\" Liz replied as she started to eat some for herself.

Luckily for her, she had Jackie in her class. Since it was the first day, the teacher Mrs. Hill, spent the whole day just setting up the attendance spots and going over the rules. The students were shocked when Mrs. Hill waddled into the as formerly the thin, sexy volleyball coach, but succumbed to the pressures of a slower appetite and a tighter scheduler, filled with quick fast food pickups for lunch and dinner. She waddled into the gym at around 200 pounds. Most of the weight was centered around her sizable stomach, but the rest evened out to her chest and butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was laid back for the most part, as Paige spent the majority of the period talking to Jackie and her other friend Tina, but what surprised her was when Mrs. Hill called her over at the end of the period. \"What do you need Mrs. Hill?\" Paige asked as Mrs. Hill looked at Paige with jealousy. Paige had the figure that Mrs. Hill epitomized. A slender stomach accompanied with a huge rack, and a juicy ass with cheeks the size and firm, spherical shape of volleyballs. Mrs. Hill had thought of the perfect way to damage Paige's figure.  \"Well Paige, as you can probably tell, I'm not as active as I used to be.\" Mrs. Hill began while letting out a belch. \"Yea so?\" \"Well, I was thinking I could use an assistant. I asked the principal and she's perfectly fine with me volunteering one student to be my assistant. Would you be interested? You were always one of the more active students around here.\" \"Sure that sounds fun.\" Paige responded. \"Alright great!\" Mrs. Hill devilishly smiled. \"Do you mind getting my lunch from the teachers lounge? And make sure to take no food from there.\" Mrs. Hill sternly asked. \"Yea sure, no problem.\" Paige responded as she walked with Jackie to retrieve her backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Jackie pondered as she walked with Paige. \"Oh, Mrs. Hill just asked me to be her assistant or something. I'm sure its like extra credit.\" Paige responded. \"Oh thats cool.\" Jackie answered as she waved goodbye to Paige while walking into her next class. Paige walked by herself into the lounge and grabbed the lunch bag. Suddenly, her stomach rumbled louder than an earthquake. \"I'm sure Mrs. Hill won't mind if I take a little snack.\" Paige said ripping open a bag of barbecue chips from the bag.</span></div></div>",

With each step, Paige seemed to have more of a jiggle to her step. Her curvier legs were shoved into tight leggings, while her chubbier stomach was pouring out of an ill-fitting Pink brand blouse. \"Hey Jackie!\" Paige said as she tossed away her breakfast tray of waffle sticks. She'd started a habit of eating breakfast in mornings with Danielle. \"Oh hey Paige.\" Jackie said she kept scanning Paige's chubbier body. Paige's face was chubbier too, she was starting to have the beginnings of a double chin and her cheeks were rounder as well. Paige seemed oblivious to the fact that she'd gained 10 pounds just from being Mrs. Hill's assistant, and the effects were showing on her body,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter playing soccer in gym, Paige did the usual after class meeting with Mrs. Hill to retrieve her food and steal one or two snacks. \"I hope she packed those double stuffed oreos again!\" Paige said as she walked into the lounge. Her small pot belly bounced and her legs jiggled with each step. Paige's stomach growled as she quickly grabbed the bag and searched through the bag for snacks. She settled on a bag of cheez-its to eat. Paige quickly devoured the bag, showcasing a much more slobbish way of eating. She stuffed handfuls in her mouth and quick chewed with her mouth open. \"Those were delicious!\" Paige said as she headed back to the gym.</span></div></div>",

Every delicious pastry and food she could possibly fantasize eating were set up on the table. Brownies, cookies, cupcakes, cheese and crackers, all set up for Paige to eat. The room was empty, as most teachers were teaching the first two periods. \"I guess I can treat myself.\" Paige lauged to herself as she grabbed a brownie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige's face turned red as she let out one last loud belch. She'd eaten at least half of the buffet. Her blouse was covered in chocolate sauce. Stealthily sneaking out to her class, Paige's flabby  face was flooded red with embarrassment. She didn't expect to stuff her face with half of a buffet set up for most of the teaching staff. \"I'm sure they could just blame it on the fat janitor.\" Paige thought to herself as she arrived late to her next class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Late again Paige?\" Her math teacher Mrs. Rush asked. She would surely be a teacher disappointed by the disappearance of the buffet food, since she was over 300 pounds. \"Sorry Mrs. Rush.\" Paige wheezed as she walked to her seat. Many students were intrigued by Paige's weight gain. She was formerly the untouchable queen bee of the school, with a perfect body, but now she was starting to become chubby and out of shape. Her appetite was majorly on the rise too. She was eating double as much as she used too. \"How am I still starving?\" Paige asked herself during class as she heard her chubby stomach rumble.</span></div></div>",

She'd never been over 150 pounds before, let along 170! She was being transformed by Mrs. Hill into a fat pig! Her face now featured a permanent double chin and chubby squirrel cheeks, which contained a greasy exterior of skin from the constant stuffing of her face with junk foods. Traveling down her body, her breasts have increased in size by a cup size due to the the excess flab. Unfortunately, her former slender arms with a hunt of muscle from lacrosse workouts were now coated in flab, jiggling non stop as she rubbed them along her portly stomach. Her six pack abs were now divided into rolls of excess flab, as three rolls of flab settled themselves onto Paige's midsection. Her hips and thighs were wider, as Paige's thigh gap was now nonexistent. Her thighs chaffed with each step she took. Speaking of steps, her legs were much thicker than they used to be, encrusted in a layer of fat. Her calves shook and her much bigger behind jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige couldn't deny that she'd gained weight anymore. Her clothes had all but outgrown her, so  she settled on wearing elastic clothes more often, such as sweats, leggings, sweatsuits, sweatshirts and cardigans, along with the rare spandex shorts that showcased her leg fat. This day, Paige settled on wearing Brookside lacrosse sweats along with a Nike blouse. Paige waddled down the steps and grabbed her backpack to go to school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding her flabby body into her compact ice white BMW, Paige started the drive to school. While driving, a certain McDonalds billboard caught Paige's eye, and she couldn't resist, quickly pulling into the drive thru and ordering a big breakfast. Parking in a distant spot, Paige started to stuff her face with the meal. Syrup dripped down her firm double chin and onto her shirt, while Paige sloppily kept grabbing handfuls of scrambled eggs and pancakes. It was official, Paige had descended into a state of slovenliness. \"That was good.\" Paige said to herself as she let out a loud belch from the filling breakfast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaige arrived at school around 7:15 and waddled to the girls locker room, where she met up with Jackie. Jackie, in recent days, was disgusted and sometimes embarrassed by hanging out with Paige. \"I could see Paige already engorged herself.'' Jackie said, noting the syrup stains in Paige's blouse and the scent of hotcakes and syrup. \"Jackie want to hang out after school? Maya and Dani already said yes. \"Sure, sounds fun.\" Jackie replied as Paige waddled into the gym. Mrs. Hill laughed too herself as she saw her plumped up assistant waddle into the gym. Clad tightly in her outfit, Paige looked more out of shape and sloppy than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class went pretty quickly, even though Paige felt gassed after the period due to her flab causing much lower stamina \"Anything you need Mrs. Hill?\" Paige asked her teacher after class. \"Just the usual sweetie.\" Mrs. Hill said. Little did she know, her lunches were getting smaller and smaller each day</span></div></div>",

Hannah,brown medium length hair, 5'10\", slim but curvy in thee right places at 128 pounds. Smart, but doesn't take school quite as seriously as some of her peers. Very casual and laid back, but also very skilled in the sport of volleyball. She's recovered from an ACL tear last year, recommending her for a less than forward position on any team.

Her and Jackie tried to think of something, before Dani though of an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girls, I've got it! We can fatten her up!\" Dani proudly stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fatten her up?\" Jackie asked, sounding confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, we can befriend her, invite her to our lunch table, and give her our food when we're full. We could also give her snacks. My mom is one of the main PTA volunteers who works at the snack cafe. I can get a bunch of food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm loving this idea.\" Jackie smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But isn't that mean?\" Maya asked. \"She is the new girl after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Maya.

You seem really nice.\" Hannah replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Paige Daniels, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, Hannah Cohen.\" Hannah answered. \"So do you do any sports besides lacrosse, as I can obviously tell by your tank top.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I\"m also a cheerleader. Do you play any sports?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I was a star volleyball player at my old high school. I'm thinking about playing in college too, since I'm getting scholarship offers from a lot of colleges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's cool. Why did you move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom got promoted to a better job near the city so we moved here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice. My dad owns a steak restaurant. His fillet is the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only imagine.\" Hannah said as both girls shared a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's Mrs. Rush's room. Want to sit next to each other?\" Paige asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Hannah replied, as they walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

When she met the man that was Hannah's father, he not only knocked her up, but he constantly treated her to great amounts of food in an effort to plump her up into his idea of perfection. His plan worked, but the two separated two months before Hannah's birth due to him moving to China for his work, and they never had contact again. However, Diana Cohen (she changed her last name for simplicity's sake in raising Hannah) did not lose a single pound added to her body. In fact, her size only amplified due to her food addiction and office job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing an only child of an obese parent, it was rather difficult for Hannah to maintain her lithe figure, but she achieved the great feat nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi, baby! How was your first day?\" Diana asked her daughter with a big smile on her face, taking a brief break from her Fillet-O-Fish sandwich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Met a lot of nice girls, Paige, Dani, Jackie, Maya, Tara, and Jaime.\" She sat down at the table, across from her blob of a mother. She never minded her mom's unhealthy tendencies, she simply wasn't as drawn to them as Diane was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well aren't you little miss popular! Come on, have something to eat!\" She encouraged Hannah to dive into the various bags of McDonald's that sat upon the tabletop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled and nodded, then started making miniature sandwiches with fries and McNuggets. The feast she had earlier in the day had unlocked her inner hungriness, so she ate like she was royalty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her dinner and going upstairs, Hannah enjoyed a hot shower, noticing the slight curve on her midsection, but writing it off as bloating. She got out, dried off, and put on her pajamas of flannel pants and a tank top. She grabbed her phone and lied down in  bed with no intent of going to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah began to text Paige with a request to hang out after school tomorrow, she accepted, asking where she wished to go.</span></div></div>",

A box of donuts, two bags of Cool Ranch Doritos, and a bag of Cheez-It's, which she knew were Paige's favorite snack. \"Hey gals. You don't mind if I brought some snacks do you?\" Dani smiled. While Hannah had no reaction, Paige immediately heard her stomach rumble. Her mouth started to water while staring at the Cheez-It's box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Dani's original plan of fattening up Hannah seemed to be in full throttle and working well, she was unknowingly also fattening up her best friend.

Her legs had thickened considerably, her thighs rubbing together slightly. A decent bit of softness had accrued around her middle, making it so the indent of her belly button was visible through her t-shirt. The constricting waistband of her leggings cut into her softness quite a bit, giving her belly a slight overhang, and the illusion of love handles, even though she wasn't at that point yet. Her breasts had gone up half a cup size, pulling the neckline of any shirt she would wear down about three quarters of an inch more than it used to, A tiny bit of fullness had developed around her neck and cheeks, but not enough to be noticeable unless she tilted her head down, which gave her a bona-fide double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah was fat.

The family walked in, only to be greeted by an obese hostess. \"Welcome to Denny's.\" She said, belching, and eating a cheeseburger. \"We'll have a table for you, just follow me.\" The woman was clearly out of shape. Every waddle she made was followed by a loud and smelly fart, a wheeze or he sound of her thighs colliding together. \"Here you go.\" She said, trying to catch her breath. \"The waiter will be here soon with a complimentary basket of cheese bread.\" She continued, waddling away.\" Amy could still smell her wreak of fast food and sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what a pig. I hate it here.\" Amy said displeased as she stared at the menu. \"Now remember girls, only order from the 550 calories or less menu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Amy. Give them a break, just for one night.\" Jimmy pleaded. Secretly, he hoped that his wife started to become fat too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. As much as I hate to say this, I'll let you two order whatever you want. Just for tonight!\" Amy made clear. Lily and Ashley high fived each other as the waiter came over, carrying the delicious cheese bread. The bread had a odoriferous scent, which made Ashley's stomach rumble. She quickly grabbed two pieces as Amy gave her a glare. After the waiter listed the specials, Ashley and Lily ordered a cheeseburger, Amy ordered a double cheeseburger because Jimmy convinced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Lily and Ashley ate a lot, Amy was the true pig during dinner. \"That was so good.\" Amy belched. As the family walked out, Ashley noticed a help wanted sign. \"Lily, maybe you and me can work here, for extra money.\" \"That's a good idea Ashley, but we can't tell mom, she'd be pissed.\" Little did they know, the Denny's would start a downwards health spiral that their mother could never recover from.</span></div></div>",

You choose the path for gaining weight or staying thin. You could also fatten up other characters, such as her mother, sister, aunt, cousins or one of her friends, maybe even a teacher at her school! There are some rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlob, such as burping, farting, sweating, wheezing, popping pants, not showering(smelling bad), and eating like a pig is allowed, perhaps requested<br>\r\nMax weight for a person is 500 pounds<br>\r\nNo male weight gain<br>\r\nNo magic<br>\r\nNo vore<br>\r\nNo sudden weight gain, for example, if someone gains 800 pounds at once<br>\r\nNo animal weight gain(Paige's dog)<br>\r\nNo sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, I think it's all set up! Have fun writing! The character list is in my portfolio.</td>",
