You wonder how you got where you are, unable to remember anything that happened to you. You are a High-School student, age 14. You feel horrible, covered in scrapes and bruises, your clothes torn up. You are down on the ground, belly down in the dirt. You hear a strange sound, a growl of some sort, and look up. In front of you, you spot what looks like a Timber Wolf. It has gray fur on the top, and white on the bottom. However, something is different about it. It is large, slightly larger than you yourself, with a mouth wide enough to eat swallow a human with ease. You try to move, but your body is too sore to do so. You look on in fear as the wolf slowly approaches you. It comes to your baskside, and nudges its nose agaunst your crotch. Even through your thick blue jeans, you feel the wet, cold nose. The wolf is trying to determine your gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are...</span></div></div>",

The wolf slowly moves away from the area and paces around your body, examining it carefully. It notices that your silver short-sleeved T-shirt is town as well in several places, and notices the wounds on your body. It comes to your face, causing you to stare directly into its golden yellow eyes. The wolf opens its mouth a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! I'm going to die!\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf just happened to be yawning and closes its mouth back up. You with relief, but not before realizing that you just got a face full of wolf breath. You can't quite recognize the smell. The warm breath messed your short, spiky brown hair up a bit. The wolf moves closer and licks your forehead and cheek. You feel the wet and slobbery tongue lick you across your face. The tongue is rough, but it feels nice as well. You snap back to reality from the pleasant feeling and start wondering what the wolf's intentions are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf is...</span></div></div>",

The wolf continues licking your face, when you suddenly realize that your face doesn't hurt anymore. The wolf stops licking you for a moment. You manage to move your arm and feel your face with your right hand. You feel a bit of the wolf's saliva covering a scratch on your right cheek. You rub off some dry blood, and realize that it's not bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this wolf, helping me?\" you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze as the wolf begins licking several others of your body. With each place the tongue touches, the pain seems to go away. Your body doesn't hurt as much anymore, and you find yourself able to stand up. You push yourself to your feet, but stumble a bit and quickly fall back over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hit what you believe to be the ground, you feel what feels like soft rabbit fur underneath you. You open your eyes to find yourself lying on the wolf's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...broke my fall!\" you gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf slowly sets you down on your stomach and proceeds to stand over your body. It licks the back of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, that tickles.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf grabs the skin on the back of your neck, and lifts you up like it would a wolf pup. The wolf's touch has caused your skin to stretch, but it doesn't hurt surprisingly. You guess that the wolf licked it to numb it like it did your wounds.

On one end, you are afraid that this sign of affection from the mothering wolf could be a ruse so you may later become food for her, or for the other members of her packs. On the other, you have the ridiculous idea that this wolfess was actually trying to keep you as its SON. Of course, none of these claims could be verified; how many people do you know that have survived a hand-to-hand encounter with a wolf, and one of this size no less? It did not matter so much now; you were certain that there was no way out of this mess soon.<br>\r\nAs you lay on the ground, the wolfess still licking you with its rough tongue, you started to feel tired. And itchy. You assumed that it was just the change of environment, and the fatigue that came with trying to wrap your head around the situation. However, you looked at your hands as they itched your body and saw your nails were getting sharper than normal. They grew and pointed at an impossible rate, and you were extremely confused. The growth did not hurt; it just tingled, making your fingers itch too. As you scratched your left hand with your right, the annoying feeling continued no matter how much you attended to it. Finally, upon closer inspection, you felt a simultaneous jolt in your hands and feet, the itching feeling becoming a warm sensation that turned you numb. You groaned, not in pain, but in sheer confusion. Then, something happened that you would have never expected. The wolfess stopped licking you and hovered her slightly agape muzzle to your ear. She breathed into your ear and motioned her lips in a way that almost simulated speech. Human speech. She said, or rather breathed, \"Do not worry. The transformation has begun.\"<br>\r\nMy mouth hung open, a combination of complete disbelief and a raging toothache in the back of your mouth. You reached in with your warming hands, which were developing some sort of soft gray cover, you grimaced and retracted your hand, seeing blood on your finger. Your teeth were becoming sharp, so sharp that they could puncture skin. The wolfess turned her head and began licking you once again. \"It's confusing at first, but don't fight.\" Her airy \"voice\" soothed you once again, but once again, you didn't know if it was sincere or just the temptation of a snake. Or wolf, rather.<br>\r\nAs the transformation continued for what felt like about an hour, the effects began to show more vibrantly. The tingling, warm sensation and gray covering on your hands and feet turned snow white, and your palms and calluses developed pads, black as coal. Your mouth was filled with razor-sharp teeth, and many accidental bites led to you spitting blood. On top of that, your mouth elongated into a wolf-like muzzle. The wolfess spoke again, but her voice became clearer and less airy. \"Wonderful. The transformation is continuing accordingly. You will become a member of the Lupusapiens in no time...\" At that point, you were shocked. Confused. You were half-human, half-wolf and being treated by a giant talking wolfess who you recognized as your mother. Suddenly, you felt an unbearably terrible pain in your chest and the base of your spine. You fell to the ground in a fetal position, practically yelling in pain. The wolfess leaned down and nuzzled you; she seemed bigger than before. \"Calm yourself, my child. It will all be over soon. Now rest; my husband, the Alpha male, will be pleased to see you in your Lupus form, Casine.\" You did not know what that last word was, but from how she said it, you assumed it was her name to you. You repeated it to yourself before blacking out from shock and pain. \"Casine...\"</span></div></div>",

He looked down with is emerald green eyes and kind of blushed. Suddenly you felt really tired and you passed out on your new dads paw. He licked your cheek then put his head back down and drited off to sleep as well. In the morning you awaken with a big yawn. You realize that you were alone in the cave.

You now realize that you are surrounded by a pack of the giant wolves. You spy the wolf who carried you in run up some rocks almost in the shape of a staircase to a large male wolf. The wolf licks the male affectionately. The male wolf's tail is up high, and he stares down upon you. Based on his position, you know he's the Alpha Male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, he's the one in charge?\" you think to yourself. \"Then, that means the wolf that brought me here is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour assumptions are correct, the wolf is the Alpha Female. The male walks down the rock staircase to you, approaching you in a gesture that shows he's the boss. You notice that he has a large scar across his chest, meaning he's been in tough battles.

You look to your left without moving your head, you use your eyes, and see the female wolf that took you here giving a kind of hint by licking in air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quiver shakes down your spine. You think you will actually have to lick that disgusting wild animal! Yuck! You don't want to be clawed again, so you close your eyes and push your head up with your tongue out to lick. You feel like you've been leaning forward forever, when you finally reach the fur surrounding the wolf's mouth. It isn't the best tasting thing you've had, it was pretty bad, but you figure you need to make it like a \"lick\" instead of just a touch, so you move your head back making your tongue do a licking motion. When you reach the bottom of his nose you felt the wetness and another quiver went down your spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish you put your head down and look back at the female, who is still licking. The wolf over you growls again, you figure you must lick him again. You lick him another time, getting a couple more quivers. That still isn't enough?! You lick him one more time, then he finally licks you back. He starts to back away a few feet when you turn around onto your hands and knees, then push up with your hands and get on your knees, the wolf comes closer slightly and pushes you back down with his paw, hard! Your hands couldn't hold you up for that, you face plant into the rock floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear wolves growling, you fear they are directed toward you, </span></div></div>",

The alpha male then picks you up by the neck, opening the scar on your cheek more, and walks out of the cave, leaving the others in the den. You look back to see the alpha female looking very disappointed in you. You aren't walked too far, until you see a den similar to the one you were just in. It was dark in the cave so you couldn't see what awaited you. The alpha male stopped at the entrance and threw you in. You landed with a loud thud on the rock floor. You hear panting as you look up your eyes adjust. It's more wolves! They're only cubs though. They're still at least twice as big as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a growl and look behind you. You see a cub, larger than the rest looking at you the same way the alpha male did at you. You think he's wanting you to submit. You stand up again, after all they're only pups, and try to show you're superior. You still have to tilt your head back to see the wolves face. You suppose he's the alpha pair's cub since he's the biggest and has the same look as them. As you stand there in front of this huge wolf pup, you start to have fear build up inside of you, he's not doing anything, which makes you think you won for a moment. He then sits down and lifts his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around trying to keep your face from being hit. Instead you are taken out at the legs and you fall backwards and hit your head on the rock floor. You pass out. You wake up in the adult wolf den with all the pups in it too. You tried not to look embarrassed and self pity, but your face was showing it clearly. The alpha pup comes to you again like he did before, you almost start to stand up until you hear the alpha male growling behind him. You then lie down on your back and wait for the pup to get his muzzle close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of de j\u00e4 vou, comes over your mind, the taste and feeling of the adult alpha male's fur and nose. As you think about it a quiver goes down your spine. You hope for forgiveness and reach up, tongue ready. You eventually lick him once, that's all it took for he licked you back before you even pulled your tongue back in. You wipe your mouth and turn over to get up, then you remember what happened last time. You stay on your hands and knees. The pup growls with the alpha male communicatively. You watch as the alpha male walks over to you and puts his paw under your chest. The alpha male pushes up, causing you to stand on your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha male then walks back past the pup and growls as if to say \"There, happy now?\". The pup nods. The alpha male turns around, and looks like he's looking at you, but truly he's looking outside the cave to see that the sun has set by now. He growls at the alpha female communicatively then walks up the ramp on the side of the cave to the balcony above, turns and walks deeper into the cave. The other wolves stay on the first floor and disappear into the cave. You're left standing there with the alpha female. She comes over to you and forces you to turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe licks a few times then carries you up to the balcony and growls at the alpha male communicatively with your neck still in her teeth. The male growls back then motions her over to him. He was lying on a pile of animal furs. The alpha female sets you down next to the alpha male and you start to shiver. You look up at the huge alpha male and his thick coat of fur. You then turn around to have the alpha female scoot you over up next to the male then her come up next to him, covering you with fur. It's very comfortable as is, but you still feel the need to move around. You lie down on the furs beneath you with the fur from the male and the female still around you. You quickly fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

If I had just left you where you were, you would be dead by now for certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed hard. \"What do I have to do to stay alive?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must learn to be a wolf and earn your way into the pack.\" replied the Alpha female. \"You may call me mum but not openly as you are still an outcast.

There seemed to be plenty for all but, observing how they viciously pushed Karna away, you knew that it was going to take a fight to get even a scrap off the bone. Normally, you would not have dreamed of eating deer meat raw but it was either act as one of the pack or become part of their next meal.

You howled in pain, cursing your momentary lack of focus then went on the offensive yourself, clipping her in the nose with a heavy swing of your right fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that had to hurt.\" you thought, hearing Karna howl in pain herself. \"I can't let up though, not while I have the momentum, I have to get her to yield!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou noticed a recent wound on Karna's right shoulder, most likely from one of the subordinates, and drove your fist there next, forcing her let out a low whimper. Then, to your surprise, she came back with a strong swing of her paw and struck your head, nearly knocking you out as it hit the ground. You looked up at her, still bearing your teeth, as you felt the blood from the scratches she left on your head drip down your face. Fortunately, you had been in a few rough fights and you were able to take a lot of punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not bad of a fighter.\" you thought, trying to ignore your pain. \"But so am I!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou responded to Karna's blow you your head with a heavy blow of your own as she came in close to bite you. Your fist struck her hard in the left eye, forcing her to back away, whimpering. You then jumped up and grabbed her right ear with your teeth and pulled her head down before striking her again, in her wounded right shoulder before ripping off a piece of her ear with a heavy jerk of your head. Karna howled and whimpered before quickly retreating to a low spot in the ground, clear of you and the other wolves, you were victorious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, little one.\" said mum, quietly, stepping up to you. \"The rest of the kill is yours, leave what you wish to Karna when you are done.\" then you heard what sounded like a sigh and you began to get worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long has it been since she last ate?\" you quietly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Karna has not fed for three kills.\" replied mum. \"She must learn to fight more viscously or find her own food. If not, she will grow even weaker and either be killed during a hunt or be eaten by one of the subordinates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Karna, concerned, and heard her whimpering as she held her head very low to the ground. \"Oh, man!\" you thought, kicking yourself. \"She's crying!\" a low sigh escaped your lips. \"I just can't let her go hungry like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot certain what your actions would bring, you looked over the carcasses and spotted an entire leg that the other wolves had missed! It was certainly enough meat to fill your belly so you knew that it would feed hers. The only question was so you offer her the meat and eat the scraps ot take the meat and leave the scraps for her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it over, you decided that you needed an ally and Karna sure seemed to need a friend as well. You took the bone of the leg in tour mouth and dragged it away from the carcass , as if you feast upon it in private. Only, as you passed Karna, you suddenly gave it a heavy push, sending it rolling into her. Karna let out a low yelp of surprise then looked at you as if she was uncertain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat.\" you said. then walked back to the carcasses, still on all fours, and began to work what little meat was left off the bones, knowing that you could adapt and find a lizard or grub to eat sometime later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKarna, as you noticed, had accepted your offering and was eating hungrily while you worked on the scraps, hoping that you had made an ally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this a wise decision?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your mouth began to water as you did not get much to eat the day before. As a human, you were not really a hunter but you saw yourself as a fair fighter and you had proven yourself one, facing Karna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to try.\" you thought to yourself, determined to win your meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving as quietly as you could, you carefully crept out of the cave, into the morning light. Unknown to you, the Alpha male was awake and watching. He nudged his mate, mum, waking her, and she watched you with a certain curiosity. Using what you knew about how other predators hunted, you stayed as low to the ground as you could, trying your best to stay down wind so the doe would not pick up your scent. Once you were close enough, you jumped the doe, hoping to knock her off balance and quickly get your arms around her head to snap her neck. It would be quick and the doe would die instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful.\" you thought to yourself, eying the doe's hooves. \"She could really tear you up if you let her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, the other wolves were awake and watching you as well. Finally, you were in a position where you believed you had a good chance and made your move. Unfortunately, while you were so focused upon the doe, you failed to sense the buck who the Alpha male saw right away. You were knocked away by him, sending you tumbling but you were back on all fours in the next breath, growling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" you thought. \"Why didn't I see him coming!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buck brought up his two front hooves and brought then down upon you but, fearing for your life, you quickly dodged his blow and growled again, hoping to last long enough to wear it down. While you were 'locking horns' with the buck, the Alpha male ordered the pack onto the hunt and they made short work taking down the doe, no longer being protected by its larger and more powerful mate. The buck again attacked you but missed as you dodged again, noticing that one of the buck's rear legs was shaking badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must have been injured there recently.\" you thought, surprised by how quickly you were spotting such things. \"If I could throw it off balance...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buck reeled you back into the present with a charge of it antlers, which you barely managed to dodge, then moved to charge again. This time, you were ready and charged him as well! Unknown to you, being focused on your fight, the pack hesitated, seeing your bold move, and watched as you jumped aside at the last second and wrapped yourself around the buck's hind legs. He have out a loud sound of surprise then came crashing down, his head striking a large rock with the full force of his weight. A loud bone breaking crack was heard and the buck immediately fell silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do it?\" you asked yourself, whispering. \"Is he dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully pulled yourself away from the buck's hind legs then moved on all fours to his front. His eyes were open but unmoving and there was a small but steady stream of blood running from the rock under his head. The buck was clearly dead, you had made your first kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did it!\" you whispered, slightly proud of yourself. \"I faced a full grown buck and took it down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you did was very foolish, little one.\" scolded mum, walking up to you. \"What you should have done was alert me or the Alpha male of the potential meal outside our cave.\" she paused, eying your kill. \"I am impressed by your success but remember, the pack hunts as a team for a reason, better chances of continued success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I earned my meal?\" you asked, knowing that an apology at this point would be futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha male approached you, his face covered in the doe's blood and eyed your kill before turning mum and gave her a quick nod before tearing into the flesh as mum then turned to you. \"You may eat your fill with us today.\" she told you. \"This is your reward for your first kill but do not expect any favors tomorrow, you must learn to hunt with the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she fell silent and began to eat as well with you left wondering if you actually deserve to dine with the Alpha male and female, mum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Mum also did not speak a word to you but she did  occasionally throw you what you had come to know as a grin.

The Alpha Male led the way as they patrolled the edge of their territory looking for the noise. Soon they found it. It was a trio of wolfs and from the looks of it a rival pack. The Alpha Male and his band laid close to the ground and watched them. If the wolfs were just scouting then there was no need to fight them. Instead they would increase the watches once the wolfs left. The Pack's territory was the largest of the various wolf packs in the forest and was close to a river and had high rocky cliffs to protect its rear. The pack had defended this area for many generations and many other packs were their enemies, luckily their pack was one of the strongest due to the position of their territory. <br>\r\n     As they watched the wolfs moving around, the Alpha Male found it hard to distinguish their motives. They were moving along like they were scouting but also laying low to the ground in attack positions. Turning to the Beta Male the Alpha whispered.<br>\r\n   \"Felix what do you think? Should we attack.\" The second in command shook his head and whispered back.<br>\r\n    \"If we do that we may alert the rest of their pack plus they haven\u2019t entered too deep into our territory to warrant such aggressive behaviour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Back in the save you stayed awake and listened to the conversation.

The wolf is carrying a large caribou in its mouth. It approaches the center of the room, where you notice the large a stone pedestal that seemed to avoid your attention before. It sets the large caribou down on the pedestal, and you can see it clearly. The caribou is much larger than usual, but smaller than the wolves. The neck has been snapped, with blood dripping down from the neck, and the wolf's fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf walks over to the Alpha pair and bows its head, moving in a way that made it look like it was stretching. The male approaches it, and gently licks it, accepting the offering. The female does the same, and the two approach the caribou. The other wolf moves and sets itself down next to a female wolf with what seems to be a very tiny bite mark in her left ear. the wolf from before was a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They must be the Beta pair.\" you guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha pair carefully examine the fallen prey, and sddenly stop. The male is at the stomach, and the female at the rump. Both sink their teeth into the flesh and pull away the fur, until they get nothing but soft flesh. They chew the meat, completely focussed on their meal. As they chew down to the bone, you wonder if they plan on eating all of it. Finally, the male lifts his head and motions for the others. The other wolves slowly approach the body, making sure that they're allowed. The Beta pair go first, and the rest follow suite. You hear your stomach growl and realize that you're hungry too. Very hungry to be precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even remember the last time I ate.\" you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that all of the wolves may eat, you slowly make your way over. Several wolves, including the former Omega, stop eating and growl at you. The former Omega is young, and his fur isn't as shiny or as well taken care of as the others. He runs at you knocks you away, causing you to lay motionless on the floor before he returns to his meal. It is there that you notice another opening in the cave wall to your right. No wolves are guarding it. You are much closer to it, than the one of the left that you came through to get here.

Not thinking about it anymore, you resume watching the young wolves play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*Nanashi means \"nameless\", and okami means \"wolf\".

Examining your hands, you see the beginnings of a rough pad formed on your hand, while your nails seem to have grown slightly. Beinging your hands to your face, you feel your face slightly pushed out, the beginings of a muzzle, while your mouth now bears a set of sharp fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first instinct: Scream.<br>\r\nYour second instinct: Run<br>\r\nYour third: Faint<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, forgoing what would definatly cause an uproar amoung the pack, and probably undo the respect you'v managed to earn from the alphas, you take a deep breath, hold it, count to ten, and try to calm down, though through your mind seems to run this constant voice saying 'oh my god, I have a tail'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least his one seems to be taking it well,\" says the gruff voice of the Alpha male, \"The last one screamed so much, he didn't realize he had run right off the cliff,\" he said, chuckling slightly as he looks you over. \"I'll give you a few minutes to ajust, then I'll be waiting for you outside,\" he says, walking past you, tail raised high as he heads for the cave exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he's left, you sit down, trying to digest what has just happened, \"I'm sure your quite confused, Nanokami,\" says the Alpha female, sitting next to you, \"I'm sure your wondering what has happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"How can you talk?\" you say, almost without thinking, in which the Alpha laughs, \"Anything can talk, we have always talked, the difference is, now you can understand. You are slowly becoming one of us, as do any of your kind that enter in to these mountains. We do not know why, or how, but it happens to them all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what will happen to me?\" you ask, \"Is there anyway to stop it, or any way to leave the mountain? Not to seem ungrateful or anything, but, I miss my family and friends...\" You trail off, as you try to recall your family, but all you draw is a blank. You expression tells what is going on in your mind, and the Alpha nods understandingly, \"As the transformation persists, memories of your old life will fade away. You can try to leave the mountains, but none have been sussesful, most lose their memories far before they ever reach the edge, and others have lost their lives to the predators that roam there. Even if you were to survive, the cliffs that surround us are to steep to scale, and even we cannot tell what lies beyond it's borders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what else is their for me?\" you ask, near tears as hope seems to slip from you. The alpha puts a paw on your shoulder, \"Nanokami, I took you in from the wild near dead, and cleaned and healed your wounds, do you not think I have not done so for a reason?\" you look at her in disbelief, wondering what she is saying, \"You are a part of my pack now, and if you choose, you can be part of our family, look around you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look, and watch the wolves. The pups play on the ground, wrestling each other, while the older members socialize, even playing their own games. Even the omega, though more carefully, involves himself in the community, or goes off to explore. \"Our way may not be your own, but do you not think we would accept you? The pack is a family, and even if you were not born amoung us, you are a part of it as sure as any one of our pups, Nanokami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling me Nanokami? My name is...\" and you stop, sudenly realizing that you cannot even remember your name anymore, \"I... can't remember...\" you say. \"We have called you this since we found you,\" says the she wolf, \"We name all who come here, for none remember their names by the time they can understand us. So to us, you are Nanokami,\" She stands, and pushes you to your feet with her muzzle, \"And you need to go meet with Strongmoon, my mate has little patience, so it's best not to keep him waiting little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you run to the cave entance, coming upon the Alpha male, Strongmoon, as you exit the cave, overlooking the forests from atop the cliff. \"I assume Winterwind has talked to you,\" he says, and you nod, as you realize that sounded more like a command then a question. \"Then you know you have two options available to you, you can leave, and try to find the exit to these mountains, or you can remain here, and become a part of our pack. Know that, if you leave, you will be facing the wild alone, for I will not sacrifice any more under my charge on such a fools quest.

Your best option it seems is to stay with the wolves, at least, you could find a home here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A wise decision,\u201d says Strongmoon, still watching you with scrutiny, though the look in his eyes seems to soften slightly. \u201cYou are unlike most that have come here,\u201d he says, the tone in his voice somewhat pleased, \u201cYou compose yourself with more self control then the typical human, but we\u2019ll see what your made of once a proper set of fangs grow in.\u201d He stands and approaches, and you quickly kneel lower to the ground, in a submissive posture, whining slightly, \u201cYou can get up,\u201d he says, \u201cNot every gesture I make is a signal for you to submit. Just show proper the respect and courtesy to your elders, and you\u2019ll fit in soon enough.\u201d You rise keeping your tail lowered, though it twitches slightly as the more relaxed tone Strongmoon has taken makes you feel a bit more secure. \u201cNow, go and meet the rest of the pack, I\u2019m sure your brothers and sisters will want to get to know you,\u201d he says, and can\u2019t help but give a small chuckle as your face lights up, and your tail wags, as the thought of acceptance washes over you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you dart back down the tunnels, noticing for the first time that running on all fours has become considerably easier. And he accepted you! You can hardly believe it, but then it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise, wolves are a very close knit family, even the omega is a valued member, even if it is the lowest rank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the main cave, you see the cubs playing energetically, while it seems the more mature wolves too, have began engaging in wrestling, but by now you know that this is normal, unlike humans, wolves engaged in activities like this together, it was not only about eat and sleep, wolves love play from puphood to adulthood. Still, the older wolves are still much larger then you, should you introduce yourself to them first, or should you try your luck with the smaller pups first?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was suddenly knocked onto my back, as both of them started licking my groin, and as best as they could started licking, and kissing, as wolves could, my stiff, throbbing cock.

I can not tell you how many times I came....and in who, and when.....but after many, many hours of never-ending sex, I passed out.....doing my final coming deep inside Fleetfoot's tight-clinching pussy,....as I was standing on top of her prone, madly humping body, our mouths pressed to each other's kissing as we came....and came.....and came......<br>\r\nWith a satisfied sigh, I cuddled with them all, surrounded on all sides by the three female wolves.

Our ancestors had no choice but to follow him when we got there he was already transforming into one of us. They were about to slay him and our ancestors attacked to save his life. The entire camp was killed and the scout was now one of our kind. our ancestors accepted him into our pack and let the Omegas take care of him, since every human starts out as pup once they transform. There are many other stories that are to be told by the crystals. But that will wait be when your much older little ones. For now you can go play with your friends.

There's been enough fighting with the lynx's today,\" you say. \"I know dear, I know, don't worry though, our pack is very strong they'll be able to fend them off. Now get some rest dear, I'll wake you when it's over Nanokami,\" your mom says. You soon fall asleep, as do the other pups, while all the mothers stayed awake to keep an eye on all of you.</span></div></div>",

You shudder at the thought that the wolf might leave you behind and force you to find a way back on your own. If that happened, you were screwed. In truth, the Alpha Male did plan such a test for another day, but today you would not be subjected to such a thing. You could tell by a smirk on his face that he knew that if he left you here alone today, you'd freeze to death when the sun went down. Naked as you were, even a fire wouldn't keep you warm enough, and there was nothing providing a sturdy shelter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf comes to a halt, causing you to stop as well. He lifts his back leg and pisses on a rock, probably refreshing a mark indicating territory. The wolf then growls at you; you watch as he sniffs the mark. He wanted you to do the same. The thought of sniffing a wolf's piss grossed you out, but after what you had gone through already, you knew it would be best not to disobey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a heavy sigh, you get down on all fours and sniff the mark. It smelled just like any other pee mark. Seeing that you didn't get it, the wolf places a heavy paw on your head and smothers your face against it. You hack and spit and curse out about being forced into such a degrading act. The wolf then points to another mark. Not wanting your face to be pressed into more piss stains, you go over and sniff it. To your surprise, it smelled different, surprisingly different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't from a wolf, is it?\" you ask the Alpha Male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you understand why the wolf did what he did, though you kind of wish that it wasn't necessary. Now that you could tell the difference, you could find the wolves' territory. The wolf also points out various claw marks to show you where to go if you found yourself lost. The Alpha Male looks at you, as if expecting you to do the same if you got lost. The wolf slashes at a fallen tree log, leaving a deep mark and tells you to the same. You try, but you can't leave any indentation of any kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf heaves what looks like a sigh.</span></div></div>",

You need to take it slow. Your skull's have taken a good knock after hitting that boulder,\" says the alpha male. Nanokami must have been the name they gave you, and for some reason you cant remember anything past when the alpha female found you in the woods, not even your own name. So you stick with Nanokami and ask, \"What happened to me? How, how did I change into a wolf?\" \"Well It happens to everyone who comes through here, but your the first in six months. They come to this mountain, some are in the same condition as you and they transform after two days of being with the pack. You've been out cold for the past three days, so you transformed two days ago,\" the alpha female says. \"Sorry for freaking out and running off earlier, I can understand if everyone is mad at me. You brought me here and were taking care of me, and I repay you by running away,\" you say, hanging your head low. The Alpha female replies, \"It's alright little one. We were kind of expecting that to happen, but we were surprised at how far you got. The last one who freaked out only made it as far as the den's entrance. No one is mad at you. We're just relieved your finally awake.\" \"Well I have to help check the borders this morning, so I'll leave you two alone for now. I suggest that we get volunteers for the hunting party, and some to watch the rest of the pups including my own,\" the alpha male says before taking his leave along with everyone else. \"What did he mean by 'including his own'?\" you ask the alpha female, with a confused look on your face. \"Well we do have our own pups. You just haven't met them yet and they are actually sitting right behind you,\" she says as you look behind you and see three other pups (one boy and two girls, all your age) looking at you with welcoming eyes. \"And we talked about it and wonder if you would like to become part of our family dear,\" she finishes. You were taken back by this offer. To become part their family, that was a bit overwhelming and you wonder if this would make the other pups jealous of you. When looked the only other pups (four more to be exact, and same number of boys and girls) were sitting next to the alpha female. You weigh out your options and accept her offer. You say, \"I'm grateful for the offer. Thank you, but what are we going to do about my leg. I actually noticed it was sprained after I collapsed from exhaustion.\" \"My mate Strongmoon will back with some vines and twigs after he's done with patrol. We just didn't want to touch it incase you woke up and tried to run off again. Oh, I almost forgot introductions. My name is Winterwind, but you can call me mother and Strongmoon father. This is your brother Talcain, and your sisters Aria and Nyla,\" Your mother says. \"Hi Nanokami,\" your sibling say in unison. \"Hi sibs,\" you reply back making everyone giggle. \"Well We'll introduce the rest of the pack later. Right now It's time for lunch,\" she says and she lays on her side positioning herself so you didn't have to move much. Your siblings start to suckle, but your a little hesitant until you here your mom say as she nudges you, \"Go ahead son, drink.\" You latch on to one of her nipples start to nurse and soon feel warm nourishing milk flow down your throat. The milk tasted sweeter then anything you've ever tried. You continued to nurse until you were full and feel your strength come back to you.

Don't worry, that cougar is no match for this pack. My mate will be back soon, in the mean time we need to tend to your leg. It's hurt pretty bad.\" \"I'm sorry for what I did. I should have known better, You took me in and were teaching me the ways of the pack, and I repay you by running off. I just hope none of the member's are severely injured or killed. I'm sorry for putting all of you in danger,\" you say, preparing for whatever was going to happen. \"You don't need to apologize little one. We were expecting you to react the way you did. It happens to most humans once they see they've transformed. We were just worried we wouldn't get there in time, and what happened was coincidence. We understand why you ran off, you were alone, scared and weakened. Seeing a pack of wolves and that you had become one was an overwhelming experience for you. My mate and I have talked it over and want you to become part of our family. My pups, Talcain, Arya, Northwind will be more then happy to have you as a brother,\" Winterwind says as Strongmoon walks in. \"I thought you would've had the omega pair take care of me for what I did,\" you say. \"Oh no dear, the omega pair isn't ready to take care of pups,\" she replies. \"And trust me Nanokami, I've seen pups get themselves get in to deeper trouble then what you got into, so don't be so quick to assume we will be harsh on you for what happened. Besides I think you've taken enough punishment to last you a month, after what you've just been through,\" Strongmoon says. You blush a little and then see the pups Winterwind spoke of and they look at you with welcoming eyes. \"So, will you accept our offer little one? And don't worry, this won't make the beta's pups jealous,\" Winterwind says. \"Yes,\" you say as you nuzzle her. She nuzzles you back and says, \"Alright, now we need to mend that leg of yours, my mate already has the vines and twigs to make splint, and I'll put some leaves on your wound once I'm done cleaning it. Pups, go off and play, your brother will be fine.\" And with that, they go and play tag. \"Hold your leg out son,\" Your dad says, and you slowly put it out, because it hurts to move it. He starts to make a splint for leg and say, \"Ow,\" as you wince in pain from the splint tightening. \"Shhhh, it's okay honey, I know it hurts. If you need to cry, it's fine,\" your mom says. \"Ow, this teaches me not to wonder off alone, ow,\" you say with tears falling down your face. \"Sense of humor in tact I see,\" you dad says as he finishes making your splint. You smile with tears rolling down your face. Your mom says as she nuzzles you again, \"You were brave dear, it's okay to cry. We can't  have you walking any where for a couple of days, so don't try to wrestle with your siblings Nanokami.\" \"Alright mom,\" you say, knowing it's better to not argue with her. \"Now, it's time for you pups to have lunch,\" She says as she lays on her side. Your siblings come up and start to nurse, but you are hesitant, for you had not had wolfs milk before, but then again you can't remember anything from your past life, including your name, so you stick with Nanokami. Your mother notice you weren't nursing and nudges you towards her nipples and says, \"Go ahead my little one, drink. You need this kind of nourishment for the next few weeks. Your only 6 days old dear, so it's completely normal for you to nurse, go ahead.\" You then latch on to the nipple closest to you and begin to suckle, feeling warm milk flow into your mouth and down to your stomach. The milk tasted so sweet, you want to keep nursing, but your stomach said otherwise. You then latch off of your mother and your mother smiles and gently picks you up and places you between her fore paws. You make yourself comfortable between your mother's fore paws, as she cleans your wound and gives you a bath.</span></div></div>",

As your vision clears up you see the Alpha male and he looks a whole lot bigger. You also see an expression on his face, which was not a sign of disappointment, but worry and said, \"Thank goodness your awake little one. I was afraid that rock would have put you in a coma.\" (Wait, he can talk? And the last time I was called little one was when I was.....) your thoughts trail off as you look at your body which was now that of a week old wolf pup. You are in a state of shock at what has happened to you. Your arms were now forelegs and your knees were bent the way wolves were of course. Your body was now covered in light gray fur, which matched that of the alpha female, your face was the shape of a wolf's, your ears were now on top of your head and you had grown a tail, definitely telling you that you were no longer human in any shape or form. You look at the alpha male and he beats you to the punch, \"Relax little one, I know that you are surprised at what's happening, but this is a blessing. Your one of us now and will have much easier time walking on all fours now. I know the pack and my mate will be pleased to see their newest member in his new body.\" \"Well what position will I have in the pack, am I the new omega?\" you ask. \"If you were an omega, you would have been trained by the omega pair. So no, your an alpha. By the way my name is Strongmoonand and my mate Winterwind is the one who found you. She couldn't bare the thought of leaving you there to die, or to let us feast on you so we took you in. We were surprised that you had some wolf in you. My mate and I want to become your parents and our pups are looking forward to a new brother. You just haven't seen them yet since you were asleep before they were and woke up after they did. We should be heading back to the den before it gets dark. The Mountain can be dangerous at night for pups your age Nanokami,\" he replies. He had called you Nanokami and you went with it since you can't remember anything from your human life, even your own name. You then say, \"I can't make it back on foot. I think I may have sprained my leg, it really hurts.\" \"Well I'm not too surprised that it did after you had hit that boulder, so I will carry you back to the den. We're going to have to let that heal for a few days, so no rough play with you siblings,\" He says in a fatherly tone. \"Yes dad,\" you reply making him smile at the fact that you were already accepting them as your family. He proceeds to grab you by the back of your neck and picks you up. Your body goes numb and you cant move as he carries you back to the den. You figure that this makes it easier or the parents to carry their pups so that they don't put up a fight. Right now you didn't want to fight back, you'd rather have him carry you back then have to limp all the way back. Once you are back at the den....</span></div></div>",

Arya, Nyla, What do you think?\" he asks. \"I agree,\" Says Nyla. \"Yeah, I don't want to leave our new brother out of all the fun,\" Arya says kindly. \"Well playing will have to wait little ones. It's time for dinner and then bed time. It's been a long day,\" She says. \"Awwww,\" you all say in unison. This makes your mother giggle as she heads down to have her fill. Once she is finished she comes up and lays on her side to let the four of you nurse. You all have your fill, then your mother says, \"Bedtime little ones.\" \"But mom,\" Nyla says and the four of you yawn. \"We wanna stay up,\" Arya adds.

Nanokami, I need you to stay awake for just a little while longer. We need to make a splint for your leg,\" he says as your siblings pass out, and you were on the verge yourself but your mom quickly nudges you. \"Put out your leg Nanokami,\" your mom says.

You smile and ask, \"So you were only a few days when he took you out for your test?\" \"Two days ago actually so your not too far behind,\" he says. \"Mom's back guy's,\" Northwind says and you all turn your heads to see your mom walking up. She soon lays on her side and signals you to go ahead and drink. Your siblings proceed to suckle, but you are a little hesitant to do so since you've never had wolf's milk before and were new to the pack. Your mom soon nuzzles you and says, \"Go ahead honey, your part of the family now, and you need this nourishment for the next few weeks.\" She then picks you up gently and places you close to one of her nipples. You then start to suckle and feel warm, nourishing milk enter your mouth and flow down your throat. The milk was sweeter then you could have imagined and you keep nursing till you feel full. You then let out a burp and are about to say \"excuse me\" when your siblings proceed to burp as well. You all laugh as does your mother as your dad walks up with twigs and vines in his mouth and drops them and says, \"What did I miss that was so funny?\" \"Our pups just had some gas dear. They couldn't hold it in. But can you blame them? Their only a week old dear,\" Your mom says. He replies, \"That they are dear. Nanokami, I need you to hold you leg out for me.\" You then put your leg out slowly to not feel so much pain and then your dad starts to make a splint for it. You yelp a little as the splint tightens around your leg. \"It's almost over sweetheart. We know it hurts, shhhh,\" your mom says, and you breath deeply as you try to hold back your tears while your father mends your leg. Finally your dad finishes and you have shed a few tears. Your mother says as she nuzzles you close to her, \"It's alright to cry dear. You were in pain, but you were very brave to take the pain.\" \"I'll say, I nearly screamed when they were mending mine,\" your brother says making you smile. \"Well, it's time for bed little ones,\" your mom says. \"Aww, but mom,\" Northwind says as you all yawn. \"We're not ti...mmmmm,\" you all say in unison before passing out cold. Your mom smiles and says to your dad as you sleep, \"Not tired huh? Seems to me all them had too much fun for one day.\" your dad replies,\"That or your milk made them sleepy, you know how mother's milk sometimes has that affect at night. Seems it outdid them this time.\" They both smile and place all of you next to your mother. The rest of the pack (aside from the ones on patrol) soon fall asleep as do your parents.</span></div></div>",

You look back at the alpha female who beats to the punch with the question you were about to ask and said, \"I know what your question is little one, your wondering what happened to you, correct?\" You nod your head in reply and wait for the answer. \"Well, you've been out for 2 days after you were thrown into the river.

Your head took a good blow from that boulder in the river so we need you to take it easy for a few days. Once I've had my fill, I'll let you nurse dear,\" she says, and with that she walk off and dug in with your new dad. You waited there patiently having a feeling if you tried to get up and walk you would pass out or make the pack angry. As you waited you thought that this would be the first time in a long time that you had mother's milk, let alone that it would be wolf's milk this time and not human milk, but you weren't complaining. You hadn't had anything to eat or drink in two days as far as you knew. You probably had some of her milk unconsciously, but you still were very hungry and thirsty, so having her milk would satisfy both needs. As soon as she finished eating she came up to your families resting place and laid on her side next to you and let you start nursing. As you suckle off one of her nipples, you feel warm nourishing milk flowing into your mouth and down your throat. The milk was sweeter than anything you remember tasting and kept nursing until you were full. Once you finish nursing, your mother then picks you up and places you between her forepaws again, proceeding to give you a bath. \"How much cleaner can I get mom?\" you joke. You both laughing and she says in a joking tone, \"Well I can't have my son looking dirty if any girls come by tomorrow to say hi. Oh, I almost forgot my manners. My name is Winterwind and my mate's name is Strongmoon. And yes, you can still call us mom and dad, oh and you have a brother named Yuma who will also take over leadership once your father and I can no longer lead. We figure two Alpha pairs leading after we're gone is better than one, but no need to worry about that right now. Your brother's playing with the other pups right now but should be up in a little bit since it is almost time for bed. You should probably get a jum pstart on that dear. You need a lot more rest if you want to feel better.\" You didn't argue with her since she was your mother after all, and also due to the fact that she's three times bigger than you are, so she can easily overpower you. All you say is, \"Okay mom.\" and you soon fall asleep between her forelegs. She gently places you to her side so she wouldn't wake you up and your brother comes to lay next to you. Soon everyone is asleep.</span></div></div>",

As your vision clears up you see the alpha male running towards you and now looks a whole lot bigger to you due to the fact that you are smaller now, but why was he running to you? Was actually worried about you? You had just failed the swim test so you don't see why he would be worried. Maybe wolves weren't as savage as you were led to believe. As soon as he reaches you he asks \"Are you alright Nanokami? I'm sorry didn't grab you before you fell, but the current was to fast.\" He called you Nanokami, that must have been what the pack called you while you were human, you stuck with it since you can't remember your old name. You say \"I'm fine, just a little shaken from the fall. I do want to know how I became a wolf though if it's not too rude to ask.\" \"Well most humans that have come to this mountain don't make it through the first night, but the few who have turn into wolves some time during the next day. Your transformation took place after the fall it seems. I hope you can forgive me for not pulling you out,\" He says. You reply \"It's alright, I'm sorry I couldn't swim.\" \"Well I can teach you another day but we have to get back to the den. I'm sure everyone wants to see how their newest pack member is doing. Oh, where are my manners. My name is Strongmoon and may mates name is Winterwind. We are going to be your new parents. Now, lets start getting back,\" he finishes. You get up and start to follow him, but as soon as you take your first step, you feel a sharp pain in your right foreleg and fall back down yelping in pain. Your dad immediately notices and comes back to you and asks, \"What's wrong son?\" You reply \"My leg, it hurts. I think I sprained it.\" With that he says, \"Then I'll carry you back home we're going need to let that heal for a few days.\" He then grabs you by the back of your neck and your body goes limp. You can't move a muscle. You guess this is every pups Achilles heal, and let him carry you. You can't really complain, it's better then having to walk all the way back with an injured leg and he could easily overpower you. And with that you head back toward the den.</span></div></div>",

Then another pup who seems to be a week older than everyone else comes up and starts to bully you saying, \"So Nanokami, how does it feel not to be able play like everyone else around here? You seem to be too weak to even hold yourself up. You will never make a good leader.\" \"Leave our brother alone Hayate,\" Your brother and sister say trying to defend you. You were a little suprised at this. \"See, can't even defend yourself.\" \"I can defend myself just fine Hayate. You know, instead of bullying everyone to try and make yourself look superior, maybe you should try and make freinds with everyone,\" you say \"Yah, get to know them better than you already do,\" Nyla adds. \"I think you would find it alot easier and it might be helpful to you in the future,\" Talcain finishes. Hayate is at a loss for words by your statements and  everyone else is amazed and smiles at the 3 of you.

I think I'll try doing what you said.\" \"Good, so you want to hang out with us?\"  You ask. All the pups look at you in confusion for a second while your siblings know what your doing but then everyone else catches on to what is happening. \"Sure, but, what can we do? I don't want to be rude, but I know I can't be too rough with you since you sprained your leg. How is it feeling by the way?\" he asks. Your all suprised at his sudden change of heart but go with it and say, \"Better, but it still hurts too much to walk on it.\" \"Sorry about acting like a bully, but I thought everyone would respect me if they thought I was tough.\" \"It's okay, come on lets play,\"  you reply. For the rest of the day everyone plays with you make sure they aren't too rough. At the end of the day once everyone had their dinner and you and your siblings finished nursing, your mother says, \"I am proud of you 3 today pups. It was very noble what you did. You all turned a bully into a friend and that is a true mark of leadership. I think the 3 of you will work well together in the future. Don't let anyone tell you different.\" She then licks the 3 of you and everyone says goodnight and you all fall asleep.

You were a natural, and your dad says \"Your doing great pups, keep at it.\" Just then, you see one of the pups, Northwind, struggling and swim over to help her. Just before you got to her, Northwind's head went under. You then trust your instincts and dive under to help her back up to the surface. Once your heads were above water, you were both coughing and have Northwind get on your back and start to swim to shore, but you were having trouble keeping your head above water and were starting to swallow water and drown when you feel something underneath your body. It was your dad he had gotten you on to his back saying, \"Hang on Pups,\" and brought the two of you back to shore. You both were still coughing up water once you are on shore and you then look at your dad, you felt you had disappointed him, but he was smiling. He says, \"Nanokami, I'm impressed. You just started learning how to swim and were doing a good job, then you make an attempt to save Northwind. That is a very noble act, I'm very proud of you.\" \"Yeah thanks for helping to save me,\" Northwind says. \"Well, I don't think I ever would have gone in if Hayate hadn't boosted my confidence, thanks Hayate,\" you say. He replies, \"Anytime Nanokami.\" \"You know, I wasn't the only one going to help Northwind. I saw the rest of you swimming towards her. It's nice to know that everyone looks out for one another,\" you say trying not to take all the glory. They all smile and tour dad says, \"Come on pups we best be getting back to the den. I need to help with the noon hunt and I think you've had enough excitement away from home today.\" And with that you start walking back. Northwind nuzzles your chin while your walking and then licks you. You were a little shocked by her gesture but politely nuzzle and lick back. Hayate walks up next to you as Northwind pads farther up and he says, \"I think Northwind has a crush on you Nanokami. And I think you feel the same way, don't you?\" \"How could ya tell?\" You ask. \"I saw the way you were looking at her. It's was a little obvious,\" he says. You blush and wonder if you should talk to your dad about it. Right now you were just wanting to get back to the den.</span></div></div>",

Your brother says, \"Hey Nanokami, you know we're not jelious. Saving her was instinct, not showing off. I saw the worry in your eyes when she was in trouble. If you had done it to show off, then we would be angry. Your not that kind of wolf bro. And if it's not to rude to say, I think you and Northwind are a cute pair.\" You blush and say, \"Thanks Talcain, you know I'm too young to be setting my eyes on girls though.\" \"Hey what's that suppose to mean?\" Nyla sarcasticly asks, and you all laugh. Your father returns after talking with the grown-ups and says, \"Well what's so funny? Have I missed something? Don't be keeping secrets from your dad now.\" \"We were just talking about Nanokami and Northwind, dad,\" Talcain says. \"Don't you think they make a cute pair?\" Nyla asks. Your father says, \"Well I think your all too young to know what love is yet but we'll see what happens with Nanokami and Northwind once their older.

You should try and get some sleep dear, you've had a big day. And don't worry about could have happened.

You are about to pounce on your target when you hear something coming and you turn your attention to it. A moose had entered the training grounds and was staring at you. Your dad says, \"Do not run or he'll charge.\" You hold your ground as the moose stairs at you and you think of what to do if he does charge. Soon you have to act because he is coming towards you. Your siblings want to help but your dad stops them and says, \"He has to figure it out on his own pups.\" Your dad said not to run but you had to do something. Then you remember what your dad had told you a few days ago about moose's having a hard time turning sharply while charging. Your dad saw that you knew what to do and waited for you to take action. As it charges you, you take a stance and say in your mind (Wait for it. Wait for it. NOW!) at that moment you jump to your right and do a somersalt role. The moose runs for a little while more, giving you and your family enough time to retreat into the trees. Your father then says, \"Well done Nanokami. How did you know to duck out of the way in time?\" \"Well, I remember what you said a few days ago about moose's and used that knowledge to my advantage. That's why I did what I did because if I had run before hand it would have kept following me,\" you reply. \"I'm impressed bro. I never would have thought of that. But don't let it go to your head,\" Talcain says. \"Don't worry I won't. Besides I'm sure there much more to learn than how to dodge a charging moose,\" you reply. \"That's for sure. Maybe we should start heading back. What do you think dad?\" Nyla asks. Your dad replies, \"I think that's a good idea you all trained hard today and you've all had enough excitement for one day.\" The three of you smile and head for the den.</span></div></div>",

Once there, your mother says \"Now don't be scared little ones, but there is another pack outside that wants to take over our territory, and I have feeling we have run into them before. But don't worry, we're safe, our pack is too strong to back down and will not let them take the territory.

You then hear him say, \"This is the last time I will let your pack walk away with your lives. Next time you are in our territory, the punishment is death. You should realize after your first attempt that my pack is too strong and too fit for your pack to defeat. If you value your lives I suggest you leave now.\" The pack then left and your father walks in with the kill and the rest of the pack and you and your siblings go to greet him. After he drops the kill he then nuzzles all of you and says, \"Hey pups, how's your leg feeling Nanokami? Hope it's healing fine.\" \"Well I played a little more roughly then I should have this morning, so I hope it didn't get worse by much.\" you say as you look at your leg, which had a thick branch and some vines on it to be used for a splint now since your parents had put it on you while you were asleep. \"Well, as long as you didn't play to the point where you made your leg hurt or the splint break, it should have done little damage. I do want you to take it easy for the rest of the day though, so Talcain, Aria, Nyla don't be wrestling around today, I want you all to find a game to play that won't involve running and wrestling, but for now let your mom feed you after she has her fill,\" he says. \"Yes Dad,\" you all reply. You wait to nurse from your mother and then a question hits you and you ask her before the 4 of you nurse, \"Mom, why does that pack want the territory so bad?\" You all wait for her answer and she says, \"Well for one Nanokami, the leader of that pack is bent on controlling all the territories on the mountain, and for another, Our territory is bountiful in food and forest protection for the pack. That pack's leader has made many attempts on other packs but has failed and all the other packs know that we're too powerful for them to conquer, so they don't dare attack. The only territory that he can set foot into other than his own is his brother's territory. His brother doesn't share his lust for power and knows better though, but it is nothing for you to worry about little ones. Your safe, and that's what matters. Now It's time for breakfast pups.\" With that, the four of you latch on and star to suckle, and this time the milk doesn't make you dose off.</span></div></div>",

You get down and back off a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some rest little one, you'll have a lot to learn tomorrow.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sleepy, but you agree to lie down. You lay awake until the silent night grows darker, and you decide to close your eyes. You can tell its darker even though there is little to no light in the cavern room already. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few hours pass, and your eyes shoot open. You began shaking violently, shivering from a temperature so cold you can't imagine what is is. You can see your breath, and your clothes aren't helping at all. You look towards the wolf, and notice that she is awake as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cold, are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold your shoulders tightly, and nod your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come lie down next to me,\" she tells you, \"Don't worry, I won't harm you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't really want to put full trust in her just yet, but you do so, making sure to approach her on all fours. You snuggle up beside her, her fur amazingly warm and snug. You can't help but get warmer as you lie against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it so cold?\" you finally ask.<br>\r\n\"Not to worry little one,\" she replies giving a suspicious grin, \"You'll just have to wait a week or so until your fur coat finally grows in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely confused by the statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean by that?\" you stutter.<br>\r\n\"All in due time, little one...\" she replies softly, \"All in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gently licks your cheek, and you can't help but feel comfortable and fall straight asleep. The wolf smirks as your eyes shut closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you're sound asleep, thoughts continue to run through your mind. What did she mean by her all of her statements? What was to become of you? Better yet, why could you understand this wolf? Maybe it isn't just her... </span></div></div>",

Then as an afterthought you said, \"Mommy.\" By the time you said that you had reached the end of the tunnel and were now in the main cavern.

Your mother walked behind you and gave your rear a light nudge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Nanokami, don't feel shy,\" your mother says. \"You'll meet them soon enough, but right now we need to go see the Alphas.\" You nodded and walked up beside her as she continued to the raised platform near the far end of the cave. When you got to a small set of stone stairs your mother ran ahead up the steps. You were about to follow her when you looked at the steps and saw they were nearly your height a piece. Your mother was almost halfway up when she noticed you weren't following her and she began to walk back down to you.

Do understand Nanokami?\" You nod your head,  and the alpha male  nods back in aproval. \"Now if you'll excuse me I must help with the hunt tonight,\" he says. You kneal once more as he takes his leave, and he nods back.

Your not going crazy, your one of us now,\" The alpha male says. you look at yourself and see your body is no longer human, but a five day old wolf pup. \"How did this happen? Not to sound ungrateful or anything,\" you say. \"No, it's fine to ask that question. When I found you out there, I knew you wouldn't last long without proper care. It would have been a crime to leave you, so when we brought you here, I was going to feed you some milk earlier last night but you ran off. We knew you would come back and were glad that you came back okay, but we had to be strict and that's why my mate Strongmoon scratched you yesterday. Once night came, that's when you transformed. Your part of the pack now and part of our family. Oh, my name's Winterwind by the way and we have decided to call you Nanokami.

You turn your head to see the voice belonged to the alpha female, and she looked bigger then when you saw her last night (like three times your size). This makes you look at yourself and you see that you are no longer human, but a wolf pup (5 or 6 days old by the looks of it). You finally look at the alpha female speechless at what happened to you. She then says, \"Relax little one, I know that your confused, but this is a blessing dear.\" \"Wh-what happened to me, n-not to sound ungrateful,\" you say nervously. She replies, \"No, I know you have many questions and they will be answered. You have been brought to this pack for a reason. When I found you out there in the forest, badly injured and nearly unable to move, I felt you needed my help, call it maternal instinct if you want. I decided to bring you back to the pack and take care of you, I knew full well that you would become one of us. Once I brought you back to the den, I talk to my mate Strongmoon about taking you in and he agreed. The pack soon came in with the kill and once I had my fill, I was going to bring you some meat, but you were gone. I knew you would come back eventually and if not we would have sent a search party to find you. Once you came back to the den unharmed everyone was happy to see you, but my mate had let everyone know he is still in command, that's why he scratched your face yesterday.\" You rub your cheek with your paw and say, \"Yeah, that one I deserved, not sure how I got the rest of my injuries from yesterday though. In fact I can't remember anything before you finding me, not even my own name.\" She replies, \"Well I don't Know how you were injured either, but Your memories of your human life before being found by us have faded. We have decide to call you Nanokami. Oh, and my name is Winterwind, but you can call me mom and Strongmoon dad. I'm sure your hungry little one, so come have some of my milk. Your going to need this kind of nourishment for the next month or so.\" You soon latch on to one of her nipples, because she was right, you were hungry and are not old enough to have meat. You begin to suckle fast and your mom says you slow down, \"Slowly dear, sloowly. that's it dear, if you drink too fast you'll get a stomach ache.\" You had slowed down your drinking by this time and were enjoying your meal, the milk had tasted sweeter then anything you had ever imagined, and you wanted to keep drink, but knew eventually you'd have to stop. You mother licks you as you suckle and then says, \"Drink as much as you need dear. Looks like I'll have eat a little more of the kills we get since I'm providing for two now.\" You give a slight chuckle as you nurse, but feel a little embarrassed that you have to depend on her and the pack for food and protection, but hey, better to have their love and protection then to be torn to shreds by them. They were your new family and pack, and they will do whatever they can to guarantee your safety while you grow.</span></div></div>",

Finally, your feet are in his mouth, which he licks for just a moment before taking one last, huge GULP! The finally bulge in his throat sinks into his massive belly, stretched taut in front of him. He groans in a pleasured manner, obviously enjoying your movements as his paws caress his large, fluffy dome of a gut; his stomach bloated so full that he was on the verge of bursting with you, his tongue hanging out of his maw as he pants happily.</span></div></div>",

Your transformation is progressing nicely. You now have fangs, night vision, excellent hearing and smell, and your nails have been replaced by claws.\" That explained a lot, it seemed that you were transforming rapidly but not to fast. The Alpha female then says \"It's time for you to nurse again little one.\" And with that you start to nurse and this time you start to shrink a bit to match the size of a three or four day old pup. and you had fur all over your body, aside from your face. After you were full, the alpha female says, \"Just three more days son, and you will be a fully fledged wolf.\" \"Is it alright if I call you mom? I mean you've been taking care of me and I'm truly grateful. But I can understand if you don't want to have me as a son, I understand,\" you say. She smiles and says, \"My mate Strongmoon and I have decided to make you our son dear, so yes. My name is Winterwind by the way, and we have decided to call Nanokami little one. Your memories of your life before finding us have fade including the memory of your name. Now I know you just woke up but it is time for bed dear. The pack will be eager to see you tomorrow and you need your rest dear.\" You do as she says and for some reason it felt like you hadn't slept in ages, and fall asleep on the spot.

Then came the first of the wolves that were dragging the beast into the open area. Then pushing from the rear were a few more wolves. And in the center of that few was a large grey wolf. \"Papa!\" Aria exclaimed as the hunters hoisted their kill up onto the stone table used for eating. As soon as the meat was up everyone stepped back and let the Alpha male and female eat first. All but you and your brothers and sister, who run forward underneath your mom and dad. You and Kai stopped between your dads forepaws, and Hayate and  Aria between your mom's. Everyone chuckled at the sight of the Year old pups romping around before dinner beneath their parents. Even your mom and dad chuckle before bending down to break through the skin in front of their children so that you can eat. You dig in stuffing your little puppy face until your absolutly bloated. Your brothers and sisters lay down just as you do and curl up into a ball with your tail wrapped around you. Your parents take a little longer eating having bigger stomachs, but as they finish and the beta pair come in, and so on, your eyelids slowly close as you drift off to sleep with a full stomach and happy heart. What seems like seconds later, a rough nudge on your side wakes you up. You open your eyes quickly and see your father standing tall above you. You close your eyes and make a whinning noise to show your displeasure. Behind you, your mom heaved a sigh. \"Sayaka, would you and Hakuo mind helping us with the kids?\" \"Of course Genarius. Hakuo, come over here.\" called the soft voice of the beta female. Sayaka and Hakuo were pretty much imediate family. In fact, you and your siblings actually reffer to them as Auntie Sayaka and Uncle Hakuo. Their footfalls were heard as they walked over to you and your family. You heard a small yelp as Hayate was lifted up. Then a second later you felt the rough grip of your father on the back of your neck. You whinned some more as you opened your eyes. Your paws dangled limply below you  and the skin on your neck wrinkled up where your dad held his grip on your neck. Your siblings were being carried up the stairs to your family's den by three other large gray wolves. You wanted to fight back and get your dad to realese you, but this position was a pups achillis heel, you literally couldn't move from this point.  Even if you could, your dad could overpower you without even trying. So you grumpily let him continue. In front of you the crowd of wolves parted like butter as Lord Nero brought one of the packs four only pups up to bed. After you are set down next to your bros and sis on your fur bed, you say good night to your parents and your aunt and uncle, you and your siblings snuggle really close together and drift of into sleep again.</span></div></div>",

If you could go and hunt something down now, and suprise dad in the morning, he'd let you hunt! You jumped up with excitment and ran in a circle. Kai woke up next to you. \"Hhmm, waddayadoin?\" he mumbled  groggily. \"I'm going hunting, promise not to tell! Please!\" you begged him. \"Hhmm surewaddeva.\" he slurred as he rolled over and fell asleep again. You were so excited as you ran down your stairs to the center cave, that you accidently slipped and performed a sumersault over yourself just like a puupy. You ran happily as you left the center cave for the first time. You managed to find your way outside, the sun was just coming up as you started walking around. You never thought of this, but you had no idea where to start. As day truely started and the sun rose, you decided to call it in and go back inside. You turned and ran straight into a large strong, furry leg and did a backwards sumersault and landed in the sitting position. Slowly you looked up to your father's furious face. \"Kai leaked?\" you guessed. Your dad nodded and growled deeply as he stepped foreward towards you. You cried and rolled onto your back in the grass and assumed the submissive position, hoping it would help. Seeming to read your mind, your dad replied \"You sure are smart with that move.\" through gritted teeth. Your ears dropped as he picked you up and turned to walk back inside the cave. You noticed that he wasn't as gentile as he usualy is, like now he was trying to get you to yell uncle. As you and your escourt entered the center cave every wolf sighed in relief. Your mom ran forward as your dad dropped you between his paws. \"Clear out!\" he barked out powerfully. Instantly the room was cleared for all but your family. You opened your mouth to explain, but your mom cut you off sternly. \"Kai already told us everything.\" you closed your mouth as your ears dropped, and you shrank down slowly. \"Nanokami, we will have to punish you for this, and we've decided to...   </span></div></div>",

That was when you started crying. Your dad bent down and picked you up by the neck again. You sister then started crying and buried her face into Hayate's side. As you were hoisted up, dad bit down hard, but easily not as hard as he could. But still, with your sensitive skin and his sharp teeth, it did pop four holes in the back of your neck where his sharpest teeth were. He dropped you from the height you were at, which was actually pretty high to you. You bawled your eyes out as you hit the ground hard. \"No meat for you tonight, go to the den. Now!\" your dad boomed at you. After hearing him yell like that, you didn't have to be told again. Still crying, you scampered off and ran up the stair/ramp that lead up to the Alpha den in the side of the cave. You buried your face in your fur bed and cried. Hours later, after everyone had eaten dinner, and you were starving, Kai walked up to you. \"Hey man...how ya doin'?\" he asked insecurely. You didn't answer him. \"Ok, I know your mad at me, but dad made me, look.\" he said. He brought him nose under your head and forced it up, when you looked at him, he was showing you the back of his neck. Punched into his skin, were four little red holes. He turned his head and looked at you. \"I'm sorry.\" he said again, and you forgave him. You both assumed a wrestling position, but before you could start, Hayate and Aria came up. \"Mama says were have to go to bed.\" she said sadly. Normally, all the boys would've complained and stayed up, but after your parents display of anger today, none of you hesitated to get in bed. </span></div></div>",

We would have had to track you down if you hadn't of howled,\" he says. \"Yeah, thanks for getting us help,\" your sister says. your brothers nod in agreement. \"No problem,\"you reply.

You even ran away, nearly getting eating and being injected with a poison that resulted in your overall death. Still, now that you were a wolf, it was as if your sin of being a human in a wolf's world was wiped clean.

You weren't really a playful mood, but you wanted to cheer him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna wrestle?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine,\" he replies, \"You can go and play though. Don't let me ruin your day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince you weren't really too eager to play to begin with you simply get closer and sit yourself down beside him. As you do so, Talkain remembers something your father told the rest of the pack members shortly after you were born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen,\" he had said, \"Nanokami is the human who somehow found his way here and ended up dying. I don't want any of you to give him the slightest hint that he was ever human. He's my son, and should find out by any means other than me or Genarius telling him, or he somehow remembers, I'll personally see to it that you receive a fate far worse than death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was dead serious too, and everyone knew he could back it up. Other wolf packs might look down upon him if they were to find out, but he was the strongest of all of the wolves and nobody would dare question him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suspected Talkain most of all to tell, and on several occasions he wanted to, but Talkain never did. In fact, he noticed how nice he was to you, a kindness that he wasn't actually faking. Talkain was looked upon better for that, and he realized that he might one day escape his cursed rank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe places a paw on your head and rubs it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, little scamp,\" he tells you, \"Go have fun!\"</span></div></div>",

After a few moments, the wolf swallows and sends you down his tight throat, his neck bulging on the outside gradually getting smaller until it disappears behind his ribcage.

The alpha female didn't even speak for she knew you would ask her another question. You ask, \"What happened to me? How did I become a wolf pup?\" \"Well here's the thing dear, once humans come to this mountain they change into wolves. The process is a painful experience and I'm sorry it had to happen right after you had hugged me for comort, and yes I saw the tears in your eyes. There is  no reason to be ashamed for what happened, many humans have reacted the same way when we first found them. The last one sort of freaked out after he saw what happened to him. He ran right out of the den and didn't come back. We found him a few hours later knocked out after running into branch. He tried to run towards the the bottom of the mountain, but the pack has already looked for a way off and it is surrounded by cliffs too steap to climb down, which makes it useless to leave the mountain. Their memories of their past life fade away and they either become one with the pack or journey off on thier own,\" she says. \"And now you have a choice little one,\" the alpha male says, \"You must decide if you will stay or leave. If you stay my mate and have agreed to take you in as our own, but if you leave the pack will not protect you and might even kill you the next time they see you.

This was a chance to start over and know more about wolves then you did as a human. You finally say, \"I've decided I'll stay.

You just go with it and figure this is every pups Achilles' heel. Your mother carries you down from your families resting area and outside of the den where you were greeted by a blinding light making you close your eyes for a split sec trying to adjust. Once your able to see again you see many of the pack members in their own little groups talking. The pups were playing around under the watchful eyes of the grown ups. Some of the grown ups gave a quick glance at you and then returned to talking, probably about you. One of the pups comes up to you and your mother and says, \"Hi aunt Winterwind, is this Nanokami, my new cousin?\" She sets you down as she lays down and says, \"Yes, Nanokami, this is your cousin Hayate. He's been looking forward to meeting you.\" \"Hi Hayate,\" You say. \"Hi Nanokami, how are you feeling? I heard what happened 2 days ago,\" he replies. You seem too have forgotten what really happened and only your mom and dad remember what happened, but you and the rest of the pack remember that you had gone exploring with your parents when a snake had attacked you after you ran ahead of them a little ways and tried to kill you. Luckily your parents got there in time to save you but you had so much air squeezed out of you and your muscles get tightened that you had passed out from the encounter. \"Yeah, that taught me that I should stay closer to my parents. I feel fine, but I think I'll listen to my mom and take it easy today,\" you say as your mother smiles. Hayate replies, \"Well all the other pups were worried about you, myself included, but I had a feeling you would pull through. Do you want me to bring the others over to meet you?\" There were 6 other pups aside from you and Hayate, all seemed to be your age. \"I don't want to stop you guys from playing all day,\" you tell him. \"I already talked to them about it and they think that they could take a break for a day. It's not the end of the world and aunt Winterwind said she had a story about uncle Strongmoon she was gonna tell us,\" Hayate says. He goes to gather the other pups and lets them introduce themselves. You then all listen to your mother's story about your dad and the story takes till nightfall.</span></div></div>",

What seems to be troubling you?\" she asks you. You finish nursing and say \"I'm just thinking about what happened 2 day's ago. I feel like such a weakling not being able to defend myself from that snake.\" \"Your still very young Nanokami, it would have been incredible if you had been able to defeat that snake. Also it only took 2 days for you to be able to wake up from the attack. Most pups your age would have been unconscious for nearly a week, believe me I've seen it. You are not weak at all son, and the entire pack was happy to see you awake today. I don't think you saw but the entire pack was smiling at you when I was carrying you up here, knowing you would be okay. Most of them told me they were impressed at how fast you recovered. When you get older, I'm sure you'll be as strong as your father. Now I think it's time we get some sleep dear,\" your mom says.

Your mother and father had told you their names, which were Strongmoon (your father) and Winterwind (your mother) and said you would soon learn the names of the other pack members. Everyone was impressed with how fast you recovered from the your transformation. You know the pack forgives you for running away but you still feel a sense of guilt putting one of their leaders in harms way. Your mother tells you that it is what the pack does for each other and they considered a part of them as soon as they laid eyes on you and she knows you'd do the same for them if you had the strength and skill to do so. After she gives you a bath you cuddle up beside her and take in her body heat as you sleep soundly through the night. Your parents smile at you before they too fall asleep. The next day you wake up you get up and move a bit which alerts your mother in the process and she sees that your wanting to move around. \"Good morning Nanokami. I see your ready to move about. Maybe you should do a little walking so your muscles don't get stiff. Take one step forward. Good, now another one. That's it your getting it son,\" she says as you start walking around an all fours. You are starting to get used to your wolf body, but you trip over yourself a few times before getting the hang of it which makes you and your mother giggle. The pack has already started to wake up, including your father, who was already gathering volunteers for the morning hunt. You ask your mother, \"Can I try going down to the entrance myself mom?\" \"Of course you can dear, just let me know if you need me to carry you down,\" she kindly replies. \"Thanks mom,\" you say, and you proceed down the step-like rocks. You make it almost half way before tripping over yourself while accidentally running and land with an \"oof\". Your father was watching you and smiled at your effort, even though he knew you would eventually trip. \"Take it easy son. You don't want get ahead of yourself. You'll get the hang of it Nanokami, don't worry,\" your dad says to you as you get to your feet regain your footing. You didn't know the hunting party was watching you and smiling as well at your valiant effort to walk on all fours, knowing all pups at your age are only starting to walk, so it is inevitable you will lose your footing for a little while. The hunting party takes of as you make it down to the entrance and are controlling your footing a little more. You didn't notice your mother had been right behind you in case you would go tumbling down, which you didn't. \"Great job on your first try down the platform honey. Your getting the hang of it a lot faster then most of the other pups your age. Don't feel bad about tripping, it happens to all pups your age, your just starting to walk. We thought you wouldn't be able to walk at all since you just became a wolf pup, but I guess you had a little wolf in you all along. You'll be a great help to the pack once your older Nanokami, but for now I think playing with the other pups is all you will do right now. Your still very young, and training won't be for a while,\" she says to you to help boost your confidence. As you and the rest of the pack head out of the den.....</span></div></div>",

When your vision came into focus again the alpha female and many of the other pack members were surrounding you where you had passed out, and now they looked a whole lot bigger. It was weird but they didn't seem threatening to you anymore, even though they were bigger looking now. Instead they had worried expressions on their faces, which surprised you entirely. You started to roll back onto your belly when the alpha female says, \"Don't try to move little one.\" You are in shock at the fact that she spoke, so you turn your head in her direction as you lay on your side and say, \"You can talk?\" \"Yes, all animals can talk little one. The reason you understand me is that your now one of us,\" she says. You immediately look at your body and yelp in surprise that she was indeed correct, you were a wolf, and at the most, a week old pup. That's why you felt strange and the pack members looked bigger to you. Your age had regressed during your transformation to a week old wolf pup. \"How did this happen? How did I become a wolf?\" you ask. \"We don't know, your the first human that has passed through here in the last five years, maybe it has something to do with the mountain. Maybe heaven has a plan for you. Either way we need to get you back to the den, It's late at night and the forest can pretty dangerous for a pup your age dear.\" The alpha female then picks you up by the back of your neck and carries you back to the den. Your body has gone numb and you can't move a muscle, making it useless to try and fight back, but hey, you weren't complaining. The pack seems to want to help you, not hurt you, and so you continue to let her carry you. Once you reached the den the alpha female placed you down lightly and went to talk to her mate. You stayed where you were, terrified that if you moved from where you were they would punish you or worse, kill you. As soon as the alpha pair finishes talking they walk up to you and the alpha female says, \"Do remember where you were before the mountain little one? We're curious.\" You try to think of where you were and draw to a blank. You can't remember anything before the alpha female finding you, your home, your friends and family, you can't even remember your own name. You shook your head in disappointment of yourself. She replies, \"We thought so. You see one of the elders say they had seen the same thing happen to the last human who passed through here. The young wolves you see here were either really young or not even born at that time. They don't know how it happened, but the human had begun life over again at two weeks old, a week older then you. He was raised as one of us and became a beta in his adulthood to the end of his life, so we recon the same thing has happened to you and will happen to other humans in the future. Now we know you may want to leave again, but we can't allow it. Your too young to fend for yourself. My mate Strongmoon and I have talked it over and we have agreed that we will adopt you and you will become our son and brother to our other three pups. That is if you would like to be part of our family.\" You see her three pups pop out from behind her, they seem to be your age and stare at you with welcoming eyes. You are taken away by this offer and want to accept it but won't this make other pups jealous of you. You look around and see only one other pup who was female sitting in front of the beta female, so your guess is that is her daughter. You then weigh out your options and say, \"Thank you for your offer. I will accept it, I really have no where else to go, but what is my name going to be? I know you don't want to keep calling me little one, and I really don't remember my old one.\" \"Well how does Nanokami sound?\" asked the alpha male. \"Sounds great to me. Has a ring to it.\" Everyone laughs, including yourself. \"I'm sorry for running off and putting you in danger,\" you say lowering your head. The alpha female walks up and nuzzles you while saying, \"It's alright Nanokami, none of us were hurt and I'm sure if it were another human, they would have reacted the same way you had if they had seen a pack of wolves. And I know that you wouldn't purposely harm any of us. It was an honest mistake. I saw the tears in your eyes before you hugged me for comfort. I sort of felt like you were one of my own pups at that moment. That is why I made you that offer, and I'm glad you accepted it. By the way, I'm Winterwind, but you can call me mother and Strongmoon father since you are our son now.\" You smile at her feeling relieved to have that burden lifted off your chest, nod your head in reply and nuzzle her back as a thanks.</span></div></div>",

Why?\" \"Well, being a mother already, it was maternal instinct that told me to protect you. I wouldn't have done if I hadn't felt something for you. You were helpless in that situation, just like a pup would be, and it would have been a crime not to save you. And now look, You can start over life with your new family. We will love you and protect you with all our hearts Nanokami,\" she replies. \"I thought you would have made me the lowest rank for what I did, it wasn't right for me to leave.

We are surrounded by trees in every direction, so if you go beyond the first set of trees the punishment extends and becomes more strict, like not even leaving the den at all.\" You agree to her terms and are relieved she wouldn't do something physical to you.

At this rate, you are to weak to utter much protest, and this seems to urge him to hurry up, as he makes short process with both your small and large intestines, only dropping the pace to savour your liver. Your belly is next, eaten together with your last meal, before your kidneys are eaten by the more and more satisfied fox. When he pauses to look down on your ribcage you are only dimly aware of your surroundings, and as if wanting to waste no more time, his strong jaws crack the ribs to get to your liver and heart.

Kalia tells you that once a great wizard once lived in the forest, and he lived in the secret place she'll take you.  The wizard died (or moved away) a long time ago.  The place has several magical spells still working, and one of these spells prevents anyone else from finding you if you're in this special place.

You didn't know where you were or why you were there, but you knew your mommy would tell you. \"Mommy, where am I,\" you cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Nanokami,\" Genarius said. \"And what do you mean, you're at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Home,\" you ask. You can't remember what or where your home is. The only thing you remember is your name, your mother, and that you were a wolf, always have been and always will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes Nanokami, you're at home. Don't you remember?\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I only remember my name, you, and that I'm a wolf.\" Genarius smiled, the toxin the snake injected\u00a0had left him entirely open to suggestion. He now had no memories except what others would tell him.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh honey, you're probably still fuzzy from the fall. You got a nasty hit on the head when you fell from that rock yesterday. Now come on, it's time to eat.\" With that you walk off to greet the pack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Weeks Later:<br>\r\nYou had met everyone in the pack and most of them had accepted you as one of their own, though some were skeptical at first. Any leftover memories of being anything but a wolf had faded into oblivion. You were wrestling with a wolf named Nero, Fang's younger brother, and being sorely beaten. You were on your back when he put his paw on you and laughed. \"Ah, are you that weak, or do you just love losing to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Nero,\" you growl. \"Just because I keep losing doesn't mean that I'm weak! Besides, you're like three times my size.\" You were right, he was three times bigger than you and only a few months older. In fact, you were hardly as big as the largest newborn pup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, ha, ha, don't you get it, you are weak! Even newborn pups can beat you in a wrestling match!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! You're a mean wolf!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, go cry to your mommy you big baby! You don't deserve to call yourself a wolf! You don't even look like a wolf! You....\" Angela nipped on his tail to shut him up. No one was allowed to tell Nanokami that he was a fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up! I hate you! I hate you!\" You run as fast as you can away from him and run into your cavern to see your parents asleep. You run onto your bed and cry over what had happened. You look down and see the fur that looked like yours and you began to cry louder and harder, remembering how Nero said you didn't look like a wolf.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a loud grunt and see your parents wake up and stretch themselves out. Your mommy nudges your daddy, Salas, and he\u00a0looked at you and asked, \"Why are you crying, Nanokami?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nero made fun of me,\" you cry. \"He made fun of my size and how he always beats me at wrestling, and then he said I didn't deserve to call myself a wolf! He said I didn't look like a wolf! He said a newborn could beat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't listen to them son. They're just picking on you because they're jealous of your fur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is my fur so different? I don't like it. I want gray fur like everyone else.\"\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, you're a special wolf. Your fur makes you more special than the other wolves, like how Angela has black fur on the tip of her tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why is there fur like mine on your my bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is from a fox, sweetie,\" your mommy says. \"They're mean animals that like to make themselves look like special wolves like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Foxes are bad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the worst.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6 Months Later:<br>\r\nYou're wrestling with your friend Kai when you hear a rustling in the bushes to your right where you saw...</span></div></div>",

You start to wake up, but you hear Fang say, \"I don't care what Salas says, that thing is not a wolf, and it will never be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up crying at the nightmare you'd just experienced. Your cries attract Angela and she walks over to you and starts to nuzzle and lick you affectionately. \"What's the matter Nanokami?

The only exposed areas were completely bare. You look at it and it appears to be sleeping. \"Kai, what is that thing,\" you ask curiously.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen one of these before.

You find yourself in a ordinary-looking forest, nothing seems out of place. You wonder how you got where you are, unable to remember anything that happened to you. You are a High-School student, age 14. You feel horrible, covered in scrapes and bruises, your clothes torn up. You are down on the ground, belly up in the dirt. You hear a strange sound, a growl of some sort, and look up. In front of you, you spot what looks like a fox. It has orange-red fur on the top, white on the bottom and paws, and black accents. However, something is different about it. It's large; you could tell it was a kit, but it appeared to be the size of a full grown fox. You try to move, but your body is too sore to do so. You look on in fear as the fox slowly approaches you. It comes to your side, and nudges its nose against your crotch. Even through your thick blue jeans, you feel the wet, cold nose. The fox is trying to determine your gender.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it doesn't feel anything, it takes a few steps back and then growls something. There was another growl and a large, gray timber wolf came into view. Its back reached your mid chest. The two growled at each other for several seconds before the wolf ran off into the forest, leaving you and the fox in the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox walked up and laid down next to you. It was then that you and the fox noticed a large gash on your forehead that was spewing blood. The fox got up and began to lick the wound. You begin to think it's going to eat you, but when it ceased licking you put your hand up to the cut and felt that it had stopped bleeding.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh in relief that the fox was friendly and manage to sit yourself up. The fox plopped itself down beside you and looked up at you. You smile softly and begin to scratch the fox behind his ears. \"I don't suppose you could tell me where I am, could you,\" you say to no one in particular.

She continued for another five minutes before she heard a loud rustling and several large wolves, each almost twice your size, came through the brush and approached you.<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\nNanomami's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you had told Kai to go and get your parents, you had padded up to the human and sat down next to it. You laid there for a moment before you looked the human in the face and saw a large gash was spewing blood at an alarming rate. Deciding you had to help the human, you leaped onto its chest and began to lick the wound as your mother had done with you on several occasions.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the wound had stopped bleeding, you had laid back down and looked up at the human as it sat up and turned to you. It put her hand down and began to scratch you behind your ear. It was a new sensation, but was an extremely enjoyable one and you found yourself melting under her gentle touch. The human began making several noises, obviously trying to communicate with you. You could swear that for a moment you had understood what she was trying to say, but you quickly dismissed the idea. \"What are you saying,\" you asked.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human simply sighed and resumed stroking and scratching you. You just laid there in pure ecstasy for several minutes before you heard a loud rustle and your parents, the beta pair; who you and your siblings called Auntie Sayaka and Uncle Hakuo, Angela and Campari, and your brothers, Kai and Hayate, as well as your sister Aria.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father looked at you and the human and gave off a menacing growl at the human. The human instantly stopped stroking you and backed away quickly. \"Nanokami,\" he roared. \"Get away from that human this instant!\" You whimpered slightly at your father's ferocity and instantly retreated behind your mother's forelegs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salas, calm down,\" your mother barked, \"You're scaring Nanokami!\" Your mother turned to you and gave you a few reassuring licks before soothingly saying, \"It's alright Nanokami, daddy's just a bit on edge today. Why don't you head on back home with Auntie and Uncle, we'll be there in a little while, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShyly you nod and your Auntie Sayaka walks behind you and lifted you up in her teeth by the scruff of your neck. You look back at the frightened human and gave a small whine as she finally disappeared from your view and you headed home.<br>\r\n****************************************************<br>\r\nGirl's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look as several wolves came into the clearing and look at you and the fox for a moment. Then the largest wolf crouches close to the ground and released an ear shattering growl directed at you. You take your hand off of the fox and quickly back away. The large wolf turns its head towards the fox and growls at it for a few moments before the fox whimpered slightly and ran behind the third largest wolf.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf it hid behind turned and growled at the largest wolf and licked the fox and gave a few soft whines. Then the fox appeared to nod at what the wolf was saying and the other wolves walked towards the fox and one lifted it up in its teeth and walked they all padded\u00a0away, leaving you alone with the largest and third largest wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two wolves turned to each other and began to growl at each other for almost ten minutes. Finally, the smaller of the two walked up to the largest and began to lick it affectionately. You had concluded that the two were mates. The male turned and walked behind you. You felt its tongue drag across the back of your neck and its jaws clamp on your neck and lifted you up. You felt your skin stretch, but somehow the wolf's tongue had left your neck numb and you stayed still as the wolves began to carry you to a large den.</span></div></div>",

The wolves say that they'll take care of you, but just how true was that. They seemed to bear animosity for Kalia, and probably all foxes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you knew the foxes seemed to be weaker and lower in status, you know that they would always be kind to you and you felt a powerful connection to Kalia; a bond that only a mother and child should share. In the end, the decision was clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" you say as dignified as you can with your small, high voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that,\" Salas sneers. \"Did you just say no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't go with you,\" you said with a voice that was braver than you felt. \"I'll stay with Kalia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's very nice for you and we'll respect your decision,\" the first wolf says. He turns to Salas and nods. Salas jumps from where he stood and gripped the scruff of Kalia's neck in his mouth. He bit down hard, causing blood to seep from a wound. He lifted her off of the ground and slammed her into a thick tree to his right. You started to run towards her but were stopped when the other wolf placed a paw on your back and pushed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched pitifully as Kalia was being thrashed, bit, and cut by Salas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow extensive is her wounds?</span></div></div>",

Finally Salas lifted her far above the ground and slammed her to a small boulder. You saw her right fore leg bend at an unnatural angle and a small splinter of a bone pierce through her skin from the inside. Kalia let out a small howl and blood began to fly from her open mouth. Salas gave out a cruel laugh and began to walk towards you. He stopped and gave you a serious look. \"You have one week kid,\" he said. \"If the life of a fox isn't what it's cracked up to be, you can come join us. Just give out two howls and we'll come and get you. But remember, only one week, and this is a one time deal.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalas gave a nod and he and the other wolf ran off towards their den. After they had left, you ran up to your mother and began to nudge her awake. For a few minutes she remained dormant, but soon her eyes fluttered open and she quickly tried to stand up. She instantly fell back to her side and released another spurt of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son, are you okay,\" Kalia asked concerned. \"Did they hurt you? What happened to the wolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, I'm okay,\" you say quickly.

All of the foxes instantly stopped what they were doing and gave odd looks at your mother. All around you foxes whispered, \"Is that...\", \"Kalia the Outcast\", and, \"She has another son?\" You simply suppressed a growl and continued to follow your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou followed your mother to a separate cavern where an older female fox resided.

You were not about to be killed by a bunch of oversized nature lovers. You and your brother walk along the forest trail, the trees rusling in the wind. Your brother turns to you, \"Will, I wanted to give you something before you went on that field trip, but i didn't get the chance.\" You look at your brother, tall and caramel skined. You always made fun of him and called him indian cause he had the skin of one, but you loved him and looked up to him like any little brother would. \"What is it?\" you say with interest. John walks to one of the trees in the forest with a hole big enough to fit a sword in there, and thats what was in there. John pulled out a huge silver sword that had the style of dante's sword from Devil may cry. Your eyes widen in surprise, \"Where did you get this?\" you gasped. John smiles, \"I knew you'd like it, after i saw you on your laptop downloading pictures of different swords that you liked, I used my birthday money to buy you one. Tears were swelling up in your eyes, your big brother got you a present that you always wanted. you always begged you parents to get you a cool sword, but they always said no cause \"It's to dangerours, you might hurt your self.\" But you tell them that you've been studying how to fight with a sword, but no, no sword for you. \"Why can't you just like video games like your brother?\" your mom always said to you. \"I'm not about to put my only two sons in danger just over a silly sword.\" your father nagged you. After a while, you gave up on the sword, knowing you's never get it, until now....<br>\r\n\"T-thanks, john.\" you sniffed, you gave you brother a hug, he did the same. \"Your welcome, Will.\" As soon as you two separated you were about to  go back to the cave....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it happened!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive wolves jumped out of the bushes, circling you and john, growling. John tossed you the sword and got his bow ready. He shot one wolf in the heart with one arrow, the wolf yelp and collapsed, dead, \"Good shot!\" you said while deflcting a wolfs claw who tried to scratch you with it. \"Thanks.\" John panted. You ducked and rolled out of the way as a wolf lunged at you. John smacked a wolf in the muzzle with his bow, it yelped, backed away, and grabbed its muzzle, whimpering. You sliced one wolfs chest, leaving a huge gash. It growled and came after you. You held you sword uo in defense, but it pinned you down. You heard a voice in you head, 'Were not going to hurt you! Stop fighting and come with us!' You looked up to see the wolf wasnt attacking you. A pain swelled up in your chest, it was that wolf you saw in the forest who kiddnapped you! You got kiddnapped once, but not again! you yelled at the top of you lungs \"NEVER!!!!!!\" and pushed the wolf off with an unknow strength. Then you heard a scream, you looked over to you brother to see that he is getting eaten by the wolf he attacked!<br>\r\nThe other wolves looked at him in shock. One wolf said \"Salas! you werent supposed to eat the humans brother!\" the wolf just grinned and said, \"Heh, it was worth it, that human is the one we're after anyway.\" he chuckled, refering to you. \"JOHN!!!!\" you screamed, furious, and lunged at the wolf. The wolf yelped in surprise and looked back at you before you hacked and slashed the wolfs face, \"YOU MONSTER!! *SMACK* YOU ATE MY BROTHER!!! *SLASH* I'LL KILL YOU!!! *TWO SMACKS* SPIT *SLASH* HIM *SLASH* OUT!!!!!! *STOMP*\" was the last thing you did on the wolfs stomach before he coughed up your brother. With one final slash you cut the wolfs head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n......Silence.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas all you heard. The wolves were trembling at the other wolfs head, which was staring back at them, eyes widen in shock. \"T-t-that human just killed Salas!!!\" one wolf shouted in shock. The other wolves just stared at you, panting, soaked in the wolfs blood, hands trembling, a crazy look in you eyes. Slowly, you walked over to your saliva soaked brother, who was shivering from the cool air on his slimey body. You took him in you arms, \"W-will....\" he said weakily. You laid him on the ground, tears in your eyes, \"I-i-i-im sorry john.....I let you get eaten.\" your brother smiled weakily, \"No.....It was i who failed you......I slipped.....I-i-i-i.......love you little brother. But......remember this.....only.....use....the.....sword......for you......and t-the.......ones......you......love.......\" Is the last thing he said before his body went limp. The wolves all looked at you with sorrow eyes. One wolf  trotted over to you, \"I-is he dead?\" You glare at the wolf, causing her to back away, whimpering. \"You, YOU MONSTERS!!!! YOU KILLED MY BROTHER!!! OF COURSE HE'S DEAD!! WHY WOULDN'T HE BE?! IT'S YOUR FAULT HE'S DEAD!!!!\" you point your sword at the wolves, \"If I ever see you trying to kill me, humans, or any innocent creature.........I'LL KILL YOU!!!!\" and with that, they all ran off, leaving you to mourn over you brothers dead body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...........Life is a crule......crule thing to go through......but somehow........we manage........to survive.........and so will you..................William Jones..........</span></div></div>",

She smiles and licks her lips hungrily before looking directing attention toward you .<br>\r\n \"Well, well, my compliments to the chef, your sister was such a... delectable appetizer\".<br>\r\nShe pounces on you, knocking you to the ground. She stands up, her paws front paws on your chest, holding you down. She looks you right in the eyes and licks her lips slowly, taunting you and reveling in your terror.<br>\r\n\"Soon as my stomach settles, I'll move on to the main course. Until them, you'll have a minute or two more outside of my stomach, 'Supper', Any last words?\"<br>\r\nYou stare back at her unbelieving, the gurgles of her as it digests your little sister amplified in your mind. Finally, you break down. Tears stream down your face as you ask her why she's doing this. She just laughs. <br>\r\n\"I'm a wolf, a carnivore; I eat meat. You're meat, which means I eat you. Circle of delicious life; simple, really\".<br>\r\nShe bends down and licks your teary face.<br>\r\n\"Mmm, salty, I do love the taste of tears, really- Uuuurrrrrpppphh<br>\r\nA belch interrupts her monologue and blast your face with the smell of partially digested meat. You try not to think to hard about it.<br>\r\n\"Heh, seems your sister's about done. Time to start on the main course.\"<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth wide, giving you a view of her teeth and pulsing throat. Then just as your mind has finished processing this, the world goes dark as she swallows your head far more quickly then seems possible. One moment, there was teeth, the next, everything was black. You can feel her tongue on your chest, licking you and taking in your flavor. Appreciative 'mm's vibrate around you. Then, she swallows, and repeats the process on your stomach. The next swallow squeezes your head into a tiny, smelly compartment that must be your stomach. Undigested bit of meat and clothing cling to your skin and you start to struggle. Your arms are pinned to your side by the wolf's throat, so you squirm and kick. It doesn't seem to be making much of a difference, though, since the wolf just continues to take her time and savor your taste. Each swallow bringing more and more of you into her stomach, which expands to fit. After what seems like an eternity you heel her tongue lapping at your toes. This mouthful seems to take the longest, maybe she's putting off the end, maybe it's your imagination, but eventually your feet make their way down her throat to join the rest of you. You take the opportunity to kick at the stomach wall, and are rewarded with the sound of muffled laughter, which reverberates around you as the stomach fills with acids. The end comes far too slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the wolf stretches and lets out a contented sigh. She loves it when they struggle. She lets out a soft belch, and curls up on the cave floor. Eventually, once the struggles cease and there's nothing left of her meal to really enjoy, she falls asleep and lets her stomach finish its job.</span></div></div>",

The damaged fabric gives easily, and soon your chest and belly are bare, the shredded remnants of your shirt pinned beneath your back. You put up a final struggle, trying to wiggle your way free, but it is no use. The wolf leans down and bites into the soft skin of your belly. She is almost dainty now, a sharp contrast from the wild hunger you saw when she bit your shoulder. She pulls her head back and away, but stays standing in the same place. You see your flesh stretch out in her mouth and tear away from your body. The agony is incredible, but you cannot look away. The wolf swallows the chuck of you that is in her mouth, then she leans down and takes another. She has reached your organs now, and when she punctures your stomach, you can see meat that is not your own spilling out. It is the same meat that she fed you earlier, and you realize that even when she seemed to be helping you, she was really only serving herself. You cannot bring yourself to hate her for it, however. This forest is her place to hunt, and by being here, you are made her prey. As she takes another bite, you noticed the world has grown dark. The only thing left is you and the wolf. Even the pain of being eaten had begun to dull, making the scene seem far away, as if happening to someone else, as if you are only a fascinated onlooker. She takes another bite, tearing out your small intestine. She cannot eat it all at once though, and part of it falls from her mouth, landing on your bloodied chest. Your body is in ruins. You cannot move, and you can barely breath. She takes another bite. With this one comes much of the skin from your chest, allowing to see your own ribs. You can no longer hear or feel anything clearly. Sight is the only sense that works, and even that is fading. The wolf places her nose in the cavity in your belly, searching around for something she likes before biting again. This time, she punctures a lung. Your breathing grows shallow, and your vision swims. You can no longer see yourself, only an indistinct shape that must be the wolf.

Well, it seems like you won't be running anywhere, escape is out of the question now, and you whimper lowly in pain. The female ignores it and instead starts to undress you with her teeth and claws, not being overly careful as you get some cuts along the way, but finally you're completely undressed save for the collar, and she seems happy as she looks you over, pacing in a circle around you. When you try to sit up she growls in warning, and obediently you lie down again on your stomach and watches her carefully, trying to guess what she's thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while she ignores you and seems to watch the exit of the cave, but as noone appears she turns back and looks over you for a few moment, before flipping you over onto your back with a paw and grinning down at you. You gulp loudly, wondering if she's changed her mind about not eating you, but you have no reason to fear. She is merely tired and plans to rest until her mate returns with food... and you're looking like the perfect pillow for that. Yawning widely, showing you all of her white and sharp teeth, she pokes your stomach for a couple of times, before she lies down and nearly smothers you. Given that the wolf is large, larger than you, it feels like all of the air is pressed out of you but when you try to wriggle into a more comfortable position and catch your breath again, she looks down and gives you another warning growl. The message is clear, you're to lie still and be comfortable for her, and after a while she lowers her head and buries you completely underneath her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou do not know how long she lies and sleeps on you, but every breath feels pained and your ribcage is pressed down under her weight, hence it feels like an eternity and you can't relax at all. Suddenly, though, she raises her head and perks up her ears as she seems to listen to something outside the den, giving you a chance to see the light again and breathe without inhaling her fur. It seems to be someone outside the cave, and the female gets up from you to see if it's an unwelcome visitor. Lying still on the ground and desperately trying to get some air without your bruised ribcage giving you too much pain, you can't see the outside of the exit, but as she sits back and grins you know that it's someone she knows, and hopes that she'll forget about you for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

Three wolf pups enter the den, growling and chasing each other playfully, but they stop as soon as they see you. Looking back to their mother, one of them growl something that sounds like a question, and as she grins and seems to nod you know you're in trouble. The pups want to play with their new pet, and they're known to play it rough. One of them pounces on you happily, digging his claws into your belly, and soon his two siblings join in their playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of your arms are grabbed and chewed on playfully, whilst another seems want to drag you away and pulls at the wounded leg, but as the other two have good hold of you it only results in your broken ankle being stretched out painfully and you cry out in pain. For a second, all three pups pause and look on you, seeming to be intrigued by the sound of your scream, before the one at your legs pulls again, until she is rewarded with another scream. Delighted, all three seem to compete in who can make you scream the loudest, watched by their mother who seems to be amused by seeing her pups play. The one on your stomach digs his claws deeper into you until blood starts to trickle from the marks, and the jagged tongue that eagerly laps them up feels raw against your skin. The pup that used to be satisfied chewing on your arm now spots your fingers and find them much funnier to play with, biting down hard enough to break two of them, and you scream out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pup that was clawing your stomach suddenly growls something to his siblings, and as both of them look down on you with vicious grins you gulp again, wondering what he said. It soon becomes obvious, as all pups get off you and instead nudge you in the sides, apparently wanting you to get up. Hesitantly, you get up on all fours but grimace at the pain when you put any pressure on your wounded hand, but they don't seem to care. One of the pups instead growls again and nudges your rump, urging you to walk forward. You take a few awkward steps but soon feel the cold nose nudge you once more, and you try your best to run on all four. Clearly this is what the pups wanted, and they all chase you happily, biting your legs or feet when given a chance, but not seeming to want to catch you just yet. After a while however, your breath grows more and more strained and you feel how you grow slower, and as the pups notice this too one of them jumps onto your back and playfully bites your neck, declaring you 'dead' for now. Grateful, you sink down on your stomach and hopes to rest, only to sigh loudly when jaws once more close around your broken ankles and drags you further into the cave, until you can't see the light from the exit any longer. It is the female that is moving you, and soon she reaches her destination; the place where the pups usually sleep, a nest that feels soft as she lays you down in it, and the pups lay down on and around you. Glancing down underneath you, you realise that it's an own fell as well as your old clothes that makes the nest so comfortable, but you're given little time to think more of it as one of the pups playfully breaks another of your fingers. Crying out loud again, you hope that they'll either leave you alone or just kill you and have it over with. The female looks down on her pups with a tender expression in her eyes, before you hear something from the other side of the cave, and she leaves to head over to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the male finally back?</span></div></div>",

Once their eyes adjusted to the light, Nanokami was able to look out upon the sight of the forest for the very first time that he could remember. It was large, at least to his little eyes. The scent from the pine tree drifted everywhere about him, with light dancing in beams through the boughs of the trees. Faintly in the distance he could hear water, and looked up to see a large fox sitting on a rock in front of them. He was silver and black, with a white tip on his tail. Large, round, deep blue eyes, and he appeared to be smiling at Nanokami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Kerani.\" Nanoni said to the fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Nanoni. How is young Nanokami doing this morning?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's doing well, a little scrapped and bruised from the fall yesterday, but other than that just fine\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough for a visit from my son? He was so worried about him that he wouldn't stop bugging me to come see him today.\" Kerani <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I think that would be wonderful for Nanokami to have a visitor today.\" Nanoni said with a wolfish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the bushes popped a smaller version of Kerani. He darted straight for Nanokami, who withdrew behind Nanoni's large paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok dear, it's just Serani, he won't hurt you.\" Nanoni cooed softly to Nanokami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Nanokami edged his way from behind his mother's paw and looked and the bouncing ball of fur in front of him.</span></div></div>",

The wounds Nanokami had suffered from were starting to heal, but a slight tinge of pain was still present. He couldn't help but flash a tiny smile as Serani was bouncing around and talking in a higher-than-normal voice. \"Nanokami! I heard you were hurt, so I wanted to see you, but Kerani wouldn't let me, so I waited and waited and waited and waited...\" Serani repeated this over and over again, as much as his little heart could muster. Serani stopped briefly to inhale greatly, and Kerani looked down with a mixture of confusion and humor. \"Heavens, Serani! If you could run as fast as you speak, you'd leave the entire pack in the dust! Now go; play with Nanokami.\" A wide grin stretched across Serani's little muzzle, as he ran towards Nanokami once again. \"Come on, let's play!\"<br>\r\nAs Serani ran off, yelling behind for you to catch up, you couldn't help but feel a slight twitch of memory in the back of your head. You felt as if you weren't just Nanokami, kid wolf to your mother Nanoni. Whenever you thought about your past life, however, you felt a headache that just blocked out more memories. You knew who you were, but that past person was slipping away, faster than you originally expected. The scent of pine was thick in the air, in your nose, and it crept into your mind. The strong, sappy odor was pushing your featherweight thoughts into purgatory, never to return. You were no longer a 14-year old human boy that got lost in the woods. No longer the boy who was rescued by a female wolf and miraculously spent the night without being killed. You were...I was...I am...<br>\r\n\"Nanokami? Nanokami!\" Serani was standing next to you, practically shouting in your slightly perked ear. You jump into the air a little, startled as you snap back into reality. \"Oh sorry Serani. I was just daydreaming.\" Serani tilted his head to the left in confusion. \"Are you okay, buddy? You seem a little off today.\" Indeed, you did feel off. But telling the other wolves about this would only single you out as crazy. They might even make you the Omega of the pack; a third wheel, so to speak. \"I don't know, Serani. I guess it's just being cooped up and recuperating is all.\" Serani was a little unsure of your answer. \"I think it's something else...\" Your eyes dart from side to side...</span></div></div>",

The previous nights events pass like a blur; you'd been found in the forest, taken to the den and then gave yourself to the lusts of the wolves. Yet somehow, you hardly felt ashamed by it, was it not natural to mate whenever one felt the urge? The alpha male's sleek, muscular body was curled around yours, his head next to your muzzle... Looking back to the frenzy of the previous night, you remember how wonderful his cock felt inside of you, so hard and thick as it thrust in and out... and you found yourself purring at the memory... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a second? You had a muzzle? You could purr now? What's happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shifted your head down and examined yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, you didn't remember having so much body hair before, nor hair that was so fine and sleek, not to mention silvery-grey.  The body you now possessed was not the fragile, dainty figure you possessed before, but one of a sleek, curved hunter. And those claws, they were so deadly and sharp, designed to cut through the flesh of prey. Still stunned, you curve your gaze down to your hind legs, then toward your tail. Alarmed, you tried to rise to your feet, but lost your balance and stumpled back down, letting out a dog-like yelp. It was then it truly hit you, sometime during the night, by some magic or whatever, you had transformed into a she wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to get the attention of the Alpha male, who let out an amused growl as he rose on all fours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Ah, good morning Misty, I gather you've had a good nights rest?] came the Alpha males deep, reasoning voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to ask him what had happened to you, but all that came out was a bark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Speak to me through your mind, think of what you wish to say and I shall hear you...]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[H-how, what happened to me?] you communicated. Your 'mental' voice still sounded very much like it had when you could still speak vocally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alpha male declines to respond, instead grinning once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[So that means, I-I'm a wolf now?] you said, frightened by the possibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Do you find that so hard to believe?] the Alpha Male replied. You were about to ask him why he brought you here, but he seemed to read your thoughts. [Allow me to explain, the pack has had a shortage of young females for a good while; most are too old to bear pups anymore. Therefore, I have searched far and wide, and when I found you I thought what a wonderful female you would make.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Alpha male gazed over your new canine body, [And it appears that my efforts have not been for naught after all.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were flattered by the compliment, however you still were a bit unsure. It was still too much to truly acknowledge that you would never go back to your old life, even if it hadn't been so great anyhow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nuzzled you on the neck, [Now there, do not concern yourself of the world of the humans anymore, they are the distant past. and it is better here. You are now one of the pack and we are your family.] <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought about what he said, and it did not take you long to discover that... </span></div></div>",

Her tittys were now quite a handful, yet they still stood up, proud off her chest. Her breasts had no sag, they both seemed to emit a glow, and they seemed to be hotter within the flesh. <br>\r\nHer hair had also grown longer, and was now a thick, black color. The mane she had was fuller, and also seemed to be very sensitive to the lightly blowing breeze. It turned her on erotically, and she sighed with growing arousals coursing through her youthful body.She was also very naked, and the coolness of the air seemed not to penetrate her. Her nipples were hard, and she moved her hands to rub some warmth into her chilled breasts. Even her pussy had sprouted a large mass of thick, pubic hairs that were alive and making her very horny.<br>\r\nShe then sat up and marveled when the wolf's eyes met her's.<br>\r\n\"So, you are still watching me,...my friend?\" she murmured. MIsty then stood up and saw her backpack, that seemed to materialized out of thin air, in front of her feet.<br>\r\n[Again, we are so sorry, Misty.....I will stay with you until you get picked up by the highway. We can leave when you get dressed....] the sad sounding voice in her head said. Again Misty looked closely at the wolf. It was the Huge Omega Male wolf....and there were many others behind him, just out of her sight. With a smile back to him, she wordlessly went to the back pack, got dressed in her torn, yet usable clothing, minus a bra, or panties....and hefted the light pack onto her back. With the huge wolf leading the way, like a watch dog, Misty followed to the nearby highway.<br>\r\nJust as she heard the light traveled road, she noticed the wolves all disappearing,...and she was now truly alone,....she thought.<br>\r\nBut, a single thought came back from the Omega Male...[No you will never be alone again, loved one. Once you have been 'touched' you are always one with the pack. You are family now....and we will keep in touch....be well!]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Misty got to the road's edge....and stuck out her thumb...and began waiting for a lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat next???????????</span></div></div>",

Rubbing it, it felt like her ear, but why was it on her head? \"Oh god... Why is my ear?! It wasn't a dream!! I'm still a wolf!!\" you go to sob, cupping your face in your hands, only to realize there was a distant lack of muzzle. You stop, sniffling a bit, when suddenly you hear the voice of the Omega.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried to restore your form, but the art of transmutation is a fickle art, and the Alpha is clearly more of a master of it than I previously believed him to be.\" you look over yourself in earnest after hearing the Omega's words, seeing your clothes, somehow mended, back on you, and not a trace of fur or claws on you, until you look behind you to see a drooping silvery-grey wolf tail poking through your jeans in a new tailored hole that clearly wasn't there before. Worried what else was off, you looked under your clothes, trying to keep the Omega from looking. \"I will never understand humanity's shame in their nude form, but if you wish I not look, I shall not.\" He buries his head in paws as you undress slightly, finding, other than your tiny A-cup breasts were now giant DD-cups, the only other thing off about you was that was groin was a dense, furry mess, a triangular jungle of dense silver fur obscuring your vagina like some kind of fur bikini, but then you saw a part from the fur trail upwards from it turning auburn, clearly transitioning from fur to human body hair, making a tiny narrow trail up to your navel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you redress, finding it odd to have to slip your tail through the holes in the back of your panties and jeans, the Omega addresses you, saying, \"When the Alpha turned you into a wolf, he used an ancient forbidden ritual, first hypnotizing you with his eyes, then manipulating your mind, playing on your raging teenage human hormones, so that he may carry out the key part of the curse, to use his seed to curse you to become a wolf against your will. I was able to purge most of the curse, but as you can see, this is the best I can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can say or do anything else, he goes on, \"I also had my trusted soothsayer look into your soul to see if there was any lingering damage from the Alpha's hypnosis or the curse itself... It appears, once a month, on the night of the full moon, you will go into an estrus that will make you become as lustful and horny as you were under the Alpha's power, and seek out a mate, or mates, human or wolf, for wild debauched sex with zero inhibitions.\" You have flashbacks to that night before you were turned into a wolf, how you remember begging the Alpha to fuck your brains out, the others licking you over, how in your afterglow he kept pounding you, and then you remember another detail of that night, when you were on Round 4 with the Alpha, but had two other wolves in your ass as you sucked another wolf's dick, all while jerking off two other wolves, wondering, no, begging, to see how many more wolf dicks you could get in you. In the same memory, you recall seeing a shiny surface, and saw yourself, bobbing up and down, bits of fur growing on cum-drenched chest, a chest that was now sporting six C-cup breasts, along with fur on your thighs and arms, and your slightly distended nose being black and wet, but because of how horny and slutty you were under the Alpha's power at the time, it was like you simply didn't care about the reflection of the transforming girl you saw at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother fresh memory was when you were going for your sloppy tenths, the Alpha already worn out and just watching you practically rape the lesser male wolves, your body practically white because your mostly grown fur was bathed in wolf cum. Finally, the last male the Alpha had called upon to this den collapsed, the last of his seed spent. You started trying to suck his dick hard in your halfway-formed muzzle, but it was no use. \"Master, I'm spent, but she won't stop!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. The moon will set soon, and her lust will abate. When it does, she will collapse from exhaustion, and you are to have my other mates clean her off. I need her to not remember anything of this night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf pushed your demi-muzzle off his dick, she begged in a high, sweet, almost baby-like voice, \"But Missy wanna fuck more. Missy horny!!\" As one of your hands furious masturbated yourself, another tried to jack off as many exhausted and sore wolf dicks as possible, trying to get one rock hard again so you could plunge it in you again. Just as you hit the jackpot and slid a new dick in your unnaturally wet vagina, the moon set, and you said, yawning, \"...but Missy horny, no tired...\" as you pass out on your male victim, his dick still in you, going off from sheer exhaustion, blasting more seed into your passed out body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, he turned me into some wolf bimbo, and now you're saying I'll do that again every full moon for the rest of my life?\" you sob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I'm sorry, Misty. I could not purge that part of the curse from you. The next full moon, if it has a penis, whether it be human, magical wolf like myself, normal wolves, or even simple dogs, from moon rise to moon set, your whole life will revolve around sucking, fucking, and jacking off as many as you can, and you will never tire or get sore until the setting of the moon. Once the moon sets, you will return to the way you are now. Again, if I could purge this blight from your soul, I would, but the Alpha's forbidden arts were forbidden for a reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm like a werewolf, but instead of turning into a wolf, which I've already done, I'll turn into a slut. Just great.\" you grumble, fighting back tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is some good news though...\" the Omega stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I'm pregnant?\" you mock him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who tol... I mean, since you were forcibly turned against your will while I should of been keeping a better eye on my subordinates, I decided to grant you some gifts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gifts?\" you ask, not hearing his near Freudian slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, despite having a human form, you still retain the alacrity of the wolf, meaning you can run as fast as us, and move as dexterously as us as well. Second, I imparted my divine sense of smell to you. My soothsayer said my failed attempt to restore your humanity had already left you with superhuman smelling, but I decided to bless you with the Omega's nose, and now you have supercanine smelling. Finally, your body was bathed in a special oil made from herbs the foxes taught us wolves us, and if you decide to return to the human world, you will have no need to hide your wolf attributes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why...\" you ask, holding your ears, wondering just what he put on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because while humans will see your ears and tail and know you have them, the power of the oil causes those that behold anything bathed in it to believe that what they are seeing is the most natural thing in the world, and spread the effect to anyone they speak to. Although they'd see or hear of you as a 'wolf-girl,' they think of you, speak of you, and treat you like wolf-girls were an everyday occurrence for them.\" the Omega states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I could go home right now, ears and tail for the world to see, and no one would care?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" the Omega answers you, adding, \"and that power will be passed on to your children as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess... I could go home then... but, then why are you here personally? You could of had an underling explain this, and what keeps the Alpha, or another wolf, from trying to turn me into a wolf again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came here because the Alpha's actions shame not only me, but the pack in general, and my honor would not allow me to send a proxy to help you in this crossroad of your life. Also, to answer your other question, a living body cannot sustain more than two forced transmutations in their lifetime. You have been transmuted twice against your will, the first time by the power of the Alpha, since transmutation magic does not regard those under hypnosis or mind control a willing participant of the magic, and the second time was when I put you to sleep to reverse the curse, because I worried your mind would not handle the trauma of witnessing your reversion. However, just like hypnotized subjects, unconscious subjects are also unwilling targets, even if they are willing in the waking world. Therefore, if he, or anyone else, ever tries to change you against your will again, it would probably kill you.\" you gasp, as he adds, \"but my blessing also protects you, blocking the magic of change, so your life is safe. However, if one day you wish to willingly change your shape, come tell me and I will release the seal on your body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou absorb all of this, then ask, \"But still, I think you have something you want to ask me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Observant, young one...\" he grins. \"As it stands, you may return to the human world and leave this place forever, if you so desire, and return to your old life, but there is the mystery of how you ended up here. I believe malicious humans did that to you. Therefore, I propose two choices. You may do as I already mentioned and go home, and I will leave it at that, if you wish, or...\" he pauses for dramatic tension, \"...you could become our pack's liaison, an ambassador, if you will, to the human world, and our fellow animal brethren, bridging our worlds, teaching us about 'technology,' and of the ways of our fellow beasts. To help, I can give you this...\" he licks you on the cheeks. Suddenly, the crickets all sound like they speak English. \"...you now speak any tongue on the planet. So, what say you?\"</span></div></div>",

In his mind, he thought, that since he wasn't a father yet, maybe he wasn't the right choice to care for you. Soon enough, he hears some of the wolves around him. <i>Is this a joke? Even if she does become one of us, what would she even help with?<br>\r\nThe alpha's being too nice.<br>\r\nThe pack is growing more each year... It'll just give us problems</i><br>\r\nGenarius knew some wolves thought of humans that way and even wanted to kill any they came across, so it quickly made him think that a wolf might take the human just to treat them horribly. She was like a daughter to him and though he wasn't experienced, he knew he would still treat her well. If he did accept it though, this would be something new for both of them. Him being a parent and her being a new species entirely. Eventually he began to step forward. You smile at his action, feeling happy. <i>Alpha? I choose to accept her as my daughter. I may not know how to be a parent, but I know this pack and will train her well.</i> The Alpha nods and gives a slight smile. You turn to see him get closer and smile. You smile back and feel happy and accepted. Some wolves groaned, while others smiled along.<i>Very well. You are now officially her guardian and father.

Soon wolves are called to hunt and they later return with two well sized kills. You quickly remember your new way of eating and look away in disgust. Genarius gives you a look knows that you'll get used to it eventually. You step forward, as if you are about to eat, but Genarius growls and looks at you. You feel a wave of tension. You can tell that it wouldn't be wise to continue moving forward and so you freeze. Genarius nods shortly, as to not only acknowledge your choice, but to assure you that you made the right one. You look back towards the kills to see the Alpha ripping some pieces. Another wolf soon joins and after a bit, more wolves join. The first two wolves soon leave to eat their current flesh pieces and lick themselves clean. Genarius makes a gesture towards you and begins to walk. Following, you hear Genarius explain.<i>the higher skilled wolves eat first. Since you are now my pup, you are at my level because you are now my pup. It's not the highest, but at least you won't have to worry about starving.</i> Looking back, you see the other wolves whimpering. It's lucky for you, but you feel a little guilty. After taking some, at least as much as Genarius would let you, you greedily 'wolf' it down. It tastes better than the last time.<br>\r\nAs you finish you and Genarius talk. <i>I know you said that you don't remember your name, so I was think about coming up with a new name? Do you have anything in mind?</i><br>\r\n\"Well... I don't really know... What are the other names like?\" Gesturing with his muzzle, he picks out some names. <i>There are a variety of names. There's Winter Wind, Scratch, Wind Shifter, and many other different names. You know, now that I look at you, and your background, Nanokami looks like a good name, but only if you want it.</i> It sounded strange at first, but you begin to quickly warm up to it. \"Sure! Okay! Sounds good Genar- uh, dad!\" the sound of the word dad felt better for both of you the more you said it and, though trying to hide it, you noticed Genarius's tail wag. After more time, it was getting late and you yawned, remembering how tired you were. Genarius nudges you to move but you soon fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

We were just about to do something cooler than just tumbling around trying to walk, but if that's what you'd rather do, go ahead!</i> There were a few giggles from the other pups.

You did want to give a good first impression, but how were you supposed to stay calm when the other wolves were making fun of you? You think about trying again to hang out with them.

Your heart fluttered as you figured you were changing more. Sniffing again, you realized the scent wasn't totally as strong, but you decided to follow anyway.

You could even change genders or become younger or older, or you can just stay as a human, but if you do change you might become one of us, or pray. I ask all of my pack, even my tracker to bring things they find that seem interesting, but if you want to stay, you must adapt to our customs. After this conversation, you must live like us without mistake. Because you haven't grown here, you will be taught, but hurt this pack, and you will leave and be treated as an enemy or pray. Also, if you stay, and you transform into pray, we will hunt you. It is only in our nature to do so, but as I said, your choice, I will let you think about it...</i> You thought about it and looked at the pack. It was unbelieveable that the wolves, at least the alpha was being nice, even more unbelievable that you were allowed to join, but what would you choose? </span></div></div>",

Then again, even if you did stay, you had to obey strict rules and codes and you might not even like them. The more time had passed the more you realized there was no guarantee of safety out of the pack, so it'd be much more rational if you stayed. <i>Do you want to think it over some more? We will not hurt you here and you can stay, but only for today.</i> \"No!\" you almost yell, but you quickly tell them you made up your mind. \"I mean... I want to stay.\" the wolf nodded and commanded the others not to harm or eat you and that to tell him if you messed up. <i>A hunting party is assembled and will bring their kill in a few moments. When the kill arrives, your training will start.</i> You nod and feel queasy, yet hungry wondering what is to come.</span></div></div>",
