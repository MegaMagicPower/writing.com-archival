            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Stephanie had recently finished school for the day and was casually making her way home. Not feeling like rushing home and dealing with her family, she decided to talk a leisurely walk down a nearby trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Taking the long winding trail home was a nice break for Steph who was enjoying the warm summers day. Her beat up sneakers scuffed along the gritty dirt path with an almost grating sound as she breathed in the fresh air around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She looked stunning in her regular blue t-shirt and stone washed jeans that complimented the color of her radiant blue eyes. Her long blond hair almost seemed vibrant when she was dressed like this. It made her feel good inside, standing out from everyone else was something Steph usually shied away from besides with her clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she wandered down the path, dust kicking up against her smooth ankles as she trudged on in her sockless sneakers. Her eyes scanned the ground as she casually walked on. The odd bug would scurry out of her way as she padded along and she watched them scuttle for the relative safety of the grassy areas along the side of the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Steph's eyes casually passed over the dusty ground until something shiney caught her attention. Coming to a halt, a few tiny stones popping under her shoes as she stood still, Steph repositioned her backpack over one shoulder and bent down to pick up the strange device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It looked like a pen, but it was definately a strange kind. It didn't seem to have any company markings on it and it featured a small button. Two small digital displays in the device showed the numbers 15 and 0 in a dull red font. Looking curiously at the device, Steph turned it over in her hands and studied the LED like tip of the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a casual click of the button, light burst from the tip of the pen and blasted a bench far off down the road which quickly vanished in the ray of bright blinding light. The read out ticked down, clicking as it changed to 14 and 1. Steph looked toward where the bench was, head tilted to one side with a curious expression. What had just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This was definately something she would have to tell her friend Sara about. She had been friends with her preppy brunette friend for years now. The two got along very well and always shared everything about their lives. Steph liked being around her friend too. Sara was someone who was at least shorter than Steph's 5'9'' being only 5'2'' herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Blinking softly, trying to clear the spots from he vision from the bright light the pen had generated, Steph walked toward the bench, gasping in surprise as she found it and a tiny man upon the ground. Shrunk to tiny size by the power of the pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Steph felt like she was Godzilla compaired to this miniature sight. The bench was only a meer two inches in length by now. The light must have stunned her so much that she missed the actual shrinking. Looking down, her soft features lost in a sea of thought. Steph casually stepped forward, crunching the tiny bench under one of her grimy beat up sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She heard a tiny sound of surprise from the jogger who had stumbled away and was staring up at giant sized girl. He had not made it too far however as Steph realized with growing feelings of guilt that she had pinned his leg under her shoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The tiny man could only watch in surprise as Steph stepped back. The massive rubber sole of her old running shoe sent a cascade of tiny stones falling down upon the path. Her shoe scraped to a halt, just a few inches away to her, seemingly yards to the tiny man who turned his attention from the pain in his leg to the beautiful but obviously deadly giant girl that hovered over him. Her blonde hair was caught in a slight breeze as her soft features became dark with shadow, her eyes looking down upon his shrunken frame. The sun high above almost seem to cast her into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Seeing Stephs massive form crouching before him was a little more than he could bare and the tiny man tried to scramble back, dragging his leg. It was no use. Curious fingers reached down for him as Steph gathered him gently into her left hand and raised him to her face, still down in a crouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The tiny man was saying something, unsure of what it was, Steph brought him to her ear. The tiny man was pleading with her to let him go and not to hurt him further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The feeling of guilt knotted in Stephs tummy as she lowered her open palm down in front of herself again. She explained that she didn't want to hurt him in the first place and that she would try to return him to normal as soon as possible. Setting the tiny man back on the ground, Steph stood back to her full height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Her guilt began to melt into something new. A sensation stirred deep within Steph and as she stood there she began to wonder what it would be like to step on the tiny man before her. He wasn't dare moving, apparently trying to catch his breath as he started forward at her shoe, expecting some form of salvation from Steph and to be returned to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Lay down. I want to make sure you don't fall over and hurt yourself more if the transformation is too fast,\" Steph lied as she twirled the pen nervously, looking around to see if the coast was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   When he was lying there, she slowly scuffed her shoe across the ground and raised her sneaker high above him. Coughing on the rain of dust and stone, the tiny man stared up at the marked patterns on the rubber sole of Stephs shoe. She wasn't really going to press down, she just wanted to feel what it would be like to have this power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Setting her heel down upon the ground, Steph rolled her sneaker down so it was resting upon him. Solid, yet slightly spongy rubber held the tiny man in place as he began to squirm, trying to find any way to free himself from the ceiling of rubber pinning him to the gritty ground of the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Steph began to blush brightly as she stared down at her shoelaces and the grimy material of her shoe. The idea that a person was now under her control as small as a helpless bug beneath her sneaker was oddly enough turning her on. A shiver raced up Sephs spine as she realized a horrible truth, she wanted to feel her bare skin against him much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   He watched helplessly as the giant girl took her foot off him, giving him time to forget the danger and actually remember to breath again. Steph knelt down and began untying her sneaker. Her blue eyes stared through streaks of her blond bangs as she looked from her tattered shoelaces to her tiny prey upon the ground. Her eyes filled him with dread. All he could do was try to drag himself away and that did no good. This wonderous giantess could catch him in the blink of an eye. He had to put his faith in her, but at the same time he felt himself trying to move away from her as quickly as possible anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Casting her right running shoe aside, Steph quickly padded her big toe down upon the tiny man who colapsed back onto his back almost immediately. The soft dampness of her skin felt so odd against his body. The slightly yielding sensation of her toe was quickly replaced by the ball of her foot as step repositioned her bare sole over the tiny man that was at her mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Steph blushed as she felt the tiny man wiggling even harder now, knowing that she truly had no intention of returning him to his normal size. She couldn't believe how good this felt. Her feet were pretty sensitive and this was sending shockwaves of pleasure racing through her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Softly gasping to herself she began to realize things that made her even more excited. Things that made her cruelty even less bearable to the tiny victem pinned under her giant soft barefoot. The fact that she had worn her shoes all day at school, completely barefoot must have made them pretty sweaty on that hot summer day. It was intoxicating to imagine it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It was even more overwhelming for the tiny man as his hands slipped against her moist bare skin, trying desperately to push up against the huge sole that casually wrinkled and padded down upon his entire body. He was barely bigger than the ball of her foot, and even that may have been an illusion to him. He turned away from the sight of the giant girls skin upon him and closed his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Lick it,\" Steph softly gasped. She was shocked by the softness of her own voice. Never would she imagine herself requesting anyone do such a thing. At least she couldn't recall feelings like this. It just seemed right. Her power over him was absolute and he should show her that he was willing to do anything for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She sighed as she felt him squirm up and begin to nervously do as she commanded under the arch of her massive toes. Bars of sunlight lit the dark ground around him as he focused on the girls giant toes above him, intricate details flowing together to form the patterns of her skin. He pushed his hands up against the sides of the massive toe and stared up, hoping that he was making her happy enough to spare his life rather than end it like a bugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   So many details were racing through Stephs mind now and she couldn't brace herself any longer. Switching her weight to her bare foot she felt him desperately struggle to lick faster but it was no use as she shifted her sole forward and squished him helplessly into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   More than anything, Steph wanted to run home with the memory of this still fresh in her mind. In scared her to think of what she had just done, but it thrilled her even more as she drank in the power of pressing the shrunken man under her gigantic bare sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She stood there for at least five more mintues though. Wiggling her toes and staring down at the slight bit of damp red that had seeped between her toes. Rasing her foot she felt another cold shock as she noticed he was stuck to the bottom of her foot. Shivering with the sure pleasure of her actions, Steph began to wipe her foot off in the grass and then slipped her shoe back on. She desperately needed to try this again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Steph decided to head home. Overcome with the thoughts racing through her mind as she paced back and forth in her room, it didn't take too long until she grabbed her phone and began dialing Sara's number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sara sounded pretty groggy, probably Steph had just woke her up from a nap after school. As full of excitement as Steph was, she held back her enthusiasim and teased Sara with the unknown, \"Hurry over okay? I've got something very special to show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Full of anexiety, Steph sat down on her bed. Bouncing up and down slightly she began to wonder what it must have been like for her first shrunken victem. Taking off her right shoe, she examined the sole of her foot. Her blue eyes eagerly scanned the surface, imagining it so much bigger than her. Wondering what it would have been like to feel it slowly crushing her body. She massaged her thumbs across her wrinkled sole, brushed her fingers along each detail, it felt so soft to the touch. She was sure the tiny mad had a different opinion however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Sara showed up a good ten minutes later. The knock at the door startled Steph who hopped up and dug her foot quickly back into her sneaker that was still laced up. Opening the door, her 5`2`` brunette friend stood there smiling. She was wearing a pair of tan khaki pants and a t-shirt just a few shades lighter. Steph couldn't help but smile when she noticed her friend had worn over her black leather ankle-boots too. Steph had thought her feet must have been damp in just her sneakers, she couldn't even imagine what Sara's must be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Steph lead Sara over to the couch and began to go over the details of her walk home. When she got to the part about squishing the tiny man however, Sara seemed pretty surprised at her friend. Steph caught on and quickly covered her tracks, claiming it was an accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That didn't last long, and Sara was already wondering herself what it would be like to feel a shrunken person under her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, put on the TV and wait here, I'll go find someone for you. Shouldn't take long,\" Steph winked as she headed for the door. Sara didn't know what else to say as she watched her friend leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Steph remembered the library would be nearly empty sans a few bookworms who would be too busy studying to notice her. She smilled to herself and rode her bike to her desired location in hopes of finding Sarah some new \"friends\" to play with. Inside working hard studying for their science test were three girls of the varity Steph and Sarah would consider dorks. Lisa(5'1 brunette), Emily(5'4 blonde) and Cathy(5'2 brunette)were all pretty in their own right but compared to Steph they were a little overmatched in the looks catogory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph had made it to library in nearly five minutes and quietly opened the door to enter to find Sarah her new \"friends\" and maybe somebody for her to play with as-well. She noticed the three girls sitting alone and pulled out the pen and smiled as thought to herself how easy it was to actually collect \"new friend really is. She quietly walked over and quickly zapped the three before they even had a chance to put up a fight, she gathered them into her pocket and headed back to her house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\", Lisa asked out loud as her and her pocketmates were tossed about due to the movement of Steph's body as she rode home. \"I think we are in somebodies pocket but that would be impossible\" Cathy said before tumbling face first into a piece of Juicy Fruit gum Steph had in her pocket. Steph arrived home and quickly ran inside and up the stairs to Sarah. Sarah was still watching TV and still had her boots on, when Steph noticed this she laughed to herself about the hell that awaited her three new friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah noticed her coming through the door and shut off the TV and asked with an excited tone \"So, what'd you bring me?\". \"Well I found you three new people who really want to be your friend\" Steph answered with a smile. \"Well then let's met them shall we?\" Sarah said hardly hiding her enthusiasm over the forthcoming event. Steph reached into her pockets and pulled out her captive audience and introduced them to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa,Emily and Cathy all screamed when they realized that Cathy's pocket theory wasn't so farfetched after all. \"Well then now that we're all formally introduced, I've got a job for you to do and it may detiremine wether or not we decided to grow you back or not\" Steph annouced. \"All you have to do is walk over and tell Sarah if feet smell or not\" she said, \"And it's that easy and if you do you might go free!\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily wasn't to sure to trust the giant girls but what choice did they have? They all walked over to Sarah's feet which were the size of a five story building to them. Sarah began unlacing her boots and had pulled the left one off, \"Guess I forgot to wear socks today\" she giggled as Steph joined in. The three tiny captives were nearly at vomiting from the smell wafting toward them as Sarah finished pushed off the seconded boot with her sweaty bare foot, \"Well?\" Sarah said while wiggling her massive toes. Lisa was elected to go and do the \"honors\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa leaned in and quickly sniffed getting a bit nautious at the whole thing. \"Well it looks like they think your fett are pretty ripe\" Steph bust out laughing. \"I guess your right but how rude of them to say such things!\" Sarah sternly said before giggling in her own right. \"I think we should keep them now and make them learn to love it, what do you think Steph?\". \"I say that's a great idea and I'll seconded it!\" she laughed down at the puny prisoners while responding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Though I think we need to show them we mean business about the change in attitude, don't you?\" Sarah asked as she wiggled her toes in their faces. \"Right, we can't have them thinking they can just waltz in here and insult you like that\", \"So what do you think we should do to express to them how we fell about such behavior?\" Steph asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I DID want to try squashing somebody under my foot a little while ago!\" She laughed as the three shrunken girls turned ghost white as the words left her lips. \"Well how to we decide who gets to have \"Crushed by Sarah's Big Stinky Feet\" on their tombstone\" she was nearly in tears from laughing so hard. \"What a horrible way to go\" Steph shot back, \"but better them than me\" she smiled. Sarah looked down and nudged Lisa with her big toe, \"So you're the one who thinks my feet stink hunh?\". \"NO! Ma'am I was just coughing because I have a bit of a cold\" Lisa answered with her words breaking due to her shaking body. \"Well maybe you'd like to see what's it like to be an insole, bet it would fix your cold right up since it's nice and toasty in there!\" Sarah spoke as Steph was giggling uncontrolably and nearly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", Sarah said as she knocked over her boot with one of her feet. \"I want you to climb in there and wait for my signal, got it?\". \"Yes, I think I've got it\" Lisa quivered as she began crawling inside. Once inside Sarah sat the boot upside again and held her toes just over the opening, \"Well that's the signal!\" she luaghed as she started lowering her foot in the boot not giving Lisa much time to find a safe spot. The inside of Sarah's boot was hell for Lisa, the smell burned her nose,mouth and eyes and she had little time to get herself in a safe spot before Sarah's massive foot collasped on her. \"You feel great down there.\" she said as she wiggled her foot in the final few inches engulfing Lisa in sea of soaking wet flesh and horrible stench. \"I'm going to give your friends time to say a few words before I go on, so you'll go with a little diginity before I crush you like a bug under my foot!\" Sarah giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily and Cathy walked to the sole of the boot and tried to calm Lisa down telling her everything would be fine and they would get out this. Lisa tried screaming something to them but the sole was too think for much more than mumbling to be heard. \"Well, now that that's over, Steph if you'd be so kind as to make sure our ner friends don't mess the show I'll get on with the grand finale.\" Sarah spoke while standing up to make sure she got the full experience of crushing this dork beneath her. Steph held the other two girls close to Sarah's booted foot so they could her and more importantly SEE everything that was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any last words before I continue?\" she asked but heard nothing, \"Wait what am I saying bugs don't get last words\" and with that said she began pressing down a little on her captive. The pressure was enough to snap one of Lisa's arms and legs, \"I bet that sucked for you didn't it?\" Sarah laughed while grinding her foot down more into Lisa resulting more bones shattering into dust and her inards to compress like a folding table. \"Think she's still alive in there?' Sarah taunted the other two captives, \"Well, let's see if we can fix that!\" Sarah joked and with one huge push her sole firmed and tightened then pressed down with all her weight like a mammoth train slamming into it's unlucky victim. Lisa's last screams were muffled away by the sweaty, soaking foot of Sarah's left as she was grinded into oblivion by this cruel bitch. Lisa's skull was the last thing to go and Sarah made sure the crunch was loud enough for the two tiny girls to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKERRRRRRRRRRUNCH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah took off her boot and held her bloody sole out for inspection while wiggling her toes which had some of Lisa stuffed in there amongst the filth and toejam. \"Well, I guess she learned to have some mannors didn't she!\" Sarah laughed while Steph held the tiny gals close so they could get an up close look at what Lisa was left as. The sight and smell made them both almost throw up and they began to cry. \"Pay good attention to that site\" Steph spoke as she stared down at them. \"You now belong to us, you're entire lives will be spent at our reeking feet or anywhere else we decide to put you is that clear?\". Both tiny girls nodded quickly and began kissing Steph's palm to show their new found devotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, one of you will be Sarah's new pet and one of you will be mine.\", \"So I want one of you to go over and kiss Sarah's big toe and I want the other to come over here and kiss mine\" Steph said while slipping off her sneakers and socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever you choose will be your new queen until she either let's you go or grows tired of you.\", Steph made sure to let the know they better pray it's not option #2 they end up with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah and Steph sat back wiggling their less than fresh toes and waited for the slaves to make their choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCathy and Emily gulped and stared at their own personal hell before them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two shrunken girls trembled in fear as they stared at the looming soles of Steph's and Sarah's sweaty feet. Sarah's left foot was still coated in the bloody remains of their former friend Lisa, and the two giantesses wiggled their toes tauntingly over their shrunken captives. Cathy and Emily could clearly see every bead of sweat and every wrinkle that formed on the girls' titanic feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph and Sarah simply laughed as they saw the terrified expressions on their captives' faces. Steph decided to playfully poke Cathy in the chest with her big toe, and she giggled with glee as the tiny girl was knocked clean off of her feet by such an insignificant motion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong girls? Can't you chose who you want to spend the rest of your lives serving?\" Sarah teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course they can't, Sarah. We're both just so perfect compared to little bugs like them, so you can't blame them for not being able to decide. It's a matter of picking between two flawless goddesses, after all!\" Steph answered her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shrunken girls still cowered before their two massive captors, and they didn't know what to do. Soon the intense fear overtook their bodies, and they immediately turned to run away. Seeing their captives' futile attempt at escape, Steph and Sarah simply stood up and laughed. While the shrunken girls were running with all their strength to try and get away from the cruel giantesses, their captors simply walked after them at a slow and leisurely pace. Their massive strides quickly covered far more ground than the tiny girls could ever hope to at their size, and their stinking feet soon lowered onto the fleeing girls, pinning their minuscule bodies down helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the girls now trapped under the sole of their captors, they were forced to endure not only the intense pressure of the wall of flesh being pressed onto them, but also the unbearable stench of the giantesses' sweaty feet. Both Steph and Sarah laughed again as they enjoyed the feeling of total superiority over the much smaller girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this is just pathetic! How could you possibly be dumb enough to try and run away from us?!\" Sarah taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! You had the chance to live as slaves to a pair of perfect goddesses, but instead you decide to do this?! You should have been honored to have that opportunity!\" Steph continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad for you, because now you'll get to experience exactly what your rude little friend did earlier: You're gonna be crushed under the feet of your goddesses!\" Sarah finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, the two girls simultaneously shifted all of their weight onto the feet that held the shrunken girls beneath them. Within mere moments, the two tiny bodies were compressed into the ground and splattered into a pair of red puddles. Steph and Sarah looked at eachother and giggled before lifting their feet to examine the results of their handiwork. Seeing the flattened bodies of the two foolish girls smashed onto their soles, Steph and Sarah were flooded with excitement. They were truly addicted to this feeling of absolute power, and they desperately wanted more of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thinking, Steph and Sarah decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The familiar squish of the moist interior spread between the folds in her sole, and pressure was reapplied as she stood upright. At least she could take comfort in the fact that the blistering sun was still hitting the surface of the show and making it SEARING hot; her foot would only get more malodorous on the hike to Sara's house. She had to show someone what she found, or she'd explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunch of pebbles grew louder on the uphill trudge back to Sara's neighborhood. Steph's well-worn sneakers were now filthy, and kicking up so much dirt that her ankles were getting caked with it. She couldn't help fantasizing that the ground-up rocks and pebbles were tiny people, crushed and trampled under the unyielding treads of her shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe exited the trail near  Sara's neighborhood, and began the 2-block walk to Sara's. The steaming sidewalk proved abusive to her feet, which squished inside her dirty, creaking footwear. Clutched in Steph's fist was the pen, which her fingers were compulsively fondling with one hand while she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph headed up the front walk of Sara's house and knocked.  The short brunette answered the door. \"Oh, hi Steph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey. Listen, can I come in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really hot out here, yeah. Hurry up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go to your room for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to show you something...should I take off my shoes? They're dirty--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you can just dust them off on that rug. Or you can take 'em off, I don't care.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They...um, they may stink a little. I'll leave them on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...fine. Come on.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSara hadn't changed out of her designer gear from school, but her shoes were off; her bare feet scurried up the carpeted stairs to the dimly-lit second floor. Steph chose to leave her shoes on. Biting her lip, she wiped the treads on the mat in the hall and followed after Sara to her room. The house sounded empty.... All the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteph shut the door to the plush bedroom behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Sara asked with growing worry. Steph's body language was screaming that she had a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'm going to show you something wild. I hope you believe me. I was on the trail coming home from school, and I found this...pen. I mean, it looks a little like a pen. But it can shrink things. ANYthing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you talking about? What do you mean? \"Shrink\" like it's...a therapist? A portable one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop being dense. I mean SHRINK! Like \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" shrinking. I don't know how it works but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show it to me.\" Sara interrupted, still skeptical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here it is.\" Steph unsheathed the gleaming cylinder and held it up. \"Let me show you turn it on...\"</span></div></div>",
