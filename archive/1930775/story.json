At least once you thought because if you had no experience with the matter you would be afraid but holy moly this is real and the striking figure of the girl before you was so excruciatingly intimidating you could only look up. Black boots, warm blood, the two soon to mingle and mix. It's a taunting drag, the descent of Trucy's foot but you stay in it for the show. Once you had been on a rollercoaster and were so positive that yes oh yes you would ride it but at the last moment jumped from the cart onto the safe ground and realized you could have died just then locked in that standing position. The ride moving so fast so immediately you're flung into nearby brush half the man you used to be in a physical sense. Viscera strewn about, all about, pronouced dead before the doctor even saw you. There's a little design on the bottom of Trucy's sole that looks like a muted horn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite your sudden courage to live for less than twenty seconds longer your legs turn into wheels (metaphorically) and you whiz away from Trucy, the pace of her descsnt now violently quickened and sickeningly real since you have returned from your daze. When you run you imagine if it would be better to die a human or a bug, at least the complications of human death would be a thing of the past and honestly 99% of things are harder when you're alive. You don't stop despite these thoughts but there's a chance you could slowdown and give the dame a chance to crush you.</span></div></div>",

It was a small cramped room with a bed parked up against the wall opposite of the desk you just realized you were under, as well as a chair you were right underneath at this time. Then you looked to your left and saw that it was dark out, and that the light you saw was from the lamp on top of the desk.

Consisting of a white short sleeved shirt with dark blue stripes on the sleeves and a dark blue handkerchief with white stripes along the edges tied around her neck, and a yellow one tied underneath that one. As well as a badge with a twin scale on it, like the scale's of justice. The girl was also wearing a dark blue colored skirt with black lines that ran up and down the skirt itself. The girl also had black socks that went just past her knees and white and yellow shoes. She also had a single black glove on her right hand that was fingerless on her pinky and ring fingers that also had a sky blue ring around the wrist. Her hair color was a reddish orange, her eyes were blue, she had a blue ribbon tied around her head holding a part of her hair in a ponytail off to the left side of her head, and she had a small golden moon shaped earring on her right ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd lastly, she had a strange object around her neck that seemed to be changing color's and had a small face on it that was changing as well.

You can't even enjoy it, it hurts too much to use your neck (<i>hey, you chose this route!</i>).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As they say in German, \"Bis sp\u00e4ter!\" And with that, Athena's gigantic rump crashed down upon you little body, totally covering you in the cloth from the skirt, completely enveloping you in her butt's radiating heat. You were covered in sweat...from you AND Athena...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, you wish you could enjoy this, but her incomprehensible weight compared to yours was devastating to your shrimpy frame!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena apparently decided to get comfortable, because you soon felt your body sliding along with her colossal ass, scraping yourself against the hardwood chair. You could only imagine what other parts of her body could do to you in this state...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Goddess Athena soon got comfortable and settled down. She had brought a second chair to lay her legs across while she did some homework, writing on a notepad while using her thighs as a table, thus putting even more weight on you. You found yourself nestled in a wedge created by her imposing butt-cheeks. Your entire body had gone numb by that point, so it wasn't totally unenjoyable. The smell was pleasant enough, and hey, at least if you ever got back home, you could say you were this close to such a hot girl's panties, not that anyone would believe such a silly story anyways (or that you would tell anyone in the first place).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena got up at one point an hour or so after you were initially sat upon to get a cushion for her feet. But you couldn't even run away, let alone move with all the freedom you had for that fleeting moment. Your body was still extremely sore. So when Athena sat back down upon you, it was actually a relief. You for some reason felt lonely when she was gone for that one minute. You couldn't believe you had even an inch of attachment to this girl who has been torturing you since you met each other. But then again, to you, an inch was almost half your height...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Athena each fell asleep on that chair for the night, but what greeted you the next morning surprised even you...</span></div></div>",

Considering the immeasurable weight Athena had been pressing down on you with, you had expected to outright die if you lost consciousness at any point. That didn't seem to be the case, though. The feeling of something prodding against your side jolted you awake.<br>\r\nPerhaps more unexpected was the absence of the intense pain you had been dealing with for most of your imprisonment beneath Athena's ample backside.<br>\r\nThere was a dim light overhead; just enough to illuminate the vaguely familiar furnishings of Athena's room. You were equal parts dismayed to find that you hadn't <br>\r\njust been having an especially intense nightmare and glad to be alive and seemingly free of any lasting injuries. How that was possible was a secondary concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only occurred to you now to check what had woken you up. Hovering just off to your side was the tip of Athena's index finger. Your eyes snapped open. Beyond Athena's hand, you could see her face. She was apparently sitting on her knees next to her chair.<br>\r\n\"Glad you're awake.\" she said. <br>\r\nYou assessed the situation for a few seconds. You still weren't certain of it, but you really couldn't feel any pain from the places you definitely should have been nursing severe injuries to, and you idly wondered whether you might have a chance at getting up and making a run for it.<br>\r\nIt was that, or continue to be subjected to this lunatic's whims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't make it very far. Barely halfway across the cushion of the chair, Athena's gloved hand came down in front of you to block your path.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can't say I blame you for running...\" Athena said from behind you. Her fingers suddenly rushed toward you, closing around your whole body before you could move.<br>\r\nYou braced for the impending violent squeeze, but it never came. Rather, Athena's fingers gently pressed you to her palm as she brought you up to her face.<br>\r\n\"Hmm. I'm surprised you <i>could</i> run like that, though.\" she commented. \"Are you still in pain?\"<br>\r\nYou stopped your efforts to force her fingers away. Something was off here. She sounded earnest, like she was actually concerned.<br>\r\n\"... Not really.\" you replied warily.<br>\r\nYou yelped as Athena's palm suddenly shifted underneath you. She had given a heavy sigh. Her hand's movement brought her strange necklace into view for a moment. The display was faintly glowing green. Your view was obscured again when you returned to being level with Athena's face.<br>\r\n\"<i>Gracias a Dios</i>... I was sure you were really hurt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked in surprise. \"And why would you care about that-? You were the only reason I was getting hurt in the first place!\"<br>\r\nAthena averted her eyes. You could narrowly see her necklace again. The display had faded from green to a faint blue.<br>\r\n\"... I don't suppose it'd help if I said I was sorry, would it...?\" she asked unusually quietly.<br>\r\n\"Sorry...? Last night, you spent over an hour <i>torturing</i> me, but now you're 'sorry'-!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena didn't seem to have an answer. She carried on staring anywhere but directly at you.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not finished-\" you began to shout. You broke off as she held up a hand in front of you.<br>\r\n\"I'm not about to excuse what I did to you. It was... beyond cruel, and I can't honestly say that I remember ever being more ashamed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was your turn to lack a response. This girl didn't make even half a bit of sense.<br>\r\n\"So,\" she went on, finally turning back to face you properly, \"How about a do-over on our introductions?\"<br>\r\nYou blinked. \"Introduc-... what?\"<br>\r\nAthena managed half a smile. \"I'm not hearing a 'no', so I'll go first. You might remember, but I'm Athena Cykes, almost-attorney. You are...?\"<br>\r\nHmm. Having no memory of anything beyond waking up here last night was beginning to look like a problem.<br>\r\n\"I'm... not sure.\" you said hesitantly. \"All I remember is waking up in here. Pretty sure I wasn't always this tiny, though. That's all, up until you spotted me and decided that I must have been <i>dying</i> to meet your <i>ass...</i>\"<br>\r\nAthena's eyes flicked away once more. \"Right. Well... If you can't remember anything, all the more reason for you to have somebody big to look after you, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe. You know anybody like that? 'Cause all I see is a mood-swinging college girl who tried to kill me.\"<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on. I wasn't trying to <i>kill</i> you... But anyway, I can't blame you for not being ready to forgive me, but at least give me a chance to make it up to you. Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat back for a moment. This girl was hardly the kind of person you felt like entrusting your life and wellbeing to. But then, she was also the only person you had seen since waking up at a size competitive with insects, so...<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you replied, \"Fine. Going it alone at this size isn't looking like an option, anyway.\"<br>\r\nAthena's immediate reaction sent you stumbling backward to fall back onto the cushion. She had reeled back to throw her arms into the air, making a noise that you could only assume meant she was happy with your agreement.<br>\r\n\"<i>Wunderbar!</i> This is gonna be fun! You can be my little pet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pet...?\" you sighed. This was certainly better having her sit on you, but this girl's new suggestion wasn't exactly sounding perfect. \"Whatever. So, what's next?\" you asked, mentally adding \"psycho-bitch\" to the end of the question.<br>\r\n\"First, I'll help get you some new living arrangements.\" Athena replied. \"There, does that sound like something a psycho-bitch would say?\"<br>\r\n\"Hang on, you heard that? What, you're gonna tell me you can <i>read minds,</i> now?\"<br>\r\nAthena flashed a cheeky smile. \"Something like that.\"</span></div></div>",

It was plump with babyfat and heavenly soft, like a warm bed on a Sunday morning. \"You're just so cute! I can't get over it!\" Her voice shook you as it vibrated through her cheeks. Pulling you away, she smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned her grin, albeit sheepishly. That experience wasn't wholly unpleasant, but being as tall as a doll to an eight-year-old girl was still an unsettling experience that created a pit in your stomach. Trying to put aside your trepidation, you started to work towards... Well, you had no idea how you were shrunk, but staying here wouldn't help you. With that, you spoke up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, Pearl. S-so, ah...\" Come on, breathe. Relax... Not that it was easy, with the, albeit cute, enormous girl's face looming over you. \"Pearl. You're a big girl, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? W-well...\" The girl began kicking her legs. \"I'm only eight, and often need Maya or Phoenix to do things....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, think of it this way, do you wear a diaper?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's face took on an exaggerated pout. \"Wh- N- No!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that means you're a big girl, Pearl!\" You shouted up at her quickly to placate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl, relaxing, tilted her head, then beamed to the degree she nearly shined. \"Yeah, I guess I am! Hee hee, I'm es-pess-ee-aly big compared to you!\" To reinforce the point, she gently cupped your torso in her hands, her thumbs covering the complete upper part of your chest. Her embrace was soft and gentle, but your heart beat nervously knowing your well-being literally rested in the hands of a little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you sure are, haha...!\" Only now did you see the irony of that approach. \"Well, big girls have to do the right thing, OK Pearl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuzzling you in her lap, she kept her grip on you. \"Oh I know, don't worry! I'll take care of you, and feed you, and we'll play together, and you'll be...\" One hand released you and drew up to her face, cupping it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Pearl, right now you have to take me to someone who can help. I think I heard you say Maya-?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off by the girl's free hand slamming into the couch cushions. \"No! Maya is Nick's special someone!\" Blushing, she continued, slightly reserved. \"...You're mine~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- No, Pearl, I just need to get big again, and... Wait, what do you mean, \"special someone?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they...\" Pearl let you go and hugged herself, turning from side to side. \"...And then they...\" She cupped her face and blushed deep. \"...And then....\" Covering her mouth, her face burned red as coals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the eight-year-old's childish display of what lovers did, you felt a potential noose squeeze tighter and tighter around you. Hopeful you were confused on what she was conveying, you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Pearl, are you saying they're...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...In love~!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh-oh, you never considered yourself much of a winner when it came to women, but you never would've guessed it was because you were too tall!

That doesn't sound very safe Pearl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll be so much fun!\" She nuzzled her hands. \"If you fall, I'll catch you, and if I don't, it's nice and soft!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the curtain of pink that seemed to stretch miles above you. It was somewhat loose, so you felt you <i>could</i> climb it, but... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, maybe there's another game we could play...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you! Don't worry, here, I'll give you a head start!\" Gently pinching you by your shoulders, you felt like a kitten being carried by its mother as she plopped you on her sash, a few inches up from her lap, at least to her. \"Now... Go!\" With a giggle, the game was on. Holding close to her dress, you breathed in the scent. It was clean with a hint of flowers, like fresh laundry. With a gulp, you began your ascent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was surprisingly easy, there were many folds in the cloth to grab and push off of, making it much easier than you had initially suspected. You dared not look up or down, but you could feel the young spirit medium's gaze, as if it were pushing you down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Pearl? Could you please not stare so hard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? This is so much fun! It's no fun if you you climb while I'm not looking!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo much for that, you thought. Perhaps... \"Well, what's so fun about it? You're just sitting there, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt yourself enveloped in pink as the girl shuffled herself to a more reclined position, thinking on your words. \"Well...\" She began. Still with eyes full of cloth, you could feel her gaze return. \"I dunno! It just feels funny, that a tiny person is climbing on me! It makes me feel big! It's like... It's like I'm a planet! Yeah, Planet Pearl, with the brave little explorer!\" She squealed, overjoyed at the thought. If she was a giant, you felt you could see her perspective. Even if she were stomping through the streets tall as buildings, at least everyone would be experiencing what you were now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow would Pearl react to that? Everyone running scared, as the gargantuan eight-year-old gleefully skipped through the city, each step shaking the earth as she delighted in what a big girl she was, all grown up. Even if she played exclusively with you, at least you'd be normal sized, and others aware of your plight. But as it stood, Pearl wasn't a planet, but she was your whole world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that made you feel very small. </span></div></div>",

Pushing yourself into the cloth once more, the familiar scent no longer relaxes you, but rather reminds you of your size, your place, as a bug crawling on a little girl's dress, solely for her amusement. Before she speaks again though, you shunt out all thought, and resume the climb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel disconnected from yourself, the rustle of the fabric around you muted in your ears, as well as the occasional giggles above. Your limbs long since began to ache, but even that is dull. You feel yourself climb not because you have the strength, but because you have nothing else left to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo run from her toes to her forehead would be a marathon to you, this little girl, you realize, is your new world. You are hers, and that is in fact a mercy, because without her there would be no way to help yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing both your mental and physical journeys, you manage to pull yourself over her collar, her porcelain-white skin a vast expanse before you.

Not moving a muscle in the titaness's grasp, you stayed limp, your gaze centered on her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm hm hm hmm, hm hm hm hmm~\" The young girl hummed as she kicked her legs. \"Hmm- Mmf!... Ahh....\" The girl's hum ended with a push followed by a sigh of relief as you heard her pee hit the toilet water. The splashing created it's own tune, as Pearl relaxed, letting her body take its natural course. As the sound reverberated from the small room, you couldn't help but imagine as you stared blankly into the panties what it would be like to be in there, especially after she was done. Was she old enough to know to wipe? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo no no, stop it! She's a little girl! As you tried to shake yourself of such depraved thoughts, you felt your stomach lurch as she, finished with peeing, decided to play with her newfound toy. Walking you along her thigh, you made sure to keep your body limp as she once again sang the tune to what was likely some superhero show she was watching. Thankfully, her voice drowned out yours as you nearly sputtered. Right in front of you was... Was... It wasn't meant for your eyes, nor anyone else's. The young spirit medium's unwiped pussy sat in full view as its owner innocently paraded you in front of it, oblivious to the detrimental effect it was having on your moral compass. You watched, unnoticing and uncaring of her antics with your minuscule form as a bead of pee shook at the bottom of it, shaking like dew on a leaf, before falling into the toilet below, joining the mix. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groaned in-time with her as her grip suddenly tightened. Pearl's face contorted with effort as she now began exercising her other end, the hamburgers she had eaten earlier awaiting their final destination. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile before temptations of the flesh tested your doll act, now limits of the flesh were being tested as the gigantic eight-year-old's grip tightened around you. Sweat beaded on your forehead as Pearl fought to pass her meal. You felt like a tube of toothpaste in her iron-clad grip, breathing a sigh of relief in tandem with the spirit medium in-training as a large *splash!* echoed through the bathroom. Before you could rest though, her grip tightened once more as you felt fear that you might pop from her godlike strength. What a way to go, you thought, frantically trying not to cry out, crushed in the grip of a little girl who didn't have enough fiber in her diet! With a few more toots and splashed, the girl's grip on you relaxed for a final time, leaving you gasping as quietly as you could manage. As you recovered, you could taste the air, what Pearl had done to it. Rather than disgust, you found your member erect and pushing into her palm! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe it would've been best to have spoken up in the first place, you mused. Ah well, better late than never. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giantess began to take care of your hygiene, you spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm alive.\" Pearl continued, not having heard you.

I am...\" You paused, thinking for a moment before the perfect idea hit you. \"...I'm a Spirit Medium Training Fairy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's eyes shined like diamonds as her mouth fell open. Every bit of her expression screamed \"Christmas two weeks early\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" She shouted, causing you to cover your ears. Pressing forward, you let your hands fall away as you continued. \"T-That's right! I only appear to young mediums with the absolute most talent and potential, and that's you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked as if she were going to burst. \"Oh please teach me teach me Mr. Spirit Medium Training Fairy teach me teach me teach me!\" She bounced and begged on the toilet seat, her panties still wrapped around her ankles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronically, it was that which made you reconsider. Your heart squeezed and your guts churned at the words in the back of your mouth, at the knowledge that you were abusing this cheerful, sweet little girl's naivete to satiate your own sick fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't stop you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, but the training will be tough! Do you think you can handle it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes yes I can I can do it, you can count on me!\" She gripped her bicep, as if to show off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm a terrible person, you thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well! The first lesson is... You must put me in your panties!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl's face changed from one of determination to confusion. \"...Um, how will that help me become a better medium like Maya?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wagged your finger up at the doubting giantess. \"These training techniques are ancient, and passed down from the time of the first mediums, and they absolutely work! If you don't want to advance though....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned in, jostling your perch on her thigh. \"I- I can, really! But, I just don't get how-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou interrupt her. \"All will be revealed in due time, Young Mistress Pearl! But that is the lesson, and it begins now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-OK, Mr. Spirit Fairy Medium....\" She conceded as she grabbed some toilet paper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah! Um, that is forbidden! Yes, you cannot wipe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl was shocked. \"But, but I'm still-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did say the training would be hard, didn't I Young Mistress Pearl?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantess nodded her head as she put the unused TP back. gently picking you up, she set you down in the hammock of her panties. Blushing, she began to pull them up, before you shouted one last set of rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, this is secret training! If you tell anyone about you, you will gain nothing! To experience the full benefits, you must allow me to remain here for a full day!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I'll really get stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise.\" You lied. </span></div></div>",

She also had a long, navy blue scruff with a golden design of a bird with three legs. She also had her long black hair held up in a ponytail, and it was supported by a big key and some flower clips. She also had a pair of knee high boots and socks that were the same color as her short sleeve shirt just over her boots.

Kay started smiling an even bigger smile now that she had a fan of her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing little guy. Where to start?\" Kay said as she started tapping her index finger against her chin while staring up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, i guess i should start at the beginning. Where the Yatagarasu first began.\" Kay cleared her throat as she began her long story of the Great Thief Yatagarasu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long before the name Yatagarasu ever came into being, my father, prosecutor Byrne Faraday, and my uncle, detective Tyrell Badd, had a strong friendship and partnership. The two worked on many cases together and eventually came across the Amano Group, which they found to have connections to an international smuggling ring. They also found a single witness willing to testify against them: Cece Yew, an employee of the Amano Group, who was subsequently put under the protection of uncle Badd.\" Kay paused to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, Manny Coachen, one of the smuggling ring's members, managed to evade Badd's surveillance and silence the witness. Unfortunately for Coachen, he was caught on a security camera, and so he was put on trial for the murder. In response, the Amano Group sent agents to lure Badd into a trap and steal the surveillance video, and thus Coachen escaped conviction due to the lack of the decisive evidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's horrible. And they just let him get away scot free?\" Kay just nodded once before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Badd and dad heard the verdict and saw Cece Yew's sister Calisto Yew wail in despair, they vowed to take down the smuggling ring by any means necessary. While Yew initially refused their offer to join them, the three later met again, and when each party realized that the other was actively hunting down the smuggling ring, they decided to unite for their singular purpose.\" Then Kay stopped talking, got up, and walked over to her desk, pulling some things out of one of the drawers before returning once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They knew that the smuggling ring's puppets were sent orders through distinctive black directives cards depicting a white Yatagarasu bird, and thus they thought to parody this by creating a white calling card depicting a black Yatagarasu. Soon enough, the Great Thief Yatagarasu began to grab the attention of the news by stealing evidence of corruption from various companies affiliated with the smuggling ring and exposing it to the media, leaving its calling card to show who had done the deed. While the legend of the Yatagarasu dominated the news for the next three years.\" You were amazed of all the information you were learning. The life of the Yatagarasu sounded really cool to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's so amazing. But how were three people so good at what they did? It seems a little complex to me that only three people could do so much for three long years.\" That's when Kay showed you the calling card she was talking about a moment ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three legs of the Yatagarasu represent the thief's three distinct traits. In reality, these three traits come from the particular skills that each of the three people comprising the Yatagarasu brought. First, the Yatagarasu always knows the exact location of the target object. As a defense attorney, Calisto Yew attracted the attention of potential target companies desiring legal protection, and so she could get close to the Yatagarasu's targets. Second, the Yatagarasu knows exactly how to disarm the security systems in the way. As a prosecutor, my father had knowledge of security-disabling methods and used a device called Little Thief to plan the Yatagarasu's heists. Third, the Yatagarasu never leaves a single shred of evidence behind. As the detective in charge of the Yatagarasu cases, uncle Badd could ensure that no evidence ever made it to the authorities. The Yatagarasu always managed to obtain the target undetected, and so the victim company never realized that it had been infiltrated until the evidence and the telltale calling card reached the media and it was too late. Despite the Yatagarasu's best efforts however, the leader of the smuggling ring was never found in all those three years.\" Kay looked exhausted. She got up and walked into the kitchen for a moment before returning with a glass of water. She drank the whole thing down before continuing her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In 2011, my dad stole a key from the Cohdopian Embassy, but during the same night, an embassy employee named Deid Mann, who was to testify against the embassy, was murdered. In a curious move, Yew sent the key to the police rather than to the media, and it became known as the Yatagarasu's Key. In addition, the killer, Mack Rell, claimed to be the Yatagarasu rather than the killer. Because of this, Badd interrogated Rell to prove that Rell was not the Yatagarasu, and my father offered to prosecute Rell and brought the key to court for the same purpose. While Rell had been caught on camera, clearly proving his guilt, he suddenly pointed to my dad and claimed that he was the Yatagarasu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So wait, this guy that killed Deid Mann knew your father was the Yatagarasu? Was he a member of the smuggling ring too?\" Kay didn't say anything. Rather, she just looked down at the floor like she was ready to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When court was subsequently adjourned, dad took Rell to Defendant Lobby No. 2 to question him. Just before court reconvened.....both my father.....and.......Rell.........were found dead.\" This shocked you even more than anything else thus far. Kay's father was killed? And in a courthouse of all things. She must've suffered a lot more than you realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, listen, we don't have to talk about it anymore if you don't want to. I'm fine just knowing what i know now.\" Kay just kept looking down at the floor until she replied--</span></div></div>",

She had to be, knowing what she did for a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Badd tried to head the case, but another prosecutor, Manfred von Karma, overruled him and placed his budding students Miles Edgeworth and Franziska von Karma in charge. Initially, it seemed that the two victims had killed each other, but Edgeworth found that this was not the case. Manny Coachen, who had come to watch the trial, was also ruled out because he had been under constant surveillance. Yew, having conducted her own investigation, then accused a close friend of mine, detective Gummy, of the murder. However, in another major turn of events, Edgeworth's investigations led to the conclusion that Yew was the real killer as well as the Yatagarasu. Yew then admitted that she was, in fact, an agent of the smuggling ring all along, and she escaped with the Yatagarasu's Key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait wait wait a second. You mean to tell me that not only was Yew your father's killer, but she was also a member of the same smuggling ring that killed her own sister? The same group she spent the last three years searching for? Why did she do all of that then? What did she have to gain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure. But the smuggling ring had been one step ahead of Badd and my father once again. Badd was now the only legitimate member of the Yatagarasu left alive. So he vowed to catch Yew at all costs. Later on however, he looked into Cece Yew's files and found that she never had a sister. Which means the Yew was never after the ring to begin with. It was just a ruse to get close to my father and uncle Badd. Nonetheless, the Yatagarasu was finished, and the trail to the smuggling ring was cold.\" Kay took another moment to catch her breath before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seven years after my father's death, i found his diary, and Little Thief, which revealed to me that he was the Yatagarasu. That's when i decided to finish what he had started and adopted the Yatagarasu persona. On March 13, 2019, i returned to Los Angeles to find Miles Edgeworth and even helped him solve a murder using Little Thief. This also resulted in the arrest of one of the leaders of the smuggling ring, Ernest Amano.\" Before Kay continued, she went back to the kitchen to get another glass of water. This time however, she drank a glass before returning with two new ones. One for her, and one more for you to drink while she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uncle Badd finally had his big break. He searched Amano's home and found the stolen surveillance video from the KG-8 Incident as well as the directives card that had led to the murder. That night, Badd broke into Byrne's old office, which Miles Edgeworth now occupied, and stole some files related to the KG-8 Incident, including a page hiding a directives card that Byrne had found. Edgeworth caught him in the act, but it was too dark for Badd to be recognized, and he managed to escape. The next day, a Yatagarasu calling card was sent to the former Cohdopian Embassy, which was now divided between Allebahst and Babahl. This attracted Edgeworth, Gummy, Badd, and myself, as well as Interpol and Franziska von Karma, to the building. Despite Interpol's best efforts, the fake Yatagarasu eluded them at every turn. In the end, the Yatagarasu's shadow had appeared and disappeared in the rose garden undetected, the Babahlese half of the building had twice caught fire, and two murders had occurred, one of whom was Manny Coachen, with each corpse found in each embassy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. Sounds like a lot of hard work was building up around all of you, wasn't it Kay?\" Kay nodded before saying--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Oh you have no idea. Edgeworth gained permission to investigate the crime scenes, and he unraveled a complex chain of events that had caused the myriad of phenomena. Eventually, he revealed one of the top Interpol agents in the area, Shih-na, as Calisto Yew, who had infiltrated Interpol as a spy for the smuggling ring. However, Shih-na managed to grab me and put me at gunpoint. It was during this confrontation that Edgeworth finally understood that both Shih-na and Byrne Faraday were the Yatagarasu. As Badd joined in the stand-off, he revealed himself as the third member. In the end, Shih-na's boss Shi-Long Lang stepped in and apprehended Shih-na, taking responsibility for her arrest as his subordinate. Finally having found the mole, Badd congratulated Edgeworth on his brilliant deduction and left it to him to find the real mastermind of the smuggling ring.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Now that Yew was out of the way, there was still the whole mess at the embassy to deal with. What happened there anyway? Did they find out who the real head was?\" Kay nodded before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hours later, Edgeworth, Lang, me, Gummy, and von Karma implicated Allebahst's ambassador Quercus Alba as the culprit of both murders, as well as the leader of the smuggling ring, finally ending the ring's reign of terror once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing! Truly an amazing story. But is that all? Surly there must be more to it than that, right Kay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really little guy. *yawn* After that...i just felt.....like.......\" Then Kay looked like she was going to pass out.

One of them was wearing a white lab coat with a dark green colored button up shirt, brown pants with the legs folded up just below her knees, and a black belt around her pants. She also had on a pair of black high heeled shoes with a small ribbon affixed to them that was tied above her ankles. She also sported a pink ribbon tied around her neck, and was carrying a purse of the same color which was filled to the brim with bottles of stuff you couldn't see from where you were now. She had pink shades over her forehead, her eye color was teal, her hair color was brown, she looked to be around five feet tall, and her skin color was white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the other woman, she was wearing a dark colored shirt which was having a hard time concealing black bra and massive breasts. At least to you they were massive. She was also wearing a short skirt of the same color, and a pair of white slip on high heeled shoes with a black heel. She had long yellow scarf around her neck with a purple magatama hanging just underneath it, as well as small purple earrings in her ears. Both her eye and hair color was brown, she stood in at around five and a half, and her skin color was also white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took ya long enough Kay. Did you forget we were coming over today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Of course not. Something happened to me a few day ago that i just had to take care of.\" Then Kay lifted up her hands to show you off to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talk...Kay, is that a bug in your hands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't say for sure Ema, but it looks more like a tiny doll to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A doll? Kay, aren't you a little old to be playing with dolls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a bug or a doll. He's a person. A really tiny person. Go on, tell em little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A tiny person? Kay, there's no such thing as a tiny--\" Finally you had had enough. you were fed up with everyone calling you some other form of tiny. So you shouted at the your of your lungs--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will everyone please stop calling me tiny!\" This got everyone's attention. Including Kay's. Then the other two girls started looking at you even more curiously than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did that thing just talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not a thing! I'm a human being. And yes! I can talk!\" This caused both of the other girls to jump back a few feet. Never in their lives have they ever seen a tiny man before. Of course, neither did Kay until just a few days ago. After a moment or two however, both girls came in real close to examine you. Now you were starting to panic a little. Their eyes were less than a few inches away from you, almost piercing small holes into your body as they examined you very closely. But that was cut short as Kay lifted you up and away from them, causing them both to fall face first onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. Why did you do that Kay? We were just looking at him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were scaring him. He doesn't like it when people look at him like that. Isn't that right little--\" You coughed a few times to let her know of her almost error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right. Sorry. We still need to figure out a name for you, don't we?\" You nodded as both of the other girls got back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait Kay, you mean that he doesn't have a name?\" Kay turned around to face her friends once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. He's suffering from amnesia it seems. He doesn't remember anything about himself. And to top it all off, his size is...\" Kay trailed off knowing that you didn't want to be called little anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so horrible. I'm sorry for treating you the way i did back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah. Me too.\" Bot of them said as they bowed their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No guys. It's fine. Really. I'm just glad you understand my situation now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Oh, before we forget, we haven't introduced ourselves. My name is Mia Fay. But you can call me Mia.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Ema Skye. But just call me Ema.\"</span></div></div>",

Mia was just leaning against the far wall looking at you every now and again as well. And you were starting to panic again, wondering what those two were thinking about. You knew it was about you, but what could they each be thinking about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Kay said as she brought in an extra chair for her friends to sit in. She pulled the other one out from her desk and let Mia and Ema sit down in them. Then Kay proceeded to sit down on her bed facing the others while placing you on her lap. The sudden rush of being placed there and being placed there made you blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is everyone ready to start the meeting?\" Ema quickly raised her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ema? Did you have a question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did. I was wondering what he was doing here? I thought you said that the Yatagarasu had only three legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, you see...\" Kay stumbled over her words for a moment before Mia interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, does he even know what the Yatagarasu is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I told him yesterday. He knows.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then he knows what we're planing to do tomorrow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well, no. I forgot to tell him that part.\" Mia just sighed as she shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kay, if he has no idea what we're about to do, then i don't think it's a good idea for him to be included in this meeting.\" Kay just looked down at you saddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless of course...you plan on making him a member of the Yatagarasu?\" Kay quickly looked back up at Mia in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a second Mia, the Yatyagarasu only has three legs, thus it only has three members. It can't have another member, or it'd be a four legged bird. And don't think there's such a thing as that at all.\" Ema said in argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well to be fair Ema, there's no such thing as a three legged bird either. But yet, here we are.\" Then Mia sighed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're right. The Yatagarasu can't have four legs. But who said anything about it not having a tail or a head? Something like that would still work, wouldn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, but--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or perhaps, we could use him as our secret weapon for tomorrow night's mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, our secret weapon?\" Kay asked as she didn't like where Mia was going with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when you showed us Little Thief last week? Remember that one room we couldn't get past no matter how hard we tried? The one with the small hole at the base of the final doorway?\" Kay pondered Mia's words for a moment before she snapped her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean that door?\" Then Kay pulled a small device out of her pocket. Then she started pressing some buttons until it started glowing green. And soon after, the whole room was engulfed in the same green light. It blinded you for a while, until you saw the light fade. But when you were able to see once again, you saw that the whole room became something completely different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?! Kay! What happened to your room?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it? This is the Yatagarasu's ultimate weapon. I present to you, Little Thief. With this, i can recreate any environment by the press of a few buttons. In addition, i can also the use data of the places the Yatagarasu plans to steal from. And from that data, we can find out where all the security devices are, how many checkpoints are in each sector, how many guards are in the building, etc.\" You were amazed once again. You had no idea Kay had such an awesome device. Now it was a no brainier Kay's father was so good at being the Yatagarasu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was right around here if i recall correctly.\" Mia said as she got up and pointed at the green double doorway. There were also two guards with guns stationed at either side of the door. As well as card scanners next to both guards. Kay then zoomed in on one of the guards feet. And behind them, was a small hole about two inches tall that seemed to go through to the other side of the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we had something small enough to fit through there, then we wouldn't need to resort to combat. We could just have that thing go in there and retrieve the target for us.\" Then Mia looked over at you. Followed by Ema, and Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. Let me get this straight. You want me, someone who's never had any experience in stealing anything, sneak into a heavily secured building with armed guards and steal something without being spotted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. If we think about it logically, then someone of your...stature, would be the perfect choice to send in there. You'd be small enough so that the only way you'd be spotted is if someone was looking right at you on the floor. Plus, you're the only thing we have that's small enough to get past that door.\" You started thinking through Mia's words. Then she smiled a wicked smile and said--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, if you don't want to do it, that's fine. It just mean's we'll have to kill those pesky guards and steal their card keys.\" Everyone looked up at Mia in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia! you're not actuality thinking about killing those guards are you? They may be working for the bad guys, but that doesn't mean they're bad as well.\" Kay said in argument. Then Mia brushed her hair aside as she said--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what would you do Kay? Those guards are packing enough heat to gun us down before we even make it five feet in front of them. There's no other way to get to that door unless we kill them first, unless he uses that small hole to bypass the guards, the door, and the security system.\" While you were afraid of sneaking into such a place, you also didn't like Mia's other idea. It was either you go in with them, or stay behind and pray to God that they find another way that doesn't involve killing those guards.</span></div></div>",

And recently, thanks to Ema, we were able to hack into the mainframe for a short period of time. Just long enough for us to catch glimpses of plans for a device that can rewrite the biometric data of any person who uses it. Basically, enabling the user to get past any biometric security system, such as fingerprint identification software, blood analysis, retinal scanners, and even voice recognition software.\" Mia said as she looked down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I never knew such a thing ever existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nether did we, until we got tipped of by an email that got sent to Ema by mistake, saying that the prototype had been finished and they were ready for testing, and needed it to be used on a low security area, such as the home of a non-wealthy person who has some kind of security in their home that they could hack into. When she saw that message, she looked into it and found the plans and brought them to us.\" Kay said as she looked down at you and back at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing, whatever it's called, is too powerful to be held in the hands of humans. If the person using it was intending to use it for evil purposes, they could hack into banks and steal money form anywhere in the world, steal other people's identity's, security cards used to get into classified areas, and so many other things. It needs to be stopped and shown to the police before they can mass produce them and take over the world.\" Even you had to agree with Mia on that point. That thing was far too powerful for any human being to possess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so it's powerful and we need to show the whole world what they've made so they can be stopped. How are we going to do that?\" You asked as Ema got down on her hands and knees and started showing you the floor plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prototype device is located on the 67th floor, on the east side of the building. They've got it locked up in that room we showed you before. on the other side of those doors is a room with laser sensors and security cameras. Pass through the lasers, and game over. The whole room locks up until the guards unlock them themselves. Same with the cameras. Don't let them see you, or else.\" After catching her breath, Ema continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still the matter of the final door however. It's keypad locked. The good news is that we know the code. The bad news is, you won't be able to reach it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do i do if i can't reach it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, i was just thinking, perhaps i could create some devices for you to use before we send you inside tomorrow night. You'll need to have some sort of spy gear if you want to take being a member of the Yatagarasu seriously.\" Ema said as she started poking her chin with her index finger before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, after that last door, the last room with the device has a floor that's rigged with a sensor that goes off if there's more weight on it than what's already inside. You might be able to avoid it, but why leave anything up to chance? I could create something for you to use while i create some other things for you to use.\" You liked the idea of having your own custom made spy gear that you alone could use. It made you feel more...unique that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, i guess we'll just have to wait on you to create my gear for the mission, right Ema?\" Ema nodded as she got up and walked on over to you and Kay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So I'll head on over to my lab and get to work on that. I guess that means you'll be coming along with me Little Thief.\" Ema said as she reached out for you, only for Kay to cover you with her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go with you? Why does he need to go with you Ema?\" Kay asked in a worried tone of voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how else am i going to get proper measurements for his gear? Make repeated trips back and forth to see if everything works and fits? No, it would be so much easier on me and my feet if he came with me.\" Ema says as she shifts her feet around, making you glance down at them for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kay, I'll make sure to bring him back in one piece, safe and sound. So don't worry about it.\" Kay looked down at you, still unsure of weather or not she should let you go alone with her alone, or let someone else go along with you two.</span></div></div>",

Mia, what will you do while we're gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll go see how Wright's is doing.

What you saw was Kay, still in her pajamas, standing over you with her hands on her hips. Her expression was completely unreadable, but it was obvious that she was waiting for you. Before you even had time to react, Kay reached down and grabbed you off the floor, her slender fingers wrapping around your tiny body and lifting you up into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... H-hi Kay...\" You said, a nervous smile on her face as you tried to play this off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there, mister mini-man. I see that you thought you could sneak a peek at me changing without me noticing. You clearly aren't that bright if you thought I'd just conveniently forget to close the door all the way, and that it being cracked open just enough for a tiny little man who happens to be sharing a room with me to slip through was just a coincidence.\" Kay said, not even the tone of her voice giving you a hint as to how she was feeling right now. Apparently this girl had an incredible poker face <i>and </i>the ability to hide her emotions when talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally you slapped yourself for falling into such an obvious trap. You should have just sat back and ate that bread that she left for you, but <i>nooo</i>. You just had to let your arousal get the better of you.

She was right. Even though you had only just met her, you were really starting to like Kay a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your face turn bright red like that, Kay began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwww, you're so cute little guy! Okay, since you wanted to see it <i>sooo</i> much, I'll be nice and give you the show that you came here to see.\" Kay said, grinning mischievously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay then set you down next to the sink. Your mind was struggling to wrap itself around what you had just heard. Was Kay really going to do what she was implying?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got your answer as Kay winked seductively at you and began slowly stripping off her clothes one piece at a time. With each piece she removed, your face turned more and more red. Soon she was standing before you in all her naked glory, and you practically fainted from the intense arousal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Kay shot you a teasing look before snapping her fingers to bring you back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay pipsqueak, show's over. Let's get to bed now before you explode all over my counter.\" Kay said, quickly slipping on her pajama's and scooping you up once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kay... What was... Did you really just...

What do you want me to do exactly?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKay had to pause and think about this for a second.

Your reward is yet to come, although if you would like to rest under my perfect toes until we reach might domicile you may.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, her toes lifted until they touched the top of her shoe. They left a nice cozy looking spot right underneath them. Your mixture of exhaustion and arousal spurs you on as you slide right into your new temporary bed. You lay a few kisses on her big toe to let her know that you were ready. The toes descended upon you, gently covering you like a blanket covering a scared child. Your raging erection, which up until this point you had forgotten about, rubbed pleasantly between two of her toes. With a pleased sigh, you slowly drifted to sleep. </span></div></div>",

The fine fabric of her nylon stockings was hanging just a little ways out of your reach. This was easy enough to overcome; a leg up from the edge of her boot was all you needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could hear the continued grumblings of your new host from off in the distance. Whatever she had on her mind was lucky for you, as it was keeping her from swinging her legs down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway up her calves, you began to get distracted with admiring the smooth skin beneath the silky nylon, which, unfortunately, drew your attention away from your task at just the wrong moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman's thick fingertips suddenly rushed in toward you. With a yelp, you ducked and dropped flat against her leg, just below the knee. The woman scratched at a spot you had just been climbing a few seconds earlier, and her hand retreated.<br>\r\nHesitantly, you resumed the climb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more seconds finally brought you to the short plateau of her knee. Beyond that, her thigh crossed over her other leg and met up with it inside of her skirt.<br>\r\nYou felt a reckless desire to climb along her thigh and reach that alluring spot, but you had priorities right now.<br>\r\nLooking up at the woman's face, you waved one arm to get her attention, while using the other for stability.</span></div></div>",

Plus it's less of an inconvenience to put you in my bra or panties when I can't be bothered to place you in my shoes.\" Well all this sounds just fine and dandy, but you can tell things are about to go abit south. Just as soon as she finished her sentence, her hand clutched around you tightly almost crushing you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you are a bad pet, however, you will need to be punished. They will be as severe as the rewards are kind. You will be used as a shoe cleaning slave, or a general housekeeper, and I will put you though more pain then you can imagine. Don't cross me little man, or the consequences will be very dire. Are we understood?\" You nod rapidly hoping to get started on the right foot, no pun intended. She loosens her grip on you, finally allowing you to breath easy again, while smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? I can be a kind owner as well. Just to prove it you can pick out what we do first. I will even put my email on hold for the rest if the day. Whatever your heart desires is yours my little man.\" Now you are faced with quite the quandary, what to do first?

Hey, that--\" you shouted as you immediately sat up, but you cut yourself off when you noticed your surroundings!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look upwards to see a giant woman's pink fingernail above your chest, with her even larger (and admittedly pretty) face staring back down at you with a huge grin!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shocked, huh? I guess I would be too if I woke up only a few inches tall. Unless you've always been this way, then that makes your discovery even more incredible! By the way, I'm Ema, Ema Skye, and you're going to make me famous among the scientific community!\" Ema squealed to herself. But you could barely  understand what was even going on in her flurry of words! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you shrunk, and she found you? This is way too weird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait, pink tinted glasses, lab coat, an endearing love for science, she must be Ema Skye from the Ace Attorney series! (that and she did say her name was Ema Skye)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her attire and mid 20's appearance, you must specifically be in Apollo Justice! But how did you end up shrunken in your video game?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, speak up, I know you can talk! Have you always been this small or were you shrunken by some amazing marvel of science? Are you human? What's your name?\" As Ema begins to barrage you with a load of questions again, you stand up and take a look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed you were in a bedroom, and were currently standing on a desk across the room from what you presume to be Ema's bed. Many posters with sciencey quotes, laws, and theories were hanging on the walls around you. You look over to see a couple of test tubes that completely dwarfed you in size. Hopefully they weren't for you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention back to Ema who has seemingly stopped her relentless \"interrogation\" and speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her your name and how you haven't always been this tiny, and that you don't remember how you got there. All the while Ema is writing down every word you say, probably \"for science\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I see, well that's somewhat disappointing. I was hoping for something much juicier, but this'll have to do. You're lucky I found you! But, if you don't mind, can we get some small (har har) tests out of the way first? I want to see what shrinking does to a person's mental and physical form. Ya know, 'for science'!\" Ema says, making a triumphant pose and sticking her pencil up towards the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well sure, I guess it couldn't hurt to do a couple harmless tests, and it'd be reassuring to know my body wasn't affected by the shrinking...\" you say. Ema wouldn't hurt you, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then let's get started! First...</span></div></div>",

Oh man, 86-60...that's rich...\" Ema trailed off laughing to herself at you ridiculous answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruthfully, you read those measurements on some ideal women's body size ad or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give a huge sigh of relief and fall into a sitting position on Ema's desk, and wait for her to stop laughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, okay little guy, I'm done, I'm done.\" Ema says as she wipes a tear from her intense laughter from her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" Ema says.</span></div></div>",

You could feel exhaustion creeping into your body as you neared your destination. Other than a few occasional twitches in reaction to your contact with her body, she at least managed to keep quite still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lengthy hair provided a reliable method of completing your journey, and with a strong sense of accomplishment, you at last dragged yourself over the curve of the peak of her head and slumped against the soft knot of hair tied toward the back of her scalp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few seconds later, her hand appeared from beside you, closing its long fingers around your body and gently bringing you around to her face. Ema was flashing a pleased sort of smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did a really great job,\" she said, \"That was just barely over four minutes! I'm impressed. This opens up whole new worlds of possibilities for more experiments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely certain of how you felt about that, but you were also too tired from your strenuous climb to feel like replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, for now, anyway, a deal's a deal.\" she went on. \"We can pick this up tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat little remained in the day had been considerably more peaceful. Ema provided you with an appropriately sized meal in the evening, and once it came time to head to bed, she set you on the countertop in her bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go and change,\" she said, \"Just wait here for a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she returned, -- now wearing a thin nightshirt and shorts, which only seemed to further your rather embarrassing acknowledgement of her physical attractiveness -- she picked you right back up to return you to her bedroom personally.<br>\r\nThe room itself was a big of a mess. Scattered clothing and scientific equipment lined the floors and desktops, making you quite glad that you had Ema to carry you over it all. You didn't imagine you chances would be too promising trying to navigate down there alone.<br>\r\nHer bed was like a vast plain of light-coloured fabrics, with high ridges made up of the uneven surface of the sheets and blanket.<br>\r\nYou very briefly placed on the top of the dresser next to the bed as Ema laid down, after which she picked you back up once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you'd been embarrassed by her before, it was nothing to this. Still smiling coyly down at you, Ema drew back the neckline of her nightshirt to reveal the gap between her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is your stop.\" she said cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you didn't mention that I'd be <i>in your shirt...\"</i> you stammered as she dropped you lightly against he chest, directly between the two heaving walls of smooth skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma cocked an eyebrow teasingly. \"You've got a pretty prestigious spot down there. You're really about to complain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, n-no, but-... It's not really safe, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure it is,\" Ema said, gently grazing a fingertip over the top of your head, \"I don't roll around in my sleep, so you'll be just fine. Get comfy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were fairly sure that your blush was overtaking your entire face by now. With a terminally awkward hesitance, you laid down with your back resting against the base of Ema's left breast. You tried to ignore the way it loomed over your head, providing some rather intimate perspective on just how very small you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. Easy, right?\" Ema said, resting her head against her pillow. She reached for the light switch on the lamp next to her bed, but before turning it off, she added, \"By the way; you might be tiny, but I <i>can</i> see that raging boner of yours. Don't try anything untoward, unless you're prepared to take on the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just another second to watch your blush ascend to new heights, she switched off the light.</span></div></div>",

You couldn't help but suspect that she was already having more fun with the experiment than you would have liked. You didn't have much time to think about this, however. With a small shake of her rear as your only warning, Ema lowered herself down onto the chair. The moment her body made impact with yours, you were pushed down onto your back, leaving you buried in the depths of the cushion, pinned down by her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, the pressure wasn't nearly as bad as you had expected. Ema's theory didn't seem far off the mark, as you weren't in any pain, feeling only a moderately heavy squeeze against your entire body from the two relatively soft sides. On the other hand, though, your other senses were a bit clouded. You were right around the centre of Ema's rear end, giving you just enough room to wriggle around a bit, but the cushion was easily forming itself around her, which prevented you from seeing or hearing anything particularly well. Mercifully, there were no particularly noticeable smells surrounding you, in spite of your location against her body. Ema was moving very slightly on top of you (probably taking down notes on her side of the test), and you though you heard a faint giggle from above you. It wasn't until several seconds had passed that you began to wonder exactly when Ema was planning on standing back up. She didn't seem to be showing any signs of being ready to stop, so you began to move around a bit, to indicate that you wanted to end the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma seemed to get the message. A small gust of wind pushed in at you as she lifted herself off of your body. Turning around, she smiled down at the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look alright. How did it feel?\" she asked eagerly, holding up a notepad and pencil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... OK, I guess? I think you were right about my... molecular structure, or whatever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma quickly scribbled a few lines on her notepad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!

Sure, the first test hadn't hurt, but you still had no idea what the limits of your tiny body really were. <br>\r\nEma looked thoughtful for a few seconds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" she said, setting her notepad down. \"Since we know that your base molecular structure has been condensed and fortified in proportion to your size, we should see if the same applies to your muscle mass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... What?\" you asked. Only about half of the words that you just heard made any sense to you, and they weren't the important ones.<br>\r\nEma sighed impatiently. Without answering, she lifted you off the chair and moved you over to the table. Then, she turned her pencil over in her hand and set the eraser down on the tabletop in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See if you can climb up this pencil.\" she instructed. \"This'll let me test your muscle mass and stamina.\"<br>\r\nIt didn't seem worth arguing. You looked the pencil over. It was slightly worn out, but it didn't look as if there were really any places to take a grip on it. Even so, you placed your hands on the metallic eraser casing and pulled your feet onto one of the small ridges. At this point, you encountered two problems. Firstly, there definitely weren't any dents in the wood of the pencil that were large enough for you to hold onto, and secondly, Ema's hand wasn't perfectly steady, which meant that the pencil was swaying slightly on the spot. After a few seconds of running your hands over the pencil in search of any handholds, you decided to try just putting your arms around the entire thing to inch your way up. This worked for all of five seconds before you inevitably slipped from the smooth surface. Ema frowned as you fell back down onto the tabletop.<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" she asked, leaning closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" you muttered, getting to your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I guess there isn't any good way to grip onto the pencil, then...\" she said, thinking it over. After a moment, she smiled. \"New plan.\"<br>\r\nSetting the pencil aside, she turned around and sat down on the surface of the table herself. You watched as she extended her index finger and set her fingertip on the table, right in front of you.<br>\r\n\"OK. Try climbing up my arm, instead.\"<br>\r\nYou looked up toward Ema's shoulder, high above you. Her arm was pointing fairly straight downward, but it looked like her sleeve would be easy to hold on to, once you could get to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a step forward, right in front of Ema's fingernail. Up close, you could tell that her index finger alone was thicker than your whole body. It would have been intimidating, if not for the first test she had tried. Not wasting any time, you grabbed the best hold you could around her finger and began to pull yourself upward. Her skin was smooth, but not even close to how smooth the pencil had been. As such, it wasn't too hard to make it up to her hand and the base of her arm. Ema was watching your movements closely, probably trying to check for any signs of exhaustion, considering what she had said about your stamina. Once you started up her wrist, the climb slowed down a bit, but you still weren't finding it very difficult. After around half a minute, you reached her elbow, where the sleeve of her green shirt started. The fabric was much easier to hold onto, and in less than half the time that the first part of the climb had taken, you pulled yourself up onto her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work! You don't even look tired!\" she said as you pushed away a lock of her hang that had swayed against you. She quickly wrote a few notes on her notepad again. \"OK. You're doing well so far, so let's take a break.\"</span></div></div>",

Indeed, everything around you looked like the contents of someone's bedroom. A girl's probably. Judging by the collection of stuffed animals arranged nicely in rows based on the size of the animals. You tried pinching yourself and even punching yourself a few times to wake yourself up from this bizarre dream. But you didn't wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this actually real?\" You asked yourself. Before you could ponder more on that thought, a strange odor filled your nostrils. Turning around, you saw a MASSIVE pair of black high heels towering above you like buildings. Much to your relief, the heels had no wearer at the moment. Though the thought of something large enough to wear them provided you with a painful reminder of how helpless you must be right now. Resting off to the side of the heels were a larger pair of black socks. This was the source of the smell from earlier. You looked around the room, trying to understand your surroundings. The rest of the room layout seemed normal for a bedroom. It had a bed, a wardrobe, closet, side table with a lamp and some books on it, a desk with a computer, and two doors. One of which was partially open. Just then, the ground started to shake. The vibrations grew more and more powerful until you heard something trying to open the closed door. The door opened and in walked a titanic woman with golden hair that was held in a ponytail. Which looked like it would go down to around her neck if it wasn't. She had thin, basic glasses over her eyes. Her attire consisted of a black, shoulder-less top and black pants with a gray belt. She was currently walking around barefoot, and had a nervous look on her face, and seemed to be sweating a lot. As well as playing with something in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second...isn't she?-\" Then it hit you like a ton of bricks. This woman was none other than Adrian Andrews. A woman who appeared in JFA, and T&amp;T. Part of you wanted to ask her for help, but you didn't know if you could trust this her. You'd have no way to save yourself if she decided to keep you as a pet or a toy. For now, hiding was your best option. At least until you had a better understanding of how she acts around others.</span></div></div>",

But when she did, you almost wished she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-Oh-my-God-O h-my-God-Oh-my-God!\" She was repeating herself over and over. She looked like she was about to go into shock. She was also hyperventilating. She was also pacing back and forth from the door to the bed over and over again as well. Whatever had her upset must really have a strong grip on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is happening. I didn't know it would do that. I didn't know a child's plaything could do something like that. OH MY GOD! I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!!!\" Adrian started hitting herself on the side of her head as well as biting the tip of her tong. She seemed upset over a toy? Of all things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know it would do that. How could I know that a little game like that could pull a person out of their own world? HOW COULD I KNOW?!\" She started hitting herself again. But something struck me as odd. She said something about a game that could pull people into another world? Why did that sound so-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a second. Where is he? I thought I put him next to my shoes-WHY ISN'T HE HERE?! Did I step on him?!\" Adrian then starts checking the bottom of her feet for signs a bloody mess that could have been you. But when she saw her feet were clean of anything {Except the sweat from being worried so much.} She started to calm down a little. {Just a little. You could barely notice it.}<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. So he's not under my feet. That mean's he's still somewhere in my room.\" Adrian then takes a quick look around her room for signs of the tiny life that is you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Are you still in here?\" Adrian then took a took a few steps towards the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't be afraid of me. I just want to help you. So please come out. Just to show me you aren't dead. Please?\" She stopped with her feet just inches away from the leg of the bed you were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This girl worry's to much.\" You told yourself as you held your nose. The smell from her feet alone was enough to make you sick. It was almost like, whenever she gets upset, her whole body starts to stink up. And Adrian must have noticed it as well. Because when she brought her hand up to her chin to ponder where you might be, her face turned to disgust. She then smelled the rest of her arm's, then underarm's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God that's nasty. I really need to stop sweating like this. It always makes me smell bad. Guess I'd better put that stuff on again.\" Adrian then starts to walk away from the bed. Still looking at the floor, making sure she doesn't step on you. She then walks out the door she came in from and closes in shut. So now she's gone. But not for long. But was that such a bad thing? She really sounds like she wants to take care of you. But at the same time, you know how much of a klutz she can be. Like that time in T&amp;T, case three, when she dropped the vase that had the letters I AM on the front, and she even rearranged them to spell AMI as it said in JFA. But still, she was the one clumsy enough to drop it in the pink paint in the first place. If she could do that to a priceless vase, how in the world could she handle a tiny person who has no idea where he is anymore? As you were thinking about what to do, Adrian walked back into the room again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh. Much better.\" She then walked carefully back to her bed and sat down on it with her feet right next to you. You didn't dare smell them again. But something looked different about them. It looked like they had a shine to them. And it looked like they were smoother then before. That's when you decided to give them a quick sniff. So you got right next to them, sniffed them, then pulled back, covering you nose. But when you did, you wanted to smell them again. Something was different about them. They smelled...nicer. So you let go of your nose and sniffed them once more. They still smelled sort of like sweat. But not as bad. They also smelled like cherry blossoms. It wasn't a strong scent, but it wasn't a bad one either. It was...perfect. Just then, while you were caught up in thought, her heel came back and knocked you into the bed leg. It didn't really hurt, it just caught you by surprise. Then it went up onto the bed. You heard some rustling on the bed above you. Like she was getting ready to go to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to take a quick nap. Make yourself at home. Just please don't leave the room. It's really dangerous out there for someone so small like you.\" You heard her covering herself up under her blankets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And one more thing, please don't come up here while I'm sleeping. I tend to attack my bedding in my sleep. Always dreaming about all the times I've screwed up In my life.\" And then she stopped talking and started sleeping. This looked like the perfect time to get a better understanding of your situation. You could have a look around her room. Or you could try to climb up her bed and get in contact with her. But she said that she tends to attack her bed in her sleep. No doubt over the events that happened in JFA. Or you could try to leave the room and go explore somewhere else. But that sounds more dangerous than the other two options. If you left her room, She would still think you were in there. And she might act even more klutzy than normal outside. In the end, you decided to- </span></div></div>",

And besides, if you just left her here, she would just feel more worse wondering where you ran off to. You walked out from under the bed and over to a part of the bedsheets that were touching the floor. You grabbed on, and started climbing up them. It took you a while, but you soon found yourself on top of the bed. After you caught your breath from the ordeal, you saw Adrian under the covers with her face facing the other side. Her body also covered the whole length of her bed from top to bottom. She was really tall for a woman. And her feet were no different. they must have been at least size ten. And it was really cute the way her toes just came out of the covers. You walked over to her feet under the covers. You were about to go under and play with her feet, but then you felt a tinge of guilt. What if she woke up and saw what you were doing to her in her sleep? What would she think of you then? After all she's done for you so far. She'd think you were a freak or something. She'd probably just tell you to get lost and never come back, leaving you to care for yourself in a world where no one knows you even exist. But your urges were strong. Sometimes too strong even for you to control. You sat down, facing away from her feet and thought long and hard about what you should do.</span></div></div>",

She looked really beautiful the way she smiled even though she was asleep. You then climbed up her pillow and walked over to right in front of her face. You were just inches away from her red lips. Then all of a sudden, she started yawning, and you could see all of the inside of her mouth. Her big red tongue lifting to the roof of her mouth, her big white teeth wide open, and her uvula hanging right over her big, wide, throat. The thought of being inside her mouth started making you feel a little excited. You didn't know why at first, but then you remembered hearing about a group of people who had fantasy's about being inside other women, as well as doing things to women that they wouldn't otherwise know about. Then it struck you like a bolt of lightning. Was I one of those people? After that, you saw that her mouth was already closed. It must have done that while you were deep in thought. That's when you saw a strand of her golden hair running over the side of her cheeks. You then walked over to it and tugged on it gently. Making sure you could hold on without slipping.

You then walked right in front of her face and yelled-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAKE UP ALREADY MS ADRIAN ANDREWS!!!\" It was enough to get her to jump right out of bed and onto the floor with her feet hanging up over her.

The scent is strong but not overpowering, a calming sensation rushes through your body every time you inhale. Your efforts are being definitely appreciated, if the moans coming from April are any thing to go buy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm! You are just wonderful down there little guy! I think I might need a rub like this every day, although I doubt you mind that huh?\" The positive reaction plus her teasing statement makes you happier than you ever thought possible.

You wondered what she was trying to say...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute or so Vera stopped sketching and looked back down at you, but now you could see she was madly blushing, probably extremely embarrassed for not even being able to talk to you directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched her sketch pad to her chest tightly and slowly turned it around revealing...</span></div></div>",

She looked quite young actually, and quite pretty. She was wearing pink oven mitts that completely covered her hands, a large blue overcoat, snow boots, one of those Russian hat things that you could never remember the name to, and an apron. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had shoulder-length wavy blonde hair and was holding a large silver platter with the lid over it.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As soon as you woke up, you immediately clutched your head in pain. You had no idea where you were or what had just happened to you. Every time you tried to remember something from your past, a sharp pain flashed through your head. It was as though your memories were being sealed away by some kind of supernatural force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for some reason there was one thing that you could remember perfectly well: your knowledge of the Ace Attorney series. You had no idea why that information alone was still fresh in your mind when everything else seemed to be locked behind an electric fence, but at least it was something. Maybe that knowledge would become useful to you in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs fate would have it, it very much did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to look around at your surroundings, the area around you seemed strangely familiar. To your left was a single three story building, and to your right was what appeared to be a storage shed. What immediately caught your attention was how mind-numbingly gigantic these buildings appeared to be compared to you. It was as if you had been shrunken down to a measly 3 inches tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as this thought entered your head, you heard something moving behind you and quickly turned around to see what it was. You were worried that it would be a giant cat or something that would carry you away and make a quick meal out of you, but much to your relief the only thing there was a brown cardboard box. Under normal circumstances, this box would have been just average sized, but with your current minuscule form it appeared to be the size of a mansion to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid box had a pair of holes in it near the bottom, and the side that was facing you was fairly decorated. There were a couple red warning stickers near the top and a picture of a panda holding a marker in the bottom left corner. You couldn't immediately tell why, but this box also seemed very familiar to you. It was as though you had seen it somewhere before, but that was impossible... Right now your only memories were of the Ace Attorney games, so why would something like this-!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyriam Scuttlebutt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was bad. Myriam Scuttlebutt was an... interesting character. At first she came across as just a mean spirited jerk whose sole purpose was to antagonize others through her slanderous school newspaper, but she later reformed and became a much nicer person, even befriending the three people she had antagonized the most. Though she constantly hid within a cardboard box, underneath it she was actually kinda cute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hoped that this Myriam was the post-reform version, you knew that the box she was wearing indicated otherwise. She had a much different box on after her character reform happened, so the fact that she was wearing this one meant that you were in deep trouble. As soon as you realized this and began to run away, however, a giant hand shot out of one of the holes in the box and grabbed you tight. You squirmed and struggled as much as you could against those gigantic fingers, but it was useless. She had caught you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she had you in her hand, the box lifted up off the ground to reveal the lower body of the young schoolgirl who had been hiding underneath it. Her legs were long and slender, with her uniform's skirt just covering her upper thighs. She had pads covering her knees, and she had a single bandaid on each leg. Though her body from the waist up was still hidden by the box, you already knew what this girl looked like. She had sharp eyes and long purple hair held into pigtails with a pair of gray clips. The girl in the box lifted you up to the hole near the top, where her eyes mysteriously glowed through the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sss Sss Sss... Hmmm, what have we here? A tiny little man? Interesting, very interesting. I wonder what I should do with you, little pipsqueak... Maybe I should keep you to myself as my own personal servant. Or maybe I could advertise you in the themis herald and use you to draw some new members to join the newspaper club. I'm sured there would be LOTS of cute girls who would jump at the opportunity to join my club and have a miniature man to play with however they want. Then again, I'm not exactly sure if I want to share you with anyone else... Hmmm, what to do, what to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit of thought, Myriam decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Myriam held you, her slender fingers wrapped tightly around your tiny frame, as she considered what to do next. After a few moments passed, she finally came to a decision. She set you down on the ground and pinned your lower body beneath her foot. The pressure was painful, but it was nothing too major. She clearly didn't want to break her new toy too quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, fun as it is running this operation without anyone to complain about the way I do things, being the only member of the newspaper club is a lot of hard work. You're going to be my ticket to getting a few new members to join, alright shrimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can't turn me into your club plaything! I'm a-\" Your argument was cut short as your captor peeled one of the bandaids off of her finger, picked you up from once again, and wrapped the bandaid around your head to silence you. Luckily there was just enough of a gap left to allow you to breath, but any attempts at speaking were muffled and undecipherable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sss Sss Sss... You're a tiny little shrimp with a big mouth is what you are. I can do whatever I want with you, so just get used to it. Pretty soon I won't be the only one playing with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, your box-clad captor carried you off toward the school building and entered the newpaper club's club room. With the bandaid covering your entire head, you couldn't even see where you were being taken. You had no idea what was going on until you were roughly dropped onto what you assumed to be a desk and the bandaid was quickly peeled off of your head, which was far less painful than you expected it to be. You assumed that this was due to most of the bandaid's stickiness being used up when it was wrapped around Myriams finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you even had any time to move or react, you felt a pencil being pressed against your back, and then that same bandaid being wrapped around your chest to secure you to said pencil. Myriam then pulled out a camera and began taking pictures of you from various angles. Once your little photo session was over, Myriam removed her box disguise and sat down at a computer in the corner of the room. Plugging in her camera, she set to work in creating the next issue of the themis herald, where she would advertise you as bait to draw in new members. When she finally finished and printed out the paper, she turned to the back page to show you the advertisement she had created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>'HUGE discovery! New species that highly resembles a human male! Just 3 inches tall! Only one known to exist! Join the newpaper club for free access to this bizarre tiny creature!'</b></font></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow that text was a large picture of you, and below that was a bit more information about the newpaper club. At the very bottom of the page, there was some small red text that said:<span class=\"cred\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"> 'The newspaper club is only open to girls. No boys allowed.'</font></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sss Sss Sss... How do you like that, shrimp? Just you wait, soon enough this place will be flooded with new members!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next week Myriam circulated the new issue of her per throughout the school. A couple days passed and there were no signs of any new members coming to join the club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, why, WHY?! Why hasn't anyone showed up yet?! Don't they realize what an amazing once in a lifetime opportunity this is?!\" Myriam yelled, slamming her fists down onto the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They probably don't believe that I actually exist. Anyone can make a picture like that with a little photo editing.\" You pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up and keep rubbing my feet, shrimp. I'm not in the mood for your sassing right now.\" Myriam said, sighing and laying her head down on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say.\" You mutter as you continue giving your owner a foot massage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had become routine since she mad you her club pet. She would often kick off her shoes and place you under her desk while she worked, forcing you to massage her feet to help her relax. At first Myriam was really mean to you, treating you more like a slave than a pet, but after the first few days the thrill of having a tiny life completely under her control started to wear off. By now she was fairly indifferent toward you. She would give you an order every now and then and you would follow it, but she didn't pay much attention to you beyond that. At the end of each day she would turn her box upside-down and drop you into it, and you would have to sleep in there until she came back the next day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was what your life had become now, and with still no memory of what your past life was like, you had no what of knowing rather or not this might actually be an improvement. After all, pet or not, at least Myriam provided you with consistent meals and shelter. For all you knew, the past you might not have even had that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, just as you were losing yourself in your daily ritual of massaging your giantess owner's surprisingly soft bare feet, a knock on the door snapped you out of your trance. Myriam quickly jumped out of her chair, knocking you over in the process, and rushed over to answer the door. As she opened the door, Myriam saw the last two people that she expected to: Juniper Woods and Robin Newman. Instantly the smile of excitement faded from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you... What are you here for? I doubt that you're here to join the newspaper club...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, that's exactly why we're here. That little guy in the picture is real, right? He's the cutest thing EVEEER! I wanna play with him!\" Robin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and as student council president, I feel that it is my responsibility to keep watch and ensure that no harm comes to this small innocent creature on school grounds.\" Juniper said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well that changes everything! Juniper, you're welcome to join. Robin, sorry, but I made it clear enough in the paper: no boys allowed.\" Myriam answered, the excited smile returning to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin then surprised Myriam by taking off her brace and revealing the feminine curves of her chest hidden beneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh my god! Robin Newman, the most hot-blooded boy in the prosecutor class, is actually a girl?! This is going to be a major scoop! I've gotta-\" Myriam was about to rush over to her computer and start writing up a new story, but Robin grabbed her by the wrist to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah ah ah, no you don't. If you tell anyone else about this, then the next issue of the herald is going to be your obituary. G-E-T I-T?\" Robin said, the cheerful smile on her face providing a terrifying contrast to the serious tone of what she just said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*gulp* Y-yeah, got it.\" Myriam said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now, where is the little cutie-pie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see him down there under the desk.\" Juniper said, pointing right toward you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see him! Come here, little guy!\" Robin said, rushing over to grab you up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then began to hug you as tightly as she could. Before she could squeeze the life out of you, Juniper tapped her on the shoulder to snap her back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopsies. Sorry little guy, I got a little carried away there for a second.\" Robin said, handing you to Juniper for safe keeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Myriam, what's this little one's name?\" Juniper asked, being incredibly careful while holding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no idea. The guy has no memory of anything about his past, so you can just call him whatever you want.\" Juniper said, now hiding under her box for safety. Apparently Robin's little threat scared her a lot more than it was meant to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so... Hmmm, interesting... Well anyway, since we're going to be fellow club members from now on, how about we spend some time talking and getting to know eachother better?\" Juniper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sss Sss Sss... Sounds good to me.\" Myriam said, coming out from under her box once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just leaves the issue of what to do with the little cutie-pie while we T-A-L-K. Anyone have any ideas?\" Robin said, locking her eyes on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

You obliged, climbing and sitting into her shoulder. She stood back up and grabbed her book pack. She headed over to a ladder and climbed up it, pushing aside the trap door she came through before. She climbed onto the stage and headed around to the walkway, heading back toward her dorm. It was dark out, so neither one of you two were too worried about anyone being around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes, you and Robin arrived at her dorm, entering her room.

You look like you're in a lot of pain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right; you're whole body was still hurting from your journey in her.

You started getting nervous, still traumatized by what happened only a few hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you neared her face, she stopped, holding you a few inches from her mouth. She extended forward, giving you a small kiss. She then started lowering you down toward her chest. With her other hand, she pulled aside her white and red shirt, revealing her bra and breasts. You looked up at her, unsure if she was joking or being serious. You got your answer as she rested you gently at the front of her bra, letting you go. She got back into her bed and layed down, allowing her breasts to act as giant pillows for your body. You layed back in her cleavage, her breasts wrapping around you. You immediately started warming up slowly, starting to feel much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ok in there?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Thank you so M-U-C-H. It's nice and warm.\"<br>\r\n\"No problem little guy.

When you look up, you see a gleam of light and then Robin's gentle face, smiling. As she walked, her bra and chest swinged side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs good as it felt, you knew you needed to get out soon; it was starting to get too hot. You tried climbing you way up, but it was simply too slippery to climb up. You couldn't go down either, her bra was too tight against her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only try rustling around until she noticed you. This took a while. After a few minutes, she stopped walking and seemingly sat down. You then heard someone talking about pottery and other types of art. It wouldn't help you to make Robin uncomfortable during class, so you just stopped and relaxed, trying to cool down as much as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost two hours, you felt Robin moving again. It was getting too unbearable. The heat was causing to sweat and become dehydrated. If you didn't get out soon, you were really going to die. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you thought it was all over, you felt Robin stop moving and suddenly more light gleamed though. You looked up, seeing Robin look down right at you. The light faded slightly again as her hand came down and cupped itself around you, pulling you out of your prison. You looked around as she moved you to a table. You were in some kind of closet that was full of folded up tables. There was a single light in the middle of the room. Robin placed you down next to a cup of ice water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-M-G, I'm so sorry. Drink some water, you burning up.\" You walked slowly to the cup and drank a quarter of the cup (Which to you was almost a whole cup). <br>\r\n\"Robin, its...ok. It's not your fault.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. You need to leave for your own safety. I'm too dangerous for you.\"<br>\r\n\"Robin, I've never met anyone who's as kind as you. Most of the people around here would probably just kill me on the spot. Your're the only one who I can trust.\"<br>\r\n\"Really? You...trust me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well you. You've been too kind to me for me not to trust you.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. That's really nice of you. Now, drink up while you can. I have class in half an hour.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really weren't looking forward to another class, but it would just have to be. For fifteen minutes, you just drank and drank and drank. Soon, your body was much cooler and you felt much better. Finally it was time for the two of you to go.

As Aura Blackquill stepped out of the prison doors and into the outside world, she couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief. After what was without a doubt the longest year of her life, her prison sentence had finally come to an end. At long last she was free once again, and it was all thanks to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Princess... She truly is amazing. Not only getting Simon off of death row, but even managing to get my sentence reduced to just one year after the stunt I pulled. I... I really do owe her everything now, don't I?\" Aura began to laugh to herself as she realized what she was saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo think that the person who she had held a grudge against for so many years, the person she had despised with every fiber of her being for killing her beloved mentor, would turn out to be the person that she was the most grateful to now. Even after she had held everyone in the Cosmos Space Center hostage in an attempt to get Athena convicted of murdering her own mother, that girl still went out of her way to defend her when it came time for her own trial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there was no way to avoid a guilty verdict in this case, but she defended her anyway and managed to convince the judge to reduce her sentence in light of all the good that came out of her actions. Thanks to her hostage situation forcing that retrial, Simon Blackquill was proven innocent, and with that the dark age of the law was beginning to slowly fade away. What's more, the Phantom who had been the cause of it all was finally brought to justice. Yes, Aura had committed a terrible crime, that much was undeniable. But she had only done it for the sake of her brother, and so much good had come as a result of it. It was thanks to Athena bringing that to the judge's attention that she was able to walk the streets again so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura smiled to herself as she thought about it. Those events had given her a new lease on life, and she wasn't going to let the past tie her down anymore. Much as the loss of her mentor still pained her, she knew that she had to move on. With her long hair being blown about in the breeze, Aura looked to the sky and felt truly happy for the first time in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't gotten any joy out of looking up at the sky like this since the day I lost you, Metis... But now, now it looks more beautiful than it ever did before. Your daughter has grown into a truly amazing young woman. I'm sure that you must be so very proud of her.\" Aura said to herself, placing her hand over her heart as she gazed skyward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as Aura was about to get on her way, she saw something small falling out of the sky. Said something was heading right toward her. Thinking fast, she quickly reached out her hands to catch this tiny something before it hit the ground. As she carefully caught the tiny object with both hands, Aura began to examine it to find out just what this strange little thing was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise, the object that she now held in her hands wasn't an object at all. Rather, it was in fact an incredibly small human male! Aura couldn't believe her eyes. How could such a tiny person possibly exist? It completely went against every scientific principal that she knew. The human body shouldn't be able to survive at such a small size, and yet from what she could tell you were still breathing, just unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura simply stands there for a moment, too amazed by this discovery of hers to even think about anything else. After a bit more time passes...</span></div></div>",

Only refer to your character in the second person (ex: YOU looked up. YOU told her YOUR name) you get the point by now. <br>\r\n3- Though most fetishes will be allowed please try to refrain from insertion, death, and digestion(though they are okay, don't overuse them). Mouthplay and vore (strictly oral) is completely fine.<br>\r\n4- No male/male interaction allowed<br>\r\n5- Your character is roughly 2-4 inches tall. Please keep it in that range and refrain from altering the size of anyone or anything else. <br>\r\n6- The girls can be whatever kind of giantess you want: kind, cruel, playful or apathetic, but give them a good reason to be those things and please try to keep them in character.<br>\r\n7- PLEASE use decent grammar and punctuation and keep the story in English. <br>\r\n8- Try to refrain from killing or ending the story early, if you do, give another option for a different outcome.<br>\r\n9- Though I will allow a short chapter once in a while, I will delete if you post nothing but one or 2 sentence chapters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the Ace Attorney games and female characters are included, so let's jump in!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGPs for good additions! Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 6/5/13: 100 chapters reached!! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 11/5/13: <b>Now that Dual Destinies is released, be warned that this interactive may contain spoilers to the game! You have been warned~!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 5/11/14: <i><b>Over 20,000 views!!</b></i> <b>Thank you all so much for checking this story out, but I could really use you additions as well!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdit 9/27/16: <b>Spirit of Justice is now released as well, more potential spoilers ahead~!</b></td>",
