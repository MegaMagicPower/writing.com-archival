He is a tenth generation Monster Combat Specialist. Who has been trained to take over the family business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tElthain is a world of sword and sorcery. Where monsters roam around and terrorize towns which struggle to prosper. Everyone in this world has the ability to learn magic, though some are more proficient at it than others. Mostly magic is weak unless trained and so the people have taken to creating magical artifacts to compensate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere are few powerful healers in this world, those that are strong in the healing arts are those who have been gifted the powers from a divine being which they worship as a god. Whether he is a god or not I am not qualified to answer. Since I cannot even tell if I am a god or not. Such a title was given to me by another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith this little information I leave you to your own devices. I shall not interfere with you unless I must. I will simply do what I have always done and observe. What fate awaits you I wonder? What road shall you lead young Riktal down? How shall his first day of school end? Though keep in mind, while you can control the choices young Riktal makes, you cannot control the choices everyone around him will. So even if the situation is the same down two different routes, the outcome may most certainly be different depending on the choices everyone else made on that timeline among the infinite possibilities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tMan this was such a pain. Why did I even have to come here anyway? I had already passed all the qualifications to become a Combat Hunter. But no. That wasn\u2019t good enough for mom and dad. You\u2019re still only seventeen they said. You need to finish school they said. Try to play nice and make friends they said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tried at the last school, I really had. It wasn\u2019t my fault everyone just got on my nerves. They wouldn\u2019t leave me alone and acted like I was too good for them. It wasn\u2019t my fault I had almost killed the principal because I had finally had enough of him gunning for me. He had had it in for me from day one. Ever since he had found out who my family was. He just hadn\u2019t let up until finally I had enough and put a sword through his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked down at my new school uniform. Shiny metal gauntlets against my hands and magically reinforced leather breeches and shirt. There had been more of course but I saw no need for a helmet, chest plate, and leg guards. I mean really, the uniform choice was a bit outdated. Combat Hunters didn\u2019t wear this garbage when they went out. At least I had never seen any of them wear it. But this was one of those traditional schools. Where those who were from old families or had above average aptitude went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo now I was stuck repeating the tenth grade. This class was probably full of whiney rich kids who didn\u2019t know which end of a sword to hold or the first thing about loading a gun. That or overbearing brainiacs who wanted to make you feel small by overcomplicating everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTake it easy Riktal. That\u2019s how you keep getting into trouble. Isn\u2019t that what big sis is always saying? You overanalyze and turn molehills into mountains. You haven\u2019t even met any of them yet. Keep your cool and keep to yourself for now. Let them do their thing and you do yours. In the end we are all on the same side. We all want to become Monster Hunter's. This is a fresh start. No one knows me here so they don\u2019t have any expectations of me. They don\u2019t know anything about my past either. This is a chance for a fresh start. I can do this. I just need to keep my temper in check. No killing anyone on the first day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a deep breath, quickly running my hand through my red and orange hair as if that would make the short cropped locks less noticable. Pushing my glasses up on my face absently with my middle finger I opened the door to the classroom and stepped inside, gripping my duffle bag tighter with my left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEyes. Twenty pairs of eyes turning to stare at me. Some narrowing in speculation, some glaring, a few even uninterested. But all of them focused on me. I felt uncomfortable as the teacher motioned me over to stand next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh! You are a bit early! Class! This is the new transfer student.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at me with a smile I felt was probably fake. He knew who my family was and he was probably already trying to get into my good graces. That was what all the other teachers did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you care to introduce yourself?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cMy name is Riktal. Nice to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood there as they all continued to stare at me. What did they want? I didn\u2019t know any of them. I wasn\u2019t going to give them any more information then they needed to know. Mine was an old family, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a few of them would know the name and try to get buddy-buddy with me for that reason alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Yetz coughed a moment before smiling again in the uncomfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, well. Thank you for the introduction. Your seat is that empty one in the back of row four.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave him a quick nod before heading between the rows, ignoring the eyes that followed me until I found my seat next to the wall. Before doing anything else I swivled the desk at an angle so my back could be partially protected and nothing could sneak up on me. I dropped my bag, hearing the faint clinking of the weapons inside knocking together. My father would knock me into next week if I were to ever forget to bring at least a half dozen weapons wherever I went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I sat down and pulled out my textbook on alchemy as the teacher returned to his discussion on making health potions. Propping my elbow on the desk and my head on my hand I let out a another sigh. I had mastered the three levels of healing potions long ago. Big sis Ulinia had pounded that into my head by the time I was fourteen. I probably knew more about it than this teacher did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I had to at least make an attempt to pay attention. It was bad manners to ignore someone out of hand. You never knew when they might surprise you with some extra little insight or tidbit of information you could use. My mother had knocked that lesson into me when I was five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs Mr. Yetz continued to drone on about the properties of the vierra plant and how the length of time you cured the Niploc leaves determined the potency of the concoction, I fingered the bronze hilt of the dagger at my right hip. Even though a dagger was part of the school uniform, this one held extra importance to me. My dad had gifted it to me last month as proof  that I had passed all his tests with flying colors. It was my unofficial badge of a Monster Hunter. Toying with the knife made me reach up and touch the red ruby inset in the silver chain around my neck. My mothers gift for passing her courses, just like the gold and silver ring on my finger was big sis\u2019s gift when I had passed hers. Yet they still forced me to come to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced around the room then, noticing a girl at the last desk by the windows with her head down. It looked like she was sleeping but I couldn\u2019t tell from here. A closer look around proved that everyone else saw her, they kept glancing in her direction quickly before returning their eyes to the front. The teacher saw her lack of attention as well, simply ignoring it. Just what was going on here? What was wrong with these people? Why didn\u2019t they say anything to her? It just wasn\u2019t right. I would have been beat around the yard until I was black and blue for doing something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMr. Yetz finished his lesson and sat behind his desk while the rest of the class worked on study sheets. The girl next to the windows turned her head to the side and I could see her eyes closed, a bit of drool coming out of her slightly opened mouth.</span></div></div>",

If I had to suffer through these classes and I didn't even need them, why should someone else get a free pass? Even if they were some sort of genius, that was no excuse in my book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sounds of scribbling suddenly stopped as the tension rose in the air. The teacher glanced at the girl a moment before giving me one of those fake nervous smiles of someone who was afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"She's, special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Meaning you are afraid of her or her family. Special or not, rules are rules right? If you bend them for only one person for whatever reason then how is that fair to the rest of us? And you better not give me some bull line about their being mitigating circumstances or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy sitting in front of me turned around and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Just give it up, it's not worth it. We all used the same argument before but nothing ever happens. Her name is Liz Hawthrope and she is ranked number one in the Combat department. Even if her academic grades suck she gets a free pass because she can lay the smack down on all the teachers here. Everyone is afraid of her, it's an open secret that the teachers don't want to admit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Mr. Yetz who glanced away slightly and I let out a tsk of disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Well if you aren't man enough to say something to her then I will. I was at least raised with a little bit of respect. And I'm not going to be cow-toed over some threats of violence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a small gasp as I stood up and strode over to the still sleeping girl. Some were whispering that I was being foolish and stupid, others that I was going to get myself killed. I ignored them all as I leaned against the windowsill and crossed my arms. With a massive heave I kicked out my foot, my boot smashed into the underside of the desk and lifted it up a few inches. It came crashing back down, making her head bounce as she woke up startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Glad to see you finally woke up. So mind telling me why you think you don't need to stay awake in class? Since you probably weren't awake earlier, I'm the new guy. And my feelings are a bit hurt you didn't even have enough respect to be awake for that occasion. Everyone seems to be afraid of you but frankly I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with her blue eyes as the bangs of her purple hair slipped down her forehead. Finally she laid her head back on her arms and turned her head away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Buzz off.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI grabbed her by the hair, lifting her head up for a split second before smashing it back down as hard as I could into the desk. I saw the blood spray out as her hand reached down to her side where her knife was. I was already spinning around behind her and was on her right side by the time she swiped at me. With a quick flick of my fingers I had my own dagger in my right hand. As I reached over to clamp my left hand on the fist with the knife, I smashed my own blade into the back of her left which was still flat against the desk. It buried itself up to the hilt, even as I forced her right hand to bend downwards and thrust her own blade into her side. I applied a bit of magic to my arms to increase my strength as I held her pinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know who the hell you think you are or what you think of me but frankly I don\u2019t care. You might be some genius messiah of combat training but if so you seem lacking to me. If you think combat is all there is to becoming a Hunter you are mistaken. I can only imagine just how little academic knowledge you may or may not have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo let me enlighten you to a little human anatomy 101. I just shoved a six inch blade deep into your side as you can probably feel. That queasy feeling you have right now? Like you are going to throw up? And that wheezing sound you hear? That\u2019s because I just punctured your lung. Soon the blood will start to come up your throat as it is pushed out by the pressure. Unless you get medical attention within a few minutes you are going to die. You will die faster if I pull this knife out just so you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlood began to leak out of her mouth as her eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow. If you paid attention at all in any classes except combat you might, just might know a few minor healing spells that every Hunter learns. But they won\u2019t work. Since I am imbuing your blade with my own magic to counteract any healing you might possibly do because I want you to suffer. There is more to being a Monster Combat Hunter then simply the physical combat. A good Hunter has an active mind that soaks up everything around them. I don\u2019t care how good you are or how good you think you are. The Association doesn\u2019t need a Hunter like you who can\u2019t show even a small amount of respect. What I just did is what a monster will do to you one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow if you answer my question I might even let you live. If you want to be stubborn then by all means say nothing and I will watch the life slowly drain from your eyes as you struggle in vain to take just one more breath. So I ask again, mind telling me why you feel you don\u2019t need to stay awake in class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe coughed up some light pink blood and wheezed a bit as she tried to suck in more air. I gave her three more minutes before her body finally gave out and she died. The realization that she was about to die seemed to finally hit home and her eyes grew larger as the fear set in. She struggled weakly, her energy draining quickly. Her struggling only made the time she had left that much less as she tried using air she didn\u2019t have. Finally she gave a final blood filled cough before looking at me to give her weak reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I already know all this stuff. I\u2019m a fifth generation Hunter. My parents forced me to attend school even though I should already be out in the field.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? Now was that so hard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled my blade out of her hand and let go of the knife in her side, halting the flow of magic I was sending down the metal. I wiped the blade clean on my pant leg before resheathing it. She was trying to heal herself, her hands glowing a pale white, but her magic was weak. Most of her energy had been spent in her struggling. Left to her own devices she would probably still die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGiving a small mental shrug I returned to my seat. It wasn\u2019t really my problem.</span></div></div>",

My temper was always getting the better of me, making me do things that I regretted later. Even if I didn\u2019t like her on first impressions I still had to help her. Lord knew I wasn\u2019t the easiest person to get along with at times and people had still helped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStooping down I dug through my duffle bag and found the spelled pouch I had gotten a few years ago as a gift. Opening it up I ran my fingers over the wax sealed lids until I found the small vial I was looking for. Pulling it from its seat I strode back over to the girl still trying vainly to live a second longer. I thrust the vial of red liquid with small purple spots floating in it towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere drink it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with that slight stupor of someone who\u2019s vision is going blurry but finally took the vial from me, breaking the seal with her fingernail. She spat up a bit more blood before downing the liquid and pulling the knife from her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was actually impressed by the way she handled herself even in this situation. I hadn\u2019t heard a gasp of pain from her since I had thrust my knife into her hand. She had bore the pain like a true Hunter, which was more than I could say for most people claiming that title I had met. Her body glowed with a purple aura for a second before she began to breath easier, the blood finally halting its flow from her side and mouth. Without another word I turned and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at Mr. Yetz as if he was stupid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo the principals office of course. There are rules about fighting and harming other students after all. Rules are made to be followed unless there is no other choice but to break them. A Hunter is trusted because he follows those rules and upholds the order they represent. I made a choice to break the rules and so now I must face the consequence. If I think myself better than the rules just because I am stronger or smarter or come from an old family or whatever other reason I can think of, then I am no better then a common monster. Without rules there is chaos, and a Hunter does not promote chaos. Isn\u2019t that basic Combat Hunter 101?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the room then and headed down the hall. My mother would probably pull me around by my ear and give me a lecture for getting into trouble on the first day. Not that she would actually care, as a mother. She would simply do it to put up the appearance of caring. I wasn't even an hour into my new class and already I was letting my temper get the best of me. Why did I have to be wired like this anyway? With such a short temper and everything seeming to set me off? Why couldn\u2019t I be more normal like everyone else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pushed my glasses back up my nose before entering the main office and saying I was here to see the principal. I took a seat when offered and waited. It didn\u2019t take long before I was up again, being directed into the principal's office to stand before her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was visibly older. Some women I knew tried to hide their age but she didn\u2019t. Her gray hair was done up in a classical bun as the wrinkles lining her face told a story of many smiles and a merry attitude. She was slightly plump but not fat, simply the creeping paunch of age since she no longer actively hunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me one of the smiles that transformed her face to that of a woman fifteen years younger. It was a sincere smile, one that reached her eyes which gave a small twinkle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what can I do for you Riktal? I wasn\u2019t expecting you back so soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI stabbed and almost killed a girl named Liz Hawthrope. I have no excuse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo excuse? No mitigating circumstances? No reason for your actions? You just simply decided to stand up, walk over and stab the girl for no reason?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo excuse ma\u2019am. Any reason or reasons I might have had do not factor in. The same with my actions afterwards. The fact still remains that I stabbed and almost killed her. So I came here to accept my punishment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou said almost, so she is still alive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCorrect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo I take it Mr. Yetz gave her a healing draught?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo ma\u2019am I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy? You had already shown you had intended to kill her by stabbing her. Did you feel guilty? Were you forced into it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo ma\u2019am. None of that. In truth I felt no guilt at all. A Hunter has no need for such things as guilt when he commits to killing his prey. But I am well aware of my own hasty temper. It has gotten me into a lot of trouble already. I am simply trying to make a new start here. Giving her the health potion is something I would not have done before. Since it is not what I would have done at my old school, I decided to go against my ideals and help her. That is the only reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe rubbed her eyes a moment before looking at me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour family is one of the oldest around. You are great Combat Hunters. It\u2019s for good reason you are all ranked within the top twenty in this nation. But I\u2019ve told your father time and again, teaching just the technical aspects isn\u2019t good. Told your grandfather too but he wouldn\u2019t listen. You just lose something in the process if you don\u2019t loosen up a bit and let a child be a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not blaming you for the way you see the world. It was how you were raised and trained after all. I know all about how you are already Hunter class. It's in your profile after all. You are more than qualified and honestly you don\u2019t need this school. But perhaps you can learn a bit of flexibility here even if we don\u2019t have anything new to teach you. Try to make some friends and loosen up. That is all, you may go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what about my punishment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou decided to save her life, I don\u2019t think a punishment is warranted. I don\u2019t run this school like most others. It is folly to think there will be no fighting between the students and no accidents. We teach you to use weapons of every kind after all. If I punished everyone who hurt another on accident or not I\u2019d never find time to rest. It\u2019s all about that flexibility I was talking about. Now if you had not helped her that would be a different story. Your act of kindness mitigated your act of temper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you still must punish me! The fact still remains I stabbed her. If you don\u2019t it will be seen as you giving me preferential treatment because of my family name. I\u2019m no better than any other student here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine you want a punishment? Then as your punishment you have to make two friends in the next two weeks. You may go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pointed to the door and I turned and left while shaking my head. What was she thinking? What kind of punishment was that? Two friends in two weeks? She must be letting me off easy because of my family. It was the only explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling lunch just as I made it to the staircase. The cafeteria was right down the hall, but my duffle bag was on the second floor. We would be going back to the same classroom after lunch, only the teacher changed out of the rooms in this school. Should I get my bag and take it to lunch with me? Would that be considered weird? If I was going to have to make friends it wouldn\u2019t do to be seen as the weird kid. But a Hunter never went anywhere without his gear in the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy stomach grumbled loud enough to wake the dead. I realized I hadn\u2019t eaten anything since dinner last night, so I pushed the hunger pangs to the side as I tried to decide what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tNo I had better get my bag. There were dangerous weapons in there I didn\u2019t want falling into the wrong hands. Granted everyone in this school was a Hunter in training and I would think they honored the codes of our profession. Especially the one that stated a Hunter\u2019s weapons were sacred and not to be messed with. Sometimes such weapons were handed down from generation to generation. They were an extension of the Hunter and anyone caught stealing one could be shunned to the point of having to quit being a Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill, even knowing all that it was best not to push fate. Wasn\u2019t there a law somewhere that stated if something could go wrong it would? So ignoring my grumbling stomach I climbed the stairs and walked down the silent hall towards the classroom. As I got closer I heard voices coming from inside. I didn\u2019t think much of it until I heard some of their words which made me stop and listen for just a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMan would you look at this! This is a bona fide Lexington double barrel! Do you have any idea how much these things cost? With a bad boy like this even a D class Hunter would be a mach for a low B class monster! I wonder what augmentations it has on it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on Gregory, put it away. It\u2019s not yours and you shouldn\u2019t be going through his things like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s the harm in looking huh? I mean don\u2019t you want to know too? Didn\u2019t you hear the clank or feel the magic coming off this bag when he walked in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I\u2019m not interested! If he wants to show us that\u2019s his business. Otherwise you have no right to do this. It\u2019s really close to breaking the code!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy you acting like you aren\u2019t a part of this? You didn\u2019t leave so you are just as guilty. Hey look at this! These are a high grade fist weapon that would be great for you. Never seen ones with blades on the knuckles before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey are called Roller Knuckles. Hey don\u2019t shove them on me I don\u2019t want them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell now that you\u2019ve touched them you are just as guilty as me so don\u2019t go blabbing or you will get in trouble too. I mean, aren\u2018t you the least bit curious of how it would feel to use them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI am a little, but this is wrong!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had heard enough. And I felt the anger beginning to make my blood hot. What would have happened if I had gone to the cafeteria first? Would they have ended up stealing my weapons? What kind of damage would they have caused? Yanking open the door I strode inside and headed right for them. One of the boys was in the process of bending down to put my knuckles back in the bag while the other one was staring down the sights of my Lexington, pretending to shoot monsters with it. They both saw me and got scared as I let an evil grin cover my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019d like to know how it would feel to use them huh? I\u2019ll make sure to arrange that for you. See? Am I not generous? Now put them away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy who had already dropped my gloves backed up while the one with the gun failed to catch my false courtesy. His eyes grew round and a look of greed came to his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy this time I was close enough to him as I smiled even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I sucker punched him in the face, causing him to real backwards. In one swift motion I used my foot to kick one of the roller knuckles into the air, grabbing it before it fell and pulling it onto my right hand before he recovered. Clenching my fist together the three small circular saw blades inset into the knuckles spun madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou better use it on me now before I tear up that face of yours with this glove.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I charged him, my right fist cocked back and the blades spinning threateningly. He reflexively pointed and fired at me like it was any other gun. As the bullet came out he was lifted off his feet and thrown backwards from the kickback. The bullet flew towards me and stopped in mid air as I ignored it. His back smashed into the window and the only thing that prevented him from falling to the ground was the fact that I grabbed his leg at the last moment. I heard his head bounce against the wall and the clatter as my weapon dropped from his hand, discharging once again as it hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith one hand I pulled him inside and threw him on the floor, giving his stomach a kick for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou went through my bag without permission, that\u2019s strike one. I won\u2019t count it against you for using it because I told you too. But you let it fall out the window to the ground, that\u2019s strike two. On strike three I don\u2019t give you any more chances. That weapon is much too high a level for you to use right now no matter how shiny and nice it is. I dare you to test me. Now get out of my sight before I really hurt you, but know I will remember your name. Gregory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy crawled on all fours and then ran out of the room as he managed to get his feet under him. With a sigh I pulled off the glove and took it back to the bag. Looking at the other boy who was backed against the wall as if afraid of what I would do to him I nodded my head towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet out of here. I\u2019m not going to do anything to you. You at least had the sense to try and stop him and you were already putting it back. I\u2019ve got no beef with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe ran towards the door, stopping before he left to look back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh, can I ask how you stopped the bullet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo secret. It\u2019s my gun and it\u2019s tuned to me. I\u2019ve got an augmentation on it so I can\u2019t get shot by it. Would be stupid to be hurt by your own weapon don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded and ran out of the room as I went back over to the window. Avoiding the shards of broken glass I got up onto the sill and leapt to the ground, using a bit of magic to cushion my fall. I found the Lexington and quickly inspected it, finding only minor cosmetic damage. Tracing the stray bullet I found it had only made a hole in the base of a wall, nothing to worry about there. Tucking the weapon into my belt I began climbing back up the side of the building, thrusting from window ledge to ledge and grabbing the small bits of handhold on the brick face until I was back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was putting it away in the bag when the door opened again. Looking back I saw it was one of the girls from class. She completely ignored me, having a sort of faraway look on her face as she went to the back of the room and began tending a plant that was back there. Once she was done she turned around and seemed to see me for the first time, giving a start of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t see you there! You\u2019re the new kid right. Rikky? Richard? Randy? What was it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal. Why does that name sound so familiar? Oh yes! You\u2019re the Zelkov that\u2019s going to help me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait how do you know my last name? Who told you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you mean? He told me of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe? He who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe One God. He speaks to me. He told me to become a Hunter. My parents don\u2019t believe me of course, I don\u2019t know why. Shouldn\u2019t a priest and priestess believe the most?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re a priestess?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell not exactly. I never took the rites so I only know some of the healing spells.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe came over to me and laid her hand on the side of my face with that absent look in her eyes again. I felt a bit of the warm glow the divine powers all servants of The One God possessed as her head cocked to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are lonely, angry and have a feeling that you are trapped. There is much pain inside of you that you hide well. You seem stable on the outside but inside it is a fine balancing act that can topple you in every direction at any moment. I do not know how to help you though but I know you will find the answers you seek if you make the right choices. There is a girl in your near future. One that can become close to your heart if you let her and will ease those feelings inside of you, giving back something you once thought lost forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked as her hand fell away, looking up the few inches into my eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did it again didn\u2019t I? I had one of my divinations. I\u2019m sorry if it freaked you out like it does the others. The urge just comes without warning and I can\u2019t help myself. A lot of people think I\u2019m a bit weird and I guess they are right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she went to her desk and pulled out a small box which she opened to reveal neatly packed food. Taking out a fork and saying a quick prayer she began to eat. I had a feeling this was normal for her, eating alone in the classroom. She was probably a bit of an outcast because of her power. Even though most people would be all over her trying to become her friend since she was a healer normally, those sudden burst of divination kept them at bay. Not to mention that far away look that seemed to cross her face at random. I would bet she was probably communing with her god in some way, but these kids didn\u2019t understand that, probably not having dealt with servants of The One God before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy stomach growled again, reminding me that I was still hungry. My eyes were drawn to the door and then to the girl again.</span></div></div>",

I rested my chin on the hands I folded along the back as I watched her for a moment but she didn\u2019t seem to realize I was there or care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do you always eat alone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe started in surprise at my words before blinking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh you\u2019re still here? I thought for sure you\u2019d run away like everyone else after I tell them about their future. But yes. I find this more peaceful and the birds sometimes come join me so it\u2019s not all that bad. So you don\u2019t need to worry Richard. Wait no, that\u2019s not right. What was your name again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh yes Riktal Zelkov! Sorry, I\u2019m not all that good with names, just faces. Keep telling me and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll remember it some day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a weird one I\u2019ll give you that, but you aren\u2019t that strange. I\u2019ve dealt with servants of your god before and seen that same faraway look. God-touched they call it. Not to anyone\u2019s face of course because you act like the word is cursed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe is everyone\u2019s god not just mine or anyone else\u2019s. And why would they see that word is cursed? Would they not want to be touched by God? Are not all priests and priestesses touched by Him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d say ye of little faith but that really doesn\u2019t apply to you now does it? You really don\u2019t know much of anything of what goes on behind the scenes of the Church do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really. I\u2019ve always been able to talk with Him and my parents said I didn\u2019t need to know right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy stomach grumbled again and I pushed it to the side. I felt this meeting was somehow important. Maybe destined. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had gone a day or more without food for training, I could push through it. Even though the sound wasn\u2019t loud the girl still heard it, putting some of her food on the lid of her box and pushing it over to me, handing me the unused spoon next to her meal. She did so absentmindedly, like the thought of not helping me or not feeding me never crossed her mind. That\u2019s why I accepted the small offering with a gracious thanks and started to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore the first small spoonful of rice met my lips I saw the girls eyes watching me. Feeling a bit ashamed I set the spoon down and bowed my head, saying a quick prayer of thanks. This seemed to make her happy as she continued to eat her meal with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much to tell you of what I know goes on behind the Church doors, seeing as you are still technically a priestess and all. But the truth is, the Church isn\u2019t what it used to be. Back a long time ago every servant of The One God could commune with him. That\u2019s how they all got their powers after all. But somewhere down the line, they got their powers from him but stopped being able to hear his voice in their heads. They don\u2019t publicize this fact of course, continuing to promote the idea they all hear him to the general public. Even promote the belief to those in training to become servants until they take the final rites.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow I\u2019m not saying they are corrupt or anything. They still do good work and they provide valuable assistance not only to Hunter\u2019s but to the poor and needy that we Hunter\u2019s protect. In the last few Hundred years those who can still commune directly with the god, the real God-touched, have certain destinies or reasons for being born. Now I don\u2019t know what your reason is until you complete it, but I am sure you will find out when you are ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI refrained from telling her those who were truly God-touched also usually ended up dying in horrible ways at very young ages. Some lived to old age, but most of them were either set upon by the mob who condemned them, their own Church who felt threatened by them, or by their destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I already know. Well at least I know what it is right now. He told me it was to save Riktal Zelkov. He also said he had other plans for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd how are you supposed to save me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shrugged a moment before stuffing another forkful in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know, he didn\u2019t say. He just said I would know when the time was right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, I forgot those that can truly hear his voice don\u2019t question at all. They simply follow and obey knowing it will all work out. People like me that can\u2019t hear him like you question everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt is sad, but that is the way it is. Not everyone can hear him but everyone can come unto him. But I do not understand why it is you know so much about the Church that I do not when you are not a servant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA bird flew in through the broken window, a kestrel by the looks of it. It swooped down onto the table next to us looking to the left and right in that jerky bird way. The girl crumbled up some bread and laid it on the desk so the bird could pick at it before returning her attention to me. She really was one of the chosen ones. I had always known there was a god that oversaw this world, he had made his presence known many times. But this was the first time I had seen someone he was personally taking care of like this. All my information about the God-touched was secondhand, the ones I had thought had this communion with him had only been faking it ot keep up the farce. I smiled at her, feeling a warmth inside just from being in her presence. Even though I tried to make my smile happy, I could feel how it was tinted with sadness. As if I was regretful that I was tainting this girl with my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause, no matter how much light you cast upon the land, there will always be shadows. I simply deal with that darkness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet the man who knows the evils in man\u2019s heart\u2019s combat the evils in the name of good. Even if he sinketh into the pits of darkness as he uses those evils he shall be lifted up to the exulted seat for his works. For though he has sinned against me, still he has done my works and I shall not strike him down nor shall I deny him the blessings of my presence. Amisada chapter ten verse twenty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know, I don\u2019t even know your name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s Lilia. Lilia Hawson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Lilia, I don\u2019t know how it is I am supposed to help you, or you save me, but if you ever need anything then you let me know. It\u2019s true that I might not hold much stock in The One God, but I also believe he exists. I have no doubt that you really are one of his servants that can hear him and you follow his commands. I have no desire to get struck down for not helping you or turned into a frog in my next life or something. In the end the servants of The One God and Hunter\u2019s are in the same business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen would it be ok if I speak with you again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhenever you wish. I\u2019ll make time for you. That is if you don\u2019t mind if I eat lunch with you from now on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally! You\u2019d do that! Truth be told it gets a little lonely here sometimes. It\u2019s not always that bad since I have my bird friends and He talks to me sometimes, but I do like talking with other humans from time to time, they just always avoid me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know the feeling of being lonely. I don\u2019t mind either, I can use the company. Besides, how could anything go wrong when I know The One God is eating with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finished our meal as the bell rang, but we ignored it as we continued to talk about different things. It was the first time I didn\u2019t feel awkward or angry or annoyed when dealing with someone my own age. Even though I was terrible as a people person, everything just felt right around her. The class began to file in then as she put her empty box away and I didn\u2019t miss the looks sent our way. Nor the bits of whispering as the rumors began to emerge. Standing up I gave her a parting smile before going back to my seat. The smile she returned was full of that warm glow of divinity she seemed to possess in spades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in and called out roles before closing his book and addressing the class. This was the hands on section of Alchemy, where they would learn to mix concoctions by applying what they learned before lunch. I\u2019d have to use one of the lab sets in the back of the room since I didn\u2019t have my own kit yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cClass. Today we have a special guest who has graciously consented to teach you. She is a renowned potion specialist from our very own Efenbis city. Ranked number two in the nation and seven in the world, she has helped advance the skills of Alchemy to new limits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOh please no. Please don\u2019t say my big sisters name. Please god if you really are listening prove me wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a tenth generation Hunter with a lot of experience under her belt. Please welcome Ulicia Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey all looked around in surprise, all eyes focusing on the door in expectation. But my sister wouldn\u2019t do something as mundane as use a door. She was a flashy show boater who would probably use a teleportation potion. Indeed that was exactly what happened. A column of green smoke appeared in front of the teachers desk and my sister stepped out of it, throwing her hands out wide as if to embrace the entire room at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe wore a red long sleeved shirt, though only one sleeve still remained. The one along her right arm was ripped off up to the shoulder to showcase the tribal tattoo running all the way down to her wrist. A pair of loose fitting jeans ripped at the knees that seemed to be held up by magic were wrapped with spelled wire to hold an array of bottles of all colors. Each bottle as long and narrow as a finger and capped with wax. Her hair was blue on the left half and  yellow on the right today, pulled back and tied in a ponytail. The purple eyeliner seemed oddly out of place when compared with everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked around the room and saw me sitting there in the back, a grin splitting her face as she hopped onto the first desk and ran straight towards me as nimble as a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiki tiki!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I suffered her squeezing me tightly while rubbing her cheeks all over my face. When she began to rock me from side to side squealing happily I finally had enough, trying to push her away.

I thought for sure mother and father would take you slaying with them. Or at the least let you take the Exams so we could work together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, you and me both. Seems you\u2019ve been left out of the loop, but I guess I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at that, it\u2019s the way mother usually operates. Mother seems to think I need to finish three years here before I\u2019m ready to get my license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I think you should just go take the Exams anyway! Who cares what that old fuddy-duddy says anyway! We both know you\u2019re ready for the big time. And then I can recharge my tiki tank anytime I want! We can work together all the time! Just think about it Riki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019d rather not. I bet you are more worried about getting your tiki juice on a regular basis then you are about me becoming a Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t deny it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned as she embraced me again, rubbing her cheeks against my face a moment before letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought your tiki tanks were filled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI used some tiki juice so I was just topping off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell hurry up and get to teaching the class. You\u2019ve already made enough of a scene for one day, now act your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a sigh as if she were somehow suffering, making the simple act overly dramatic before standing at attention and giving me a salute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSir, yes sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to giggle then as she turned around. I started to pick up my chair when she jumped and spun in a circle, clapping her hands as she landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know! Why don\u2019t you help me teach Riki tiki! You know all of this just as well as I do and with two of us we can get more done! What do you say Riki tiki!\u201d</span></div></div>",

I haven\u2019t been that for almost ten years now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe bounced up and down like a giddy schoolgirl who just got to meet their idol in person before trying to hug me again. This time I evaded her clutches, pointing at the front of the room sternly. With a sigh she finally turned and began to teach while I followed behind her quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should all know by now Alchemy is an art. It\u2019s not based on gut feelings or eyeballing measurements\u2018. It\u2019s a strict formula of A plus B equals C all the time. You can\u2019t replace A or B or put a small decimal on one of them to make B.00001 and expect the same results. Anyone can master Alchemy as long as they have the required materials and knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut as Hunter\u2019s we have a leg up on most other people. We can control our magic better than other people can. That means we can create potions and elixir\u2019s that a regular civilian alchemist cannot. We can also hunt our own ingredients, which is sometimes the only way we can make a potion, since the ingredient we might need is bound to us until it is used. Like the essence of Swamp Creepers. That stuff floats around you like a bad odor you just can\u2019t get rid of for a few days no matter how much you scrub. But you can make a powerful potion of sleep with it that when used properly can put a small army of B class monsters to sleep even if they are normally immune to such spells.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued speaking for a few moments longer before telling them to pull out their mini labs while instructing them on how to make a basic healing potion. As she began to drift out into the room to the left I headed towards the right. She continued to tell them exactly when to add ingredients, when to stir and other tips while the two of us stopped at each desk for a bit of personal help. When a hand was raised with a question the person closest or who wasn\u2019t already occupied would answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt felt a bit weird teaching my classmates like this honestly. I was beginning to second guess my decision to help out. But then again, if I had declined what would I have done with my time? Probably make a potion on my own. Perhaps a translocation potion to give to Lilia in case she needed my help. But I could do that at home and it would need to be put into an artifact to be most effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see a few goofy smiles on faces left over from the show my sister had put on and a few speculative glances my way, mostly by the girls, as they tried to think how best to get into my good graces now that they knew I was a Zelkov. But despite how flippant and easygoing the class had seemed earlier, they took the lesson seriously, they treated me and my sister with respect and asked serious questions. They knew this was their life and their future on the line, and that this information could make or break them as Hunter\u2019s. So there was very little calling me over on the false pretense of asking a question only to try and flirt with me or something stupid like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone finished making their potions, a few even managing to make a tier two version, shortly before the bell rang. Liz of course had no problems, simply grinned at me when I looked in her direction with eyes that seemed to know I was a bit uncomfortable. While they packed their potions and labs away carefully my sister came up behind me, pressing her body against my back while hugging me around the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh it felt so good to work with you again Riki tiki! I wish I could stuff you in one of my bags and take you with me everywhere I went! I never have to worry about anything when you are around! I was able to focus on my group because I knew you were there! What do you say? Ditch this place and run away with me to my next job!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI extracted myself with a sigh just as the bell rang, turning with a slow shake of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know I can\u2019t do that. We both know that would just end with a big fight between me, you and mother. Even if it didn\u2019t, I\u2019m still an unlicensed Hunter. You\u2019ll get in big trouble with the union if you took me out with you. Perhaps enough for you to lose your license as well depending on how dangerous or confidential the job is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pouted a little before finally nodding her head with a downcast look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, I know. You be careful Riki you hear? I don\u2019t want anything to happen to that precious tiki juice. I\u2019d die without it! I have another job to do so I\u2019ll be away for a while, not sure how long though. I\u2019ll see you when I get back ok? Give mother my love when you see her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she pulled another transportation spell off her belt and smashed it on the ground. The green smoke flared up seconds before she stepped inside and was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t call me Riki tiki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had to wonder if the words made it through the spell before the gas had fallen in on itself to disappear. With a sigh I grabbed my weapons and headed off to Combat class. It didn\u2019t take long to toss my duffle into a locker and head out to the arena. I didn\u2019t need to gear up like everyone else or use my own weapons. Most of what I had was higher grade anyway. It would be best if I just stuck to stock weapons in any sparring mach. Things still wouldn\u2019t be even, but at least it would be a bit fairer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master told everyone that today they would be fighting real monsters in groups of four or five to put their knowledge into practice. The class began to murmur excitedly as he told me and Liz to sit this class out. With a shrug I turned and headed for the bleachers, at least this would be a good chance to get an idea of the general skill levels of my classmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had barely sat down though when Liz came bounding up the steps until she was standing right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWant to have a bit of fun? I got the Arena Master to agree to give us our own little section of the floor to spar together if you want. You don\u2019t have to of course, but I\u2019d like to see how good you are. So what do you say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI saw the kick coming for my head out of the corner of my eye as Liz shoved my arm to the side, trying to hide her attack in her counter to my open palm thrust. I let my knees buckle as I dropped my body, throwing my head back so the strike sailed harmlessly inches over my nose. As I continued my fall I rotated my wrists and shoulders, planting my palms on the cool cement floor. Bunching my muscles I thrust forward with both feet leading but she blocked it with crossed arms. My attack was still strong enough to lift her off her feet and send her flying though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already on my feet, taking three quick strides forward before sailing into the air by the time she landed. With a quick frontward flip I came barreling back down, aiming to pile drive my feet into her stomach where she was laying gasping for breath. At the last moment her midriff bunched up as she rolled backwards with her legs crossed at the knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy attack missed by inches even as her lower half surged forward, locking my neck in the crook of her crossed legs. With a grunt she lifted me bodily into the air using only the power in her lower body while doing a handstand. I felt my body moving sideways as she spun on her hands quickly a few times, my body flowing outwards by the centrifugal force. Suddenly she let go and I was free flying, unable to control myself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her do a break dance move while I flew, dropping her lower half as she spun to her feet and leapt into the air like I had. My back met the cement hard, softened only a little by my quick use of wind to buffer me. I watched her do the same flip in the air as I had even as I rolled backwards. But I wouldn\u2019t let it end there, she had shown me something good, time to repay the favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile she was still falling I shoved off from the ground with my legs leading. Right before I hit her I crossed them just like she had, slamming into her neck and twisting sideways with my upper body. I couldn\u2019t spin in a circle like she had, but I got enough momentum to let gravity do the rest of the work. I let her go as I floated a little higher into the air from the maneuver, finally hurtling back towards earth as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer back bounced against the ground and she let out a gasp of pain, having time only to see me falling towards her. I saw the flicker in her eyes as she rapidly went over everything she could do, realizing I would hit before she got out of the way. Saw her gathering earth magic to harden her skin to try anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt the last second I spread my legs and hit the ground on either side of her, bending my knees to absorb some of the blow. With a grin I sat on her waist and patted her cheek lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding up I offered Liz my hand, which she took with a small sigh and a grin of her own. We both heard some cheering around us as we went to pick up the two sets of swords we had both started out with. Looking around with a bit of surprise we saw the class watching through the walls that had turned opaque as glass. The Arena Master was also grinning as we moved towards them, part of the wall sliding back into the floor to let us out of our own personal sparring arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe rest of the group couldn\u2019t concentrate on their monsters once they heard your clash through the walls. So I let them take in the show and maybe learn something. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head along with Liz, both of us saying we hadn\u2019t even noticed at almost the same time. We looked at each other then laughed a bit, replacing two of the swords on their racks and putting the two with broken tips in the pile with a few other broken weapons. We both grabbed towels that were freely provided against one of the benches as we sat down on the sidelines, thinking it best we not spar anymore so the rest of them could get back to getting real combat experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know you knew that last move too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t until you used it. I simply adapted it with what I already knew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGeez, and it took me almost a week to master it! Is that part of being a tenth generation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNah, I\u2019ve just learned to adapt and analyze quickly. There are loads of things it\u2019s taken me a while to get right. You should have seen me when big sis started teaching me Alchemy. If it could be blown up, I\u2019m pretty sure I managed it. I couldn\u2019t even get the most basic of potions right. Just didn\u2019t have the head for the math. All those numbers didn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense. In the end big sis would sit with me for hours at night going over math drills until I got good at it before she even let me near the ingredients again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that makes me feel a little bit better. Alchemy has always been one of my best subjects. My big brother used to say my brain was better than a calculator. I loved all the number stuff and the formulas. By the way, what was that one move you did called? The one where you juggled one of your swords on the other to block my attack and then grabbed it out of the air when I hit it. I\u2018ve never seen it used before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really have a name, just something I picked up from a friend I know. Though he usually does it with daggers. Still, it\u2019s all about the balance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it was impressive. Took all I had to get my other sword up in time to block the follow-up backhand blow. If I had been a few seconds slower that would have been my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell your head if the blades hadn\u2019t been spelled for sparring. I was impressed by the rapid chain of fist and elbows you threw after we broke our swords.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean the Lightning Tiger Barrage? It\u2019s my mom\u2019s signature move. She has the nickname of Sleeping Tiger you know. All sweet and docile until you get her angry then she\u2019s like a wild unchained tiger that\u2019s as hard to catch as lightning. I\u2019m more interested in that move you did where the air seemed to spiral around your fists and it looked like a phantom claw.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean the Twisting Demon Punch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah if that\u2019s what it\u2019s called. Mind teaching me how to do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShouldn\u2019t be too hard. You got enough skill for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be modest. I can tell I was outclassed. I might have gotten a few good hits in and held my own for a bit, but I know you were holding back. I\u2019ve been around enough strong fighters to know that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk so I was holding back. Still you\u2019ve got skill, I\u2019ll admit that. Definitely B class worthy, perhaps almost A.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her blush a bit as she ran her fingers through her hair, hooking a few stray strands behind her ear. I wasn\u2019t sure why she was getting embarrassed over the truth. Especially after our bodies had been locked together as they had been the last fifteen or twenty minutes. If me grabbing her breast or her my crotch as we threw each other across the floor didn\u2019t make her embarrassed, why should this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply shook my head privately. For all that she was like me, a Hunter in all but truth, I guess she was still a girl. I never could understand the minds of women and I probably never would. Especially ones around my age with all their nonsensical thoughts and alien ways. Still at least I could deal with Liz since she was able to shove those girly ways to the side like any real Hunter could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe chatted for a bit more, going over details of our sparring match and saying what we were impressed with or what we needed to work on. Suddenly the bell rang and I was startled back to reality. Had we really been talking for almost thirty minutes? I had to be careful from now on, I couldn\u2019t let my guard down like that again. Not paying attention to your surroundings was a sure way to get killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of us broke off then, following the rest of the class back to our respective locker rooms. It only took a few moments to grab my duffle bag and head out the door since I didn\u2019t have any gear to put away like the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce back in my seat I watched the class trickle in, seeing the looks of worship and scheming cast in my direction. With a sigh I mentally prepared myself for the onslaught of plots to befriend me, bed me, or milk me. Even in a Hunter academy you still found such politics. No I shouldn\u2019t be surprised, Hunter\u2019s plotted more than even dirty politicians sometimes. It really wasn\u2019t a wonder that they started while still in training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell finally rang again as the teacher stepped into the room to take attendance.</span></div></div>",

Before this, each country had their own determination not only of the value of the coins which they minted for use within their own lands, but also for weight, purity, and exchange value. There had even been fighting if you took money from one country to another in an attempt to use or exchange it depending on the political strife at the time. For example, Judaris and Tachikal were both long time enemies, even more so than they are today. If one were to even bring a Judaris minted coin into Tachikal they would be killed without question. Even if it was a devout patriot of Tachikal who held a single coin, he would be cut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut with the implementation of the Reul bills, also known as the hundred coin base, on a global level; small wars and tense relations between nations dropped dramatically. Now, no matter where you go one Senz coin will always be worth one Senz coin. One hundred Senz will always equal one Knutz and one hundred Knutz will always equal one Reul. The only difference is in the price of items, a suit of armor might cost ten thousand Reul here while over in Bornica it might cost fifteen thousand. These prices are dictated by the wealth of the nation and the ruling government, be they king, dictator, president, or council.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore the teacher got any farther into his lesson a woman came through the door. She was a looker with her bright red hair tied up in twin ponytails. A red that was more than a match for mine, almost giving off it\u2019s own glow. With a single finger she pushed a pair of gold rimmed glasses farther up on a small nose, her pale white skin accentuating the deep purple eyes. Her breasts seemed to be almost bursting out of the white button up shirt she wore tucked into a pair of no nonsense black business pants. With a clipboard tucked under one arm she marched over to talk to the teacher quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already picking up my bag as the teacher looked in my direction, motioning me forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I know. I assume my father want\u2019s to see me. That\u2019s the only reason I can think of that your here Jara.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a small nod the woman gave the teacher a bow of the head, apologizing for interrupting the class before the two of us left the room together. While we walked I could hear the slight clanking and creaking of her prosthetic left leg, though she somehow managed to walk without a telltale limp for all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what does my father want with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it is best if he discusses it with you himself. Besides, talking out in the halls here isn\u2019t safe. Prying ears and eyes you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was a bit deep and clipped, but I had grown used to the slight brusque tone of hers. I knew it came from the years she had spent as a Hunter before she lost her leg. She had been the captain of one of the associations quick response teams, dedicated to stopping S class monsters that posed a threat when they got too near cities. Or to act as the associations private  standing military when needed. Though I still wasn\u2019t sure why she had decided to give up her position and work for my father as one of his aides. Even without her leg she was still a brilliant strategist and a good leader, even if she couldn\u2019t exactly fight like she used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI\u2019d worked with her a few times on random jobs while my father was off on business and she was free. I had learned the basics of tactics and strategy from my father and mother, along with the books at home. But it had been this woman who had really fleshed out that knowledge, expanding it vastly while showing me how to use it in practice. I had a healthy respect for her skills of both body and mind, having been dumped on my backside by her on more than one occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you at least tell me if I am going to like what I hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom what little I know, probably not. It\u2019s not all bad, but it will probably leave a bad taste in your mouth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t say anything else as she led me to a small room who\u2019s only furnishings was a table, six chairs, and a set of shelves holding some books. A single window looked out on a track where a class was running laps. My father was already sitting in one of the chairs around the table, a little girl with hair as white as fresh fallen snow trailing down her back and eyes the color of sunset. She held a teddy bear to her chest with her right hand while she stared straight ahead with lifeless eyes, not even turning to look at the noise I made coming in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJara walked over to the nearest chair, sitting down and grabbing her left leg. With a grunt she manually lifted it up to rest on the tabletop before leaning back in the chair. I could see the edges of the shiny metal skeleton leg that went up to her knee and the set of hydraulics at the back allowing her some movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I brought him like you asked. Though I personally think it would have been better if you had come alone. You didn\u2019t really need me except as a buffer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease Jara, we\u2019ve been over this. You know what\u2019s at stake here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father glanced over at me before shaking his head and returning his gaze to his aide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ll discuss this in more detail later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish\u2026 sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTaking off my glasses I rubbed my eyes trying to squelch the rising frustration of being left out of the loop again. Putting them back on my face I sat down across the table from him and the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want father? I doubt it is just to see how I am doing. You wouldn\u2019t do something so mundane and normal as that anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou made him angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, he\u2019s angry at you. All I did was escort him here like you requested. I told you how you should have handled this but you didn\u2019t listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father let out a sigh as he rubbed his eyes with two fingers. I noticed the dark circles under them then, and a few more gray hairs since the last time I had seen him almost a month ago. Even though I knew he still had a powerful build, the way he slumped over slightly across the table from me gave the illusion that he had lost all that muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t going quite like I had planned but would you look after this girl for us for a few days? Only until someone can come pick her up. Her name is Asala and she could really use someone like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMother put you up to this didn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFacts. You weren\u2019t supposed to be back until next week, yet here you are. It is entirely possible you picked her up on your last job, but that is a low possibility. If you had picked her up, I at least think enough of you to assume you would take care of something like this without toting her half way around the world to bring her back here. Second you said us, not me. You only say us when you are covering for mother in some way. So my guess is she landed in mother\u2019s lap, mother didn\u2019t want to deal with her, so suckered you into taking the girl off her hands and bargaining with me in hopes of getting a better deal since she knows my feelings for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJara barked out a laugh from the end of the table as my father glanced away from my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe got you there Romone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the little girls fingers curl around the teddy bear and let out a sigh. Getting angry wouldn\u2019t solve anything. It wouldn\u2019t get me any answers either. Not that I expected to get answers to begin with no matter what kind of emotion I was in or questions I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo? What\u2019s so special about her anyway and what kind of concessions did mother want you to get out of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a monster summoner. An unstable one at that. This lifeless shell you see before you? She did it to herself. Ran off into her head and shut down all her senses. Refusing to even eat or sleep on her own. She doesn\u2019t even control her bowels or bladder, just letting them go whenever she wants. Your mother put a diaper on her and has been supplementing her bodies needs with magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I told that damn fool of a wife of yours what a cockamamie move that was. I still stick by that too. It aint right for a girl her age to be swaddled up. Even if she want\u2019s to run off into her head, she still deserves some dignity. But what do I know, I\u2019m just an aide now. It\u2019s not like I used to be a Hunter or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father ignored Jara\u2019s comment as he kept his eyes locked on mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe only other thing she wanted me to get out of you was to have you continue going to classes. I told her that was crazy, especially considering how little love most people have for summoners to begin with. Throw an unstable one who can\u2019t control where, when or what she summons and it\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy not leave her with Jara then? She seems to have no problems with it and she can deal with kids reasonably well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut not as well as you can. Besides, I think I might have scared her deeper into her head when we first met with one of my tirades. You know how difficult it is to recover from a bad first impression, especially with a trauma victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about Pelei?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019ll do it, but I\u2019d rather you took the job son. Pelei is a good guy and all, but I don\u2019t feel right leaving her with him. She needs mental and emotional help, not just physical. And in that respect I think you might be the best person for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know? You\u2019re never around to see what I can and can\u2019t do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t honestly. All I know is what other\u2019s have told me really. But I just got a gut feeling about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJara had been right, this did leave a bad taste in my mouth.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve grown more than tired of being jerked around by her whims. You want me to take this job? That\u2019s fine. But I take it on Hunter terms. I might not have a license yet, but this is still a professional level job so you need to deal with me as a professional. If I take this job I want a guarantee that mother will stop shoving arranged marriage proposals off on me. Plus I don\u2019t hear any backtalk about me taking the Exams after this job is done or any interference from either one of you to stop me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat, you don\u2019t want any money?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMoney is fine and all but I can make my own. What I want is better than something so common. I want freedom. Freedom I can\u2019t get with you and mother cock-blocking my attempts to be what you trained me to be. Though to be fair, it\u2019s more mother than you, but I never once considered you on my side in any of this. Once I am a Hunter I can make all the money I want. I can move out and leave that house and never look back. That is what I really want father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThose conditions seem kind of steep son. I\u2019m not all that adverse to them but your mother will definitely have a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTough. When going into negotiations know your enemy. If you know what they want and how badly they want it, you can push for more concessions as you hold more cards. Isn\u2019t that what you yourself taught me father? If mother and you want me to take this job bad enough then you will pay. If you don\u2019t then that\u2019s fine, take her to someone else. What I want right now is more important to me than mother\u2019s flights of fancy. Since you are here now with this girl, then you speak for mother as well. So do you accept my deal or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father let out a sigh as he rubbed his eyes again. Jara was grinning from ear to ear from where she was silently watching and the girl was simply staring across the table at me with those doll like eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, I\u2019ll talk your mother into accepting the terms somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father gave me a woebegone look as Jara began to laugh and a smile split my face. The rich sound echoing on the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let him fool you boy. I figured this might be how the meeting would go down and told him as much. He already talked with the office before I came to get you, letting them know you wouldn\u2019t be in school for a few days. I told him you weren\u2019t a little boy no more so expect some haggling. Glad you didn\u2019t disappoint my expectations of you. Were up to me I\u2019d have sent you off to the Exams long ago. Your good, might even make a captain like I did if that\u2019s what you wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJara\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, yeah. As you wish sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked from my father to Jara who was still grinning from ear to ear, not the least bit cowed into submission by my father\u2019s looks. She often said he needed someone to stand up to him and smack some sense into him when needed. And that the other aides were too soft for such a job, being only simple civilians. Not for the first time since this meeting started did I wonder just what these two knew that I didn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell is that everything father? If it is then you can leave me to do my work. I\u2019m sure you got a busy schedule and more important places to be anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked like he was about to say something else but shook his head instead, everaging himself up slowly. Jara let her own leg drop with a small clank before getting to her feet as well. She gave me a small wink before following my father to the door. Before leaving though my father looked over his shoulder at me with a bit of sadness in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake care son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI had planned on it even if you hadn\u2019t said anything. What\u2019s your problem anyway? Not like you to act all fatherly. Kind of creepy actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe just shook his head again and walked out the door, letting the slab of wood close behind him with an ominous click. Once he was gone I sat on the tabletop, spun around and scooted across the space to dangle my legs over the edge next to the girl. As they kicked back and forth I gave her a roguish grin while looking in both directions, one eyebrow raised conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust between you and me, despite how much I might say I dislike or hate my parents, I actually still do love them. I think aliens came down from space to implant something in my head to make me do so no matter what. People say aliens are little green men, but I think all they saw were goblins. Real aliens have tentacles. Why every alien has to have tentacles! Big purple slimy ones! I mean, how are they going to do the whole tentacle scenes you see on TV if they didn\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no response to my words. No slight smile or twitch of the eyes. I nodded a bit to myself as I thought of what to say next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good mask you got going on there. Not even a twitch of a facial muscle. Did aliens teach you how to do that? Like they implanted thoughts into my brain I mean. But you see, I\u2019m on to them. I know their tricks. They might have made you look and act like a doll, but their control isn\u2019t complete. I think that teddy bear kept them from exerting complete control. Because your fingers have been twitching and tightening against it this entire time. That being the case I bet you can hear me and see me as well. The aliens have just disconnected your mind from your body so you don\u2019t actually react to such stimulation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around again before bending my head a little closer to hers while dropping my voice a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wonder though. Do you think the aliens would be able to exert complete control if I were to take that teddy bear away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got the reaction I was expecting as her hand spasmodically clutch the bear tightly to her chest. I let out a small laugh as a laid my hand on her white hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry Asala, I\u2019m not going to take it. But that does prove to me you aren\u2019t as far under the aliens control as you want everyone to believe. Though I must warn you, when the aliens messed with my head I think the rewired my brain wrong. You see sometimes I get this irresistible urge to spoil cute little girls with white hair and red eyes. I can\u2019t help but hug and squeeze them at random moments. Even plant sloppy wet kisses on cheeks and foreheads. Sometimes, like now, I even get this urge to take them on a shopping spree for new clothes. Nothing a little white haired, crimsoned eyed, girl can do to stop me when I get like this either. So I guess you are just going to have to put up with it until my urges go away. That is, if they go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I rolled backwards off the table, picking up my bag from where I had dropped it on the floor next to my chair before returning to the girls side. I held out my hand hopefully but she didn\u2019t take it. With a small shrug I slipped the bag on my back before picking the girl up and bracing her against my side, using one hand acting as a seat while I hardened my muscles up with earth magic. I gave her a quick hug before walking out the door with her in my arms. Her four and a half foot frame was so light it barely felt like I was carrying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you I got irresistible urges. But there is a small loophole in this rewiring they did to my brain. If the little girl in question who is getting spoiled says to stop, the urges go away. I\u2019m not sure why exactly but who am I to question aliens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we headed down the hall towards the front doors I thought I saw the barest flicker of a smile curving her lips out of the corner of my eye. But when I glanced over in her direction not a trace of anything marked her features. Still I smiled anyway as we left the school, my plan was already starting to work.</span></div></div>",

Got me an irresistibly cute kid here that needs to be made even cuter. Think you could help me out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI bent over slightly to let the girl stand on her own feet again. Even with augmented strength holding her for the last fifteen minutes like that had started to really make my arm ache. But it had all been part of the act I was putting on for her. She wasn\u2019t making it any easier though. Aside from the fantom grin I had thought I had seen, her face and body hadn\u2019t flickered an inch. But I knew that would change. She wasn\u2019t so far gone as to need that much coaxing. Just enough to realize it was safe to break that shell on her own. At least around me if no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAliens came down and messed around with her a bit. Made her wear this fugly dress as well. But it\u2019s all hush-hush you know. Don\u2019t want any of their spies catching wind that we are on to them you understand. You are one of the only ones I can trust that isn\u2019t connected to the aliens in any way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSue\u2019s eyes twinkled merrily as she gave me a lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI see. Well then I think I have a few clothes laying around that aren\u2019t touched by the aliens. Plus you know how my memory can be, sometimes I forget things that are said and done just seconds after the fact. I doubt any alien would want to bother getting information out of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave her a small nod as she took a hold of Asala\u2019s hand, leading her off with me following close behind. As she walked she slipped a pale orange dress off a hanger on her way past without stopping. The act was so practiced and nonchalant I would have missed it if I hadn\u2019t been paying much attention. She took the girl into a dressing room with her while I stood as a silent sentinel outside. They were only inside for a minutes before Sue led her back out for me to inspect. I looked her up and down, stroking my non-existent beard with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no, definitely not. She looks like a sickly fall pumpkin. I don\u2019t get the urge to squeeze her or rub my face against her at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSue let out a small hmmm with puckered lips before grabbing another dress, this one a deep blue with light blue trimming. I also saw her grab some white panties absently before ushering the girl back into the booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took a little longer this time but when they came out I saw Asala blushing just slightly as Sue gave me a wink over the girls head. Again I stroked my fake beard before nodding slightly. Letting her see the fingers of my free hand wiggling a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, Yes! I feel the urge inside rising! This is good! But one dress won\u2019t be enough. At least three, no, four more! And shoes! Can\u2019t forget shoes! Plus the hair! If you are going to give her a makeover got to do something about the hair too! That\u2019s how they get you. They get attracted to messy plain hair and wiggle in between the strands to invade the brain don\u2019t\u2019cha know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithout warning I lunged forward to grab the girl up in my arms, shaking her back and forth as I picked her up while rubbing my cheeks against her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo cute! I can\u2019t hold back anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was a good thing she didn\u2019t know I wasn\u2019t normally like this, or how embarrassed I privately felt. This was more my sister\u2019s kind of thing than mine, still it was one of the many effective routes to take. As I set her down I saw her blush an even deeper shade of red as her lips curled into a smile, making my own embarrassment dim in comparison to the progress I was making. It wasn\u2019t like this was the first time I had gone against my nature to complete a job or get what I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSue pulled the girl in and out of the dressing room another four or five more times. Each time I could see that shell cracking a little more. Sue seemed to know exactly what to do and say while bouncing off my own reactions and random outbursts of snuggling the girl. She was the biggest reason I had decided on this clothing store, with nearly thirty years of experience in textiles under her belt and being the mother of three girls of her own, she knew how to handle situations like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the girl came out again wearing a light red dress with a skirt ending just past her knees I reached out to grab her up again. She suddenly lifted her hand between us, shaking her head back and forth. With a sigh I stepped back, letting a pout cover my face. The same pout my sister always gave me, that being the only one I actually knew how to recreate. It seemed to work though because she dropped her hand with a sigh before holding out her arms. With a grin I grabbed her up and rubbed my face against hers, causing her to giggle before she wrapped her own arms around my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019ve finally decided to break out of your shell huh? I\u2019m glad you were able to overcome the aliens. Now they have one lest person to take over the world with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer mouth was close to my ear as she gave another giggle and answered me. Her voice was just a whisper, but I could hear the light musical tones in it. And the cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAliens don\u2019t exist silly! But thank you. You made me feel a whole lot better. You can stop now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a small kiss on the cheek as she hugged me tighter. Even as I stroked her hair I felt the tears dripping onto my shoulder. With a small smile I turned my head slightly so my whisper would tickle her own ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to stop. Losing someone hurts, there is no doubt about that. But people can still care about you. You can still find things to make you happy. If you want to cry then cry. If you want to laugh then laugh. I\u2019ll be here if you need me and I won\u2019t let you out of my sight. Right now it makes me happy being able to make you happy. Besides, do you have any proof aliens don\u2019t exist? If not, then I will have to protect you from them too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer arms tightened a little more as the water soaking into my shirt increased. While I was busy comforting her Sue slipped into the dressing room to gather up and discreetly throw away the diaper the girl had been wearing. She gave me a wink as she slipped off to dispose of it and I winked back. The girl finally started to get control of herself after a few moments, giving a sniff before wiping her nose on my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I really keep all these pretty dresses? You didn\u2019t just do this to make me feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes they are all yours. If you want a few more then make sure you say something. I wasn\u2019t lying when I said you are a cute little girl. Cute little girls deserve to wear pretty and cute things. I might only be watching over you for a few days, but I want you to feel like you are home here. I bet you my best artifact that teddy bear is the only thing you were able to take with you when you left your home. Not having things to call your own just isn\u2019t right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut isn\u2019t it going to be expensive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd who\u2019s idea of expensive are we talking about huh? To a millionaire a thousand Reul is like one Senz coin to the rest of us. To my way of thinking, right now your happiness is worth any price. So don\u2019t you worry about how much this or that costs. You leave that to me to decide when enough is enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith another squeeze she finally let go and slid to the ground, picking out another dress before going into the changing room on her own. While she was inside Sue came back as silent as a shadow to stand by my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI squelched the whispers from the other girls already. Told them this was Hunter business so they should forget it all if they knew what was good for them. By the way, care to tell me what that whole diaper thing was all about? Not that I need to know, just curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was someone\u2019s idea of dealing with her trauma without dealing with her trauma. But now that it has disappeared it never existed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat never existed? I told you before, I have a pretty bad memory sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped her five hundred Reul with a grin which she pocketed just as Asala came back out twirling around in the black dress she was wearing. We spent another hour or so in the store until Asala was satisfied with everything we had gotten. She helped me carry some of the bags out as I paid the bill, giving Sue a final conspiratorial wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala. What do you want for dinner? You feel like eating out or going home and having me make you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan we go home? I\u2019m a bit sleepy. And do you know how to make spaghetti? Mom makes, I mean made, that all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her quickly wipe away a few tears that escaped her eyes as I grinned down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye I know how to make that. And I know I have all the ingredients too. In fact some people call me the noodle master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo not really. But they could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe giggled as we walked on in silence for a bit. I saw her glancing up at me a moment before quickly looking away with a small flush to her cheeks. Finally she spoke up like I knew she wanted to, the hesitation clear in her voice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cU-um Riktal? Would you\u2026 would you carry me again. Daddy used to always carry me like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore she knew what was happening I had scooped her up and hardened my arm to act as her seat. This time though she wrapped her arms around my neck and laid her head against me as we walked. I felt the tears beginning to soak in even though her sobs were silent. I couldn\u2019t hug her or stroke her hair because my hands were full but she knew I was there for her and that was all she needed right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n\tIt seems our time grows short again. Or is this yet again? It is so hard to tell sometimes. Are you satisfied with this day? Dissatisfied? For what reasons? Observing you has been enlightening, but I fear you must come again. I need more information before I can answer my own curiosity. Only through observing you multiple times will I get my answers. So until then fair traveler, I will be watching you.</span></div></div>",

He spoke to the office before I even got you to let them know you wouldn\u2019t be coming for a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father looked at Jara with a slightly raised eyebrow but said nothing to refute her statement. Jara returned his stare with an uplifted eyebrow of her own and a small wink. Their silent conversation only took a few seconds but whatever Jara had been trying to tell him he understood. At least the small dip of his head in her direction made me think he understood. I was a bit surprised that my father had actually thought of me and my desires enough to do such a thing. I looked down at my hands which I clasped in front of me on the table, unsure of how exactly to handle my father actually acting a bit fatherly. My words wanted to catch in my throat, feeling foreign to my ears<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh thanks dad. I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was nothing son. The least I could do really. Listen, for the record I didn\u2019t want to hold you back from taking the Exams. I disagreed with your mother on that front but I lost the argument. I know it might not make much of a difference for you to know that but I do think you are more than capable and qualified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked to the left and right a moment, as if unsure of his next words while his clasped hands tightened together until the knuckles turned white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSay son. I know this might be a bit out of the blue and all, but would you be interested in doing something after this job is over? Me and your mother will be in Bornica for about a week, maybe a little longer. But when we get back do you think it would be too much to ask? Just you and me. Frankly I\u2019m not even sure what we could do, but nothing Hunter related. Maybe fishing, or go out and see a movie or something. I\u2019d like\u2026 I\u2019d like to get to know you a little better. Not Riktal the Hunter, but Riktal the man.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had to use all my will to keep my jaw from dropping to the floor as Jara gave my father a small nod. What was this all of a sudden? Had my father become possessed by a new breed of monster? He had never been interested in being fatherly before. Always putting his work first. Always treating me like a Hunter. Perhaps he was going through one of those mid life crisis things. I heard when men got to be around forty like him they sometimes had such attacks. Added on top of his previous actions on my behalf I didn\u2019t know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026 sure. I guess that would be ok. But won\u2019t your schedule be busy like it always is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll free it up for you. I realize I\u2019ve missed out on a lot of things and you grew into a young man before I even noticed. I\u2019d like to learn a bit about the man you grew up to be while my back was turned. I can\u2019t change the past, but I\u2019d like to start in the present if I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father levered himself to his feet, giving me a small nod of the head as Jara stood as well. He strode over to the door and opened it before turning to look at me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you think on what you want to do when we come back. I\u2019ve still got a few places to go before I meet up with your mother and we go catch the next flight. I\u2019ll let you get to your work safe in the knowledge that she is in good hands for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at the ground a moment as he turned away, his voice echoing a bit as he left the room pulling the door closed behind him with a soft click.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked from the door to the girl, letting my shock finally show on my face as I got up shaking my head. A few steps around the table and I was able to grab the chair my father was sitting in, spinning it around before sitting down with a slouch. Propping my arms on the table behind me I glanced over at the girl with another shake of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you believe that? Because I barely can. It feels so strange having him actually talk to me like that. Normally our conversations are limited to Hunter business and not much else. I actually get kind of crept out when he starts treating me as anything but a Hunter. I get this feeling like the world is going to end or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow my mother, my mother tries too hard and you can tell she\u2019s all fake. Fake smiles, fake greetings, fake feelings of caring. She\u2019s all about what she can get from others and how to most effectively get what she wants. Whenever I am around her I can\u2019t help but get angry just on principal. Actually just thinking about her most of the time can get my blood boiling. You\u2019ve probably met her so you might know what I am talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you know, as strange as this sounds, especially after everything I just said, I still love them both. Isn\u2019t that weird? I really don\u2019t have any memories of either one of them being actual parents. I\u2019m not just saying that or speaking while blocking out those memories. My parents, well they never had time for me period. It was always work, work, and more work with them. They would stay at the house for a few days sometimes to train me to be a Hunter, then go running off to some far off place to fight monsters. I\u2019d be left with baby-sitters and other Hunter\u2019s to continue my training on my own until they came back. Sometimes that would be a month or two later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know how they usually greeted me when they came home? Do you think it was with hugs and kisses or big smiles? No. They\u2019d come swinging a sword or their fist without even a word of warning. Not because they were angry or anything, but to test me. To see if I had continued to become stronger while they were away. I never got toys or anything either. Every present I got was either a weapon, a book on warfare or magic, or armor. Them being around for holidays and birthdays? You\u2019d have better luck suddenly transforming into a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls face didn\u2019t change at all, but her hand tightened around her bear a bit more. I had noticed that small movement while talking to my father as well. At first I hadn\u2019t been sure if that was some involuntary reaction of her body while she hid in her mind or her reacting to the words being spoken. Now I was sure it was the latter and not the former.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are lucky you had a mother and father who cared about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes began to tear up slightly even though there was no other sign of an expression on her face. I nodded my head slowly as I pulled her into an embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was right. They are dead aren\u2019t they? I hadn\u2019t been sure honestly, but it would explain why you are here now. It was a toss up between that or they rejected you once they found out about your powers, kicking you out of the house and disowning you. But I would like to think the best of people most of the time. I would like to believe that most mothers and father\u2019s aren\u2019t like mine. That they wouldn\u2019t sell out their own child so easily. Especially a cute little girl like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I began to stroke her hair I felt the tears getting my tunic all damp. Though I didn\u2019t hear any sound at all, a fact I found a bit eerie. Still, this was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey were precious to you weren\u2019t they? I know how it feels to lose something precious too. Someone precious. What\u2019s worse is when people tell you to \u201cget over it\u201d or to \u201cman up\u201d. they act like it\u2019s wrong to grieve. That it\u2019s wrong to cry. Girls can get away with it a little more than boys can, since people have this idea that girls are supposed to be weaker. I think it\u2019s all quite silly actually. Both men and women have the same kinds of feelings don\u2019t we? Even if men have been taught to hide them better. Love is still love, fear is still fear, and grief is still grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen I lost the people who were most precious to me I\u2019m not ashamed to say that I cried. I bawled my eyes out and soaked my pillow night after night all alone. It\u2019s not a sin to cry, no matter what anyone might say. It is a natural reaction and a natural function of the body. Telling someone it is a sin to cry when their body wants to is like telling them to stop breathing. Some people are made of sterner stuff, but everybody has something that can get to them. There is no reason to be ashamed of who you are and what gets to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer arms came up around me then, squeezing me tightly around the middle as a soft mewling escaped her throat. The small pitiful wail grew louder and louder until her entire four and a half foot frame was shaking and her arms were crushing me as hard as they could. I let her cry herself out as I softly stroked her hair, cooing words of comfort into her ear while rocking her back and forth a bit. When she finally pulled herself away to rub her nose with the back of her arm I planted a kiss on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you feel a bit better now sweetie?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she nodded her head I let the small curve of my lips spread into a much bigger grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Now we need to do something about those clothes. Time for you to drown away some of that sorrow with a good old fashioned shopping spree. It\u2019s not a cure for the grief, but it can help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I stood up to get my bag from the floor on the other side of the table she latched onto my tunic and followed me while refusing to let go. Slipping the bag onto my back so I could carry it more easily I offered her my hand to take instead. She looked at the offered palm and then at the floor, squeezing her teddy bear tightly before opening her arms and motioning to be picked up with pleading eyes. With a lopsided grin I scooped her up and propped her against my side. She wasted no time in wrapping her arms around my neck and resting her head against me with a sigh of contentment. Opening the door I stepped out into the hall, making a left to head for the front entrance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tPeople stared at me as I walked down the street with Asala in my arms. But neither me nor Asala cared about such watching eyes. For me, this was part of my duty as a Hunter. The mission, whether self imposed or given, was paramount. I had made it my mission to help this little girl return to the land of the living. Let them stare or whisper behind their hands all they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut for Asala, I doubt she even realized they were looking at her. When I had glanced out of the corner of my eye, there had been a small smile on her face while she rested her head on my shoulder. From her closed lids and her even breathing I could almost believe she was asleep. Even the way she tightened her hands around my neck from time to time made me think that. But I knew. She was in her own little world right now. Not the same world she had run to while hiding from reality, but one made up of memories in happier times. A world where she was able to imagine it was someone else\u2019s neck she was clinging too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe only small blessing right now was the fact that the streets were pretty empty. With most people either at work or still in school, even if she did open her eyes she wouldn\u2019t be assaulted by so many stares of disapproval. As I turned the corner onto another near empty street Asala let out a small whimper next to my ear, her arms tightening around my neck reflexively out of fear. I saw the reason immediately, a red summoning portal was opening up on the wall to my right. Only my body separated the little girl from the monster she was summoning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stopped walking, making some soft sounds of comfort as a big green melon of a head with scraggly black hair began to emerge. The hobgoblins red eyes glowed malevolently from under his thick Neanderthal brows. Without even looking I backhanded the monster before it could make a sound, sending it reeling back into the hole seconds before the portal winked out of existence. A moment later her eyes popped open as she looked around in terror, her gaze moving around wildly for the monster she knew she had summoned. A small mewl of fear escaping her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShhh. It\u2019s ok Asala. It was just a bad dream. You fell asleep on my shoulder you know. You were even letting out this little wheezing snore. I think I even felt a bit of drool soaking into my tunic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly she wiped at her mouth to get rid of the bit of nonexistent drool while I chuckled slightly at her expense. I had a feeling it wouldn\u2019t be good if she knew the truth right now. Part of the reason she had probably run away into her mind was because of her powers. Thinking in some way she could control them. Not that she was wrong exactly, it was well documented that magical ability was linked with conscious thought. So it was logical to assume special magic like monster summoning worked on the same principals. But running away into her mind again was not going to help her in the long run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter another moment of looking around for a monster that wasn\u2019t there she gave me a small smile before laying her head on my shoulder again. This time though I saw her large crimson orbs watching the sidewalk along with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid your daddy carry you like this all the time before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head nodded up and down, scraping against the fabric of my tunic as the smile spread a bit more on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you remember that. They might be gone, but they aren\u2019t forgotten. Even if you are the only one who remembers them, that makes all those memories that much more important. Because their life is not measured in how they died, but in the sum of how they lived. Even small things like your daddy carrying you in his arms, or your mom tucking you in at night or any one of a hundred things paint the picture of who they were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took another couple minutes of walking before we came to the store I wanted. Their clothes might not have been the cheapest, but I was paying for more than just fabric today. I was paying for silence. The woman who met us shortly after entering was a bit pudgy, though she still cut a fine figure even after giving birth to three daughters. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as Asala slid to the ground and I inconspicuously shook the numbness out of my arm behind her back. Walking around for almost twenty minutes with such a weight on my muscles was tiring. Even if I had used an augmentation spell and the girl really hadn\u2019t weighed that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal honey! I hope you aren\u2019t going to tell me this is some secret child of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease. Do you think anything this cute could come from a mug this ugly? Besides, I\u2019m not that old. I\u2019d have to have had her when I was six. I might have grown up a bit faster than most, but not that fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. Something this cute could never have come from someone as ugly as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSue! You hurt my feelings!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! You started it. Besides I\u2019m not sure if you have feelings sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about the customer is always right and all that other stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not a customer, your just a rascal that happens to enter the store from time to time to give us money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the woman, quickly explaining what I wanted before pushing the girl towards Sue with a gentle pat on the back. Sue lost no time in sweeping the girl up into her pace, chatting away while guiding the girl towards a dressing room. Her hand slipping a white dress off a rack without even looking in a smooth motion while she walked. She knew her job and how to make someone feel at ease in the matter of moments. She also knew how to keep her mouth shut on anything she saw or heard. Sue would be able to do some of the things for Asala that I couldn\u2019t because she was a mother and a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala came out of the dressing room blushing but I ignored it, gushing over her instead before Sue pulled her back inside with some undergarments and another dress. It took a few changes of clothes but the girl finally started to get into the spirit of it, seeking out dresses on her own and posing both for me and in the mirror when she came out. Sue called Rima, her oldest daughter, over from the make-up section of the store to work on the girl as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt first the girl was a bit frightened by the new arrival, but Rima was like her mother, having the knack of putting people at ease in the space of a few heartbeats when she put her mind to it. She was nowhere as good as her mother though, still I could see where she would be given time and practice. Her mother did have almost twenty years more experience after all. Rima treated Asala like a little sister, and the little girl blossomed under the attention. I simply sat back and did almost nothing at all except make some whistling sounds and grin like a fool when Asala looked my way, something she did almost constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter almost two hours of this treatment she danced around a bit before running off to the bathroom. I stood guard outside the door as Sue and her daughter giggled at my protective attitude. Slipping five hundred Reul from my wallet I handed it to them with a wink. We all knew it was payment for the help they had provided. It wasn\u2019t a bribe though, they both knew that much. Still it didn\u2019t hurt to tip when people went above and beyond what they had to do. It was one of the reasons they made sure to be so good at this job, because people like me tended to gravitate towards such shops for the extra services alone. It was a cycle that worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey both gave me a conspiratorial wink and lopsided grin that momentarily made them look like twins before hauling all the goods to the counter to ring me up. By the time Asala came out of the bathroom the two of them had already stuffed everything into six bags ready to be taken. Asala looked up at me with those soft eyes of hers as if asking what next. I saw hints of her sorrow hiding behind the bright crimson but as I had planned from the start, it was no longer all consuming. This was only a band-aid solution of course but it bought me a little more time to get her home where she would feel safe letting it all out. By that time I hoped to have shown her there were other things she could live for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, do you want to go out to eat someplace? Or do you want to go home and I can make you something? I bet after all this you are probably pretty hungry. The last of the magic should be wearing off shortly if it hasn\u2019t already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I said that a loud grumbling filled the air, causing her to reach down and clutch at her stomach with a blush. Letting out a belly laugh I ruffled her hair as she brought the stuffed animal in her left hand up to her face to hide it in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou decide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer words were muffled by the fabric, but I could still make them out despite that fact. Her voice was slightly low and musical, having a soft quality to it. She covered it well, but I still heard the hesitation behind those two words.</span></div></div>",

Besides, now that we have all these new clothes you should show them off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGoing over I dug into the bags, pulling out a soft blue dress that felt like silk between my fingers. It was trimmed in darker blue with a pocket in the front big enough to stuff her bear in like a kangaroo pouch if she wished. I shoved them into her hand along with a pair of shoes that went with them before pushing her off to the bathroom again. She didn\u2019t hesitate in scampering off with her treasure to change as I turned back to Sue and her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThink I could talk either one of you into getting these things to my house somehow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal honey you know we don\u2019t offer home deliveries. Our shop isn\u2019t that big and the boss doesn\u2019t have insurance to cover something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave Sue my best puppy dog face. The one my sister gave to me all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease? You don\u2019t know someone who might be willing to do it for like a hundred Reul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, I think Tommy over in stocking might be interested in something like that. No promises though, since if he took such a job he could get fired. I\u2019m not sure if one hundred Reul would be enough to entice him into doing something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow much would he be willing to do it for Rima? If he was willing at all. I don\u2019t have all that much left now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRima tapped her chin thoughtfully before getting a playful smile on her face. She glanced at me coyly out of one eye as she looked off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Riktal\u2026. I could probably get him to agree to taking only a hundred Reul if I were persuaded to. He has a bit of a crush on me you see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd how could I persuade you to do such a thing Rima?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, I suppose I could do it for a kiss. Just a small peck on the cheek.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s your price for everything. Though don\u2019t try to turn your head this time to get it on the lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was a total accident that time honest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure it was. And the way you tried to slip your tongue into my mouth at the time was an accident as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell no. I simply took advantage of the opportunity presented.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. Well as long as it was just an accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled a bit as she leaned over the counter while turning her head to the side for me to kiss her cheek. With another lopsided grin I leaned over the counter as well. Right before my lips touched her skin she turned her head quickly, getting my kiss on her mouth instead. She danced back laughing playfully, her eyes sparkling in merriment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnother accident?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course! And I didn\u2019t try to take advantage of it this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply shook my head as I slid a hundred Reul bill across the counter for her to pick up laughingly. Her mother was just grinning from the sidelines even as Asala came back out, skipping up and down a bit while her teddy bear rode in the front pocket. I offered the girl my hand which she took instantly with a smile that lit up her face. Rima blew me a kiss as we walked out the door together, getting in a parting shot before the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPleasure doing business with you Riktal darling. Come again soon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith another small chuckle that caused Asala to look up at me questioningly I turned away from the door to head to my next destination. Rima really was incorrigible. But that was part of the charm that had attracted me to her in the first place. Though she was a year older than me, she was one of the few people my age I didn\u2019t think of as being alien. Though admittedly she could be a bit alien in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe had gone out a few times and had a brief fling in the shadows. I didn\u2019t care if anyone knew, but Rima had wanted to keep it a secret. It was hard to believe she had been so much shyer back then. Her mother knew, or at least she suspected but she never said anything. I had been Rima\u2019s first just like she had been mine. I couldn\u2019t say I was actually very good the first time we slept together, but at least I knew I wasn\u2019t horrible. Like with anything, the skills had come with time and practice. Why had we broken up anyway? Oh yeah that was right, she had found someone else that she hadn\u2019t been afraid to admit she was going out with. Of course that had lasted only a few months until he had dropped her for another girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNow that guy had been a real piece of work. Normally I would have let it go. Liaisons\u2019 and breakups happened all the time. But he had left Rima, a normally cheerful girl that no one could damper, in a pile of a weeping mess. Even someone as dense as I was sometimes could tell she had really loved him. I hadn\u2019t got the full story of how he had humiliated her in front of the entire school, but I had heard enough. When I had caught him in that dark alley shortly after I knew it had been revenge pure and simple. But it had been one of the few times I hadn\u2019t acted as a Hunter, I had been acting as a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBiff had never been the same after that. I knew I had gone overboard, turning him into little more than a functioning vegetable. I really hadn\u2019t meant to hit his head so many times, but my anger had gotten the best of me. Now I had to live with the fact that I had turned a promising young man into a total retard that couldn\u2019t tie his shoes on his own. It would have been better if I had killed him in my anger, at least then he would have been better off. Now I just didn\u2019t have the heart to go finish the job in cold blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRima suspected of course, but without proof she wouldn\u2019t say anything. We never had got back together after that but that was fine for both of us. We liked our arrangement. Whenever the loneliness of the house got too much for me to bear, or whenever Rima had the need, we got together for a date or just a few hours of exertion. We had both realized we lived in different worlds in more than one way. Perhaps that was why she had kept our coupling a secret from the beginning. Still, she had helped pull me out of my depression after Siera had died. She hadn\u2019t been annoyed that I had turned her into a bit of a rebound girl. For those things alone, I would be eternally grateful to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeeing my destination up ahead I let my hand rise up to stroke Asala\u2019s soft locks absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope you like pasta, because where I am taking you is the best place in town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2026 Can I have spaghetti?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can have whatever you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI opened up the door to the Pasta Palace as her face split into a grin and the fingers in my hand squeezed slightly. I squeezed back reassuringly, giving her the comfort of knowing I was there.</span></div></div>",

His stomach showed just the hint of a paunch the same way the wrinkles on his face hinted at his age. He saw me sitting there as he looked around and waved good naturedly before heading in my direction. Asala saw him coming as well from her seat next to me and clutched my shirt a bit under cover of the table but otherwise didn\u2019t do anything else. Giving her leg a small squeeze I whispered that it was all right before focusing my attention on my sudden guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey! It\u2019s rare to see you here! And eating before me no less! Your mother was just in the shop a few minutes ago, did you come with her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo Nerval, that is just a coincidence. Honestly I would rather not see her right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill not seeing eye to eye huh? Well I\u2019m not one to get in the middle of a family dispute. Especially not when I get so much business from that family. By the way, word has it there has been a mass monster migration from the north. Apparently the Forest of Shadows became deserted in the space of a night. No one knows where all the monsters actually went, just that they are no longer in their normal nesting grounds. I doubt we will have to worry about any of them this far south, what with the weather changing and all. Still, thought it was an interesting bit of information a Hunter like you might be able to do something with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for the tip Nerval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo prob, no prob. By the way, don\u2019t you think that girl is a bit young for you? Not that I\u2019m saying anything mind you. If that\u2019s your thing then more power too you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be crude Nerval. I\u2019m on a protection job right now. She\u2019s my client. Besides, you don\u2019t have any right to be talking about girls being too young for people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grinned a bit even as a small flush came to his cheeks. With a wave he turned to take a seat a few tables down even as the waitress brought him a plate of stuffed mushrooms and linguino. He rubbed his hands together in glee as she turned away, not noticing the way he stared at her butt as she walked. Shaking my head I went back to my meal, listening to Asala slurp up the noodles happily while her feet kicked back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the waitresses giving us glances, probably thinking how adorable the girl was. And I had to admit, I would agree with them. Taking her out on the town like this made me feel like a big brother again, reminding me of the days I used to take Olia out. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her slurp up a noodle, getting sauce all over her face and a small bit on her new dress. With a sigh I grabbed up some napkins to clean her cheeks before dabbing at the fabric before it stained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBe a little more careful. These are still new clothes you know. Sure it can come out in the wash but still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe squirmed a bit under my ministrations but suffered my manhandling with good grace. When I was finished she grinned, motioning me closer with her fingers. When I leaned over she kissed me on the cheek instead of whispering something in my ear like I thought she was going to. She blushed a bit before hiding her face with both hands and looking at the ground. After a moment she went back to eating but refused to look at me, her face still burning a bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI paid our tab once we both had our fill and ended the meal with some cheesecake. Once back on the streets I wrapped my arm around her shoulder in order to steer her back to the house. If I was right she would be getting a bit tired by now. The magic would all be out of her system and her body would be screaming for some real sleep now that her stomach was full. She leaned her head against my side with a small sigh before her voice wafted up to my ears. It was low and soft, taking me a moment to realize I had heard anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you be my family? Is it ok if I call you my brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course it\u2019s ok. Who wouldn\u2019t want to have a little sister as cute and pretty as you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen\u2026 would you come with me when I have to leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do that. But we can keep in contact. You can cast a communication spell right? If so I can give you my magical id so you can call me wherever and whenever. And if you are too far away for the spell to reach, well you can always write me a letter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she didn\u2019t look at me I could hear the small pout in her voice while her hand clenched against my shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t do a communication spell. I haven\u2019t learned how yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then we have at least two days together. It\u2019s simple enough to learn, so I will teach it to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCross my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was silent for a little bit as the two of us walked through town. Finally she looked up at me with eyes on the verge of tears. I could see some of the sadness she had been keeping at bay until now creeping back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you carry me again? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t answer with words, simply scooped her up in my arms before settling her against my side and wrapping my free arm around her in a hug. She returned it before hiding her face in my shoulder and starting to cry in earnest. I didn\u2019t say anything, just kept walking. Offering her what comfort I could at the moment with just my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to leave again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI miss my mommy and daddy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you too little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knew that feeling of love was just her latching onto me as the person who had pulled her out of the darkness. She would have felt that way about anyone who had treated her as I had today. It had nothing to do with being a Hunter, since anyone could have done it. But I had been the one to anchor her in reality. To make her feel wanted and needed again. Feel less lost without her parents. So I had become the object of her affection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sniffed a bit before another round of tears began dripping onto my shoulder. I simply let her have her tears without saying a word. Sometimes everybody needed a good cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe day is done and your choices made. As you look back do you wonder that ever present question of what if? Do you imagine the way the day could have gone if you had picked a different path? Are you satisfied with this day though? Is it possible to be satisfied with a day and yet still regret it at the same time I wonder? That is a curiosity of a question I would like an answer to. You humans are interesting creatures indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut one timeline is not enough for me. You must come again and redo this day over and over. Only then will my curiosity be sated, my answers found. Only through you making different choices will I find what I want. So come again traveler and decide upon the possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat is, if you really have a choice.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it\u2019s not often I get to show off my cooking skills for someone besides myself. Ever have stuffed Papilla peppers before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head no behind the teddy bear as I reached down to pull her into my side while I turned towards the front counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then I think I know what we will have tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a small nod as she lowered the stuffed animal, a small smile curving her lips. With a grin of my own I began grabbing the shopping bags, juggling them a bit to grab all six of them. With a quick glance down at the girl I shoved one of the bags at her absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell these are your clothes not mine. It\u2019s only fair that you carry at least one of the bags.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the small smile grow a bit bigger as she straightened up a bit to take the bag with her right hand. With a nod to the two women who were giggling at me behind upraised hands I led Asala out into the street. As we walked I noticed her continuing to glance up at me out of the corner of her eye and smiling a bit every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to answer if you don\u2019t want to, but did you go shopping with your mom often? I\u2019m just a bit curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was silent as we walked and I didn\u2019t push her. This was just another part of the plans to let her deal with her grief. I simply kept my eyes straight ahead and didn\u2019t turn to look her way, giving her the feeling of distance if she wanted it without feeling pressured. After a few blocks she finally answered in a voice I could tell was holding back some pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSometimes. Most of the time she went while I was in school. She\u2019d always let me help her carry bags too when she did take me. My daddy never did though. He didn\u2019t do much shopping but he would take me once in a while. But he always carried everything. Said it was a man\u2019s duty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you have any brothers or sisters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Mommy said I was going to have a little sister soon before\u2026 before it happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBefore she died. It won\u2019t help you to ignore it like that. I know it might hurt, but if you use words like \u201cpassed on\u201d or \u201cwent away\u201d or talking about her death in such vague terms it will always hurt. When you can say it like that you can begin the healing process and move forward with your life. It doesn\u2019t mean you forget them if you accept the truth. You don\u2019t have to do that now, but I wanted you to realize that so when you are ready you can move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDaddy used to say stuff like that too. I really didn\u2019t understand him sometimes but he always had a way of making things make sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt will get better. I know it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now, but it will. Tell you what. How would you feel about me calling you my little sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen would it be ok if I called you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell obviously. Isn\u2019t that what a little sister is supposed to call her big brother? Family is what you make and sometimes who you choose. You don\u2019t get a choice in who your parents are, sometimes not even in having brothers and sisters. But it is my belief you have a choice in everything else. Even if they aren\u2019t blood related, that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both fell silent as we continued to walk along. I could see her lost in thought as she walked. She might be a young girl, but I could tell she was no dummy. I could guess at what was going on in her mind based on past experience while dealing with shock and trauma victims but that was about it. To an extent their reactions were the same, but at the same time they were all unique because of their personalities and pasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShortly after we left the bridge over the river and got onto the road a few blocks from my house a red summoning portal opened in front of us. Asala let out a small whimper, hiding behind my leg as a small blur shot into the air and the portal closed again. The bags were already dropping from my hands and reaching up into the duffle bag on my back by the time I got a good look at the monster. With a laugh I uncurled my fingers from the two guns I had grabbed, letting them stay inside the bag for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s just a Cassilion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a meow against the evening air, causing the Cassilion to land on the ground in front of me. Barely bigger than a normal black cat, the six legs and the pair of eagle wings on it\u2019s back made sure no one mistook it for anything but a monster. When I held out my hand the creature came forward to sniff my fingers a moment before rubbing against them. Once introductions were over between us I scratched the monster behind the ears and between his wings, getting a very cat like purr in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCassilion\u2019s were once regular domesticated cat\u2019s you know. They were originally created to serve as Hunter companions. This was around six hundred years or so ago mind you. Back then Hunter\u2019s didn\u2019t have as high of standards and morels as they do today. It was a very brutal and chaotic world back then, the lands were more wild and the fighting harsher. But time moves on like it always does and the lands became quieter. There was no more need for Hunter\u2019s to have fierce battle companions like the Cassilion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut after so many years of breeding and augmenting them using magic and Alchemy, they had become a self sustaining construct that was able to pass it\u2019s abilities down to it\u2019s litter\u2019s without need of Hunter\u2019s as a middle man. Funny don\u2019t you think? We Hunter\u2019s who kill monsters, created this one ourselves. We tamed them and fought with them just like summoners do. Yet today we can easily forget their past, simply calling them a monster. Just like people can so easily hate summoners for their ability to summon and control monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI motioned her over to kneel next to me, holding her hand as I held it out for the beast to sniff. Once it rubbed against her fingers I guided it to the creatures head, helping her pet it a few times before letting go. She continued to stroke the monster as it rubbed up against her, twining around her legs like any normal cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCassilions are very loveable and loyal for the most part, but they still retain much of the cat mentality they are descended from. They can go feral, they can eat anything a cat can, and they are still fierce protectors and fighters. Once they enter into a contract they are bonded for life. They will protect their companion with everything they have. Before, only Hunter\u2019s could make these bonds. Now though, anyone can if the Cassilion accepts the person. Would you like to make a contract with him? If you do he will never leave you and he will fight for you faithfully. Just treat him like a regular cat and you will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo\u2026 do you think he would accept me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsk him. He is quite intelligent and he understands human speech even if he can\u2019t speak it. Hold out your hand palm up while you ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe did as I instructed as the monster stopped rubbing against her to stare into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm. Mr. Cassilion? Do you want to be friends with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the yellow cat eyes glow slightly, giving off a small flash of light as they watched her. Finally it lowered its head and nipped her pointing finger, drawing a single spot of blood. It\u2019s tongue darted out to lap up the spot, healing the puncture in the process. The yellow eyes flashed again, settling into the same crimson color as the girls. Proof that they had bonded. Asala got a slightly slack jawed look for a moment before a foolish grin split her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe says her name is Memoeth but I can call her Meme for short. She\u2019s talking in my head!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd only you can hear her. That is part of the sacred bond you now share. How old is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala was silent a moment before answering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe says she is only two years old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, that\u2019s good. The two of you can grow into your powers together. If she had been much older she would not have been able to use your power as effectively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then yet another summoning portal opened and a large four foot tall brown hairy spider climbed out. Even as I started pulling a sword and pistol from behind my back the Cassilion expanded in size as it leapt towards the monster. By the time it brought it\u2019s paw around it had grown to be six feet tall. With a single strike it severed four of the legs before twisting and smashing it\u2019s tail into the body. The spider was slammed to the ground moments before the Cassilion\u2019s teeth sank into it. The spider monster burst into dust to float away into nothing while the Cassilion shrank back down to normal size again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd that is why they made great Hunter companions. I\u2019m sure she has a few more tricks up her sleeve, but you can trust you are in good hands, or I should say paws. Come on, let\u2019s get back to the house and see about finding a nice treat for Meme as thanks for her hard work today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we started walking towards the house again Asala giggled a bit at something only she heard. I had a feeling her new companion would help her recover faster than I could alone. Or at least speed up the process. As I pulled the girl into my side with a one handed hug the Cassilion\u2019s wings shrunk and folded against it\u2019s body to be hidden by the black fur. The way it walked along beside her made you think it really was a regular cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat is of course until it turned its head to wink a single crimson orb at me.</span></div></div>",

She was back at my side in seconds holding out the shaker with a grin. I simply shook my head before pointing at the pan of meat I was cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSprinkle it on yourself. Not a lot though, just enough to give it a little bit of a bite.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she began shaking out some of the pepper Meme jumped onto the counter next to the stove and snagged a small piece of beef crumb with a claw before hopping away again. Asala giggled at whatever the creature said in her mind as I continued to point out spices for her to add. Once the meat was cooked and drained I showed her how to stuff the peppers before having her help me make six of them. Once the meal was in the oven to cook for the next ten minutes, I grabbed a few homemade cookies from the refrigerator for her to snack on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeople say having desert or sweets before eating will ruin your appetite. But you know what, I don\u2019t believe that. One or two sweets won\u2019t hurt any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala sat at the table munching on the cookies happily as Meme jumped onto her lap. Asala began to absently pet the monster as I cleaned the few dishes we had dirtied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMommy used to let me help her cook too sometimes. But daddy never cooked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did they do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMommy stayed at home most of the time but she did odd jobs helping people sometimes. Daddy worked with wood. He made furniture and carved designs into it to make it look all pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat down across from her as the Cassilion stood up on her lap to lick the few tears running down her cheeks, causing the girl to hug the cat in comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to push yourself if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head back and forth as she squeezed the cat again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, I want to. Meme says you are only trying to help me and that I should answer. She says she will share my pain with me because she is my partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that Asala began telling me about her parents and her life before this while holding onto the monster in her lap. I simply sat and listened until the buzzer went off to let us know the peppers were done. I could only assume the Cassilion was talking to her in her mind, doing much of my work for me. Asala seemed to enjoy the food as we ate, grinning a bit foolishly as she fed bits of it to the beast who had jumped to the floor next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMeme says when I become stronger I will be able to summon other monsters she can use to transform into different forms. Is that true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I really wouldn\u2019t know first hand. I\u2019ve heard tales of such things of course, but if she said so I would say it is true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe got another far off look as a slow smile spread across her lips. With Meme around I didn\u2019t have to worry about her going back into her comatose like state. I would still have random monsters to deal with but I could handle it. So could Meme if it wasn\u2019t too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce dinner was over I told her to go get a bath and clean up. She didn\u2019t put up a fuss, simply nodded her head before grabbing out a change of clothes from the bags still sitting on the floor by the doorway. I heard her pattering feet as she ran upstairs and then the water echoing through the pipes as she turned the knobs. After a moment I heard the unmistakable meow of surprise and faint laughter. In my mind\u2019s eye I could see Asala splashing a bit of water on the cat playfully. Cassilions, like normal cats, were not fond of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI finished cleaning the dishes before going into the living room, settling onto the couch after picking up the newest issue of Swords and Sorcery. The house creaked and settled like it always did, but that empty feeling wasn\u2019t there at the moment. It was as if the house knew there was someone aside from myself inside of it right now. It had been three years since the house had last felt like this. It made me think back on all I had missed out on and all I had lost, making it almost impossible to pay attention to the articles in the magazine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re always lonely aren\u2019t you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over to where Asala was walking into the room rubbing her eyes sleepily. She wore some light pink pajamas with cats printed on it that she herself had picked out earlier. The Cassilion padded silently next to her as she crawled onto the couch and under my arm to snuggle against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause there is only enough for one person everywhere. Meme says yours is the only smell that\u2019s in the house. There are faint traces of others but they don\u2019t coat everything like yours does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, I pretty much live her by myself. I have for a very long time. My family life is really complicated, but it boils down to my parents never sticking around for very long. Big sis lives by herself, even though she works almost as much as my parents do so her house is usually empty as well. She does come over every once in a while to visit but for the most part it\u2019s just me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t let you be lonely while I\u2019m here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe wrapped her arms around me even tighter as she settled more comfortably into the crook by my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m still lonely too since mommy and daddy\u2026 since they died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to cry then as she buried her face in my tunic. I pulled her into a tight embrace as I let her cry herself to sleep. Meme jumped into my lap as her breathing began to even out and the exhaustion of being kept awake for three days by magic overcame her. The monster looked up at me with a knowing gaze before giving me a small head bow and curling up right where she was. I absently stroked the cat monster with my free hand the same way I stroked the girls hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou make sure to protect her well Meme. I already know you will but I have a feeling this girl is special. Well more special than simply being a summoner. She is going to need your help in more than just protection, she is going to need you for support as well. The two of you have a long road ahead of you and it\u2019s not going to be easy. I hope you know what you are getting into.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster let out a soft meow before nipping my finger as if to say I didn\u2019t need to tell her what she already knew. With a chuckle I went back to scratching behind her ears while she stretched out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right, all right I hear you. I won\u2019t say anymore. But if she ever needs any help, you make sure to come find me all right? I\u2019ll drop everything to answer such a call. After all that\u2019s what family is supposed to do right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl let out a small mumble as the Cassilion began to purr contentedly. I couldn\u2019t help but chuckle one more time as I continued to pet them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat knowledge might you have gained if you had gone down another path? What tidbit of information would have popped up? Would such information make the things you have learned mean something else? Would it have made you change your mind on what decision you would have made earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo one can know everything at once. Not unless they are like me, able to see every possibility. But then they would not really be considered human anymore would they? Humans choose the path they think is best, they do not know information they do not have. That is why they regret after the fact. It is why they seem to believe curiosity is one of the greatest traits. Though admittedly I have found many people do not like those who are curious. Seeking to profess knowledge is a good thing while keeping secret everything they possibly can. Truly you humans are fascinating creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I digress. Such musing is for my benefit alone. Neither here nor there. Come again traveler if you wish and see what else the day holds. See what new information you can glean and see if it changes your outlook or your choices.</span></div></div>",

I want to know exactly what they can and cannot do in case the proverbial Yeti skat hit\u2019s the fan. Perhaps next time though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave a shrug while sitting down next to me to watch the two combat floors that came into existence when the teacher raised a wall cutting the main floor in half. I really did want to spar with her, but I also had a feeling she was playing at some game of her own. I wasn\u2019t afraid of her, even if I had almost killed her a little over an hour ago. Sometimes, that was just Hunter politics at work, a cutthroat world on the inside while civilians on the outside thought us shining heroes of justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNot that we weren\u2019t by and large heroes upholding honorable ideals, but as with most things, the truth was rarely so glamorous. If she was plotting to retaliate against me she was welcome to try. I wasn\u2019t about to let my guard down anytime soon. Being born a Zelkov had taught me to never let my guard drop, if I did I was taken advantage of or hurt in some way. So while the two of us watched the groups down below fighting some mid level D class monsters in silence, I kept an eye on her covertly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about retaliation you know, you were right to give me a bit of a wake up call like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. I might not be a tenth generation Hunter like you but even I have eyes. My parents trained me well enough to read body language and notice the covert stares you are sending my way. You\u2019re probably thinking along the lines of I must be plotting something to get back at you for stabbing me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. You want me to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right then. A Hunter should be alert and aware of their surroundings at all times. Even when they are bored to tears. I\u2019d had that fact pounded into me but I forgot it while being forced to go to school here. I got lax and you got the drop on me. Granted you might still have been able to get the drop on me, I don\u2019t know, but it wouldn\u2019t have been that easy if I had been paying attention like I was supposed to. My brother would have done the same as you and called it a warning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you expect me to suddenly trust you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course not, you don\u2019t strike me as being that stupid. Just wanted to let you know I wasn\u2019t planning anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first groups finally defeated their monsters and two more groups of four took their place, going up against some Sanderlings\u2019, giant worm creatures whose mouths were covered by three flaps of skin most of the time. They had flimsy membrane wings that unfolded from their body to flap and create small whirlwinds, even allowing them to glide in the right environments. They were like the illegitimate step children of Sandworms and Slag Wyvern\u2019s. The groups should have no problems if they were around the same skill level as the last two. As long as they kept their heads and worked together they would be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo then what is your game? Why you sitting next to me like we are friends or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo game. Though I suppose I wouldn\u2019t mind if we were friends. I\u2019m just looking for some company. Someone who knows what I am talking about and understands the hassles of being from an older family. You know, like the first monster you slew alone, or how everyone thinks being from an old family is some sort of instant access to the big leagues. When I talk about the first heart crystal I earned and the different phases of my favorite weapon I don\u2019t want to be met by the blank stares the rest of the class gives me. Or that uneasy look in their eye when I talk about Hunter stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a sigh, pulling her foot up onto the bleacher and wrapping her arms around her knee. She let her gaze wander down to the floor where one of the two groups fighting the Sanderlings\u2019 were rolling out of the way of a sand tornado it sent their way before coming up throwing magic in it\u2019s direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe girls just want to talk about boys or jewelry or the hottest clothes and the guys just ogle your breasts while whispering about girls. You can tell they usually have only one thing on their mind. They pass around porn magazines and I know they have some sort of secret ranking system for all the girls in the class and the school. They aren\u2019t really behaving or thinking like Hunter\u2019s most of the time. They get serious about the lessons, but they don\u2019t take anything else seriously. They haven\u2019t figured out that being a Hunter is more than just learning the book stuff, that\u2019s why they find it hard to understand me. But I don\u2019t think you would have that problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess I\u2019ve got no problem with that. You make a valid argument and truth be told I\u2019d probably get bored to tears over such useless chatter as well. I don\u2019t mind talking to you like this. Doesn\u2019t mean I trust you yet though, but I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me as she reached out to shake my extended hand. I had to wonder if this was how people made friends. I really had no experience in this kind of thing, I just knew how to deal with people on a business basis. I knew the niceties and courtesies you were supposed to say, but it was all impersonal for the most part. Before I knew it most of them were friends or acquaintances. But people my own age? I was completely clueless as to how to handle them for the most part. Especially when they seemed to be the ones that got on my nerves the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two groups killed their Sanderlings\u2019 and one group even got a wing for their trouble. They carried the prize out like it was worth a few thousand Reuls, pumping it into the air excitedly. The truth was it would probably sell for maybe eighty Knutz, netting them all a whopping twenty each. Enough to buy them a nice shirt or two if they were on sale. Then again this might be the first time anything ever dropped for them from a monster. At least it wasn\u2019t completely worthless and they would get something from it. I\u2019d gotten a few drops that weren\u2019t even worth a handful of red Senz coins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe last group to go out went up against a Glif so I knew these five had to be a step up from the rest of the class since the monster was a low to mid range C class. I recognized Gregory and Lilia by name and one of the other boys as the one who had been with Gregory by sight but not any of the other\u2019s. Liz nodded her head slightly at the match up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah that\u2019s about right for their skill levels. Gregory, the one with the guns is a bit of an ego tripper, but I\u2019ll admit he has some skill with his dual guns. Daniel, the hand specialist is also pretty good. Probably one of the best in this class excluding us of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pointed at the brown head of the boy who had been with Gregory, giving me a name to a face. I made sure to commit it to memory. She then pointed at the tank of the group, a boy wearing full plate armor and wielding a giant templar\u2019s shield like a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic is a beast of a tank. He\u2019s a natural and out of all of them he is the one I would want shielding me in a crisis. What he lacks in magical power he makes up for in pure strength and determination. A few weeks ago him and Marsa, the caster of the group, took on a small goblin horde. You know the whole few versus many idea? Goblins might be weak D class monster\u2019s but enough can overrun even the best Hunter. Anyways, he charged in there and grabbed agro on all of them like a champ. Marsa was able to go wild with her spells and they didn\u2019t even look at her once. It\u2019s like some sort of trigger gets turned on in his head when he sees a monster. And Lilia is a decent healer. They all need more training of course, but I\u2019ll freely admit they are the best of the lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as she finished saying that Jethic ran forward to bash his shield into the unprotected right side of the creature. When it brought its right fist around he stabbed upwards with his short sword before launching into the air and flipping over the fist. His sword which had sunk a few inches into the flesh cut a huge gash in the creatures underarm as the boy\u2019s feet landed on the seven foot tall giant\u2019s shoulder. He brought his right arm up again, catching the creature under the chin with the thin edge of his shield, causing blood to spray out of the mouth even as it toppled backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy had already twisted and planted his shield by the time the Glif spun back to it\u2019s feet, attempting a leg sweep in the process. The monster was like a hand-to-hand fighter. It was resistant to magic like all sub classes of giant were and it had a fast healing ability until after it came out of second phase. But it\u2019s fighting skills were just a pale imitation of a real fighters since the skill had been implanted in them by a mage long ago in an attempt to turn them into a fighting force. An attempt that ultimately backfired, but the knowledge was then subsequently passed down to each new generation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe beast attacked Jethic with a flurry of blows which the boy took on his shield without moving. It totally ignored the other four who were pounding away on it from behind. Even as fireballs crashed into it and set it\u2019s fine hair on fire. After a few moments it did a few back flips before putting up its dukes and motioning the group to attack. This was it\u2019s second phase, meaning it was almost dead. Any external spells cast would be sucked up by the monster and sent back at the caster. Any physical attack would be blocked and countered. But it wouldn\u2019t actually do anything for these next three minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      Even as the group began to gather together to wait out the beast, I saw Gregory lifting one of his dual pistol's and knew in my gut he was about to do something stupid.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAs he fired his gun, Jethic was suddenly between him and the monster, the bullet pinging harmlessly off the shield. Even from here I could hear the tank\u2019s angry words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the leader of the group today so act like it! Did you forget what the teacher told us? Do you want to have it come chasing after you right now? Put your balls back in your pant\u2019s and quit ego trippin\u2019. This ain\u2019t a macho game here! If you want to fire that weapon again be my guest, but I\u2019m not going to lift a finger to help. I\u2019ll let it pound the snot out of you and then Lilia can heal you up after we finish killing it. If you are still alive after it get\u2019s through with you that is!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic moved out of the way, returning to the group and planting his shield on the ground defiantly while spreading his legs and waiting for the beast to lower it\u2019s hands like an immovable brick wall. Gregory looked from Jethic to the monster and then at the rest of the group before lowering his weapon and going to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s Gregory for you. Told you he has an ego. First time I saw Jethic step up like that though. Must have finally got tired of putting up with Gregory\u2019s crap and having to help clean up afterwards. Can\u2019t say I blame him though, almost every time they work together Gregory does something stupid to make the fight a tad bit harder. At least he didn\u2019t try casting a spell or something. Worst that would have happen in this case was the Glif would have countered and Jethic would have taken it on his shield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe beast finally lowered it\u2019s fists and charged again. Jethic waited a moment before sending out a wave of magical energy like a fog that wrapped around the monster\u2019s head. As the others spread out a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNice use of a provoking sight. Good time to use it too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz nodded absently even as the monster began swinging wildly with both hands, the booming of it\u2019s knuckles on the shield could be heard even from where I was. But Jethic didn\u2019t budge an inch, shifting his shoulder into the shield and anchoring his leg behind him. Daniel came in from the side as Marsa cast a spell that made flames lick around his fists like gloves. This was a second tier fire spell, the power of magma, burning at least a hundred degrees hotter then the tier one version.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDaniel began swinging just as wildly, only his blows were controlled and focused on one spot. Faster and faster they went until his fists were a blur and hitting with the speed of jackhammers. The skin at the small of the beasts back suddenly split wide open like some grape that got squeezed too hard. Daniel spun out of the way as Lilia sent some divine power to wrap around Gregory\u2019s two gun\u2019s second before he shoved them into the gaping hole and fired. The beast bulged outwards like a balloon for a second before a hole exploded out from his chest showering the shield with blue blood and bone fragments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe beast blinked a moment, not yet realizing it was dead before crumpling to the ground. Even as it hit the floor it began to break up into little white motes of energy that disappeared into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou ever wonder why monster\u2019s do that? Just disintegrate like that I mean. Why don\u2019t their bodies stick around? Where do those white motes go and what are they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head absently at Liz\u2019s question while watching the five cheering like the other groups had. Well four of them were cheering together, I could see Gregory was being left out of the celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope never wondered about it. That\u2019s just the way things are. They wouldn\u2019t be monster\u2019s if they didn\u2019t die that way right? It\u2019s magic. Perhaps those white motes are where our magic comes from. If we stopped killing monster\u2019s would we lose our magic abilities? Such question\u2019s aren\u2019t for me. I leave that kind of thing to the scientist and theorist who would be happy to spend a month on just that one question. If it was important for us to know such things those answers would have been found already and been taught to us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the first two groups went back onto the field to face off against two new D class monsters I was shocked to see my father walking into the room with a little girl in tow. Her crimson eyes and white hair stood out like a sore thumb against the lime green dress she wore. Her outfit making her pale white skin seem even paler. I was already making my way down to the side floor as he headed for the teacher. By the time I got there my father was just finishing his whispered conversation and the teacher was motioning for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour father wants to speak with you Zelkov. You can use one of the locker rooms if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father shook his head slightly, saying that this might take a while and he wouldn\u2019t hold up the class. With a nod of the head the Arena Master turned his attention back to the two groups as me and my father left the room. I glanced over at him as we walked, seeing the black circles under his eyes and a few more wrinkles on his sun tanned face. It had only been a month since I last saw him but I was sure there were a few more strands of gray sprinkling his black hair. He wore a simple blue pullover shirt that accentuated his lean frame and baggy black pants I knew hid powerful legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how are you son? I haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame old, same old. I thought you were still taking care of that Sandworm infestation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was. Got some unexpected help though, seems another Hunter had been contracted for the same job and we ended up meeting during the extermination. Was able to clear it out with his help a lot sooner than expected. We agreed to split the profits, a fact that he was grateful for since honestly he wasn\u2019t exactly up to dealing with it alone. I think he was trying to make a name for himself or he was hard up for money, that\u2019s why he took the job in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both fell silent then, neither one of us really knowing what to say. I was on better terms with my father than with my mother but he was still little more than a stranger to me. We rarely saw each other, since like my mother, he was always out on one job or another. Coming home once, maybe twice a month if I was lucky. It was almost a special holiday when both my parents were home at the same time. But as always, they rarely stayed more than twelve hours before they were off again. I tried to remember the last time either one of them had been home for my birthday or one of the many holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas and failed. But that was just how my life was, one solitude filled day after another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe led me to a room that looked like it was used for student council meetings. A single bookshelf with some tomes in it, a table with six chairs scattered around and a single window looking out on a running track. He offered me a seat and I took it while he gently guided the girl to another one pushing her into it lightly. The only reason I knew she wasn\u2019t some lifelike doll was the slight rise and fall of her chest and the miniscule movements as her fingers squeezed the teddy bear she was holding to her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s this about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was hoping you could take this girl for a few days. Your mother has been taking care of her the last three days since her parents died. But she is going to be heading off to Bornica on another job and I will be going with her to help so neither of us can guard her. She\u2019s special. You see her parent\u2019s were actually murdered, assassinated in front of her. Because of that her powers as a monster summoner manifested. Now she can\u2019t control them and she has hidden inside herself as you can see. As far as they can tell, her powers trigger more often when she gets emotional, so in a way her retreating inside herself has slowed it down a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo if mother was taking care of her then why are you here? Shouldn\u2019t she be the one to ask me to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust between you and me? I think she didn\u2019t want to get into another argument with you. I think she might have been afraid you wouldn\u2019t be able to objectively look at the problem and would refuse the job simply to spite her. Plus we both know she\u2019s not good with kids, I think she was uncomfortable with the girl as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI take it there is someone else coming to pick her up in a few days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes a summoner your mother knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I bet she would prefer this to be under the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know this is a real putnak move on her part don\u2019t you? Using you instead of coming to face me herself. Not to mention asking me to do a high level Hunter job while not wanting me to take the Exams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. I really don\u2019t fully agree with it either but it is what it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nibbled on my thumbnail as I looked at the girl for a little bit. Watching as my father absently put his hand on top of her head. He sucked at being a father, but at least he wasn\u2019t as bad with children as my mother was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFour thousand Reul. That will mainly cover expenses and a little extra for me. That\u2019s on top of my regular living allowance of course. As much as I hate to admit it, her ploy to send you worked. I don\u2019t have that small urge to drive a harder bargain and am willing to do this more as a favor than a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, yeah. Don\u2019t get used to this though. I\u2019m in a good mood today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father gave me a lopsided grin as he chuckled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sound like that\u2019s a rare occurrence.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I usually wasn\u2019t in a good mood too often, merely a state of neutrality at best. My father didn\u2019t seem to know how to respond to that so simply kept his mouth shut. At least he wouldn\u2019t try say something in an attempt to disagree with me like my mother would have. He knew as well as I that he didn\u2019t know much about me at all so couldn\u2019t deny or confirm the truth of my words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo is their anything else mother wanted you to try and get out of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah there was actually. She wanted you to continue to go to school while you are protecting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she mad! You know how little love most people have for summoners! What if someone in this school found out! Within the hour I would have just about everyone after her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know that son. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to tell her you bargained with me to get the next few days off until she get\u2019s taken off your hands. If you really feel it safe to bring her to school then you are more than welcome too, but I wouldn\u2019t bring her either. I\u2019ll be letting them know in the office, so you can leave once this meeting is over. And just for the record, I didn\u2019t agree with your mother\u2019s idea to send you to this school. It was my opinion that you should be able to take the Exams. But in the end your mother won out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell at least one of you believed in me and my strength I take it you will be leaving soon?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA little later on today actually. Your mother is in town gathering some things at the moment. We will probably be gone for about a week, maybe two. But after that I\u2019d really like to stay home and spend a little time with you if that\u2019s possible. Maybe go fishing or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ve never gone fishing before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFirst time for everything right? I know I\u2019m not a very good father, but I thought it was high time I at least tried to be something resembling one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll have to see if I have time in my busy schedule. But I might be able to work you in for something like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me a smile as he pushed his chair back and stood up. He nodded his head slightly to the side before heading towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose that\u2019s the best I can hope for. I guess you\u2019ve got a life too now. It was good seeing you again son. I\u2019ll leave you to work your magic with the girl, I know you will be able to help her more than I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBe safe dad. Don\u2019t let any monster\u2019s get the best of you. Oh and tell mother big sis Ulicia sends her love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut not you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at me with slightly sad eyes before nodding slowly and closing the door behind him. Once he was gone I walked around the table to sit next to the little girl, giving her hair a small stroke as I smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can quit playing the whole deaf and dumb game if you want. I\u2019ve been watching your fingers twitching and squeezing that bear the whole time we were talking so I know you could hear what we were saying. I\u2019m not going to force you to talk though, since I really don\u2019t blame you for running away inside your head. I have a cousin that\u2019s mute you know. He was in a bad accident when he was really young and lost the use of his voice. I used to spend a lot of time with him when I was younger, so we came up with a way of communicating using only our hands and body language. He could have written everything down but where\u2019s the fun in that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waggled my eyes while letting my tongue pass in and out through puckered lips quickly like a lizards in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was our way of  saying we wanted to talk privately. Though admittedly one of us usually ended up cracking up into laughing fits since the other usually also added weird faces into the mix.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her lip twitch just a fraction at the face I had made and knew my bet had paid off. Even if she didn\u2019t look it, I couldn\u2019t imagine that she had blocked all her senses off to be truly blind to the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know what? I don\u2019t even know your name! Hmm you look like a Suzy. No, a Paladias. Wait no, Paladias was the name of a dog I once knew, doesn\u2019t really seem fit for a human now does it? Hmm, you aren\u2019t one of those strange ones with a guy\u2019s name like Jack are you? Or one of those pretentious ones that use stage names like Tootsie Roll or Candy Cane I hope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally let a little giggle escape her lips while letting a small smile touch her face and shaking her head. It was that point I knew I had won at least a little bit of her trust. I had gotten through that small wall she had put up against the world and been allowed into her little bubble. Even if I wasn\u2019t allowed access to the secret places in her heart yet this was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell what is it then? I could teach you the alphabet me and my cousin came up with but that would take time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe slowly raised her right hand and began spelling out letters on the tabletop. A-S-A-L-A. I grinned even more as I stroked her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a very pretty name. I bet your voice is just as pretty. I hope to hear it sometime. That is if you can speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then there was a knock on the door and my father came back into the room quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh son, I almost forgot to tell you the most important parts. Her name is..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little girl turned her head as I pointed at her and told him she had told me herself. He had a small look of surprise on his face before shaking his head with a half grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I shouldn\u2019t be too surprised. You always did have a way with kids. Your mother also said they have been sustaining her with doses of magic since she refused to eat or sleep. I guess that is a little moot as well with you looking after her. You\u2019ll get her body back into equalibrium again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe reached behind him for a moment, picking something up off the floor outside before plopping my duffle bag down just inside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI took the liberty of grabbing this for you. I didn\u2019t think you would want to expose her to more danger than you had to right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me another nod before looking at Asala with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. My son is good at his job. He is as good if not better than many Hunter\u2019s I know. What he lacks in experience he makes up for in smarts. Plus he has no problem with people like you. Those with special abilities that is. Don\u2018t know where he gets it from because I\u2018ll admit, I can\u2018t see it the same way. I\u2018ve had my ups and downs with summoners and puppeteers and a few other unique abilities like corpse jumpers. I\u2018ve learned to live with and tolerate them but I just can\u2018t quite trust them anymore like he can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala smiled tentatively at my father moments before a small red circle began to appear on the table top in front of us. She whimpered a bit in fear even as I absently lifted my fist and pounded it down on the small head beginning to emerge like a hammer hitting a nail. The Gremlin toppled back through the hole and it closed up again a second later. The whole time I never let the smile drop form my face as Asala watched the summoning circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf that\u2019s all you got then I really don\u2019t have anything to worry about. Though if you bring out something really big and scary I guess I\u2019ll have to actually do some work for a change huh? But no matter how big and scary it is I\u2019ll send it back where it came from just like I did that little beastie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father gave me another farewell and left again even as I stood up dusting invisible dirt off my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala, what do you say about going out and doing a little shopping? Because quite honestly, that dress is making my eyes want to go blind from looking at it. But you see, the thing is, I\u2019m not really all that good with this fashion stuff. I wouldn\u2019t know where to start. So it\u2019s going to be up to you to pick out your own dresses and shoes. Perhaps even a few pieces of jewelry to go with them. Think you can handle that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head up and down as I offered her my hand and she took it. I stopped for only a moment to shrug my bag onto my back so it was out of the way before heading out the door and towards the entrance. Asala stuck close to me, moving in even closer once we were out on the street and heading towards town. I simply gave her silent support by squeezing her hand gently to let her know I was there. Between that and the way she crushed the teddy bear to her chest, she seemed to gain more confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEvery so often I noticed her looking up at me covertly, her thoughts a complete mystery to me. But the only thing she ever saw was the constant smile of contentment and the aura of comfort I tried to give off while staring straight ahead. At those times I would see a smile curve her lips, as if she had been seeking reassurance and had found it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cIf I had known you would spend that much I would have asked for more money! What is it with girls and shopping anyway? Is it like some secret gene you are born with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me over her bowl of beef stew from across the table. After two hours of shopping and her acting like the proverbial kid in a candy store she was sporting a new canary yellow dress that still looked a bit eye watering but she seemed to like. She hadn\u2019t said a word, simply laughed and giggled a few times. Though she was free with her smiles if nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat wasn\u2019t to say she had forgotten about her grief for her parents. Those emotions were still written all over her face. But I had tried hard to make her push them to the side for now in a careful attempt to show her there were still good things in this world that she was allowed to appreciate. That just because the people she loved the most in the world were dead didn\u2019t mean there was nothing left. I had learned that lesson the hard way without anyone else helping me. No, there had been one person, but I hadn\u2019t allowed her to help for the longest time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we ate our meal I taught her a few more simple hand signs and motions of the secret language me and my cousin had come up with. Everything from a simple please and thank you to asking how are you. This unique way of talking seemed to amuse her, making her focus on learning and mastering it. I lost track of time as the two of us sat there, my duffle bag and her shopping bags on the floor and the seat next to us. When the clock tower outside rang  six o\u2019clock I started in surprise, realizing we had been at this for almost three hours while absently eating sweets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinishing off the drink in front of me I began gathering our stuff while motioning for Asala to follow me. Even though she couldn\u2019t hold my hand because my own were full, she stuck close, grabbing onto my tunic with her left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, I\u2019d like you to meet someone before we go home ok? Think you are up for a bit of a walk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she gave me another nod of affirmation I headed off down the street deeper into the city. We wouldn\u2019t exactly be going to the far side of town, but it was slightly farther than I normally went and in all honesty I didn\u2019t always like going here. I stopped at a pastry shop to pick up a Lemon-Melon bar for only a moment before heading on my way again. After about thirty minutes of walking I turned into the graveyard, walking through all the neat rows of tombstones until I found the one in the back I wanted. Kneeling in front of the grave I bowed my head and gave a short prayer to The One God before standing up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala I\u2019d like you to meet Olia Zelkov, my little sister. She\u2019d be fourteen now if she hadn\u2019t died. Three years ago I failed to protect her like a big brother should and because of that she paid the price. She was a bit of a crybaby but I loved her dearly. Almost like she was my own child instead of my sister. When she died\u2026 when she died I felt a part of myself had been ripped out. As if I would fall into this bottomless hole and never be able to climb out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoftly I rubbed the top of the granite monument, feeling my eyes moisten up and my vision go a bit blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt the time I was alone. Or at least, I thought I was alone. My parents mourned for a few days, but then they were running off to some foreign country overseas acting like they were over it. As if it had never happened. As if her life had meant nothing! My mother burned all of her stuff. Every picture, every stuffed animal, every stitch of fabric she had ever worn or used. But through great effort I saved a few things. A few precious animals and pictures. But what I saved was only a fraction of the memories she had left behind to prove she had been alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not ashamed to say there were nights I cried myself to sleep. Nights where I just wanted to end it all. Even nights where I wanted to rampage around destroying everything. I saw nothing good in the world. Nothing to make living have any meaning if I kept going. That\u2019s how deep into my own pain and despair I was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSquatting down I traced the letters engraved down the tombstones sides. Originally there had only been her name, date of birth and the day she died chiseled in. But the grave had seemed too impersonal to me that way. She had deserved better than what she had gotten. So I had carved these words out with my power. Every jagged edge, every curve, every extra word had been my farewell to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>For the little girl who always dreamed big, may this sleep try to contain them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was finally helped out of my darkness by someone I was proud to call a friend. She was a monster summoner like you. But back then I was like everyone else, blindly hating and fearing that which I didn\u2019t understand. Yet still she helped me find myself again. At no little danger to herself I might add. She showed me how I could keep living on despite my loss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho was she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe voice was soft and sweet, almost musical. I could hear the sadness in the words even as I saw the tears in Asala\u2019s eyes. I got to my feet and went to the grave on the right before pulling out the sickly sweet pastry, unwrapping it and placing it at the base of the marker. My finger\u2019s traced the words engraved there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>To a loving daughter who\u2019s caring knew no bounds. The world is a darker place for your loss.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBelow those words were engraved a more personal note from me to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>To the first girl I loved, you will forever live on in every breath I take. Your deeds shall never be forgotten.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer name was Siera. Siera Masanafill. She died protecting me. Took a giant\u2019s club that was meant for me full in the stomach after pushing me out of the way. I tried to get her to a hospital or a priest as fast as I could. I really did. But it was too late, she died before they could do anything. I lost her a year after I lost Olia. Almost to the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the snot running down my nose and the tears flowing down my cheers, letting them free reign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe loved sweet things. The sweeter the better. Sometimes I thought her teeth would instantly rot out of her mouth because of how sweet the candy was. It hurts Asala. Even now it still hurts. But it does get better over time. That pain inside is like a big gapping open wound. Time heals it, but it will continue to ache, continue to make you feel like it is still fresh. Memories of them, both good and the bad, keep them alive and help you deal with that pain. I know how you feel right now, but I can help you if you let me. Just like Siera helped me once I let her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to forget your parents, or telling you everything will be all right. Because the truth is, for a while it won\u2019t be. Nightmares, regrets, the desire to die yourself, wanting to curl into a ball and not get out of bed. They will all be there at some point. Even if things are good like they were today, it won\u2019t last forever. Sometimes that sorrow will creep in and taint even the happiest moments for you. But it\u2019s how you handle these things that\u2019s important. Do you allow them to take over, living in the past, regretting everything and wasting your life away? Or do you stand up, look forward, and begin to move despite all of that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to look at her in time for the four foot six inch frame to slam into me, wrapping her arms around my neck and bawling her eyes out. I embraced her as well as I stroked her hair gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll get lost along the way, you will backtrack and second guess your decision. But you will grow strong. You will grow confident. But most of all you will live. You will appreciate life and you will recognize how precious it is. You are a monster summoner now whether you like it or not. With your power you can hurt millions of people if you want to. And if you remain stuck in the past, that\u2019s probably what will happen as your pain and hurt controls your power. But if you walk forward with your head held high it will be you who controls that power and not your pain. And you who decides how it will be used. Running away into your head won\u2019t give you that kind of control, it only lets the pain take over. I\u2019m no expert on this kind of stuff, but that\u2019s what I believe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe cried herself to sleep in my arms there in the graveyard while I offered her what comfort I could. Gathering her light frame up, I levitated the bags around me with a bit of magic. I took a few steps away on my way home before turning and looking a the two graves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSleep well little sisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStrength comes from the oddest places and affects people in different ways. Not just the path they take but the way they interact with others as well. This I have found while observing you humans. You put much stock in strength, throwing the word around almost casually sometimes. But I have to wonder, when you say strength, do you sometimes mean character? Moral dilemmas put a test to these strengths I have found. And sometimes those dilemmas aren\u2019t even all that great. Sometimes it comes from something as simple as telling a group of strangers your last name or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWould this day have turned out like it had if you had simply told the class your full name from the start? What series of events, thoughts, and or actions led up to this outcome? Did the shock of learning who he really was when they did have anything to do with it? Would they have not had certain thoughts or desires pop into their mind at just the right time if they had not been surprised by the revelation? Would the one known as Gregory have rummaged through his bag if he had known who\u2019s bag it was to begin with? And if he hadn\u2019t, would Riktal have ever met Lilia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith such infinite possibilities for a single day, was their any point in all of this. That, my traveler, is for you to decide. Come again and explore another possibility and see how else this day may have gone.</span></div></div>",

We had never really had what one would call a father-son relationship. We had played chess or some other strategy game a few times when he was home from one job or another, but on the whole he was gone just as much as my mother. Staying for twelve hours at the most before running off again to do some new mission or other. As such I was sometimes surprised to know he even remembered my name. he really didn\u2019t know how to deal with me as his son, just as I didn\u2019t know how to deal with him as my father. So we dealt with each other as Hunter\u2019s, keeping our conversation mainly on business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, was there anything else mother wanted you to try to get me to agree to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere was. She wanted you to continue coming to school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! Do you know how crazy that is? What if someone found out about her power? I\u2019d be fighting off the entire building within an hour!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, that\u2019s why you drove a hard bargain. in exchange for taking the job for so little pay and doing it under the table, you got me to agree to letting you have a few days off until the girl is gone. Your mother will be mad at me for letting you skip school, but I\u2019ll deal with it. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been on her bad side, and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe let out a small chuckle at some private joke only he understood, perhaps a memory of another time he had been on mother\u2019s bad side. He shook his head slightly before looking at the girl and then back at me suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh before I forget! Her name is Asala and your mother has been dosing her with magic to keep her body functioning. From what she said, Asala here refuses to eat or sleep, just keeps staring off at nothing. I know you\u2019re really good with kids, do you think you could help her? If she stays like this too much longer, her body will eat itself up without real nutrition and rest. It\u2019s not something your mother asked me to ask you, it\u2019s something I am asking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course mother wouldn\u2019t ask something like that. That would require her to care about someone other than herself. You know, like most other people. But don\u2019t worry, I was already planning on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Riktal. So\u2026. When me and your mother get done with this mission, you want to do something together? Like go fishing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Trying to act like a real father? We\u2019ve never gone fishing before. In fact we\u2019ve never done anything together before really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m getting old, pushing forty you know? I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately and I thought perhaps it was time I try something new. I can\u2019t make up for the past, but perhaps I can learn a few new tricks and try being a father for real instead of just on paper.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ll see. I\u2019m pretty busy you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose you are. I bet you have your own little business going around here under the table. After all I did the same when I was younger than you and had made a name for myself by the time I was your age. I told your mother you should be allowed to take the Exams but I lost the argument.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stood up and headed for the door, giving me a parting smile as he stood in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake care son and see you in maybe a week or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou too dad. Don\u2019t let any monster\u2019s kill you. Also tell mother big sis Ulicia sends her love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut not you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou already know the answer to that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head sadly, his eyes watching me softly for a moment before his Hunter face snapped back into place and he walked out the door. I waited a moment after he left before walking around the table to sit next to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo your name is Asala huh? It\u2019s a pretty name. By the way I know you can at least hear me. You want to know how I know? That bear you are holding in your left hand told me so. It\u2019s been talking to me this entire time. Or should I say the way your hand has been twitching and squeezing it this entire time told me so. You don\u2019t believe me do you? Well then I will just be taking your bear from you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slowly reached out for the bear, having no real intention of taking it, simply trying to get a reaction out of her. My ploy worked better then I expected though as her right hand shot up to quickly ensconce the bear in her grasp as she jerked away from my reaching arm. With a grin I let my fingers drop back in my lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee you just proved my point. You also proved you can see what I am doing and recognize what my movements mean. Though I would like to know where you learned the trick of disconnecting yourself from your senses like that. Is it something one of your parents taught you or did you just naturally learn it by yourself? Well, no matter. It\u2019s worked for you so far and it\u2019s a useful skill to have. I won\u2019t force you to come out of it, but I bet you will by the time this day is over. You should know, no one has ever won a bet against me yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t react at all to my words after that first swift movement. I didn\u2019t push her though, people dealt with grief in their own ways. That bear held great importance to her and it was part of how she was coping. Once I wasn\u2019t actively going after her bear she returned to the near comatose state she had been in before. There were many different ways I could handle this, from a straightforward approach to a comical one. Long winded talking or only a few words spoken. I\u2019d play this one by ear though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo when I stood up I offered her my hand but she didn\u2019t move or even acknowledge my presence. With a small smile I gently pulled her up by the arm and led her out the door. I stopped in on the combat arena only long enough to pick up my duffle bag from the locker before heading for the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou and me girl, we are going to have a bit of fun right now. Buy some clothes, see some sights, meet some people, and generally make you feel like a kid. I\u2019m not going to listen to any of your complaining either. You see, I think your problem right now is you don\u2019t trust me. There are dozens of ways I can get you to do that. But I think you will enjoy what I have in mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced back to see that her only response was to tighten her grip on the bear just a fraction.</span></div></div>",

Just leave the bags outside the door and close the gate once you leave.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know if you were anyone else Riktal, I\u2019d flat out refuse. We don\u2019t do house drops because there are too many potentials for lawsuits.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you\u2019re you. You\u2019ve helped us out so many times this store owes you more than one. I\u2019ll make sure to send one of the stock boys who could use a bit of extra pay and knows how to keep his mouth shut about such things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry Shizu, this is Hunter business. If crap hit\u2019s the fan and it comes down to your backside on the line you let me know. I\u2019ll smooth it over, no matter how much I have to bribe to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the woman as I turned to leave the store, taking a last look at the five bags I had managed to buy. I hadn\u2019t actually meant to spend that much but I had seen the spark of interest in Asala\u2019s eyes as I held up clothes against her body before she quickly suppressed it. I might not be up on the latest fashions or what the trendy new anything was, but that didn\u2019t mean I was totally clueless. When you simply observed people and listened with your ears more than you moved your mouth there was tons of information you picked up even if you didn\u2019t want to. I would have normally carried the bags, but I would rather be unhindered at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOut on the street I looked around quickly, judging it to be almost three o\u2019clock. Indeed one of the many clock towers rang out that it was three even as I thought that. We were on the east side of town, much farther than I usually went on a regular basis since it was completely opposite of where I lived. But there were things in this city that could only be found here. Things like the mini amusement park where we were headed now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt first she didn\u2019t react, simply allowed me to pull her along like she had been doing. But as soon as I entered the little area where they had the circus show I knew I had made the right choice. Even though the actual show was closed for the moment, I was known here so given free reign of the park whenever I wanted.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of the clowns waved at me moments before he got shot in the face by a fire hose. He began to splutter and cough as he tried to get away. I was pretty sure this hadn\u2019t been planned though based on the way he began to yell at the other clown afterwards. But it did elicit a small chuckle from Asala before she suppressed it. I kept my grin under wraps as I continued on to the back where I had a feeling her walls would break down completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! It\u2019s been a while since I last saw you around here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up Mavrick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame old, same old. That girl you recommended to us is working out wonders. Took to the acrobatics like a fish to water. Tonight will actually be her first performance. After all the training she did I think she is more than ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook the guys hand with a grin before pulling Asala forward a little. Mavrick looked every inch the clich\u00e9 ringleader, with long red coat with penguin tails to the absurdly large black top hat. He even sported a curly black handlebar mustache. Coupled with his seven foot twig like frame he always seemed a bit comical to me. Mavrick took off his top hat and bowed dramatically to the little girl, showcasing his slightly balding head of black hair. I could see her grin foolishly for a moment as her eyes sparkled. Mavrick had that kind of effect on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMavrick here runs this little circus. And if he is willing I hoped he might give us a small tour of the place. Let you get an inside look at the animals and some of the things they do to practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor you, anything Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe pulled his hat off again and reached inside. Even though the hat wasn\u2019t all that long his arm went all the way up to the shoulder as he stuck his tongue out of the side of his mouth while a look of concentration covered his face. Finally he pulled his arm out, bringing out a whistle carved into the shape of a cat which he offered to the little girl. When she didn\u2019t move to take it Mavrick looked at me questioningly and I shook my head slightly, telling him with my eyes not to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know we aren\u2019t going to move on until you take the gift. If you want to see anything more that is. If not then do nothing and we will turn around right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a moment nothing happened then her hand came up and took the whistle hesitantly. I stroked her hair while grinning, telling her she was a good girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want to see first?\u201d</span></div></div>",

That should put her in a good mood to see the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour wish, is my command!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he said this he spun around in a circle over and over until a cape popped into existence out of nowhere which he then hid himself with for only a moment. When he flung it away his ringleader outfit was gone, replaced with a flamboyant pink tutu. He looked down at himself feigning shock before covering himself with his cape again, returning to his normal wear, eliciting another giggle from Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou still doing your two-bit slight of hand Mavrick? Why don\u2019t you leave the trickery to the professionals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey the people who come here know we don\u2019t use real magic in our tricks. They come because they want to be entertained and wrack their brains figuring out how we did it. Why shouldn\u2019t the boss also have a few tricks up his sleeves for them to be confounded over? Besides, they are fun to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re just a big kid Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe motioned for us to follow and we did. Though I noticed Asala was now walking under her own power instead of being dragged behind me. Her steps quickened and her head shifted from side to side as we passed some of the attractions like the strong man and the knife juggler. Tony the juggler saw Asala staring and grinned before giving her a wink, lunging forward to catch a knife handle in his teeth before juggling two more blades on the tip of the caught knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala\u2019s eyes went wide with surprise and delight as she looked back at me open mouthed. I laughed at her look of shock as I ruffled her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you didn\u2019t I? No one has ever won a bet against me. Just because you\u2019ve come out of your shell doesn\u2019t mean something bad will happen. Even if it does I will protect you. Just enjoy being a kid right now, deal with the rest later. Understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked a moment but finally nodded slowly as she slipped her fingers into my hand. Mavrick glanced back with a knowing look and a roguish half grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHunter business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHunter business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFigured. I\u2019ll let everyone know\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAppreciated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough we came to a little makeshift circus ring where the magicians and clowns were sitting around on upturned boxes or stools around the outside. While the majority were shooting the breeze or sipping drinks, there were a few clowns going over a routine inside involving seltzer water and a hidden fire hose. It was your basic run of the mill low brow slapstick humor for the most part, but it could still be funny for all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as we came on the group one of the magicians pulled out a deck of cards, getting another magician to pick one. By the time we were on them the first magician had the card in hand, placing a one Senz coin on the face of it for a moment before flicking it with his finger. When he showed the back of the card there was a red circle with the coins markings on it right where the coin had been on the other side. The second magician took the card and inspected it, finally admitting he was stumped, at which point both of them began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you can see these are the fine backbone of our group. Everything they do is illusion and slight of hand. No matter how fantastical or mundane you may think it, they don\u2019t use real magic to pull it off. It is a dying art form in this day and age where people are learning how to use their magic to accomplish more and more things. But that\u2019s part of the wonder isn\u2019t it? Knowing we are using no magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavrick pointed at the clowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd of course we got clowns. What can I say? Their clowns.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Mavrick! Tell \u2018em the truth! You only praise the magicians so highly cause you\u2019ve got a few tricks of your own!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEveryone began to chuckle at that because everybody knew the banter was good natured and the comical face Mavrick made when he had answered elicited such a reaction. A few of the people sitting around who had been with the circus for a while raised a hand and greeted me jovially, quickly filling in the newer ones as to who I was. After a few minutes Asala had been integrated into the group like she was a long lost friend. Within the span of fifteen minutes they had her laughing at their antics or staring fascinated as the magicians boggled her mind with their illusions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe even got to learn a few simple slight of hand moves, such as how to make a coin seem to disappear from the palm of her hand by slipping it between her fingers at the right time. She didn\u2019t perfect it but I could see she was having fun trying. At best she was able to half hide it between her fingers by the time we moved on. But the glow of glee that suffused her face said everything I needed to know. I could still see some signs of grief but for the most part it had taken a backseat to her excitement and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavrick led us to the acrobats next who were busy flying through the air on trapezes or walking on tightropes or even just contorting their body into impossible looking positions. Some of them greeted me just like the others had when they weren\u2019t doing anything else and even offered to let Asala jump on the trampoline with them. She pleaded with me using only her eyes, still refusing to actually talk but I didn\u2019t need to hear words to understand her. With a small shove I sent her running off to two girls in one piece suits that I knew were particularly good at what they did. Grinning at how the teddy bear flapped in the air as she ran and then refusing to put it down while bouncing up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s special somehow isn\u2019t she Riktal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI might not got much of the mind reading power, but from what little I picked up when we met I could tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s like Minerva.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen she is in good hands. Don\u2019t worry like I said earlier, I\u2019ll pass the word around. You were never here and nobody saw or heard anything. Well most of the old crew know that already, it will mainly be the new faces I have to talk to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks nothing. You\u2019ve been good to me and mine Riktal. Always looking out for us little guys. And not looking down on the few of us with unique abilities. You\u2019re like family to us here. Well those of us that have been here a while. Don\u2019t be such a stranger all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both put on grins as Asala came running up breathing quickly with the edges of her lips almost touching her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for bringing me! I\u2019m having a lot of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was soft, light and almost musical with that slightly high pitch of youth. As she stood panting I knelt in front of her, giving her head a rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour welcome Asala. But we aren\u2019t done yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then there was a scream above us. I looked up in time to see one of the trapeze ropes break, sending a little boy high into the air. Already there was an older woman shoving off from the opposite side in an attempt to catch him when he fell past, but I could tell she had misjudged the timing. She would be on the backswing by the time he came down and out of her reach. There was a net beneath them so ultimately he would bounce off of that. But there was still a chance he would fall wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt my legs bunching to save him but held myself back. My duty was to protect this girl. I couldn\u2019t leave her side that easily. What would happen if I saved the boy and left the girl open to attack? At worst the boy would break an arm or a leg and be bruised up for a while. These things happened in this kind of business after all. But I still wanted to save him.</span></div></div>",

With that thought in mind I shoved off towards the trampolines. My eyes never left the boy as I jumped high into the air using a small gust of wind to throw me aloft and then another gust to shove me back down quickly. My feet hit the stretched fabric folding slightly before spring boarding me like a missile towards the boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust as the woman got to the lowest point in her arc I was grabbing the boys arms. Rolling over top of him I used my own weight to shove him back down while straightening out his body. In those few seconds my back was against his as I used the back of my legs to swing his downward towards the ground first. The woman came to the highest part of her swing, grabbing the boys legs as they came in range just in time for me to let go. As the woman swung back along her arc with the boy safely in her grasp I spread my arms and legs, allowing myself to freefall until my back bounced on the net. There were cheers as the boy bounced onto the net as well a moment later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned my head in time to see a sandbag tied to the end of a rope swinging right for Asala\u2019s head. I threw out a wall of wind to stop it but knew even before I let the spell leave my fingers I was going to be too late. The bag was coming too fast and I was just too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavrick lunged forward, grabbing the girl up and carrying her out of the way, the bag missing him by millimeters. It passed so close the wind of it actually lifted his penguin tails. My wall of wind hit the bag, causing it to explode. The rope went flying into the air as a heavy fabric backdrop fell from the ceiling a short distance away to lay in a heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I had rolled off the net back to the floor and run over to grab Asala up in a hug making calming noises, Mavrick was already yelling angrily at the stagehands who were bowing and scraping in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry about that Riktal. My daughter convinced me that stage backdrops and light shows were all the rage overseas and that I should incorporate them into our acts. We still aren\u2019t completely used to all of it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ignored him for the moment, stroking the girls hair as she clung to me tightly shaking a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you ok Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou lied to me. You said you wouldn\u2019t let anything bad happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right I did say that. I got a bit careless. I let my desire to help that boy overcome my mission to protect you. I\u2019ve got no excuses. I brought you here so you could see that you could trust me and this one little act ruined all of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up at me, blinking a few times as she tried to keep from crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to deny it? Not going to say things like it won\u2019t happen again or I\u2019m sorry or all the things other grown ups say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems you got me mistaken for someone else. I never said I was grown up yet. I don\u2019t know what kind of adults you\u2019ve dealt with but I\u2019m a Hunter first and foremost. And a Zelkov at that. Granted my parents were pretty crappy ones and my big sister is definitely a weird one, but they taught me to own up to my mistakes. I can\u2019t say for sure that it won\u2019t happen again, all I can do is be on guard against letting such desires override interfering in your safety. I can say I\u2019m sorry all I want, but that doesn\u2019t mean I should be forgiven for my actions. Apologies aren\u2019t really for the person wronged, it\u2019s for a persons own desires. Because they are looking for forgiveness to make themselves feel better as a sort of justification for their mistake or sin. Words are just that, words. It\u2019s actions that mean something in the end. And my actions almost got you hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you aren\u2019t sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course I\u2019m sorry. But I don\u2019t want to hear you saying you accept my apology like you are all right with my mistake. This accident shouldn\u2019t be so easily forgiven or forgotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked at me again before burying her face in my chest and squeezing me around the waist tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aren\u2019t like everyone else. I do forgive you though. Just don\u2019t leave me again ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish. I won\u2019t leave your side again. Do you want to continue on with the tour? We will probably be going to see the animals next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNu-uh. I\u2019ve had enough for today and I\u2019m hungry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnderstood. Then lets go find something to eat ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she nodded her head I turned to Mavrick who gave me a wink and a nod of the head. He accepted my farewell, giving one of his own before heading off to where the stagehands working on the backdrops were. It took a moment to extract her from my waist but when I did she clutched my hand and wouldn\u2019t let go. As we walked through the backstage areas heading for the public stage I grinned down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally is a shame you didn\u2019t get to see the animals. They have a cat that can play the piano you know. And she is a super cat, able to do kung-fu moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true. And they have a giant black bear that will shake your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps you are right. Perhaps I\u2019m just pulling your leg.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked on in silence for a few minutes until we finally got back into the main area of the amusement park before I grinned even wider while staring off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what if I\u2019m not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSmall actions lead to big consequences. But every situation has both good and bad aspects to it. What one would consider the good and the bad of it though is debatable. Because each person sees things differently. Hence why there are thousands of scenarios for each action and reaction. Why people recognize some choices but not others. Perhaps even why they don\u2019t realize they have a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis day was a series of choices. Did you look at it and say well why didn\u2019t he say this? Or why didn\u2019t he do that when he had the chance? Do you wonder why Riktal only felt he had a choice over certain matters in his day? Those choices that you decided? Or perhaps you wonder why the other people in this world did what they did when they did it. It all comes back to that thing called perception. Of each individuals ability to weigh the good and the bad of a situation and form thoughts based on those perceptions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo then, I must wonder, how did you decide the choices you did? Was it on your perceptions of the situation? Or perhaps Riktal\u2019s perceptions. Did you feel when your perception and his conflicted? If so did that make you second guess yourself, or hesitate in your choice? It seems in observing you I have found more questions I seek answers to. Feel free to come again and answer them for me as you return to this day to live it over. Making new decisions unclouded by your previous experience. Or perhaps they will be clouded, altering your perception of events with your future knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat is an interesting question to be answered indeed.</span></div></div>",

The woman swung to the end of  the swing\u2019s arc while the boy was still slightly too high over her head. She made a wild grab for him as she swung backwards but as I had predicted her hands missed his outreaching ones by inches. He tried to maneuver his body to hit the net properly on his back but he was in a bad position to begin with. As he spun he overcompensated, ending up slamming into the net on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis hand got caught in one of the small holes as his body bounced back up in the air and he continued his flip. The wrist resisted for a moment before finally snapping. He let out a cry of pain as people hurried onto the net to disentangle him and get him to the on-site healer. Mavrick let out a small sigh and shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat will keep him from practicing for at least a month. And I had been hoping to add him into the show soon. It\u2019s a shame but what can you do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had seen the movement out of the corner of my eye and was already grabbing Asala\u2019s arm to yank her out of the way. One of the sandbags tied to the end of a rope swung harmlessly past seconds after I had done so. Scanning the direction the bag had come from I looked for any more trouble. Assuming the accident hadn\u2019t been deliberate would be a mistake. But I saw no one trying to hide or sneak away so figured it was my paranoia talking. Maverick yelled at the stage hands to be more careful, getting quick apologies from all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry about that Riktal. We\u2019ve been trying to implement backdrops and a few other props into our performances lately. My daughter says it\u2019s all the rage overseas and convinced me to give it a shot. The staff isn\u2019t quite used to the weighted pulley system yet, so we get these mess ups from time to time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know there are easier ways to do that kind of thing right? With modern technology you don\u2019t have to go so old school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. But that kind of thing costs money. Money we really don\u2019t have quite yet. Besides, don\u2019t you think there is something to be said for such old school things? That relies more on the skill of the people than just the push of a button?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t answer him as I looked down at Asala who was clutching me around the waist. I could feel her heart beating rapidly as I stroked her hair to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. Thanks for saving me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. So are you ready to continue with the tour or do you want to call it a day for now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head back and forth quickly while replying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! I want to see more! I\u2019m ok honest!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled her hair as Mavrick moved on to the animal handlers area. Asala watched as two men and a woman worked with the animals in their own separate areas. There was your standard lion taming, another one was working with a bear wearing a silly hat and letting the tamer touch it. Even shaking hands like it was a human. The woman was putting a seal through the motions of playing \u201cTwinkle Twinkle\u201d on a xylophone. I thought Asala\u2019s head would come right off the way she was twisting it trying to see everything at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is only a small number of the animals we use in our shows of course. We have to keep it a bit fresh each time so we use different animal acts in a rotation. Why don\u2019t you try giving that whistle I gave you earlier a try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl looked up at Mavrick before pulling it out of her pocket and blowing into it. The whistle emitted no sound, but instantly a large black cat with a white star shaped patch on it\u2019s forehead jumped down off a pile of boxes and came over to sit at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMeet Felicia. She is one of our oldest members. Though don\u2019t tell her that, she can be a bit\u2026 catty sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease spare the girl your corny jokes Mavrick. They make even the clowns weep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou just don\u2019t have a funny bone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf that\u2019s the kind of jokes I\u2019d laugh at if I did then I don\u2019t need one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman who had been working with the seal came over grinning from ear to ear. I took her extended hand, being pulled into a bear hug before she planted a kiss on my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling! It has been way too long! I\u2019ve missed you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWith a welcome like that you don\u2019t wonder why I try to avoid you Minerva?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPosh! That\u2019s just a friendly greeting you know that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why don\u2019t you ever greet me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause your wife would be angry at me if I did Maverick. Besides, I don\u2019t like you that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought you said it was only a friendly greeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva looked at me with a raised eyebrow at my comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never said only.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI chuckled along with Maverick and Minerva while Asala looked on with wide eyes, wondering what the joke was. I knew Minerva had a bit of a crush on me, but I didn\u2019t have any feelings for her. It had nothing to do with the fact that she was eight years older than me either. She knew how I felt and she was fine with the relationship we had now. This was just the way she was. Minerva looked down at the girl and suddenly did a double take before looking up at me. I nodded my head slightly in response to her unspoken question, it wasn\u2019t often I got to surprise her. Minirve gave me a raised eyebrow before talking to Asala directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFelicia here is our resident ninja. Watch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that Minerva kicked at the cat who did a backflip away with the ease of long practice. Minerva brought her foot around again in a side swipe and the cat flipped forward, balancing on the leg even as it swung through the air. As it started to come down the cat flipped forward again and jumped off, landing on Minerva\u2019s head sitting proudly. Asala began clapping her hands in glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe can also play the keyboard, but we don\u2019t have it set up right now to show you. Think you can hold still for a little bit and not move?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva whistled a small little tune and Felicia jumped off her head as Minerva raised her left arm in front of her. The cat did a handstand on the arm before twisting on her paws and pushing off to land on Asala\u2019s hair. Asala flinched a little reflexively but the cat compensated for the movement. After a moment it stepped down onto the shoulder and draped itself there contentedly. A slight hesitation before Asala reached up to pet it, soon having the cat purring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe likes you. You\u2019ve got a gift with animals it seems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t let Minerva fool you. Felicia likes everybody.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why does she always scratch you when you try to pick her up Maverick?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I like dogs more than cats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us continued to chat for a bit as Asala held the cat in her arms, cradling it on top of her teddy bear. Asala asked a few questions about the animals and Minerva answered them as best she could. Before we knew it, a stagehand was yelling that the next show would be starting within the hour. Mavrick gave a small start and left with a quick word of apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, want to stick around and see the real show now that you\u2019ve gotten to see behind the scenes a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia jumped out of Asala\u2019s hands before the girl could set her down and we turned to go back to the front. Asala stopped suddenly, pulling the whistle out of her pocket again and holding it out to Minerva. Minerva smiled while shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou keep it. A memento of your time here. Besides the boss gave it to you as a present so it\u2019s your\u2019s now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith another sparkling smile that showed almost all her teeth she said thank you and pocketed the small wooden whistle. When I offered her my hand she took it with a small squeeze before looking up at me with those large crimson eyes of hers, directing that smile only at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the best! You aren\u2019t like everyone else who just wanted to poke and prod me and stick wires all over. You\u2019re nice and your hands are warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m glad I got your approval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached around and gave me another hug before humming to herself while we continued on, eventually finding ourselves some seats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe day ends and another story closes. But this is but one of many possible stories. Just one of many possible outcomes. This is the truth, and yet it is not. This day, while real, has not and may not happen. Because time here has no meaning. Does that mean your decisions were meaningless? That the course you chose was pointless? Those questions are entirely up to you to decide. Only you humans have the capacity to attach meaning where there is none or infer a different meaning than was intended. Come again and play with young Riktal\u2019s fate. See what else this day may have, will have, and has had, in store for him.</span></div></div>",

If you two would follow me please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter he said this he jumped high in the air while doing a back flip, spinning upside down to land a few inches away with his back to us. He looked over his shoulder with a half grin and a raised eyebrow as I simply shook my head and followed. Asala was walking on her own now, actively holding my hand instead of me dragging her by the arm. I didn\u2019t push my pace so she could keep up with me easily while she looked around surreptitiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems an old dog learned a new trick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell the boss should know a thing or two about every aspect of his show don\u2019t you think?

Just enjoy being a kid right now ok? Leave all the bad stuff for later. I\u2019m not saying it will go away, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy this brief moment. You understand what I am saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stared at me with those big crimson eyes before finally nodding her head and giving my hand a squeeze. Mavrick looked over his shoulder at us a moment before catching my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHunter business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll spread the word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA few moments later we came to the area where three handlers were working with some of the animals. One was in a large cage with a tiger who was standing on it\u2019s hind legs and doing a simple ballroom dance with the guy. The second guy was working with a group of dogs who were doing a line dance of some description. The third was a woman who was working with ten birds sitting on perches who were singing in tune what sounded like an opera song. Even as we watched one of the birds began beat boxing, making a sort of booming click sound with it\u2019s beak. The bird next to it began wagging its tongue out of it\u2019s mouth making a weird counterpoint that seemed to fit, the two sounds merging together to make one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman turned and flicked the beak of the offending bird, making it stop. Staring into it\u2019s eyes she began to make the single note over and over until the bird mimicked her. With a nod she scratched under it\u2019s chin, making it croon in pleasure before kissing it\u2019s beak. She turned when she heard us approach, her eyes lighting up as she ran over to meet us. The full head of blue hair bouncing up and down as if it had a life of it\u2019s own. When she extended her hand I shook it, being pulled into a bear hug moments before she kissed me on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! It\u2019s been forever! I was getting lonely!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Mavrick doesn\u2019t keep you busy enough?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPosh! Training beasties aint work! It\u2019s what I love to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure I could find some real work for you to do then Minerva.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou do that and I\u2019ll tell your wife about your desire to do a bit of animal training yourself. She\u2019s fine with you breaking your bones learning the acrobatics and the magic tricks, but I doubt she wants to see you coming home with bite marks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, fine. Though you\u2019re enough of an animal as it is, I don\u2019t need to learn how to tame any others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us began to chuckle as Asala stared up at us with those wide eyes of hers. Minerva looked down at the child, her greenish yellow eyes meeting the girls crimson ones. There was a spark of recognition as she did a double take and looked back up at me, her eyes going almost as big as the girls. I gave her a small nod of confirmation, getting a half grin and a wink in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala. Remember that whistle Mavrick gave you? Why don\u2019t you try blowing it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl pulled the little wooden whistle from her pocket and blew. Even though it didn\u2019t make an audible sound a large black cat laying on top of a pile of boxes jumped to the floor, sauntering over before sitting at the girls feet looking up expectantly. Maverick held out his hand to the cat theatrically while giving Asala a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Felicia. She\u2019s retired now, but it\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say she helped build this animal show into what it is today. Back in the day she was one of our only animal acts and she has earned her spot in all of our hearts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva gave a quick whistle as she held her hand palm up towards the cat while spreading her legs. The can leapt onto the palm before doing a few front flips up the length of the arm to curl around the woman\u2019s shoulders. The cat watched Asala with a knowing intelligence as her tail swished back and forth over Minerva\u2019s chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you can see, she still got a few tricks in her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala\u2019s eyes sparkled as she tentatively reached out to pet the cat. Her fingers hesitated a moment before Minerva nodded that it was all right, but soon she was petting it under the chin and behind the ears. The cat disentangled herself from Minerva and jumped down onto Asala\u2019s head, balancing there as the girl jerked reflexively before stepping down to her shoulders and then into her arms where she nestled contentedly. The girl got a stupid grin on her face as she pet the cat, listening to the purring sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you glad we came Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up at me and nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was a bit surprised to hear her voice. It was soft and a bit musical with that slight high pitch of youth. But it was another step in the right direction. The three of us talked a few more moments until there was a roaring sound from behind us. We all turned to look, seeing a fourth handler bringing a lion into the cage with the tiger. Minerva yelled at the new trainer even as the lion and tiger lunged at each other. Asala gave a whimper as a red summoning circle appeared on the far wall and a eight foot tall troll clambered out welding it\u2019s signature spiked club. It was one of the red variety so at least a high B class, perhaps even an A class monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt looked around a moment at all the confusion as the birds flew off to the safety of their roosts and the trainer whistled quickly to send the dogs away as well. The two trainers in the cage called out halt, power lacing their voices, making the two fighting beasts stop attacking and come to heel. The troll smashed it\u2019s club into the cage as the two trainers escaped back through the door, leading their animals like trained house pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was off and running at the troll, slipping my duffle bag off my back in one smooth motion and pulling out a small anvil hammer, the sharp blade on the back of the flat head glistening under the light. Letting a bit of my power flow into the weapon it enlarged in my hand until its head became as big as my own and the handle almost as long as my arm. With red trolls blunt was the way to go. Piercing worked well but not slicing. Guns were effective but I wanted both attack and defense. I threw the hammer at the creature, lacing it with an aura of magic and tethering it to my arm with a string. The weighted lump of iron smashed into the face right before I yanked back on my arm, bringing the hammer back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYo! Big red and stupid! Over here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a roar the monster turned to me and charged.</span></div></div>",

With a yell I brought the hammer around with all my might, smashing into the trolls kneecap and buckling the leg for a moment. It let out a roar just as a blue circle appeared on the floor next to me. A big meaty blue fist shot out of the hole and grabbed the club as it swung around to swipe at my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA six foot tall mountain troll jumped out of the hole and gave the red one an uppercut with it\u2019s own club even as I spun around to smash my hammer into the back of the trolls other knee. A second circle appeared in the wall as Felicia ran towards me. From out of the second summoning circle a small Picu bird appeared. They were constructs of magic and not alive in the sense of other animals, but they did have a special purpose. Felicia leapt into the air chomping down on the bird and swallowing it whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom powers born to power return! Construct to construct! Fusion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva\u2019s voice rang out as the cat gave a howl, growing four feet taller and standing on two feet. This was the purpose of the Picu bird. To enhance and temporarily transform other creatures, be they animal, human or monster, imbuing them with the magic that kept them alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to smash my hammer into the troll, slowly breaking the bones through the tough skin while the blue one kept its hands busy. Even though the blue one was smaller, of a lower class and less powerful, those weaknesses were offset by both me and Felicia attacking as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFelicia! Cyclone claws! Troll! Body blow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva\u2019s voice belted out the commands quickly, even as I slammed the kneecaps one more time to make the troll buckle backwards. The blue troll turned his shoulder into the red one and shoved while I jumped into the air. Felicia spun in a circle quickly as her claws each grew a foot long. Soon she was nothing but a black spinning ball of death, with claws poking out everywhere. She slammed into the troll as it was falling, tearing huge gaping wounds in it\u2019s flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two activate. Judgment spike.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe blade on the end grew into two, while a large spike appeared on the end of the handle. As I fell I planted my foot on the top of the hammer, getting it in place moments before the spike landed in the large gash Felicia had put on the trolls forehead. The spike went through the skull like butter, impaling it into the floor. The monster didn\u2019t even have time to let out a death roar before exploding into the small white motes all monsters dissolved into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReturning the hammer to it\u2019s original size and shape I headed back to Minerva and the group. Minerva gave the troll a bow and a thank you before opening another blue circle for it to walk docilely through. Once it was gone she looked at Felicia who looked more like a human crouching on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom construct to construct and power to power. I bid you release.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a small wind as the excess power still in the cat\u2019s body swirled around. But after only a second she shrunk back to the plain old black cat with a white marking on it\u2019s head. Asala was staring at Minerva in surprise as I grinned and knelt in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShocked? Well I guess you would be. Yes she is a summoner like you. But unlike you she\u2019s not as powerful. You want to know a secret? Everyone here knows about her power and accepts her. She protects this circus when it\u2019s in trouble, and she\u2019s able to bring her skills at taming monsters into her ability to tame and train animals. Those two tamers with the lion and the tiger? They both have a unique gift too. They can connect with the emotions of animals. Not everyone here has special abilities, but there are a few. They were all able to find a place where they felt like they belonged and people wouldn\u2019t hate them blindly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill\u2026 will I be able to do stuff like that too one day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you will be able to do that and more. Right now you can\u2019t control your power and things just pop out whenever you don\u2019t want them to. But someday it will be you who controls when and where they pop out. And what monster comes as well. The question will then become, what will you do with that power once you have it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva knelt down next to the girl as Felicia jumped up on Minerva\u2019s shoulder. The woman absently scratched the cat under the chin as she stared into Asala\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFelicia here was the first animal I ever trained. Years before I joined the circus. She\u2019s old. Older than any cat has a right to be. Back when I first started learning about being a summoner, she was my only friend. I learned how to use my unique skill to summon Picu birds to fuse with her like you saw. Because of that she\u2019s grown as intelligent as many humans and been granted a much longer lifespan. But she is still a regular animal for all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour road ahead is going to be hard. People are going to hate you and try to kill you simply because you can summon monsters. You will have few friends and you will sometimes live in fear that someone will find out. But you will also know a joy that no one else will be able to understand. Being able to summon the most ferocious of monsters and have it acting like a puppy to your touch. Or being able to command a monster you haven\u2019t summoned with but a few words. You will see things and do things no one else will. It is a magic all it\u2019s own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva stared silently at the girl for a moment before nodding her head and reaching up to pull her gold necklace off. The blue gem in the middle seemed to give off a sparkle of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI come from far to the west, across another great sea. A place where those with unique abilities are a bit more common but still no less tolerated. But there is a custom among my people. When one is about to embark upon a great journey they are gifted with a good luck charm. One imbued with the thoughts of those who came before them. This necklace was given to me by my teacher when I finished my training and decided to come across the seas. In the summoner world gold represents pliability and promise. It is flexible and soft, yet when tempered with other materials it can exhibit a hardness it cannot obtain otherwise. Just as your will needs to be in order to control your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBlue is a symbol of life and love to a summoner. Because when you are a summoner it is not just your life you take into your hands, but the lives of thousands. Both human and monster. Just because you can control them does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect them. I\u2019ve worn that necklace everyday for the last ten years. I came into my power when I was about your age and left to make it on my own when I was only sixteen. Now I think it\u2019s time it moves on with you as you set off on your own journey as a summoner. Knowing it is filled with my hopes that you become an amazing summoner that you can be proud of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva slipped the necklace over Asala\u2019s head before giving her a grin from ear to ear and wrapping her arm around my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you got Riktal here to look out for you for now so you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. He\u2019s one of the good ones and I\u2019m sure if you were ever in any great need he would come running no matter where you were. Even if he had to swim across the ocean to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala nodded her head gravely at the woman\u2019s words, taking everything she said to heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. I can tell. I don\u2019t know how exactly but he\u2019s not like everyone else. His hands are warm and his smile isn\u2019t fake. I decided I\u2019m going to marry him when I am done training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinirva began to bust out laughing along with Mavrick who had been standing in the background. I simply  rubbed my eyes under my glasses and shook my head. Where had that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you\u2019ll have to fight me for him because I saw him first! I\u2019ve been trying to get into his pants for the last two years but he is more slippery than an oiled eel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s because your old! My momma said men like them younger. That\u2019s what she talked about with aunt Jesamine when she thought I wasn\u2019t listening anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat cracked all of us up, even Minerva who gave a small pouting face before letting the laughter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re too much for me Asala. I\u2019d never be able to keep up with you if I were your husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t let you get out of it. I\u2019ve decided and momma used to say you need to stick with something if you really believe it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat set us all off in another bout of laughter as I told her we would just have to see what happened in four or five years. I offered her my hand as we got up off the floor and I spoke with the two for a bit longer. I let Maverick know I would pay for repairs, even when he said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I knew he was just being polite in refusing and really would appreciate my payment. Asala kept glancing up at Minerva in awe and a little bit of hero worship. Minerva saw the looks and smiled at the child whenever she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do you want to continue on with the tour or call it quits? I doubt anything else will happen, but if you want to be a bit cautious it\u2019s up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I looked down at Asala to see what she thought she gave me big saucer eyes, pleading with me not to stop now. Her lower lip  was pouting a little bit, giving her a real puppy dog look. If her powers acted up again Minerva wouldn\u2019t be around to help and people might actually get hurt. Perhaps it would be best to call it a day.</span></div></div>",

If there are any more damages I\u2019ll pay for them also. As long as you can keep all this under wraps for me that is Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a problem. The old heads won\u2019t even need to be told, just got to worry about the new guys. After all, you\u2019re practically family here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala jumped up and down a bit in joy as the three of us talked a little while more. Asala asked questions about animal handling and Minerva answered as best she could. Soon enough we were on our way again to see the acrobats. Asala was soon enthralled by the way a man and a woman were doing back flips on a tightrope while a boy was skipping rope on another one. Many of the acrobats waved to me or called out good natured jokes at my expense. When two of the trampoline artists asked if Asala wanted to try it out, I agreed before she had a chance to respond. I could see her eagerness and desire without her having to look at me. Clutching her bear even tighter she ran off a short distance to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are probably one of the best people she could have around her right now. Her mind is all messed up, you know that right? I\u2019ve only gotten a few fragments here and there, nothing more than surface flashes but she\u2019s not as stable as she seems. My ability is pretty weak and not always that reliable but her thoughts are strong enough to come in loud and clear when they do so that should say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured it was pretty messed up. I don\u2019t claim to understand it all, but I really don\u2019t need to understand completely to help her. Grief is grief no matter how it comes about. I\u2019ve been able to put it on the backburner for now, but it will all have to come out eventually. Hopeful I can get her to see that she can continue on with life before that time comes. Otherwise I have a feeling she will want to end her own life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour feelings aren\u2019t unfounded. During that monster attack I saw it. Her desire to die because of her power. She\u2019s just on this side of the line I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut she reminds me a lot of Olia as well. Take good care of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d planned on it. You think you could see your way to giving Minirva the next few days off? I\u2019d like her to spend it with me and the girl. Perhaps stabilize her a bit. It would be a big help having another monster summoner around her, someone who knows what she\u2019s going to have to look forward to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was your aim from the beginning wasn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why you brought her here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that wasn\u2019t one of the reasons. But I also thought she\u2019d enjoy herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell she has tomorrow off but I can work around opening up a day or two more. It\u2019s Hunter business after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank Jonrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! I haven\u2019t been called that for years! Surprised you even knew my real name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease, I got a bit suspicious around the time we first met so did a background check on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYet you still befriended an escaped convict like me huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I befriended Mavrick, a slightly disreputable circus owner who has dedicated his life to making people happy. Besides, I had your case looked into. Like you claimed at your trial, you were wrongly accused. It was all a set up with you as the scapegoat. Your problem was your enemy had more money and connections than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen how did you find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I slapped him on the back, watching as the two girls on the trampoline held onto Asala while making her do flips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a Zelkov. There\u2019s not many who have more access to connections and money then me. Don\u2019t worry, your secrets are safe with me. Unless of course you want to go back to your old life. I can make that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfter almost twenty years? No thanks. I left it all behind me long ago. I\u2019ve got it good here and I\u2019m content.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me a sideways grin as Asala came running up panting but full of excitement. Jumping up and down asking if I had been watching over and over. I told her I had been and was impressed how quickly she had picked up on it. She seemed to shine even brighter as her eyes sparkled with dreams of being an acrobat. I could almost see them reflected in her crimson orbs. Wrapping my arm around her, the three of us turned and headed on, coming to where the clowns and magicians were practicing in between eating some ham sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavrick introduced Asala to the crowd and after a few minutes of bantering, the group had made her one of their own just like everyone else had. They shoved sandwiches and juice on her, saying she was a growing girl and needed to eat. While she wolfed the offerings down the clowns put on an impromptu slapstick show that had her laughing along with everyone else. Even though they had probably seen some of the routines done a hundred times they were still the type that could get a chuckle if executed with the proper timing. The magicians did their sleight of hand, confounding her with their magic that used no magic. They even showed her how to do some of the simplest tricks involving a Senz coin or foam balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe spent another good hour or so in this fashion, until a stage hand came yelling that the next show started within the hour. Mavrick gave a start and begged leave of us as he went off to prepare. After that our little party broke up as Asala came over to wrap her arms around my neck, squeezing tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for today! It was awesome and I had lots of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re welcome sweetie. But you know, I don\u2019t think the days over. Now that you\u2019ve got a inside peek at what they do here, you want to stick around for the real show? You can see it all put together with all the flashy lights and death defying action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh wait never mind. We can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwww! Why not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause we are sitting back here at the moment. We need to go back out front and find us some good seats before they are all taken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScooping her up I shifted her to my right side while carrying her back the way we had come. She giggled as she wrapped her arms even more tightly around my neck and gave me a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThink we can get a seat for Mr. Cuddles too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Cuddles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy bear silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you never introduced us so how was I supposed to know! For all I knew, that could have been the name of your invisible friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as invisible friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know? Have you ever seen one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! That\u2019s how I know they don\u2019t exist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled a bit at my words as I raised my eyebrow at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? That just tells me no one has proven they exist or not. So until I get proof that they don\u2019t exist, that must mean that they do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to laugh and squirm in my arms as I reached around and began tickling her sides until she finally slid down to the floor and skipped out of my reach. We only stopped outside long enough to grab some popcorn and cotton candy before heading back into the giant tent to find ourselves a seat. Once we were settled in she leaned her head against my side contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, is it ok if I call you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk. I love you big brother. Don\u2019t ever leave my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t. At least not until your new master gets here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay here and train with that animal trainer lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMinerva? No. She\u2019s not as strong as you so if you summoned something really powerful she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it alone. And training you would be a full time job. She doesn\u2019t have the kind of money to live off of while she did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen can you come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t do that either. But I\u2019ll give you my communication id and we can call each other whenever we want. And I can come visit you when I have time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that. Just promise you won\u2019t die like momma and papa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying for a very long time. Besides, I can\u2019t die if you plan on marrying me right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though her voice sounded cheerful I felt her hand clench on my tunic as she buried her face in it. Soon enough I felt the fabric moisten as I gently wrapped my arm around her, stroking her hair softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven in the worst conditions you humans find a ray of light. You are flexible and resilient even in the face of the unexpected. Your lives are full of ups and downs, regrets and choices. Perhaps it is because you have choices that you have regrets. But it is also those choices that make you so resilient and flexible. They exist in a harmony of balance I find most interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDid you make choices you regret today? Did you wonder what else might have happened if you had done something even slightly different? Were there things about this day you would wish to change? Are you satisfied with the outcome? This window is closed for now, but come again and it shall open once more. Letting you relive this day and see where else your decisions might take you. What other things you might regret or second guess. Please continue to help me obtain the information I seek by riding this rollercoaster called life.</span></div></div>",

But the fact still remains that this might happen again. Mavrick can keep this under wraps and no one here will say anything. But what will happen if you summon another monster and people get hurt? Or it destroys one of these areas? What if people out in the park get hurt? I\u2019ve got a duty to not only protect you but also everyone else as well. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pouted  little more but finally nodded her head in agreement. Minerva squatted in front of Asala, flicking her forehead lightly with two fingers. When Asala put her hands up to the spot the woman let out a deep chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t get all sulky girl. The look doesn\u2019t suit you. Besides I\u2019m the only one allowed to pout like that. You listen to Riktal all right? He knows what he\u2019s doing and if he thinks it\u2019s unwise to stay then I\u2019d trust him. Even if nothing happens and everything would be fine it\u2019s better safe than sorry. Besides, I bet if you asked him he would be more than willing to bring you again. Maybe tomorrow even since I have the day off. If he does I could teach you a few small tricks that will make it easier to control your power. You decided you were going to marry him right? Well I doubt he would be much interested in a waif of a girl who didn\u2019t know how to smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala\u2019s lips began to twitch before finally breaking out into a grin the equal of Minerva\u2019s. I shared a silent exchange of thanks with my eyes over Asala\u2019s head, getting a slight wink in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think that won\u2019t be a problem at all. She will be with me for the next few days and I don\u2019t have anything better to do. So we can spend it here if you want Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked down at her feet for a moment, shuffling them on the floor before looking back up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay here and learn from her instead of having to go away? I don\u2019t want to leave again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva shook her head slowly and answered before I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry girl. This might sound mean but I can\u2019t teach you. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the skill. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the power to hold yours in check if something really goes wrong. Plus I\u2019ve got a simple life here I am happy with. I don\u2019t have the kind of connections or money for bribes I would need to be your teacher. Teaching you would be a full time job and I\u2019m not willing to quit the circus for you. This is just one of the many hardships you are going to have to face on your journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer face fell for a moment as she nodded her head in understanding. But her sadness didn\u2019t last long as she wiped her eyes and left Minerva with a smile. I wrapped my arm around her, hugging her to my side as we left the circus area and entered the amusement park proper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can cry if you want to. It\u2019s the bodies way of helping you cope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head shook back and forth slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m sad but I could tell she was telling the truth. I need to become strong like her and like you. So I can\u2019t cry all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was silent the rest of the way home, content to simply hold my hand and stay close to me. It took only a moment to unlock the door and pull the bags inside. From there I lead her to the kitchen where I prepared some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you cut them in half diagonally? My mom used to make them like that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI set the plate in front of her after running a knife through the bread quickly. She picked up one of the halves and stared at it a moment without actually eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, Riktal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m still allowed to cry for my mom and dad right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she took a bite of the sandwich her tears began to flow. She didn\u2019t make a sound, just ate and cried. Setting the knife down I went over and wrapped my arms around her from behind, resting my cheek on the top of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet it all out. I\u2019m here. It will still hurt afterwards but you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply held her like that as she finished the sandwich and really let the waterworks come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven in the worst conditions you humans find a ray of light. You are flexible and resilient even in the face of the unexpected. Your lives are full of ups and downs, regrets and choices. Perhaps it is because you have choices that you have regrets. But it is also those choices that make you so resilient and flexible. They exist in a harmony of balance I find most interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDid you make choices you regret today? Did you wonder what else might have happened if you had done something even slightly different? Were there things about this day you would wish to change? Are you satisfied with the outcome?

By the time I brought the flat head of the hammer around a blue summoning circle was appearing along the wall and a small army of goblins came running out wielding small hammers of their own. My weapon smashed into the troll\u2019s jaw as the twenty little goblins whacked at the knees and legs. Another portal opened, letting a Picu bird fly out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLaunching off the arm as it tried to throw me I spun in front of it\u2019s face, bringing the hammer in my left hand around even as Felicia jumped onto the club as well and ran towards the troll\u2019s head. The spiked end of my weapon slammed into the right ear as Felicia leapt high into the air to eat the little Picu bird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom powers born to powers return! Construct to construct! Fusion!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFelicia gave a small howl as the magical energy that made up the little bird infused itself in the cat\u2019s body. The cat began to stretch, it\u2019s paws becoming more hand like as it grew to be four feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFelicia! Claw Cyclone! Goblins! Suicide Blitz!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDislodging the spike from the Troll\u2019s ear I leapt away, grabbing the handle in both hands. The goblins ran headlong at the monsters legs, smashing them even harder than before, not even trying to avoid it\u2019s kicking feet this  time. Their relentless assault made the knees buckle and the troll sink to the floor. Felicia\u2019s claws meanwhile had each grown a foot long as she spin faster and faster in the air, creating her own personal cyclone as she fell. Gravity and her own ability landed her on the trolls face, ripping deep gouges in it\u2019s flesh. The creature gave a roar as a claw took out it\u2019s eye and another one caught in its lip, ripping its cheek wide open. As the cat continued down the front of the body opening deep wounds, I dashed in again, blocking the club with my hammer before it could hit the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two activate: Judgment spike!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA second spike began to grow along the backside of the hammer head, giving it a slightly demonic look of horns even as a bit of metal flowed down the length of the handle to create a third needle-sharp spike. Even as I danced backwards from the other arm that came around to try and grab me I threw the hammer like a Frisbee, sending it end over end right into the wide gaping hole in its cheek. The head jerked to the side as the weapon hit the inside of the other cheek before the hammer tore out through the flesh causing it to fall to the floor. The goblins were all over the troll in seconds. Beating on every inch of the monster with their hammers, focusing on the skull until it caved in and the monster disappeared in motes of white light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I had retrieved my weapon, reverted it to it\u2019s travel form, and returned to the group, Minerva was already opening another blue portal to return the goblins to their original place. The goblins, who were now down to about a third of the numbers they had been originally, gave the woman a small bow and left quietly. Once they were gone Minerva broke the spell on Felicia, returning her to a regular cat again. Asala stared at Minerva and Felicia in shock, her eyes so large I thought the orbs would just roll right out of the sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShocked? Well I guess you would be. Yes she is a summoner like you. But unlike you she\u2019s not as powerful. You want to know a secret? Everyone here knows about her power and accepts her. She protects this circus when it\u2019s in trouble, and she\u2019s able to bring her skills at taming monsters into her ability to tame and train animals. Those two tamers with the lion and the tiger? They both have a unique gift too. They can connect with the emotions of animals. Not everyone here has special abilities, but there are a few. They were all able to find a place where they felt like they belonged and people wouldn\u2019t hate them blindly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill\u2026 will I be able to do stuff like that too one day?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you will be able to do that and more. Right now you can\u2019t control your power and things just pop out whenever you don\u2019t want them to. But someday it will be you who controls when and where they pop out. And what monster comes as well. The question will then become, what will you do with that power once you have it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva knelt down next to the girl as Felicia jumped up on Minerva\u2019s shoulder. The woman absently scratched the cat under the chin as she stared into Asala\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFelicia here was the first animal I ever trained. Years before I joined the circus. She\u2019s old. Older than any cat has a right to be. Back when I first started learning about being a summoner, she was my only friend. I learned how to use my unique skill to summon Picu birds to fuse with her like you saw. Because of that she\u2019s grown as intelligent as many humans and been granted a much longer lifespan. But she is still a regular animal for all of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour road ahead is going to be hard. People are going to hate you and try to kill you simply because you can summon monsters. You will have few friends and you will sometimes live in fear that someone will find out. But you will also know a joy that no one else will be able to understand. Being able to summon the most ferocious of monsters and have it acting like a puppy to your touch. Or being able to command a monster you haven\u2019t summoned with but a few words. You will see things and do things no one else will. It is a magic all it\u2019s own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva stared silently at the girl for a moment before nodding her head and reaching up to pull her gold necklace off. The blue gem in the middle seemed to give off a sparkle of its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI come from far to the west, across another great sea. A place where those with unique abilities are a bit more common but still no less tolerated. But there is a custom among my people. When one is about to embark upon a great journey they are gifted with a good luck charm. One imbued with the thoughts of those who came before them. This necklace was given to me by my teacher when I finished my training and decided to come across the seas. In the summoner world gold represents pliability and promise. It is flexible and soft, yet when tempered with other materials it can exhibit a hardness it cannot obtain otherwise. Just as your will needs to be in order to control your powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBlue is a symbol of life and love to a summoner. Because when you are a summoner it is not just your life you take into your hands, but the lives of thousands. Both human and monster. Just because you can control them does not mean you shouldn\u2019t respect them. I\u2019ve worn that necklace everyday for the last ten years. I came into my power when I was about your age and left to make it on my own when I was only sixteen. Now I think it\u2019s time it moves on with you as you set off on your own journey as a summoner. Knowing it is filled with my hopes that you become an amazing summoner that you can be proud of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva slipped the necklace over Asala\u2019s head before giving her a grin from ear to ear and wrapping her arm around my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you got Riktal here to look out for you for now so you don\u2019t have anything to worry about. He\u2019s one of the good ones and I\u2019m sure if you were ever in any great need he would come running no matter where you were. Even if he had to swim across the ocean to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala nodded her head gravely at the woman\u2019s words, taking everything she said to heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. I can tell. I don\u2019t know how exactly but he\u2019s not like everyone else. His hands are warm and his smile isn\u2019t fake. I decided I\u2019m going to marry him when I am done training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinirva began to bust out laughing along with Mavrick who had been standing in the background. I simply  rubbed my eyes under my glasses and shook my head. Where had that come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you\u2019ll have to fight me for him because I saw him first! I\u2019ve been trying to get into his pants for the last two years but he is more slippery than an oiled eel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s because your old! My momma said men like them younger. That\u2019s what she talked about with aunt Jesamine when she thought I wasn\u2019t listening anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat cracked all of us up, even Minerva who gave a small pouting face before letting the laughter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re too much for me Asala. I\u2019d never be able to keep up with you if I were your husband.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t let you get out of it. I\u2019ve decided and momma used to say you need to stick with something if you really believe it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat set us all off in another bout of laughter as I told her we would just have to see what happened in four or five years. I offered her my hand as we got up off the floor and I spoke with the two for a bit longer. I let Maverick know I would pay for repairs, even when he said it wasn\u2019t necessary. I knew he was just being polite in refusing and really would appreciate my payment. Asala kept glancing up at Minerva in awe and a little bit of hero worship. Minerva saw the looks and smiled at the child whenever she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do you want to continue on with the tour or call it quits? I doubt anything else will happen, but if you want to be a bit cautious it\u2019s up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I looked down at Asala to see what she thought she gave me big saucer eyes, pleading with me not to stop now. Her lower lip  was pouting a little bit, giving her a real puppy dog look. If her powers acted up again Minerva wouldn\u2019t be around to help and people might actually get hurt. Perhaps it would be best to call it a day.</span></div></div>",

But the fact still remains that this might happen again. Mavrick can keep this under wraps and no one here will say anything. But what will happen if you summon another monster and people get hurt? Or it destroys one of these areas? What if people out in the park get hurt? I\u2019ve got a duty to not only protect you but also everyone else as well. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pouted  little more but finally nodded her head in agreement. Minerva squatted in front of Asala, flicking her forehead lightly with two fingers. When Asala put her hands up to the spot the woman let out a deep chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t get all sulky girl. The look doesn\u2019t suit you. Besides I\u2019m the only one allowed to pout like that. You listen to Riktal all right? He knows what he\u2019s doing and if he thinks it\u2019s unwise to stay then I\u2019d trust him. Even if nothing happens and everything would be fine it\u2019s better safe than sorry. Besides, I bet if you asked him he would be more than willing to bring you again. Maybe tomorrow even since I have the day off. If he does I could teach you a few small tricks that will make it easier to control your power. You decided you were going to marry him right? Well I doubt he would be much interested in a waif of a girl who didn\u2019t know how to smile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala\u2019s lips began to twitch before finally breaking out into a grin the equal of Minerva\u2019s. I shared a silent exchange of thanks with my eyes over Asala\u2019s head, getting a slight wink in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think that won\u2019t be a problem at all. She will be with me for the next few days and I don\u2019t have anything better to do. So we can spend it here if you want Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked down at her feet for a moment, shuffling them on the floor before looking back up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay here and learn from her instead of having to go away? I don\u2019t want to leave again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMinerva shook her head slowly and answered before I could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry girl. This might sound mean but I can\u2019t teach you. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have the skill. It\u2019s because I don\u2019t have the power to hold yours in check if something really goes wrong. Plus I\u2019ve got a simple life here I am happy with. I don\u2019t have the kind of connections or money for bribes I would need to be your teacher. Teaching you would be a full time job and I\u2019m not willing to quit the circus for you. This is just one of the many hardships you are going to have to face on your journey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer face fell for a moment as she nodded her head in understanding. But her sadness didn\u2019t last long as she wiped her eyes and left Minerva with a smile.

If there are any more damages I\u2019ll pay for them also. As long as you can keep all this under wraps for me that is Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a problem. The old heads won\u2019t even need to be told, just got to worry about the new guys. After all, you\u2019re practically family here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala jumped up and down a bit in joy as the three of us talked a little while more. Asala asked questions about animal handling and Minerva answered as best she could. Soon enough we were on our way again to see the acrobats. Asala was soon enthralled by the way a man and a woman were doing back flips on a tightrope while a boy was skipping rope on another one. Many of the acrobats waved to me or called out good natured jokes at my expense. When two of the trampoline artists asked if Asala wanted to try it out, I agreed before she had a chance to respond. I could see her eagerness and desire without her having to look at me. Clutching her bear even tighter she ran off a short distance to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are probably one of the best people she could have around her right now. Her mind is all messed up, you know that right? I\u2019ve only gotten a few fragments here and there, nothing more than surface flashes but she\u2019s not as stable as she seems. My ability is pretty weak and not always that reliable but her thoughts are strong enough to come in loud and clear when they do so that should say something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured it was pretty messed up. I don\u2019t claim to understand it all, but I really don\u2019t need to understand completely to help her. Grief is grief no matter how it comes about. I\u2019ve been able to put it on the backburner for now, but it will all have to come out eventually. Hopeful I can get her to see that she can continue on with life before that time comes. Otherwise I have a feeling she will want to end her own life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour feelings aren\u2019t unfounded. During that monster attack I saw it. Her desire to die because of her power. She\u2019s just on this side of the line I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut she reminds me a lot of Olia as well. Take good care of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d planned on it. You think you could see your way to giving Minirva the next few days off? I\u2019d like her to spend it with me and the girl. Perhaps stabilize her a bit. It would be a big help having another monster summoner around her, someone who knows what she\u2019s going to have to look forward to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was your aim from the beginning wasn\u2019t it? That\u2019s why you brought her here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said that wasn\u2019t one of the reasons. But I also thought she\u2019d enjoy herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell she has tomorrow off but I can work around opening up a day or two more. It\u2019s Hunter business after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank Jonrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! I haven\u2019t been called that for years! Surprised you even knew my real name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease, I got a bit suspicious around the time we first met so did a background check on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYet you still befriended an escaped convict like me huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I befriended Mavrick, a slightly disreputable circus owner who has dedicated his life to making people happy. Besides, I had your case looked into. Like you claimed at your trial, you were wrongly accused. It was all a set up with you as the scapegoat. Your problem was your enemy had more money and connections than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen how did you find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I slapped him on the back, watching as the two girls on the trampoline held onto Asala while making her do flips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a Zelkov. There\u2019s not many who have more access to connections and money then me. Don\u2019t worry, your secrets are safe with me. Unless of course you want to go back to your old life. I can make that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfter almost twenty years? No thanks. I left it all behind me long ago. I\u2019ve got it good here and I\u2019m content.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish Mavrick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me a sideways grin as Asala came running up panting but full of excitement. Jumping up and down asking if I had been watching over and over. I told her I had been and was impressed how quickly she had picked up on it. She seemed to shine even brighter as her eyes sparkled with dreams of being an acrobat. I could almost see them reflected in her crimson orbs. Wrapping my arm around her, the three of us turned and headed on, coming to where the clowns and magicians were practicing in between eating some ham sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMavrick introduced Asala to the crowd and after a few minutes of bantering, the group had made her one of their own just like everyone else had. They shoved sandwiches and juice on her, saying she was a growing girl and needed to eat. While she wolfed the offerings down the clowns put on an impromptu slapstick show that had her laughing along with everyone else. Even though they had probably seen some of the routines done a hundred times they were still the type that could get a chuckle if executed with the proper timing. The magicians did their sleight of hand, confounding her with their magic that used no magic. They even showed her how to do some of the simplest tricks involving a Senz coin or foam balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe spent another good hour or so in this fashion, until a stage hand came yelling that the next show started within the hour. Mavrick gave a start and begged leave of us as he went off to prepare. After that our little party broke up as Asala came over to wrap her arms around my neck, squeezing tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for today! It was awesome and I had lots of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re welcome sweetie. But you know, I don\u2019t think the days over. Now that you\u2019ve got a inside peek at what they do here, you want to stick around for the real show? You can see it all put together with all the flashy lights and death defying action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh wait never mind. We can\u2019t do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwww! Why not!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause we are sitting back here at the moment. We need to go back out front and find us some good seats before they are all taken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tScooping her up I shifted her to my right side while carrying her back the way we had come. She giggled as she wrapped her arms even more tightly around my neck and gave me a kiss on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThink we can get a seat for Mr. Cuddles too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho\u2019s Mr. Cuddles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy bear silly!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you never introduced us so how was I supposed to know! For all I knew, that could have been the name of your invisible friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as invisible friends!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know? Have you ever seen one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo! That\u2019s how I know they don\u2019t exist!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled a bit at my words as I raised my eyebrow at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? That just tells me no one has proven they exist or not. So until I get proof that they don\u2019t exist, that must mean that they do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to laugh and squirm in my arms as I reached around and began tickling her sides until she finally slid down to the floor and skipped out of my reach. We only stopped outside long enough to grab some popcorn and cotton candy before heading back into the giant tent to find ourselves a seat. Once we were settled in she leaned her head against my side contentedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, is it ok if I call you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure, if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk. I love you big brother. Don\u2019t ever leave my side.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t. At least not until your new master gets here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t I just stay here and train with that animal trainer lady?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMinerva? No. She\u2019s not as strong as you so if you summoned something really powerful she wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it alone. And training you would be a full time job. She doesn\u2019t have the kind of money to live off of while she did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen can you come with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t do that either. But I\u2019ll give you my communication id and we can call each other whenever we want. And I can come visit you when I have time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that. Just promise you won\u2019t die like momma and papa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t plan on dying for a very long time. Besides, I can\u2019t die if you plan on marrying me right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though her voice sounded cheerful I felt her hand clench on my tunic as she buried her face in it. Soon enough I felt the fabric moisten as I gently wrapped my arm around her, stroking her hair softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven in the worst conditions you humans find a ray of light. You are flexible and resilient even in the face of the unexpected. Your lives are full of ups and downs, regrets and choices. Perhaps it is because you have choices that you have regrets. But it is also those choices that make you so resilient and flexible. They exist in a harmony of balance I find most interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDid you make choices you regret today? Did you wonder what else might have happened if you had done something even slightly different? Were there things about this day you would wish to change? Are you satisfied with the outcome? This window is closed for now, but come again and it shall open once more. Letting you relive this day and see where else your decisions might take you. What other things you might regret or second guess. Please continue to help me obtain the information I seek by riding this rollercoaster called life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI was jumping off the bleacher and vaulting over the low banister even as Gregory fired his weapon. That was as far as I got though since Jethic suddenly appeared between Gregory and the monster, blocking the bullet on his shield. I stood their standing a bit foolishly as Jethic chewed the boy out, saying the next time he would let the monster smack him around. As the tank returned to the rest of the group who were looking at Gregory shaking their heads I jumped back over the banister to sit down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGregory finally lowered his weapon, going to stand next to the rest as Liz began to chuckle at my actions a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re a better person than me. I would have let the Glif get at least one good hit in before going out to the rescue. That is if the Arena Master didn\u2019t get there first. I don\u2019t blame you though, I did the same thing when I first got here. Back before I just became bored of all of this. But that\u2019s Gregory for you, always getting ahead of himself. At least he didn\u2019t try anything stupid like casting magic on the monster while it was in this phase.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t say anything, not wanting to admit I felt a bit foolish for my actions but also knowing it was what any good Hunter would have done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised though, Jethic wouldn\u2019t usually chew anyone out like that. He has a bit of a fear of confrontation. Not with monsters of course, just with other people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know what they say, even a mouse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cActually I never heard that before, what does it mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe full saying is even a mouse can turn into a lion. It means there is a limit to what everybody can take. And when backed into a corner or they finally get tired of running they will turn around and transform into a ferocious animal. Even shy timid people will have their moments. So it seems this was one of his.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEven a mouse. I like that. I\u2019ll have to remember that for the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe watched as the group finally finished off the monster, getting a scrap of Glif skin for their troubles. Jethic held it high in the air as they all cheered. Though I did notice that Gregory was left out of the small celebration, left to cheer alone. That scrap of skin would probably net them around two Reul each, since the going rate was around ten Reul fifty Knutz. Not a lot honestly but it was still a bit of pocket change. Perhaps the first they had earned so far as Hunter\u2019s in training. The Arena Master would sell it for them before splitting the profit, that was just how the system worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce they were off the field the first two groups went back out again to fight some Spindler\u2019s. a type of construct creature that looked like giant crystallized rocks with six legs growing out of the back of the body. They had no mouths and no eyes that were obvious, relying mostly on echo location like a bat. That and their speed were the biggest things they had going for them. Their crystallized bodies acted as a slight deterrent to most slashing weapons, even bouncing weak spells off harmlessly. The way to go was blunt and piercing. But neither group had such weapons, making this fight more even to their skill levels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw movement out of the corner of my eye as the two groups began fighting and was surprised to see my father walking towards the teacher holding the hand of a little girl. I was already heading down the steps to the floor by the time my father began speaking in a low tone with the Arena Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cZelkov, your father wants to talk with you privately. You are welcome to use the locker room  if you wish. No thanks Henry, I\u2019ve already got a room set aside. I don\u2019t want to hold up your classes if things take long. Thanks for the offer though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher shrugged as I followed my father back out into the hall. As we walked I studied him out of the corner of my eye. The first thing I noticed was the dark circles, telling me he hadn\u2019t had much sleep lately. The next thing I noticed was the gray in his hair. There was more of it then I last remembered when I had seen him almost a month ago. The blue shirt he wore barely hid his impressive physique, even for a man pushing forty. He didn\u2019t say anything as we walked, his sun tanned skin seeming to soak up the artificial light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy gaze strayed down to the little girl walking between us. No, on closer inspection I realized she wasn\u2019t walking on her own, it was more like her body moved reflexively because my father was pulling her forward. Her eyes had the empty look I had seen on a few other shock victims. There was no sense of life in those scarlet irises at all. A face as expressive as stone to go with the blank eyes. If I hadn\u2019t noticed the light rise and fall of her chest as she breathed I would have thought her a puppet. Her silver white hair coupled with those scarlet eyes made me instantly think albino, but her skin, while white, was still the same peach tone as everyone else. So those colors must be her natural ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe held a teddy bear close to her chest with her left hand, crushing the slightly ratty stuffed animal to a lime green dress that I personally found quite disgusting. When my father opened the door to a simple whitewashed room with a single table and six chairs inside, I saw her fingers squeeze the bear a little tighter. She was scared. But of who or what I didn\u2019t know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSpinning one of the chairs around I rested my chin on top of the hands I folded along the back while watching my father and the girl. He carefully pushed her down into a seat across the table from me before and positioned her just like a doll before sitting next to her. He looked from the girl to me and then at the table where he clasped his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 how are things with you son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame old, same old. Weren\u2019t you on a job and not supposed to come back for like another three or four days?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSome things came up and I managed to get it done early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe fell silent then, having exhausted our knowledge of the other\u2019s life after our greeting. Honestly he was barely more than a name on paper saying he was my father. I had closer relationships with near strangers than I did with him and my mother. We had played a few strategy games when I was a kid but that was about it. He scratched the back of his head, trying to find something to say so I decided to get down to business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want? I\u2019ll assume it is a job of some sort, since that is the only reason I can think of that you would come here. It\u2019s a fifty-fifty bet that mother put you up to it too, thinking to milk more out of me by using you instead of coming herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I won\u2019t deny it. Your mother did send me. Though it is more because she didn\u2019t want to fight with you than anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t believe that for a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father looked like he was about to say something but shook his head after taking a small breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnyway, your mother wanted to know if you would protect this girl for a few days. Only until someone your mother knows can come pick her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about her that she needs a Hunter protecting her? Political refugee? Some foreign dignitaries daughter? And why me? Any Hunter would do in that case. Especially since she didn\u2019t want me getting my license in the first place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a monster summoner with unstable powers. Not any Hunter would do, unless we were looking to get her killed. You are one of the few that are both strong enough and wouldn\u2019t kill her out of hand. Asala here lost her parents three days ago. Seeing them die in front of her activated her latent ability, sending it out of control. You can handle anything she might throw out and you are good with kids. Considering she hasn\u2019t eaten or slept in three days, being sustained on magic instead, I thought that would be an important factor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I suppose neither you nor mother can do it because you are going to be off on another mission?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCorrect. We leave later on today actually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy am I not the least bit surprised? What about another Hunter. Surely between the two of you someone else has to come to mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well there is Pelei and Rinik. Wait, Rinik is off on a mission of his own I think and Pelei\u2026 well Pelei is Pelei. Personally he wouldn\u2019t be my first choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he is a more experienced Hunter than me. And licensed at that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat, not going to say he is better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. In straight up skill I am better than him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father grinned at my matter of fact statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIndeed he might have more battle experience than you but unlike your mother, I\u2019d rather the girl go to someone who will take care of her not only physically but mentally and emotionally. Pelei is lacking in two of those three categories. Your mother didn\u2019t take that into account when she sent me of course but I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI also bet she wants this all under the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t deny that either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is a pretty slimy way she is handling things . You know that right? She should have come herself to deal with me even if we did end up arguing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould you have been able to be as objective about your answer if she had?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about it for a moment before finally shaking my head with a sigh. \u201cNo, probably not. Still I don\u2019t like the way she is doing things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at the girl who\u2019s fingers were barely twitching as they squeezed the stuffed animal I wondered what to do. It was true Pelei was a bit of an eccentric, but he would take good care of her. If I took this job I couldn\u2019t help but feel I would be playing into my mother\u2019s hands somehow. I could help her, there was no doubt in my mind about that. Ultimately a part of me really didn\u2019t want the hassle of a full time protection mission like this under these circumstances. Was me taking this job the best choice? Would the safety of everyone in the city and this little girl be best served if I took this job?</span></div></div>",

Just as long as mother didn\u2019t want you to try and get some ridiculous promise out of me like having to continue to go to classes while protecting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father looked away at that while rubbing the back of his neck. I had to close my eyes and count to three before I said anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease say that\u2019s not the case. She doesn\u2019t really expect me to do that does she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right, I won\u2019t say that\u2019s the case. That\u2019s why you only agreed to do this as a favor under the table without any other strings attached. And why I will be going to inform the office that you will not be coming the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe twiddled his thumbs a moment while looking around the room, not quite sure what else to say or how to end this meeting. I decided I might as well do it myself. Otherwise he\u2019d just make himself look like a fool trying to be a father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if our business is done, then go run off to do whatever you have to do and leave me to get to work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod he got up, a bit of relief flickering across his face before he turned away. He only made it two steps though before turning to face me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSay, son. If you don\u2019t mind, do you think I could hang around for a bit? Our flight doesn\u2019t leave until this evening and I\u2019d like to see how you operate. Maybe learn how to deal with children better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Trying to learn a new trick at your age? Don\u2019t you feel ashamed to be learning how to deal with kids from your own son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever stop learning remember? Even someone as old as me can learn something new. And if you must know, yes I am a bit ashamed to be learning it from you, but I also feel it will be useful information.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuit yourself, just try not to get in my way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I blocked him out of my mind, focusing all my attention on the little girl as I thought how best to approach this situation. There were numerous ways I could go about this to achieve the same results in the end. Broken down her trouble was a combination of shock and trauma so I needed to deal with both of them. When I finally settled on a course of action I let a smile play over my face before walking around the table and kneeling in front of the girl so I was on eye level with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo your name is Asala huh? I had some Asala once, a bit spicy but it went well with the chips. Wait, no. That was salsa, never mind. Still Asala is a pretty name. I know you can hear me even if you want to deny it. So you can just listen to me ramble for a little bit ok? If you get bored you can always tell me to stop.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTaking a deep breath I lifted her little hand in mine, giving it a small squeeze while trying to convey comfort to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can understand why you ran away inside your head. A lot of bad things happened didn\u2019t they? And you saw a lot of scary stuff I bet. Plus right now I bet you are drowning in your sadness, with an empty pit in your stomach where your parents used to be. I bet you feel nothing will ever be able to fill that hole ever again. On top of that you suddenly got this ability to call monsters that you can\u2019t control. I bet they come more often when you think about your parents too. So I don\u2019t blame you for running into your head and shutting down like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her Adam\u2019s apple bob up and down as she suppressed the sorrow I had intentionally invoked. Her hand tightening on the bear even more as the edge of her eyes got wet. With a gentle thumb I wiped them away while cupping her cheek in my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know the feelings going on inside of you. But you know what? You\u2019re not alone right now. Being alone makes those feelings harder to bear. It\u2019s not a sin to let those feelings out. And if you summon a monster because of it, so what. I\u2019ll beat it back where it came from lickity-split. You deserve to let the tears come. Because I bet you loved you mom and dad a lot. Those tears are a way of expressing those feelings. That\u2019s part of what they call grief.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlowly I reached out, pulling her into my chest and wrapping my arms around her. She didn\u2019t respond at all as I softly stroked her hair and continued in a slightly softer tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat pain you feel is like a big wound. Even though no one can see it and it doesn\u2019t bleed like a normal wound does, it still needs healing. Being able to cry it all out is part of that process. Time will also help, but the fact is, it will hurt for a long time to come. Even when you think you are completely healed, you will hear something that sparks a memory or see something that reminds you of them and it will all come back for a short time. But you know, pain can be a good thing too. Because it proves that you are alive. While you are alive you can remember them and prove that they lived too. It can make you stronger as well. But you should never be afraid to let it all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to stroke her hair while rocking her gently back and forth, making some soothing sounds while repeating that she wasn\u2019t alone over and over. Mainly trying to convey that she was safe and could let it all out without worry. After about four minutes her hands finally came up to grasp me tightly as she buried her face in my tunic. I simply continued to comfort her as her muffled wails made it past the fabric. I let her cry herself out, pulling out my handkerchief to wipe the snot from her nose once she was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere that\u2019s better isn\u2019t it? And look, no monsters appeared. I want you to make me a promise ok? If you ever feel like letting it all out again like that don\u2019t try to hold it in. I don\u2019t care where you are or what anyone else says you let it all out ok? And I\u2019ll be there to hold you through it all. Is that a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my pinky as she sniffed and nodded her head. She looked at my hand for a moment before linking her own small finger in mine and we shook on it. I gave her a lopsided grin and a mischievous wink, eliciting a hesitant smile from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow What\u2019s this I hear about you not eating or sleeping huh? We are going to change that whether you like it or not. I\u2019m going to run you ragged today until you will beg for a big soft bed to pass out in. I\u2019ll stuff you with so much food all the new clothes I am going to buy you might not fit in a day or two. And I tell you what little girl, I bet you are going to love every minute of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a small giggle at the way I tilted my head to the side and raised my eyebrow in her direction. Getting to my feet I offered her my hand which she took with only a small bit of hesitation, not yet fully trusting me. But I didn\u2019t expect instant trust, right now I would settle for being a lifeline back to reality. She saw me as safe and that was a start. The rest would come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeaving the room I led the little girl back to the combat arena with my father hovering in the shadows. I had to wait for my class to finish changing and the next class to get done as well before going in and grabbing my duffle bag. Once that was securely riding on my back I made a bee line for the front doors. Asala crowded close to my leg even though she was holding my hand, as if she was afraid of getting too far away from me. When I turned left to head for town my father spoke up and pointed to the car parked across the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a dip of my head in acknowledgment, the three of us headed towards it and got in. Once me and Asala were seated comfortably in the back my father turned around to ask where I wanted to go. Looking down at the skinny little girl sitting next to me in her ugly green dress I wondered what to do first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWell since we have a car, head over to Lawson Street on the east side. That was further than I was planning on going but there is a clothing store down there who\u2019s stuff if a bit better than most.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod my father started the car and we were on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean Chantelle Rouge? I didn\u2019t know you were into stuff like fashion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not. But I\u2019ve learned a thing or two about quality and design. Didn\u2018t think you would know about a place like the Rouge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen you deal with people like Pelei you learn a thing or two whether you want to or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at that, since Pelei had been the person I had learned most of what I knew about clothes from. It was kind of hard not to when he got into one of his moods. I kept seeing Asala glancing in my direction, almost as if she was afraid I would disappear if she didn\u2019t keep looking. I made sure to give her a grin and a wink whenever I caught her eye, tightening my fingers around her hand which she still refused to let go of. It didn\u2019t take long for us to get to the east side, the normal thirty to forty minute walk taking only a few moments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe streets were thankfully a bit deserted at this time of the day, a fact that would no doubt help Asala become more comfortable. The Rouge was an impressive store, taking up a full two block radius. But they also had an impressive selection of men\u2019s and women\u2019s apparel for all sizes to back it up. This was the place I came when I felt the urge to splurge a bit on clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! Back so soon? Didn\u2019t think I would see you for another two weeks or so. That new suit not to your liking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no It\u2019s fine babe. I\u2019m actually here for this little girl today. Think we could find her something nice? Maybe five or six something\u2019s? With some shoes and jewelry to match of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman looked the girl up an down with an expert eye before showing me all her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think we might just have something laying around. What do you think about a light red to go with those eyes? Or an off white to go with the hair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the expert here babe. As long as she likes it is what\u2019s important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe motioned me after her, a few of the other shop girls giving me waves of greeting and a few some flirtatious winks. I gave them an empty smile back out of politeness as we wound our way through the racks of clothes until we came to the section dedicated to girls, specifically children. At first Asala was leery, hanging onto my hand with a death grip as the woman held up a few dresses against her front. But after a few whispered words of encouragement from me she finally let go and followed the woman to a dressing room in sight of where I was. As she took the dress inside the stall my father stepped up next to me, talking in a low tone so as not to be overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs it really proper for you to be calling her babe? Unless you are in a relationship with her, but she seems a bit older than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy? What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt just seems wrong somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the obvious discomfort my father was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Finding it hard to think of me having that kind of relationship?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell\u2026 yeah that\u2019s part of it I guess. But it seems too personal. Not at all how a Hunter should be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI decided to end his suffering, motioning the woman over from where she was waiting patiently outside of the changing booth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHolly, I\u2019d like you to meet my father, Romone Zelkov. Father, I\u2019d like you to meet Holly Babe. I\u2019ve known Holly for what, six years now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least. I remember you bringing your sister in for a small shopping spree on her eighth birthday. I thought you were already a polite little eleven year old charmer, too grown up for your age.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy father here seems to think we have some impure relations going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman barked out a laugh, her whole body shaking in mirth. Finally she wiped a tear from her eye as she let out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe and you? Please, I\u2019ve got kids at least as old as you are! One of them is working the counter now! Besides, my husband might have a thing or two to say about that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both grinned at the look on my father\u2019s face, probably by the fact that the woman didn\u2019t look more than twenty years old with her smooth almond skin and full head of dirty blond hair. I clapped him on the shoulder consolingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes, she is much older than the looks. In fact I think she might even be a few years older than you! It\u2019s ok to be shocked. I bet she takes it as a compliment. How old are you now anyway Holly? Forty one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFourty two. You gave me that warding trinket remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh yeah that\u2019s right! Sorry, it slipped my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a wink before going back to the dressing room where Asala was hesitantly stepping out in a light blue dress with white trimming and a little red bow stitched in like a belt. I gave her a once over before offering it my seal of approval with a thumbs up. Her eyes sparkled and her face broke out into a grin that split her face from ear to ear even as Holly offered her another dress, this one a dark satin red with lighter red trimming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took a few changes but she slowly got into the shopping like I knew she would. I had to figure the ability to love shopping was coded into female DNA or something. After about the fifth dress she was coming out and posing for me then turning to look at herself in the mirror. Holly knew exactly what to do, sensing the girl needed a bit of a pick-me-up treatment. She was another one of the reasons I had decided to come here, her ability to sense peoples moods and adapt to give the customer the best service possible was incredibly useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time we left almost two hours later, Asala seemed almost like a regular little girl. Though she still hadn\u2019t actually said anything, she was laughing and smiling like there was no other expression for her face. She even skipped out of the store a step ahead of me, sporting one of her new dresses and shoes. This one was a soft green dress that reminded me of summer meadows, instead of the puke green of the old one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tipped Holly generously for her time after setting up arrangements to have the six bags of stuff we had bought delivered to the house. Yet another service this place provided free of charge. Asala was occupied settling her teddy bear in a small harness in front of her originally designed to carry babies. She didn\u2019t seem to care though, since her stuffed animal had it\u2019s own place of honor now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo, Asala. Have you enjoyed yourself so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head up and down vigorously, reminding me of a bobble head toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd do you like your new threads?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain the jackhammer nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then I guess it\u2019s time to go stuff your face like I promised to try to get you to fill them out properly. But I guess I should ask this first, are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she nodded her head, she really didn\u2019t need to say anything. Her stomach chose that moment to grumble demandingly. I grinned a bit as she blushed and looked down at the ground. Giving her hair a quick ruffle I pointed down the street to a family restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey can make you anything you want. And I mean anything. They don\u2019t even have a menu. You just tell them and they make it. Plus they have some brownies that are just out of this world. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if little green aliens came down just to eat them. So here is the deal, we go there and we eat. Then you can have some of those brownies with vanilla ice cream on top. But you must enjoy yourself while eating or I can\u2019t take you. Think you can handle that deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t even bother nodding her head this time, simply grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the diner with eyes that seemed to sparkle with a light all their own.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe booth I was sitting in was jiggling courtesy of the little girl sitting next to me. Her feet were kicking back and forth, the heels tapping against the wooden baseboard as she ate her meal. It had taken a bit of twenty questions and getting yes and no answers before I was able to order her sunny side up eggs, ham, toast and orange juice. A regular breakfast for lunch. My father sat across from us, silently eating some stuffed peppers looking our way thoughtfully. He had kept silent for the most part and honestly it made me a bit uneasy having him around so much. I wasn\u2019t used to  either one of my parents actually being around for more than an hour at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply enjoyed my steak and mushroom platter , listening to Asala humming to herself while she stuffed her face. My father chewed another bite of his meal before finally speaking up for the first time in almost two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like there is a lot about you I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen, son. I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI cut him off with a wave of the hand before he could utter another word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf your planning on saying something like I\u2019m sorry for not being around or some other crap like that don\u2019t bother. The facts are the facts, isn\u2019t that what you taught me? Don\u2019t make excuses and don\u2019t waste your words on empty apologies. You weren\u2019t around and I grew up. That\u2019s just how it is. Not that you should have expected any other outcome. Don\u2019t try acting like a father now when all is said and done. We are both Hunter\u2019s and that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know I\u2019ve made some choices you don\u2019t understand or agree with, and I can\u2019t change what\u2019s already done. But can\u2019t you see I\u2019m at least trying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat, with these few hours? You think watching me from the shadows in an attempt to learn how to deal with kids means you are trying? It means nothing. It meant nothing to me from the very beginning. I would have dealt with her the same way even if you weren\u2019t watching. Your presence was only for your own benefit not mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to continue but Asala tugged on my tunic gently. When I looked over at her there was a sorrow in her eyes as she shook her head back and forth slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t fight with your daddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was soft and hesitant, the almost musical tone of it tinted with the same sadness that showed in her eyes. I let my arm reach out to stroke her hair as I gave her a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right sweetie. I\u2019ll just leave it at that for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me before going back to eating, seeming to feel the matter was settled. There was more I would have said, but my number one priority was to the little girl. In my mind that covered more than just protecting her, that also covered her mental balance. If she didn\u2019t want me arguing for whatever reason, then I would accede to her wishes. My father dropped the subject as well, a small blessing I thought. At least he seemed to understand I had stopped for the girls sake and did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe spent the rest of the meal in a strained silence. But honestly I was more comfortable with things this way. I knew how to handle my father and mother when things were like this. I didn\u2019t know how to deal with them all that well when they tried acting like parents. That\u2019s why I preferred to treat them as Hunter\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala didn\u2019t seem to pick up on the undertones floating between us though, simply off in her own thoughts as she happily ate the meal and the promised brownies and ice cream. Once it was all paid for I saw her yawning and suppressed a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Sleepy already? But it\u2019s barely five o\u2019clock! Don\u2019t tell me you are ready for a nice big soft bed! We have so much more day left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe tried shaking her head no to say she wasn\u2019t sleepy but I could see by the way she rubbed her eyes and tried hiding another yawn. As we all walked back to the car I pulled her in to my side, giving her a one handed hug. Now that I had broken her self imposed shell and magic was no longer supporting her body, it was all coming crashing in on her. Her body was making demands that she had neglected over the last three days, letting the magic take care of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe drive home didn\u2019t take long and my father dropped us off before driving away again with a quick farewell, saying he would see me in a week or so. The shopping bags were all sitting on the front porch already so it only took a few seconds to unlock the spell and shuffle it all inside. Grabbing out the new night dress we had bought for her and her personal kit full of toothbrush and toothpaste among other things, I led her upstairs. It only took a few minutes to show her to my room where she could sleep and the bathroom as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI set her toothbrush and other items on the sink, telling her to consider this her home while she was here before handing her the pajamas and pointing at the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t allow dirty bodies to sleep in my bed. So get yourself cleaned up and get to sleep. Your body needs the rest. I\u2019ll be downstairs if you need me but don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be sleeping in the same room later to keep away anything scary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a nod as I left the bathroom, shutting the door on her and waiting only a moment until I heard the sound of running water. While she was occupied I quickly slipped out of my school uniform into something more comfortable, dropping them into the hamper for cleaning tomorrow. Once that was done I slipped back downstairs and into the living room, turning on the TV more out of habit of having it on for the noise than because I was interested in watching anything. Picking up the latest edition of Swords and Sorcery I began reading some of the articles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith one ear I heard the water finally begin to drain, the old house making even that simple sound echo in the silence. There was the creaking of the floorboard outside of my room so I knew she had gone inside. After that there was silence again as I smiled to myself. She had probably passed out the moment she had crawled under the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy head jerked to the right at the sound of the first step creaking, only to find Asala walking into the room rubbing her eyes, struggling to stay awake, her teddy bear almost dragging the ground in her right hand. Without a word she climbed onto the couch next to me, laying her head in my lap as her lips curved upwards in contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLaying my hand on her head I felt my own lips beginning to curl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGoodnight Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat is it that makes a person choose the way they do? Is it his environment? His upbringing? How does he choose when he has two thoughts that are both equally valid? Is it simply a matter of what thought pops into his mind first? Is that the essence of free will that you humans prize? Or are your choices really choices at all? If indeed the way you decide is influenced by the society you live in, the way you are brought up, the environment in which you live, then is that really choice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWould a child soldier make the same choices as a wealthy merchant would? If so, would it be for the same reasons? If not, then would one of them be wrong? Why would they be wrong then if both followed the path they believed was right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt is an interesting question. One of many I wish to explore in more detail. Perhaps you can explain to me why you chose the way you did. What was your thought process? Was it influenced by anything specific? I would be grateful if you came again and made different choices so that I might study and observe in an attempt to answer these questions. Until then traveler.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWell since we have a vehicle, let\u2019s go over to the east side. There is a diner there called The Sunwalker. I think we should fatten this little girl up a bit before we go looking for clothes to fit her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod my father pulled out of the parking space and we were on our way. Asala kept glancing over at me as we drove, as if afraid I would suddenly disappear if she wasn\u2019t looking. Every so often her little hand would squeeze mine where she held it between us and I would squeeze back in reassurance, a smile on my lips. I had become a secondary lifeline for her, something she could believe in aside from her teddy bear. It wasn\u2019t that unusual for children who had gone through traumas to latch onto someone or something that made them feel safe. I might have guided her towards needing me like this, but it had been for her own benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat diner is the one on Lawson street right? The one where they will make anything you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIsn\u2019t that place a bit expensive? Didn\u2019t know you liked that kind of stuff.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is a lot you don\u2019t know about me. I do occasionally like to splurge from time to time. There is nothing wrong with paying for slightly higher quality service. Besides, I think the food and the service there are worth the price of admission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at Asala who was looking up at me with her big crimson eyes so I gave her a mischievous wink, eliciting a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBesides, I think Asala will enjoy it and their brownies topped with vanilla ice cream. I doubt she has tasted anything like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took around ten minutes to drive over to the restaurant and another moment or two to be seated. I spent a good four of five minutes asking Asala a bunch of simple yes and no questions before I could order for her. The waitress waited patiently for me to continue, not even showing a hint of impatience like others might. Such was the quality of the staff in this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we waited for our food my father sat quietly watching the two of us, trying to soak up every little detail of how I interacted with the girl. I didn\u2019t mind if he wanted to watch, his presence was not required and wouldn\u2019t affect anything I said or did. My priorities were for the girl so thoughts of embarrassment or anything else did not factor in. Both him and mother were rarely around anyway so it was easy to simply forget he was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala, what colors do you like? I picture you in neon yellow. You know, all lit up and glowing like a Christmas light as you walk down the street.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wrinkled my nose and made a face at that, letting her know I was joking but she was already shuddering at the thought. She gave me a small giggle though which was a start. I continued to occupy her time until the food came, trying to elicit a bit of information about her without making her focus on her past too much. I hadn\u2019t got her to have enough fun today yet. If she really got to thinking her sorrow would come back full blast. Something I wanted to avoid for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy plan seemed to be working quite well until her meal came. It was a simple plate of sunny side up eggs, hash browns, ham and toast along with some juice. The hash browns had been cut in half and arranged along with the rest to make it all look like a giant smiling face. She took one look at it before water started flowing from her eyes. Even as I reached out for her she was already turning to clutch at my tunic. The waitress looked unsure but I waved her away with a shake of my head, getting a nod in return before she left us alone. I stroked her hair gently as I made soothing noises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong Asala? Does the way the plate looks like a smiling face remind you of your parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head nodded up and down as she cried a little harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs it a good memory?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain that nod as her arms tightened around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then don\u2019t hold it back. Just because they are gone doesn\u2019t mean all the time you spent with them was bad. You had these good times as well that you can remember. Keep those memories close you hear me? They will help you get through the rough times ahead. Don\u2019t focus on how they died, or why they did. Focus on those memories of how they lived. Make that your strength. Make that your proof.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued to cry for a little while longer and I continued to hold her. Finally with another sniff she rubbed her nose along the skin of her arm. With a sigh I grabbed some napkins to clean her up shaking my head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ve got to teach you some manners girl. Otherwise your skin is going to turn the same ugly shade of green as your dress. You know what else has that color right? Acid. Keep rubbing your snot off like that and your skin will start melting. It\u2019s true. Acid snot. I just made it up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sniffed again but grinned at my bit of humor and the too serious look I had on my face as I kissed her forehead and ruffled her hair affectionately. After a moment more of clinging to me she picked up her fork and stared at the plate, finally stabbing one of the pieces of hash brown. She shoved it into her mouth as a few tears began to roll down her cheeks again. But she refused to cling to me this time. With a smile I stroked her hair gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood girl Asala. You\u2019re going to become strong, I just know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the meal went without incident and she did indeed enjoy the brownies with ice cream just as I thought she would. A look of glee spreading across her face with the first bite and continuing until the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe staff were too well schooled and paid enough not to comment on what they saw or spread any kind of gossip, yet another point in this places favor. I made sure to tip them well as I paid the bill and we left the diner, just to make sure their eyes forgot what they saw. Once back out on the street I wrapped one arm around the little girls shoulder, heading to a clothing store only a few blocks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow we will get you some real clothes. I wouldn\u2019t say this place has everything you could ever think of wanting or needing, but I bet that\u2019s not far off the mark. Now I want you to go in there and have fun you hear me? I know all girls seem to love shopping so I want you to enjoy it too. You best not worry about how much it costs or anything like that. You shop and you shop until you are satisfied ok? If that ends up being only thirty Knutz or thirty thousand Reul, you let me worry about that. It might not be a permanent cure to the pain, but I\u2019ve learned even such things as this can be considered needed medicine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I opened the door to a world of heaven made of fabric instead of clouds. I had a feeling she was really going to enjoy Chantelle Rouge and this would become one of the biggest turning points on her road to recovery.</span></div></div>",

That suit not fit right or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, it fits fine Honey. I\u2019m here for this little girl today, I think she could do with some of the tender loving care that only this place can provide.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m tickled you thought of us sugar. Hunter business I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll pass it around no worries sugar. But us standing around gabbing won\u2019t put something decent on this child. That dress is so not her. How could you let her walk around in such a dreadful thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really my choice Honey. But she is here now so stop complaining.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuch a taskmaster you are! You best tip well for this sugar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t I always?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a laugh she motioned us to follow her deeper into the store to where the girls clothing was. Her long blond hair bouncing against her spine, the ends patting her back right over the butt she was swishing playfully for me. Even with her back turned to me I could still almost imagine her deep blue eyes watching my every move. Seeming to read my thoughts she looked over her shoulder, giving me a playful grin along with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough though she was holding dresses up against Asala\u2019s front making little grunts of approval or denial. She even held up some shirt and pant combo\u2019s but Asala didn\u2019t seem to like too many of those, preferring the dresses instead. It wasn\u2019t like the old days where it was strange to see women in pants, there were many who wore them regularly. So if Asala wanted to wear dresses, I wouldn\u2019t say anything against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the woman led Asala to a changing room with a deep purple dress lined with a lighter purple that looked like it was made of velvet, my father stepped up next to me to speak for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo are you and her a couple? Is that why you are so against the arranged marriages your mother sets up for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, why would you think that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you call her honey and she calls you sugar. That sounds like a bit of an intimate relationship there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a chuckle as I motioned the young woman over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy father here seems to think me and you have something going on so I thought I would clear up the misunderstanding. Father, I\u2019d like you to meet Holley Babe. But since that\u2019s also the same name as her mother we all call her Honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn account of my sweet personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! Your only sweet when you are getting paid to be. Outside of this store you are about as sweet as sour grapes mixed with vinegar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019d you say you egotistical overbearing needle nosed\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a paying customer right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026Sweet man you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both grinned and began to laugh, having a bit of fun with each other like we normally did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeriously though, she is sweet inside and outside of the store, but there\u2019s nothing between us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot that I haven\u2019t tried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re just too sweet for me. I\u2019d die of sugar overdose within a day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh but what a day that would be sugar!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door to the dressing room opened then and Asala came out wearing the new dress. She seemed a bit unsure about how she looked but Honey gushed over her and I let out a low whistle of appreciation when she glanced my way. My approval seemed to mean more than Honey\u2019s words as she grinned and did a little pirouette for my benefit. Honey pushed another dress into her hands, this one a shiny black with no sleeves, before turning her around to put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left Honey to her work, only making small sounds of approval and a few catcalls as Asala came out in a new dress time after time. After about the fourth such change she seemed to really begin to blossom, posing in the mirror and for me. The smile on her face was so wide and her eyes shone so brightly I wondered why her face didn\u2019t crack. But it was a true look of joy, not one she was putting on for my benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHoney also got her outfitted with new shoes, prettied her up with make-up and even a few pieces of jewelry. With Asala\u2019s consent Honey gave the girl her first ear piercing which seemed to make her even happier. Honey never let her sit around idle for long though, helping her pick out everything from underwear to perfume and even personal bath towels. She also produced a harness from somewhere Asala could strap onto either her front or back to let her stuffed animal have it\u2019s own place, freeing up both her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThough I didn\u2019t have the same eerie ability to read minds as Honey and her mother had, judging from the girl\u2019s body language I knew she was past the crisis point now. Though I wasn\u2019t actually certain if the two of them could actually read minds or if they just read body language like I did. Still their skill to adapt and give their customers a completely enjoyable and satisfying experience was quite amazing. Honey looked at me then as she stuck a hair ornament in Asala\u2019s hair, giving me a playful wink as if in response to my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally after about two hours Honey led us over to a register to cash us out, leaving Asala with a look of dreamy eyed bliss on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s see, ten Knutz fifty Senz for the ear studs. Fifty Knutz for the perfume. All told your total comes out to four hundred and one Reul, forty Knutz, and twenty five Senz. Plus your promised tip of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling out my wallet I slipped a five hundred Reul bill from it, starting to hand it over when she gave me another of her mischievous smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know, I could forgo a monetary tip in exchange for a physical one. Say a nice long passionate kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI finished laying the bill on the counter without even batting an eyelash. I was used to such proposals from her so they didn\u2019t even catch me off guard anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKeep the change as your tip Honey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNoticing the way Asala was trying to hide a yawn I grinned more to myself then anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlso, think you could send all this over to my place with one of your delivery boys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo problem sugar.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Hon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe left the store then, with Asala reaching up to touch her new earrings and smiling foolishly to herself; her bear sitting in its place of honor on her chest, watching the world from under her chin. We climbed back into the car as my father asked where to next, driving off after I told him home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then why did you want them to deliver the packages if you were planning on going there anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stroked the little girls hair where she was already asleep nestled in the crook of my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat way I don\u2019t have to worry about unloading the car and I will have my hands empty to carry her inside. I purposefully ran her ragged today so her body would burn off the last bit of magic that was supporting her. Once it was gone her body reasserted it\u2019s natural needs, and one of those was sleep. If she wakes up I don\u2019t want her to think that I am gone. Right now I\u2019m an anchor point for her in this reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are good with kids son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl snuggled even deeper into my side as she smiled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t know if she was awake or asleep, or if she was talking to me or a dream phantom. But I hugged her tighter anyway as I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you too little one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat made her smile grow a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat is it that makes a person choose the way they do? Is it his environment? His upbringing? How does he choose when he has two thoughts that are both equally valid? Is it simply a matter of what thought pops into his mind first? Is that the essence of free will that you humans prize? Or are your choices really choices at all? If indeed the way you decide is influenced by the society you live in, the way you are brought up, the environment in which you live, then is that really choice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWould a child soldier make the same choices as a wealthy merchant would? If so, would it be for the same reasons? If not, then would one of them be wrong? Why would they be wrong then if both followed the path they believed was right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt is an interesting question. One of many I wish to explore in more detail. Perhaps you can explain to me why you chose the way you did. What was your thought process? Was it influenced by anything specific? I would be grateful if you came again and made different choices so that I might study and observe in an attempt to answer these questions. Until then traveler.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tCocking my head to the side I looked into the girls expressionless face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Asala, I\u2019ll be frank with you. I know you can hear me even if you do act like you are completely disconnected from the world. That\u2019s because you are still holding that teddy bear in your hands. Anyone truly disconnected would have dropped it long ago. So you can at least hear what is going on even if you don\u2019t react to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw my father do a double take then slap his forehead at overlooking something so obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow the hell did I not realize that! Or anyone else for that matter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ignored his muttered words as I continued to stare into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you know more about this situation than anyone. You have probably overheard everything my father hasn\u2019t told me and put a few things together on your own. So here are the facts, part of me doesn\u2019t want to take this job because I feel I will be falling into one of my mother\u2019s ploys somehow. Like a fly getting caught in the spider\u2019s web. Plus I am not sure if me being the one to guard you would best serve both you and everyone else in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do know I could do it though. If you come with me you will be forced to live. I will break you out of that shell and you won\u2019t be able to hide inside your head after that like you are now. I\u2019ll make you eat real food and get real sleep, not relying on magic to do it for me. But if you end up going to Pelei you will die. He will protect you just as well as I can, but he won\u2019t try to pull you out of your shell. He will treat you just like a doll, much like you are being treated now. He will continue to dose you with magic to sustain you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn case you don\u2019t know, magic can only keep the body alive for so long without real food and sleep. In a day or two your body will become extremely weak if you don\u2019t feel it happening already. It will eat itself up and kill you. No amount of magical dosing or healing can change that. So my question is, what do you want? Do you want to live? If so I want you to chose me of your own accord. Get up and come over to my side under your own power. But if your desire to die right now is greater than your will to live, then continue to sit there and do nothing. I\u2019ll give you five minutes to decide. If at the end of that five minutes you haven\u2019t moved an inch, then I am going to walk out that door and not come back. Think quickly, the clock begins now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.\u201d My father looked at the girl for a moment and then at me. \u201cSon, if you really think that is the case and she will die if she goes to Pelei, then you have to take care of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause\u2026\u201d His hand twirled in the air as he sought an answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause she has to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSay\u2019s who? Living is a choice. Perhaps the ultimate choice. Who are we to say it is wrong to want to die? To have the desire to take their own life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut they were given the gift of life by The One God! They can\u2019t just throw that away! He has a plan for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what? They still have the option of accepting the gift given to them or not. Saying they will go to one of the eight circles of Hell if they commit suicide is idiotic. The teachings state The One God loves all his children without stipulation. I might not be a religious fanatic or anything but I do know the basic gospel. Saying she has to live for the sake of living is simply you trying to push your own morels and your own beliefs onto her. Trying to make her conform to this standard society has set as to what is right and wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut it\u2019s not right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSays who? You? The Priests? Some random stranger out on the street? If you want to go into a theological debate about right and wrong then I can accommodate you. Do you think it\u2019s right that I know more about the waitress\u2019 down at The Pipe than I do you or mother? Do you think it\u2019s right I\u2019m not allowed to become a licensed Hunter? Or that both mother and you decided to bring this problem to me, trying to get me to accept a job that should be handled by someone with a license?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was getting mad now. I could feel the heat rising to my face as I raised my voice and stared my father down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about me huh? Do you think it\u2019s right that I\u2019m always alone at home while you and mother are off god knows where doing god knows what for any untold amount of time? Or is it right that I turn every TV and radio in the house on every night so I can close my eyes and pretend there is someone else there? You want me to continue? I can go on for days! Because I am damn sure you think every single one of those things are right because those are all the choices you both made. If you had any qualms it never stopped you from shoving them to the side and doing it anyway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut do you think I think those were the right choices? Hell no I don\u2019t. I think every single one of the choices you have ever made in your lives where I was concerned was wrong. I grew up without parents! I had to learn what I did from other people! Learn what you and mother should have taught me as parents and not as Hunters! So which one of us is right then huh? You or me? You think she should live simply because she is alive right now? I call bull on that. If she want\u2019s to die then let her die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t believe that son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike hell I don\u2019t! Do I think it\u2019s the right choice if she decides to die? No I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t agree with it at all. But do I understand it and will I accept her decision? Of course, because that is what she thinks is right. That is the decision she can live with so to speak. But I suppose someone like you wouldn\u2019t understand that. After all you barely batted an eye when mother murdered Olia. A murder you helped perpetrate with your own inactions and blind eyes. A week! Only eight days did you stay home then. The longest you have probable ever been in that house in your life! Just long enough to see to the funeral arrangements and the burial then it was off to some corner of the world on another job for some third world country. I\u2019m sure you thought that was the right decision too, even though I thought it just proved you were unfit to be called parents! There is no black and white in this world father. So don\u2019t presume to tell me what is right and what isn\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at the girl who still hadn\u2019t moved a muscle during that entire exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne minute left girl. Last chance to change your mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe seconds seemed to go by in slow motion as the small magical timer counting down at the corner of my left eye that only I could see made their way to zero. I saw my father staring at me sadly, as if he wanted to refute my arguments. But he knew I was right. There was no counterargument he could make to justify himself or prove me wrong. At least he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut when he knew he had lost. The timer finally hit zero and the girl still hadn\u2019t budged an inch, with a nod I headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope you don\u2019t suffer too much girl. But you made your decision and I respect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced at my father one last time as I opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake her to Pelei and then run off to do whatever it is you think is so important like you always do. If you really think she should live or want to force your views onto her then cancel your job and protect her yourself. Though we both know you won\u2019t do that. Work has always taken top priority over everything else hasn\u2019t it? Plus you are almost as bad with kids as mother is so you wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to help her anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed for the combat arena, making it back to class just as the bell rang. It took only a moment to grab my duffle bag from the locker and sling it over my shoulder. So I was one of the first ones out the door, marching straight back to the classroom on the second floor. Before I got far though the principal wheeled herself up alongside me quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you talk with me for a bit boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that an order?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Merely an old woman seeking a bit of company. You are free to refuse if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid my father put you up to this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRomone? No. I just feel like rambling for a bit that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why me? I\u2019m sure you could ramble to anyone you feel like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause, the other teachers who are free have listened to me ramble often enough and I won\u2019t take any of the other students out of class where they need to learn. You on the other hand don\u2019t need to know any of this so I thought you might like a bit of fresh air and out of the classroom for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re up to something old woman. Rambling or not this is out of the ordinary.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chuckled a bit and I saw a sparkle of mischief in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a lot like him. But that\u2019s no surprise. Yes I might be up to something. Then again I might not be. Who knows? But if you come with me I\u2019ll let you ask one question and I will answer it honestly. After you listen to my rambling of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I flung out my hand dramatically, gesturing for her to go ahead of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLead the way old woman.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tShe led me down a side hall and out through one of the many side doors. We passed student\u2019s hurrying from one place to the next, probably having spent a study hall outside or sneaking a bit of make-out with their girlfriend or boyfriend. She led me to a large old gnarled oak tree planted behind the school building near the running tracks where a bench rested under the boughs. Even as she stared up at it in silence a group was leaving the building and heading for the track with a gym teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis tree has been alive for as long as this school has been open, did you know that? Two hundred and fifty seven years. By all rights it should have died long ago, but with all the magic that has leaked out of the building day after day and year after year it has been given a much longer life. It\u2019s protected this school as a silent sentinel and seen almost as much hardships as any Hunter will face. It\u2019s survived two lightning strikes, a monster infestation, three different plagues, countless alchemy explosions and weathered the hazards of this schools many expansions and additions. The body of the first principal, the one who founded this school, is even laid to rest under it\u2019s roots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut as tough a nut as it is to crack, it\u2019s seen it\u2019s fair share of the good times too. Such as countless graduations, tearful farewells, and confessions of love. I had my first kiss under this tree, back when I was around your age. And my first breakup. Back then mortality rates were much lower than they are now and we all knew that. That\u2019s why we all fell in and out of love so quickly and were a bit free with our passions back then. I made a vow with my three best friends the day we graduated under the eaves of this tree too. That we would all meet back up here a year from that day under these same branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was the only one to make it to that meeting. One died a month after that vow and the other two within six months of that. Not uncommon in our line of work true, but I thought we would each last at least a year. That vow was also the last time I ever saw any of them again. Alive at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stopped staring up at the tree as she spun to face me, a smile and a distant look in her eyes. A small dog came running up out of nowhere to jump into her lap where she proceeded to pet it absently. I didn\u2019t know what breed it was but it reminded me of a fox with it\u2019s russet coat and white face markings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs Hunter\u2019s we make choices. Ones that seem inconsequential and ones that can tip the scales of the very world. Our words carry weight and sometimes more power than our physical bodies do. On our command kings have been overthrown and countries wiped out within a night. We serve the greater good, not any one country, or person. We are an ideal, an image that normal citizen strive to emulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut we aren\u2019t infallible. We are human like everyone else. We have our quirks, our strengths and weaknesses. We make mistakes and we struggle to survive as best we can. Sometimes the choices we make end up hurting others. Be they loved one\u2019s, the impoverished or maybe even the wealthy. But it is up to use to make the hard choices in serving the best interest of the most number of people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWheeling past me she watched the group running around the track. Only sixteen kids in all, but each and every one had the hard eyed look of a Hunter ready for battle. The tense wariness about them of a Hunter on the alert for danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s one of the next graduating classes right there. They started out with twenty five of them you know. They watched as nine of their fellows died or dropped out over the last two years. People they called friends, perhaps even family. Look at them. They know the risks they take. They know that within five years their numbers will have dwindled even more. When they have their five year reunion, how many of them will be left? Ten? More than that? Less? Yet even knowing that. Even knowing their families will mourn for them they still chose this path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you think every one of their families was supportive of them? That some of them haven\u2019t been disowned or kicked out or pressured into giving up? They put aside their own feelings, their own families because they believe they will make a difference. And they are right. Each and every one of them will make a difference. Whether they know it or not they will all make a difference. Even in their deaths will they make a difference. Mistakes, human frailties, quirky personalities and all. They will take jobs they won\u2019t be able to talk about even with their lovers. They will hold secrets inside until the day they die and they will make the world a better place. Because they are Hunter\u2019s. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe dog jumped off her lap then after licking her face and ran off barking happily. We both watched it round the corner in silence while the gym teacher\u2019s whistle cut the air nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what exactly was your point old lady? I know all that already. I\u2019ve grown up getting that kind of thing pounded into my head. What my job as a Hunter is has never been in question. Or my priorities if it came down to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you really? Then why did you get so angry at your father earlier? You don\u2019t know his circumstances. He is a Hunter too after all. Did you ever consider that even though he felt his decisions were the right ones that he also understood he was hurting you as well? That perhaps there were secrets and missions he couldn\u2019t tell you about that were vitally important to the first directive of the Hunter? That he put you to the side to benefit the citizens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo he did put you up to this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot at all. He has no idea I am talking to you. In fact he took that little girl and left the room shortly after you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you were eavesdropping on us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI found having eyes and ears everywhere is a good way of keeping students out of too much trouble. And when a meeting between two Zelkov\u2019s is involved, I find myself more interested in those eyes and ears. I told you, Hunter\u2019s sometimes keep secrets they take to the grave. How many such secrets do you think I have in this head of mine? But none of them will pass my lips.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you know why my father and mother are never around? Why they were never a part of my life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cTut, tut child. You already asked your question. Two of them in fact, though the answer was the same for both. Now run along, I don\u2019t want to keep you from your classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as she wheeled herself off out of sight before turning around and heading back towards the school. I couldn\u2019t help but feel I had been played. That she had never intended to give me any useful information. Just what great secret were they all hiding from me? And why wouldn\u2019t anyone tell me? With a growl of disgust I opened the door into History class. There was a bit of a stir as I made my sullen apologies for being late and took my seat before the teacher started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was an old story. The History of Nesta Highwill and her future husband Gint Jervin. I had read the tale of how they stopped the first great war between Hunter\u2019s and the world governments to pave the way for the creation of the Hunter Association. Even though I had read it countless time I still got caught up in the story, perhaps because of the way the teacher told it. Or perhaps it simply felt different because someone was speaking it out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026..Nesta and Gint began their journey in 0040, three years after the start of the war. As Ronin they had no support from the main Hunter forces. Though in those days we were called Yinshin, a word that meant overpowered in the old tongue of the time. For five years they traveled from one government to the next, putting themselves in great danger but also paving the way for future peace talks. Some governments tried to use them for their own personal schemes, but between the two of them they outwitted all plots. It was almost as if The One God was guiding their movements himself. Indeed some scholars believe this actually was the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTogether they were unstoppable. Each making up for the others weaknesses., not even the strongest monsters or the toughest Hunter\u2019s of the time could match them. Is it any wonder then that they eventually became lovers as well? Still, it took them five years to stop the fighting and many lives were lost in the process from both sides, as well as the citizens attacked by monsters. And then another five years to hash out all the details that in the end created the Hunter Union. Many of the rules and ideals we uphold as Hunter\u2019s came down from these two. In a way they were truly the first real Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher continued on, going into more details about the Hunter Union and the many changes it had gone through over the years. He briefly touched upon the Second Purge, the first being what had sparked the First Uprising in the first place. Before he could talk too much about the Second Purge, or any of the events leading up to the Second Uprising, the bell rang signaling the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen two boys and two girls came over to chat me up, I simply held up my hand and shook my head, forcing them to stop in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you are all very interested in me and are plotting your own little schemes to get into my good graces but I am not in the mood right now. So just do an about face and walk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the fake smiles fading from all four faces before they hesitantly turned around. I hadn\u2019t been lying to them just to get them off my back though. Dealing with the principal had left a bad taste in my mouth and a slightly foul mood. Even an entire period of History and listening to one of my favorite stories hadn\u2019t made it go away. Dealing with people just wasn\u2019t high on my priorities right now. When I glanced over towards the windows I saw Liz catch my eye, tapping her finger rapidly on the desk in a basic code all Hunter\u2019s learned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>Now you see why I got bored of this class. To much political jockeying for my taste.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sly grin I quickly tapped a reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>You just need mental strength. You are the type that says they don\u2019t care about other\u2019s feelings but they actually do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAren\u2019t you the same way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps. But I keep the good of all in mind. I don\u2019t have to play nice with people all the time to make that happen.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n\tShe shook her head slightly before calling me a liar with a small smile on her face before turning and looking out the window, ending our conversation. Maybe I was lying to myself, but I was who I was and dealing with my peers was not one of my strong suites. I just didn\u2019t know how to deal with them like I did children and adults. It was like they suddenly became aliens once they hit fourteen or so and didn\u2019t return to normal until around twenty four. Granted there were some adults I still thought were alien that I couldn\u2019t deal well with but they were much fewer and farther apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Monster Tactics teacher came in and took role call before he started in on his lesson. While interesting enough, he said nothing new about the strengths and weaknesses of monsters that I didn\u2019t already know. He did omit the fact that healing magic and potions were effective against Cadaver Dogs, but I really didn\u2019t feel like pointing that out since that information was really only helpful for priests. Not many people would waste a healing potion on a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time the bell rang I was ready to go home. I was tired of the constant glances in my direction and the calculating looks. I wanted to tell them all to go screw themselves but I knew that wasn\u2019t proper. Slipping my bag on my back I headed out of the classroom before any of them could try to corner me. I just didn\u2019t want to get into the whole twenty questions I knew they would deluge me with while the girls shamelessly flirted and the guys tried to become instant best friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was outside the school gates I stared up at the sky, wondering what to do now. I could go back home, but there was no one and nothing there really. I did want to investigate an artifact shop here on the south side I had been meaning to find for a while to see if the owner could handle level three trinket renewals. But it really wasn\u2019t a pressing matter since I knew the price for such a renewal would be quite high. Perhaps make my rounds of the downtown to keep up with all my contacts there? I hadn\u2019t seen many of them lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA whistle behind me made me turn in time to see a group of three boys making catcalls at Lilia from where they were leaning against a tree. The two on the sides were common and forgettable, your average henchmen material. But the one in the middle looked like he was trying to stand out as having a bad boy image with his blue died hair and studded leather jacket. I shook my head at such foolishness, bullies wouldn\u2019t survive long at this or any other Hunter academy. Playing such a role was like admitting you were one step away from dropping out or you were just a loser all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Lilia didn\u2019t respond to their catcalling they converged around her like hyenas sensing a meal. for her part Lilia had that disinterested faraway look on her face, seeming not to notice the three boys circling her trying to either flirt or bully. I couldn\u2019t tell which from their low tones. After a moment a burst of pale light expanded around Lilia, sending all three of them flying. The two henchmen flew off to either side to land a few feet away while the leader of the group sailed through the open gate right towards me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI briefly considered stopping his fall but decided against it, simple taking one large step to the left. He twisted slightly, trying to break his fall with one hand but only succeeded in breaking his hand instead when it smashed into the cement. The bone snapping and breaking the skin by the time his butt touched down. He began to yell even as Lilia calmly walked up and laid her hands on his. Within a few moments his bones were back inside his skin and even the scars were fading fast. Letting the faint smile that had been constantly on her face curve upwards a little more she patted him on the head as if he were a little child before turning to walk past me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched her go while nibbling my lip. Something told me I should follow her, if for nothing else than because I felt she was a bit lonely just like me. On the other hand something was also suddenly telling me to go check out the artifact store. Which was I supposed to choose?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe feeling of following Lilia won out as I turned after her. It only took a few long strides before I was walking at her side. She didn\u2019t seem to notice I was there though as she hummed to herself, sometimes stopping to smell a flower or squat to watch some ants. When she stepped into the street to cross against the light I held her back with a hand on her shoulder. She gave me a startled look, seeming to see me for the first time as a car sped past where she would have been if I hadn\u2019t stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Riktal! How long have you been there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSince we left school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh. Ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat seemed to be the extent of her interest as she went back to humming and ignoring me. I could see why people might think her strange and avoid her. But oddly I didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable around her at all. Perhaps it had to do with the fact that she was God-touched. Or maybe because she just didn\u2019t act like everyone else so seemed less alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even question it when my feet continued going north along with her when I should have headed west to go home. She spoke up then, cocking her head to the side as she looked at me with those slightly dreamy eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, Ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat seemed to satisfy her as we continued on in silence until we came to the cloister. There was a woman wearing a light green cape and a small gnarled staff tucked into her belt standing in front of the gate looking left and right frantically. I noted the slight disdain that flickered in her eyes as she saw Lilia approaching before she clamped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood day trainee Lilia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood evening priestess Ur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t miss the slight bit of disgust in her greeting either, though only someone trained to catch the nuances of speech would notice. I wondered why this woman had a problem with Lilia. Could it be because the girl had chosen to become a Hunter and not a priestess?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t happen to see Nim and the other\u2019s did you? They ran off someplace and I can\u2019t find them anywhere in the complex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I\u2019m sorry priestess, I didn\u2019t see them on my way back from school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chewed on her lower lip, lost in thought for a moment before sizing me up and down. Noting not only my uniform but also my presence. I could see she recognized me as a Hunter even if I wasn\u2019t official yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! Hunter! Help me find those kids now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPriestess Ur right? Begging your pardon, but go blow yourself. I have no obligation to help you, especially when there is no sign that they are in danger. Plus I don\u2019t take kindly to people giving me such orders when they are asking for my help and aren\u2019t paying me to boot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen what good are you Hunter\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuite good if you are ever halfway considerate of us. We might protect the citizens but we are still human and deserve to be treated like one. You don\u2019t like it when Hunter\u2019s demand that you heal them, even when you were already so inclined to do so. Have some respect for us as well in that regard. I don\u2019t like having demands made of me even if I might have been so inclined to help to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave Lilia a small bow, purposefully snubbing the older woman by not bowing to her as well before turning to walk away. Out of the corner of my eye I could see the woman in the green cape grit her teeth and open her mouth to yell something angrily at me. I really didn\u2019t care, I wasn\u2019t one of the devoted even if I did believe in The One God like most other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeace priestess Ur. Sir Hunter would you wait but a moment longer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned back around in time to see a woman around her mid to late thirties with long pale brown hair come walking out of the gate. She wore a crown of white vadivin flowers on her head, the petals wilting slightly but not a hint of brown showing. Around her shoulders rested a cape embroidered to look like folded wings. Her pale golden eyes had the same dreamlike quality to them that I had noted in Lilia\u2019s while an almost visible aura surrounded her. Both the woman named Ur and Lilia bent down on one knew and bowed their head for a second before returning to their feet. Even if I had never seen her before, I knew who this was. There was only one person allowed to wear such a cloak, the Holy Mother herself. The head of the entire religion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Holy Mother bowed deeply to me before offering me a smile. I found myself offering her a small one in return without realizing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease excuse the priestess. I am sure she is worried about her charges and has let her emotions rule her words. I am sure she meant no disrespect. But I humbly apologize that one of mine has offended you so sir Hunter. It is true that Hunter\u2019s are not unfeeling tools just as we priests and priestesses are not. Would you please consent to helping Keeper Ur find her lost children? I too am worried about them and wish not to see either they or the priestess here suffer for our inaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoly Mother! You shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Holy Mother gave the priestess a warm smile and put her finger on her lips to quiet her. Letting the smile on my face widen even more I gave her a small bow, ignoring the priestesses words which still sounded rude to my ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfter such an apology from the Holy Mother herself how could I refuse to help? Priestess Ur, are you sure they are not inside?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yes. I checked everywhere for them but they were nowhere to be found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it would be useless to waste time trying to go up and down every street searching for them. That would take at least two days or more in a city this size. You could always just wait for them to return. Unless they have been missing for a very long time now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve been searching for about thirty minutes now and I have this bad feeling that they might be in trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then the simplest thing to do is send out some scout constructs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I can make constructs too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia grinned excitedly as she pulled two origami cranes out of her pouch and made them fly around. I let her have her moment excitedly before I sadly shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not a construct. That\u2019s just temporary transference. They last only as long as your magic is still in them. Without you supplying it constantly the magic bleeds out. A true construct holds that power in forever until it\u2019s duty is done or you take it out. In the end it\u2019s basically just wind magic. But since you are able to control wind I can easily teach you how to make a true construct. At least one of the very basic ones.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can control wind a little bit too. Do you think you would be able to teach me as well? I want to help find the children also.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at priestess Ur who was blushing a bit as she lowered her head. It had probably cost her a bit to ask me. I waited until she lifted her head to look at me from lowered lashes before offering a grin and handing her one of the paper cranes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you can make this float with your wind you have enough skill for what I have to show you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe took the crane in her hand and stared at it a moment before it lifted off her palm and zoomed around. With a nod  I slipped my bag off my back and dug into the side pocket, coming out with a large spool of gold wire. Quickly I began snipping off strands of it the length of my palm until it was all gone and I had twenty strips. I began bending each strip into the rough outline of a butterfly with spread wings while I talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor the most basic of constructs there is only three things you need aside from basic mastery over the elements that is. Each type of construct needs a certain mastery. For example these will be flying scouts so you need wind mastery. If you want a guardian type you need to know earth mastery. The first thing you need is your shape, or the form that will hold the power in. That\u2019s why I am bending this wire into a butterfly shape. You already have a form in your origami cranes so that is no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I set the ninth form on the ground Lilia pulled four more cranes from her pouch. The priestess Ur raised an eyebrow at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you always carry such things wherever you go trainee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I think they are pretty and they look cute when they fly around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe priestess simply shook her head as I continued to fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe second thing a simple construct needs is a link between you and it so that your desires come through. The easiest way to do this is to sprinkle it with your blood. You can tie hair onto it as well if you want and that will give you a stronger link, but that also requires a bit more control over your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I pulled the dagger out of it\u2019s sheath at my side and flicked my finger, letting a few drops well up and drip over the twenty small forms I had created. Once I was done I cleaned the blade on my pants and handed it to the priestess. She hesitated a moment and cut her own finger, staining two of the white cranes red. Lilia had already used her own knife to put a few droplets onto the last four paper birds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd last you need an incantation that binds it to your service. You must call upon the base elements of the material you are working with. In your case you cant just say paper, you got to go even farther back. Paper is made from trees, trees are creatures of wind, water, and earth. Fire is used in the creation of paper. That is how your paper is connected to the elements. There is no set incantation, it can be different every time if you so desire. Though if you can remember one that works easily it makes things easier as you concentrate instead of making up something on the fly. Last of all you must imbue your magic into the form as you incant, this becomes the constructs life force. Watch me.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Gold was a great conductor of magical powers and held it well. The purer the gold, the better. That was why this wire was almost pure gold, to make it easy to create things such as this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom earth you were born, by fire you were purged and by water were you formed. You who wears the age of time cut by the wind, take upon you my power to be your inner fire. Spring forth to do my bidding creatures of soil and know the freedom of the air! Be my eyes in the sky and fly on wings of your own creation!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe twenty butterflies jumped into life, beating their wings and hovering in the air awaiting my command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo. Spread out. Seek the children.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a flurry as sunlight glittered off all the gold in the sky before the area was suddenly clear again. Both Lilia and the priestess looked at me unsure for a moment and did what I had done. Lilia was better at it then Keeper Ur because that was part of her training at the academy, but the priestess did a respectable job. Both of them stuttered a bit as they uttered their incantation but in the end Keeper Ur\u2019s two birds were circling around her and three of Lilia\u2019s four were doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow give them simple commands to follow. They won\u2019t understand anything too complicated. But since you linked them to you with your blood, they will know who you speak of without naming names. Just picture them in your head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the end they simply gave the same commands I had and the birds shot off without a seconds hesitation. Lilia lifted the lone origami crane she hadn\u2019t been able to bring to life with a sad look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt didn\u2019t come to life because your power isn\u2019t strong enough yet. It takes skill to master and the stronger you get the more you can control. Three is your limit right now. But I can still make use of it. Having that will save me some time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand and she handed it over slowly as I gave her a small smile. I asked the priestess to put one or two drops of her blood on it before she healed her finger up, getting the required liquid. With that done I smeared a bit of my own on it as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCreature of the four elements of fire, earth, water and wind. Formed by the hand of man head my call to arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I stuck a finger in my mouth and ran the saliva over the beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI give you the gift of speech that you may relay the information I wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTouching the paper to my eyes for a second before breathing on it I continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI give you sight so you may know me and breath life into you so you may have a voice with which to use the gift of speech. Awaken now creature of the elements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird jerked its head to the side as it fluttered its wings, sitting on my palm awaiting my orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is your command master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can touch the other search constructs yes? Through the link of blood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Then tell me when they are found. If I am not nearby tell either one who\u2019s blood is linked with them. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird flew up a moment before settling on top of my head looking out at everybody who was watching in surprise. Even the Holy Mother who had been quiet through it all seemed impressed. With a quick thought I healed my finger, the other two having already done so. There was a moment of awkward silence before the Holy Mother invited me inside the gates. I graciously accepted, having nothing better to do while we waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThough people referred to this area as the cloister, it really wasn\u2019t anything like the sparse living conditions of monks in a monastery. It was more like a small town walled off from the rest of the city. Spanning fifteen miles all told, it had apartment houses you might find anywhere else along with its own stores selling clothes and food. This was simply a sort of haven for the devoted who wished to be kept away from the foul language outside or any other number of constant \u201cevils of man\u201d as they called them. Entry and exit into this area was closely monitored, a fact I silently disapproved of. Children born inside these walls rarely got to leave them until they were almost sixteen and even then it was usually under heavy supervision. Some grew up, got married and died without ever leaving these walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis wasn\u2019t the only place such cloisters existed either. They could be found in just about any major city. The Holy Mother or Father made their home in whatever cloister they wished and could move to another one whenever they wished as well. The last Holy Parent had lived in Mavill and the one before that Bodicum. Though most of the people living in these cloisters trained to be priests wilding the divine healing powers, not all of them were. Some were just regular citizens who wanted to get away from the outside world. Or those who were just this far away from being called zealots. I just couldn\u2019t understand the concept of giving up all material possessions and being provided everything by the cloister. I knew the basics of their history, the  basic rules they lived by and the teachings, but overall their religion was a complete mystery to me. One I was fine with not learning more about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you said anyone can learn how to make these simple constructs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Holy Mother. As long as they follow the guidelines and meet the requirements.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I have a feeling there will be a surge of people learning this new skill. If for nothing else then to have a pet they don\u2019t need to feed, bath, or clean up after. It will be useful in the future as well, to have such eyes in the sky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked around the sprawling little community as people bowed respectfully to the Holy Mother and she asked me a few questions about constructed magic. Sometimes she would stop to stare up at the sky with her head tilted before beginning to laugh at something only she heard. One time Lilia also looked up at the sky at the same time, both her and the Holy mother just standing in the middle of the street while people walked around them as if there was nothing unusual about it. They both broke out smiling at the same time sharing a look between them before moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about ten minutes of the three of them showing me the sights and telling me a bit about how they lived the bird on my head broke into the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTarget\u2019s found master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere are they now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u201cNorth by north-west of your current position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDescribe the area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLots of buildings. A road. A bridge. Green trees behind them. Flickers of magic between them and the trees.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey are by the shield next to the Whispering Woods. That\u2019s the only forest I can think of in that direction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere are they headed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird looked over at priestess Ur and cocked it\u2019s head to the side as if thinking. I knew it was simply watching through one of the scouts to give information. I held up my hand, keeping her from asking the question again or getting impatient. This was still a simple construct and couldn\u2019t process complicated things or multiple things at once outside the bounds of it\u2019s programming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeaded in your direction. Approximate time until meeting seven minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRecall all scouts from the sky. Leave only one to follow them and inform if situation changes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes master.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough all but one of my butterflies had returned to us. The origami cranes bursting into flames and crumbling since their mission was completed. My butterflies also all turned into melted gold which I caught and hardened into a large nugget for reuse later. Lilia seemed sad her cranes had died until I reminded her they had never been alive to begin with. They had simply moved with magic and that magic had broken them once the job was done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter almost ten minutes the five initiates came through the gates only to be met by the four of us. Their faces fell a bit along with the vadivin flowers in their hands as they tried to explain why they had snuck out. Keeper Ur started to give them a lecture but the Holy Mother stopped her, smiling at the children and saying they had only tried to do something nice and no harm had come to them so she should drop it. Their faces lit up at those words as the bird on my head crumbled to ash and the last butterfly also became a nugget in my pocket. With a small bow I headed out the gates, my assistance no longer needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnd so ends the day for young Riktal. Was it the best day? Or perhaps you consider it the worst one? Maybe in the end it was neither good nor bad, it simply was. Who can say for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t Well actually you can if you come again. With the ability tomake different choices while reliving this day you can judge for yourself what kind of day this was. That is, if you are interested. The choice of course, is yours.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But it had more to do with the fact that she was so much different than everyone else. Her very strangeness made her less alien and more easy to deal with. After all, I dealt with a lot of strange and eccentric people on a fairly regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply let my mind continue to wander as I stalked the streets. I had a bit of an uneasy feeling in my stomach because of the choices I had made today. No, not exactly an uneasy feeling, more like I had missed something important. As if something about this whole day wasn\u2019t quite right. Even though I couldn\u2019t put my finger on it exactly and I had no basis for such a belief, still that thought nagged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took almost an hour to find the place where it sat on a side road slightly off the beaten track. The sign over the door proclaiming its name as Heart-to-Arts was slightly weathered and chipped. Under the words was a picture of a stylized heart with an arrow pointing at a weapon. A visual name for those who either couldn\u2019t read or didn\u2019t know the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA tinkling bell went off over my head as I stepped inside the slightly cool room. Around me was the comforting sight of many artifacts on display. Having grown up using weapons and trinkets from the time I could crawl, they didn\u2019t scare me or make me anxious. They were one of the few things I could understand completely. They had no minds of their own and didn\u2019t act outside the bounds of their design. They didn\u2019t talk back or do anything nonsensical. They would never betray you either, it was the hand that wielded them that did the betrayal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFrom out of the back room came a slightly balding man around forty, perhaps slightly older. He had the hint of a paunch in his belly and some excess fat along his arms, proof that he was no fighter. His hair and eyes were both a light brown that matched his lightly sunburned skin, making the white teeth he showed me stand out even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWelcome sir! How may I help you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was wondering if you are able to renew the magic in a level three artifact trinket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching up under my sleeve as I talked I unhooked the brass band around my right bicep, pulling it into view to slide across the countertop. With expert and practiced ease he began inspecting it, using high definition magnifying glasses, scales, even examining it with his own magical power. While he was examining the armband the bell chimed again, letting in a pretty young woman around my age who was also wearing the school uniform. She was slender, with an almost childish face made more prominent by the small nose and big brown eyes. She was also well endowed, making her look somehow slightly disproportionate in my eyes. Her long black locks seemed to shine slightly as she turned her head to look at me. With a nod of my head in her direction she smiled, showing white teeth against her pale peach skin. It took me a moment but I vaguely remembered seeing her in my class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shopkeeper leaned back, setting his tools down with a sigh. The girl didn\u2019t even hesitate to go behind the counter and into the room the owner had come out of earlier. So I had to surmise she worked here after school. The shopkeeper sucked on his lower lip a moment before turning his gaze on me and shaking his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I can do it. I\u2019ve got my certification if you want proof that I can work on level three stuff. The problem is I don\u2019t have the proper equipment for something so well crafted. In all honesty this is almost level four work. I can get the craftsman\u2019s guild to send over what I need but that would be a bit of an extra expense I\u2019d tack on to the final amount. I\u2019m not so big a business that I can offer such things free of charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow much would I be looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt a guess? Around forty thousand Reul. That\u2019s not counting if I have to patch up the matrix inside or replace some of the components. That is including labor costs of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was a bit steep for my wallet right now. I had about fifteen thousand between what I had saved up and what was in my pocket. I really didn\u2019t want to ask my parents for any money, then I would feel like I owed them a debt. I could borrow it from someone else, I did know a few who would loan it to me. I could even do a bit of gambling to make up that amount, or go out monster slaying and hope for some decent drops I could sell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could answer him though there was a muffled scream as the back door burst open and the girl came out with her head covered by a slime. I could see her holding her breath through the green gelatin body even as her hands burst into flames, punching at the monster. Her attacks didn\u2019t do much good though, since her fire wasn\u2019t hot enough to burn the liquid creature. As she continued to struggle and the shopkeeper tried hitting it with fists of fire as well, I calmly took the few steps needed to stand by her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith two fingers I touched the monster, causing the body to harden. From the original point of contact cracks began to zoom around the outer shell seconds before the body turned white and the air became noticeably colder. Within two seconds the entire body was encased in ice and I gave it a hard rap, shattering the monster into pieces and letting the little bit of liquid still around her face fall to the floor. She gave a gasp of fresh air as the creature began to dissipate, leaving behind a vial of slime oil. While I was picking up the vial the shopkeeper wrapped his big arms around the girl in a protective way. I realized then that the girl was his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for saving my little girl sir Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCall me Riktal. I\u2019m not an official Hunter yet. Or if you insist call me Mr. Zelkov. But that\u2019s my father\u2019s name and I honestly prefer being called Riktal instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged, putting the slime oil on the counter for him to take. I had no use for it and I knew such an item was useful in making artifacts, even if it didn\u2019t sell for more than three or four Reul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s my job. Besides, it wouldn\u2019t do to let another Hunter in training die to such a low level creature. It would tarnish my good name. Word of advice though, if your fire isn\u2019t enough to overcome a water based creature, simply freeze it. It doesn\u2019t take much, simply use wind magic to create an absolute vacuumed around what you want to freeze. Just like in deep space the lack of air will solidify water as long as you apply enough pressure. Or you can boil it all away simply by not applying as much pressure while in that vacuum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shopkeeper hugged his daughter again before asking her what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was opening some of the crates in the back to put the stuff away when it suddenly popped out of one of them and latched onto my face. Before I knew it my head was engulfed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe shopkeeper gave me some more thanks which I waved away. I was a bit uncomfortable being thanked for doing my job. There had been nothing special or noteworthy about what I had done after all. Especially since slimes were barely considered a threat, being only an E class mob. He even offered to renew my trinket for a vastly reduced cost as thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. You need to make a living as well. I shouldn\u2019t be given such treatment for doing what I trained to do. Though I would like you to renew it for me. I can get you fifteen thousand Reul by the end of the day if that will be enough of a down payment to get the tools you need. I\u2019ll pay you the rest after the job is done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook the hand he extended to me as the girl picked up the trinket on the counter out of curiosity. She gave it a quick once over just like her father had, using fingers and magic as well as a few of the tools before her eyes went wide in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is a level three band of Treasure Seeking isn\u2019t it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yes it\u2019s a level three band of Treasure Seeking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe set the trinket down before heading off into the back room again, presumably to unpack more crates. Her father watched her go with a slightly worried look on his face before looking over at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJudging by your uniform you go to the same school as her. Would you mind keeping an eye on her for me.? She\u2019s a good kid, and smart too. It\u2019s just, sometimes she gets a bit too focused on things and flustered easily over little stuff. I\u2019d feel safer knowing someone is watching out for her if she gets in trouble. I don\u2019t want to be one of the parents that has to bury their child within five years of her graduating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why let her become a Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause that\u2019s what she wanted. Isn\u2019t it a parent\u2019s duty to support their children? Even if that means they will be putting themselves in danger? Hunter\u2019s are heroes. And I am proud that she is willing to risk her life as she is, even if I am afraid for her as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned towards the door but didn\u2019t start walking yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s her name? She\u2019s actually in my class but I didn\u2019t catch it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKiki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKiki huh? I\u2019ll remember that. Just don\u2019t go ordering any headstones anytime soon you hear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my hand in farewell as I walked out the door back into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seems traveler that our time has come to an end for now.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it served him well and he was a great Monster Hunter because of it. It\u2019s just\u2026 well, he wasn\u2019t much of what you would call a people person.  He cared about them in his own way, he just didn\u2019t know how to talk and interact with them without being rude and abrupt most times. Now run along, I\u2019ve wasted enough of your time with my ramblings. Besides I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to be around an old woman like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I walked away I couldn\u2019t help but feel I had somehow been played. I couldn\u2019t put my finger on why though. I had been the one to ask the question and she had answered just like she promised. But I felt as if I had asked the wrong question. Or didn\u2019t word it the right way. Scratching my thatch of red hair in frustration I let out a small growl before heading off to the classroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 Hunter\u2019s have acted autonomously since the year 0035, when the Hunter\u2019s of that day banded together, clearing out two thousand miles of land in three days where the city of Malandis Dae now stands. They formed the Union, also known as the Association at the end of the third day, realizing that governments would try to use them in power plays if they swore allegiance to any one nation. Until that moment they had not realized the full potential and power that they held.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher gave me a nod as I closed the door quietly, heading for my seat in the back while he returned his attention to the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere was a lot of contention in those days as nations banded together to stop what they saw as a revolt by their citizens. They thought us their property if we were born within their lands. There was a great bloody war, that what we call the First Uprising. It lasted from 0037 to 0045, and within that time monsters ran rampant in cities and towns without Hunter\u2019s to protect them. The council at the time let it happen, using the death the monsters were causing as a bargaining chip against the nations they fought against. This caused much contention within the ranks of the Hunter\u2019s, who still believed in the prime directive of our calling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThose Hunter\u2019s split off from the main group, continuing to act autonomously, but also continuing to protect the citizens regardless of what nation they were from. These offshoots became known as Ronin, and not given support by the Union. Yet they banded together in their own little Union, watching each other\u2019s backs and supporting each other in times of need. It is from the actions of these Ronin that the Hunter\u2019s fourth rule was created. This war suddenly became a three way vie for dominance with no side wanting to budge. That is until two Ronen, children not even completely Hunter\u2019s yet at barely fourteen years old, decided to step up and do something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat back and listened as the teacher taught the rest of the class about Nesta Highwill and her future husband Gint Jervin and the  ten year journey they went on to negotiate peace treaties and stop the fighting. A journey that some say was a quest given by The One God himself. I had read about it at least fifty times in the books at home, but there was something about hearing it told like this that made it feel different. Perhaps it was the way the teacher told the story, or perhaps because this was the first time I had heard it told aloud. Before I knew it, the class was over and the bell was ringing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, Are you really a Zelkov?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked up at the two girls and two boys standing around my desk. I had seen them coming and knew this would happen sooner or later, it was why I hadn\u2019t given my name right off the bat. The jockeying to be recognized, the vying for attention, would now begin. Each of them were first or second generation Hunter\u2019s. Perhaps a third and maybe even a rare forth, but for the most part they were still considered new blood. They didn\u2019t have connections or reputation or any of that. But if they could say they were associated with an old family like mine, they could get such things in an instant. Doors would open and governments would bow to them on that fact alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I am. What of it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is so cool! Then you must be like super strong and like really good at all this stuff!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the girl who was twirling a bit of her short cropped dull brown hair around a finger in an attempt to flirt. It didn\u2019t even move me at all, though I did think she was attractive enough, the blatant way she was pushing herself on me made it more disgusting than alluring. I kept my face a stone mask, making sure my disinterest got through loud and clear before dismissing her as unimportant while I answered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her take a small step back as if uncertain how to proceed and kept from smiling to myself. Idiots the lot of them if they though such crude flattery would get them anywhere with me. The blond next to her stepped forward with a slightly haughty grin, as if she was mocking the first girls failure. There was some sort of rivalry going on their that I didn\u2019t understand. Perhaps I never would since I was a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I think Riki tiki is an adorable nickname! Do you mind if I call you that too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInstantly the knife was out of the sheath at my side and in my left hand, the tip inches from her throat. I looked up at her with narrowed eyes and gritted teeth as she took a step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo one gets to call me that except my sister. If I hear you uttering it again I will cut your tongue out of your mouth. That goes for anyone else who wants to call me that. Am I clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she nodded her head up and down quickly I returned the knife to it\u2019s resting place, my eyes never leaving hers. What she saw there must have unnerved her because she turned and walked away quickly, returning to her seat. The brown haired girl grinned at her retreat from the battlefield but soon followed suite after having the same stare leveled on her. As soon as the two girls were gone, the boys came closer, lowering their voices after looking around surreptitiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Riktal, can I call you Riktal? Who\u2019s your favorite? Oh I\u2019m Bith and this is Wilith by the way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBith was as plain as day, brown hair, brown eyes, tanned skin, but no real distinguishing features. The kind of face you could forget soon after meeting him. Wilith on the other hand stood out because he was one of the few black skinned people in the room. With eyes a shade of green that seemed to almost glow. That topped with the fuzz of yellow hair on his head made him stand out like a sore thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour favorite. You know. Of the girls? You\u2019ve got to have made a few judgments on them by now.  After all we have quite a few lookers. Like Lilia and Liz Hawthrope. They are in the top five but well Liz is Liz and Lilia is a bit weird. The top slot right now is Kiki Valenca.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe pointed to where a long black haired girl with a large rack was giggling with some other girls by the door. Indeed she was quite pretty, with her slender figure and a small nose that accentuated the childish cast to her face. But I also knew how deceiving such looks could be. I had met and knew a lot of good looking women and all of them either had baggage or a personality that was as rotten as they were beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s got it all, looks, a sweet personality, brains, brawn, and money. Though she doesn\u2019t really throw that fact around. She\u2019s the daughter of a weapons merchant so she has a real eye for artifacts and some monster drops as well. So, you got your eye on anyone? I can give you all their stats if you want.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not like we try to sneak peeks at them while they are undressing or anything. Well ok so maybe I did try that a few times back in middle school, but hasn\u2019t everybody? It\u2019s just a bit of harmless fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBesides I know the girls grade us the same way even if they won\u2019t admit it. I bet you will quickly rank up there at the top.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWilith and Bith gave each other a conspiratorial grin as I looked away shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill not interested. I don\u2019t have time for such childish things. I\u2019d rather not be thought a part of your gang or whatever you want to call it. I\u2019m not here to make friends, this is nothing more than a prison sentence for me. I just want to do my time and get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe grins fell from their faces as the bell rang, giving me a look over their shoulders as they returned to their seats along with everyone else. As the teacher began his lesson I let my eyes rove around the room, noting the ones who were interested and the ones who took the class too lightly. Mentally I began marking off the ones I thought would be dead before they were twenty three. Putting them in categories of who I thought would drop out by the time the year was over, who would die in a training accident by graduation and who would end up maimed or badly hurt. The outlook didn\u2019t seem favorable for many of them right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy eyes fell on the girl named Kiki who was paying attention and taking notes. I was interested in her, but not for the reasons those two had thought. Her name sounded familiar but I would have to ask her to make sure. I juggled with the idea of holding off until I got more information before approaching her so as not to create misunderstandings in the class but decided the direct approach was the best. So what if they talked or misunderstood, I didn\u2019t care what they thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling the end of class rather quickly as I only half paid attention to what was being taught, my mind wandering from one thing to another instead. I gathered up my bag and headed out the door after the Kiki girl, intent on getting answers before I lost sight of her. I was surprised at how swiftly she moved, she was at her locker within moments of leaving the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard your name is Kiki Valenca. Are you related to the Valenca that runs the Hearts-to-Arts shop on the south side of town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned around after closing her locker to give me an offhand shrug, slipping her bag onto one shoulder as she did so. Her eyes gave me a quick once over, not assessing me as potential lover material, but the knowing eyes of someone who has seen Hunter\u2019s up close all her life. Assessing my strength, my wealth and my skill with the look of a business man, or woman in this case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, he\u2019s my father. Why do you want to know Riktal Zelkov?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow good is he at renewing complicated artifact magic? I\u2019m talking level three or higher type stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell he got certified last year but he hasn\u2019t actually done many. Most Hunter\u2019s take such things to a bigger city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I know. All the dealers I know of can only handle up to level two. Do you mind showing me the way? I know it\u2018s here on the south side but that\u2019s about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind, I help out after school so I was going there now anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of us walked out the doors side by side, turning right once outside the gates while talking for a bit about artifacts. Well she did most of the talking, getting excited over the how\u2019s and whys of the craft. I knew enough to make some crude basic artifacts but that was about it. Making complex artifacts took years of study that I just wasn\u2019t interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind me asking, what kind of artifact do you want refreshed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA level three armband of Treasure Seeking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lifted the sleeve of my tunic to show her the band clasped around my right bicep. It was old and weathered, showing it\u2019s age. The silver rune engravings along the outside of the brass ring were slightly turning color at the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo way! I\u2019ve only heard about these things! They are the ones that increase the drop chances of really rare items from monsters if you get the killing blow right? And the highest level is four where you can actually control when you make it work, almost guaranteeing high end items.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I found it stored away in one of the boxes up in the attic. I think it belonged to my grandfather but I\u2019m not sure. Now though, this one is out of juice. It has maybe one or two more good uses out of it before the magic is all depleted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2026 can I touch it? I\u2019ve only seen a handful of level three trinket artifacts but nothing like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slid my finger down the small metal band, breaking the seal holding it together before handing it over to her. She scrutinized it as she walked, holding it at every angle she could think of. She even closed her eyes and ran her fingers over it using a blind mans sight. Finally she handed it back to me shaking her head in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such craftsmanship. I can\u2019t even tell where the seams are to get inside or even where the heart crystal might be. I\u2019m sure daddy will be just as delighted. Though honestly I don\u2019t know if he can. Like I said, even though he has his certificate he doesn\u2019t work on them much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMeh it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. I\u2019ve been meaning to come find this place anyway, I just never got around to it because it\u2019s so far out of the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe returned to talking about different artifacts again, filling the silence as she led me to the store. Once inside she introduced me to her father who was pleased to see me. Part of that was probably because I was a Zelkov, the other part was because I was potential business. And when a Hunter came to do business that meant money, sometimes lots of it. I might be the only customer he had all day, but the money I might bring in could cover costs for the month depending on the circumstances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I told him what I wanted, laying the armband on the counter in front of me. His eyes went wide in surprise just as his daughter\u2019s had but then I saw him go into business man mode. He began pulling out all sorts of tools of the trade from magnifying glasses to small screwdrivers, to precision needles and scales. He even ran his fingers over it with his eyes closed the same way Kiki had. I even saw him cover the trinket in a light orange glow, using his magic to assess it as well. Finally he set the things down while leaning back with a sigh, shaking his head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I can do what you want. The problem is I don\u2019t have the kind of tools I would need here at the shop. I\u2019ve never worked on something so old, and honestly the old stuff is put together better than the newer models. This is master grade craftsmanship and I\u2019ve never touched something so well crafted before, it\u2018s almost level four work. But I\u2019m one hundred percent confident that it would be just within my range of skill. I could borrow the things I need from the craft halls for a fee and they would be here within a few days, but that would have to be added on to any deal we made. I\u2019m not so rich a business that I can offer such services free of charge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo then how much am I looking at roughly?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt a guess? Around thirty five thousand Reul. That\u2019s assuming I don\u2019t need to create a new matrix or replace something once I crack it open. If nothing goes wrong I can have it done within a week and a half.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that with or without labor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWith of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI chewed on my lower lip as I thought about it. Thirty five was a bit rich even for me. I had some saved up that I had tucked away by scraping off the edges of my living allowance. To make up the rest I would have to go do a bit of gambling or borrow it. I could always go out monster slaying and sell the drops, but without the luck from the trinket I wasn\u2019t assured of getting anything for my troubles. Monster drops were never one hundred percent, there was always the chance I would get a string of bad luck where I got nothing at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally I pulled my wallet out of the pouch hanging at my side and slid five thousand Reul across the countertop, emptying out my on hand cash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is all I have on me right now, will that be enough to send for the supplies you need? I will be back in later today or tomorrow with another ten thousand. You can consider that a down payment for any unforeseen expenses and I\u2019ll pay the rest once it is finished. Is that agreeable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMore than agreeable sir Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal. Call me Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grinned at me as we shook hands over the counter, his fingers hard and calloused from his work. I left him to his devices, seeing Kiki jumping up and down excitedly exclaiming something I couldn\u2019t make out through the closed door. Now how was I going to get the rest of that money? I could use my savings to gamble and make it all, trading risk for reward. Though in my cast I didn\u2019t think it would be much of a risk. Or I could go see Pelei. He was one of the few people I knew who had the money and wouldn\u2019t have much problems loaning it to me without complicated stipulations attached.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With a grin I collected the five thousand Reul pot, bringing my total to forty thousand and some change over my starting amount. I glanced at the clock, making sure they all saw me doing so before bowing out from the table. They tried to get me to stay so they could win back some money but I had made sure to overtly watch the time so they didn\u2019t assume I had swindled them and was now running. Packing up my bills, they all gave me a good natured wave of farewell as I left the secret room in the back of a shabby restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI would have never actually found this place after leaving Hearts-to-Arts if I hadn\u2019t paid a street imp to give me directions. But with a ten thousand Reul starting purse they had been more than happy to let a stranger in on their games, thinking it would be easy to take it. I had lost five thousand on purpose as I let them \u201cteach\u201d me the game of Tops and Tiles. A game I had long ago learned how to play from my sister when she taught me the basics of gambling. But once they felt comfortable in the easy money I began to shark them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI played it off as beginners luck, giving them a wide eyed surprised attitude as I hesitantly laid out my hand as if I didn\u2019t think it would win. Like any gambler\u2019s game, Tops and Tiles was a game of lies and misdirection. You needed skill, but you could always replace skill if you were good enough. They hadn\u2019t even noticed me palming extra tiles to create the big money hands, while losing a little bit here and there to throw them off the fact that I was cheating. In short, I had swindled them good, and they didn\u2019t even know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ambled along until I came to a men\u2019s clothing store, entering at a leisurely pace. The store clerk didn\u2019t even bat an eyelash as I walked past him into the back room to change out of the baggy blue shirt and ripped jean pants. Hurriedly I donned the school attire of brown leather pants and tunic, stuffing the rest of the gear inside the duffle bag I had also left here. Once done I left the back room again, dropping the clothes off with the clerk along with a thousand Reul, both of which disappeared from sight within seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI only took two steps though before he whistled at me, pointing at his head when I turned around. I grinned sheepishly, pulling the straight black haired wig off my head and tossing it his way before moving on. It wouldn\u2019t do to have the crooks realizing they had been playing against a Hunter. It would ruin our image. But the truth was, we weren\u2019t as pure as regular citizens thought us to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick look at the sky told me it was roughly five o\u2019clock. The artifact shop should still be open. I could drop off the rest of my down payment and then deposit what remained in my account before the bank closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are we going to do? We can\u2019t let it just stay back there, I don\u2019t have enough skill to get rid of it and we don\u2019t really have the money for an exterminator.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard Kiki\u2019s voice from the other side of the closed door behind the counter as I walked in, the bell announcing my presence. Both of them came out almost instantly, offering me smiles of welcome before I even took two steps. Mr. Valencia took my money, putting it away for safe keeping even as I looked between both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProblem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo problems at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom what I heard when I walked in it didn\u2019t sound like no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing really. When I opened one of the crates I had ordered a few weeks ago I found we had an uninvited guest as well. It\u2019s just a slime though so it\u2019s no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt is a big deal daddy! If we don\u2019t do something, it will corrode the artifacts back there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with pleading eyes as she clasped her hands in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you take care of it for us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it\u2019s a slime you should be able to handle it by now. It\u2019s only an E class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t. My fire isn\u2019t strong enough to burn it away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that the only magic you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course not, I can handle all four of the basic elements. But I\u2019m not able to make my flames hot enough to counter the jelly body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave a shrug the as I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then there you go, you\u2019ve got enough skill. I heard you are at the top of the class, so use that brain of yours and think. Each of the four basic elements have a secondary name describing their main purpose. Tell me what they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEarth is also called the defense element, it\u2019s properties are mainly used to strengthen. Fire is the attack element, because of it\u2019s destructive nature. Water is also considered the regenerative element because of its fluid shape. And wind is the supportive element.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy is it the supportive?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause it augments the other elements and their base natures. Making fire stronger turning water into an attack ability and backs up earth. While at the same time being able to stand on its own. It is the most versatile of all the elements followed by water. But I can\u2019t combine two elements yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what is a slime made of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWater mostly. Or at least some sort of liquid close enough to water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then there you go, use wind on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I rubbed my eyes while giving my head a small shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I have to spell it out for you. Though you need to start thinking if you ever plan on making it as a Hunter. If you really want to get ahead and stand out, don\u2019t wait for someone to tell you all the answers, figure them out yourself. Enclose the slime in a ball of wind and then pull it away, leaving no air at all inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes lit up suddenly as she finally understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCreate a vacuum like in deep space! That will freeze the liquid turning the monster into nothing but a block of ice! Then I could just whack it with a solid blow and destroy it. I don\u2018t need to use powerful spells then, just use it\u2018s own nature against it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBingo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithout a word she ran through the door into the back room as her father grinned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe really is pretty smart you know. Though sometimes she gets these moments where she can\u2019t see past the nose on her face. Just like her mother in that respect. Would you mind watching out for her and helping her out if she needs it? She\u2019s a good girl and I don\u2019t want to be one of the parents going to their child\u2019s funeral within the first few years of them becoming licensed Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why did you foot the money to send her to the academy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause that\u2019s what she wanted. Isn\u2019t it a parent\u2019s duty to help their children pursue their dreams?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot if you\u2019re a Zelkov I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat was that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head and told him my mumbled words were nothing just as a cold wind blew out of the back room and the sound of cracking ice filled the air. I gave the shopkeeper a wave farewell before heading back out the door. The more I interacted with other people and normal families, the more I wished I hadn\u2019t been born a Zelkov. I could only dream of my parents being even one thousandth of a fraction interested in me and not themselves or their jobs. For all that I hated them and thought them little more than strangers, some programmed gene in my body still made me love them, even if that feeling wasn\u2019t returned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShaking off such thoughts as I hitched my bag more snugly onto my back I headed for the center of town to deposit the rest of my winnings. It did no good to dwell on such thoughts and would only make me uselessly angry at them without either one even being around to vent it on. Best to simply ignore it and forget about it, hopefully I would eventually forget about them and the lonelyness as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAre you satisfied with the outcome? With the choices you made? Do you wonder at where the road would have taken you if you had made different choices? It is only natural after all. Humans are such creatures that must always wonder at that question of what if and maybe. Your regret is the very essence of this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut unlike in your real life, I give you the power to relive this day, to make different choices so you can see what else the future held for young Riktal. Or perhaps I should say holds? Since all this has both happened and has not yet been realized. Perhaps it never shall be realized. Now that is a question is it not? If you never observe a timeline, does that mean it does not exist even though it is all within the possibilities? If you redo this day over making different choices, then what of this day? Will it also not exist or become only a potential again even though it has been observed once? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTruly it is a question that must be pondered and an answer sought. Until next time traveler.</span></div></div>",

That\u2019s not to say I didn\u2019t know who the kingpins of the four corners were, but the criminals I would be gambling with weren\u2019t affiliated with old one-eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInstead I headed off deeper into the south side, mentally preparing myself for dealing with Pelei. He wasn\u2019t a bad guy or anything, I just couldn\u2019t quite handle him like I could most other people. I took the turn to the left when I came to it, following the road into the residential area and the winding path which eventually brought me to the small fenced in yard. Well small compared to the acres of land we owned. The house had an old style feudal feel to it with sliding doors and ornate trimming. It almost looked more like a temple of some sort than a house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPelei said he had modeled it after the histories of his homeland, even putting a small pond off to the side with a bamboo contraption under a manmade waterfall that was supposed to keep time. Pushing through the gate I felt the small current as the shields identified me as a non monster. Then one last deep breath before I rang the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a quick pattering of feet before the door flew open and a tall angular body was suddenly wrapping its long arms around my neck. I felt his lips against my cheeks and heard the smacking sounds before he held me at arms length with a grin. Even though he only stood at six foot, his thin figure made him look taller. Today he was sporting a baggy pink shirt and pants that melded together to almost look like a dress. Both ears were covered in studded earrings, making them almost look silver. He wore three necklaces that dangled from side to side as he shook even as he bounced up and down in excitement. The black makeup he wore around his almond shaped eyes made them look larger than they actually were in an already angular face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh if it isn\u2019t little Riktal! I was so surprised when I looked through the spell to see who was coming to see me only to find you at my doorstep! It has been too long darling! You\u2019re almost a stranger anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave me a look up and down before shaking his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat terrible, terrible fashion sense you have today darling! It simply won\u2019t do! Come!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDespite his appearance he was quite strong. I found myself being dragged along after him as he grabbed me by one hand. I had learned how futile it was to try and resist when he got like this. Even if I dug in my heels he would still drag me inch over inch. I had spent many a visit here going all out against him. Sometimes I won, sometimes I didn\u2019t. In the end I found it best to just let him get this urge of his out of his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeading me to the back of the house I found myself in one of his dressing rooms. It was more like a small clothing store tucked away in this single room, with racks and racks of clothes of all shapes and sizes all over the place. I knew through the door at the side of the room would be another just like this one only filled with female clothes instead of male. After yanking my duffle bag off my back and throwing it to the floor with a small tsking sound he tried pulling my shirt off. With a hard shove I pushed him away shaking my head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnough Pelei, I can dress and undress myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis face fell for a moment as he wiped nonexistent tears from his eyes with a sniff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut Riktal, the struggling is part of the fun! The feeling of ripping off such ugly things and dressing them up again in something beautiful! The feel of silky smoothness under the fingers! There is nothing like it I tell you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe let out a soft moan as he hugged himself and wiggled back and forth, a look of bliss on his face. With a sigh I left him to his delusions before going over to the nearest rack and picking out a soft suede black shirt. Even as I began stripping off my tunic he was falling to the floor rolling around with a bit of drool coming out of his mouth. After putting on the new shirt I kicked him in the side lightly to make him snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey! Pelei! I\u2019ve changed, are you happy now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked up at me from the floor, his eyes wild as he began to pant heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe pants! Oh the pants too! Yes! You must match! Give me your pants!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDream on. The shirt goes well enough with the brown trousers so snap out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe reached up, grabbing a hold of my belt to try and yank them off. I gave him a swift kick in the face for his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTry that again and you lose your fingers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took him a few moments to get himself under control enough to heal his bloody nose. His fingers still twitched like they wanted to rip my pants off but he held himself back. Once his urges didn\u2019t have the best of him he returned to a more normal demeanor. Well normal for him anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what can I do for you Riktal darling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI need to borrow some money. About forty thousand to be exact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly told him why, saying the extra was just in case expenses came out to be a bit more than planned. With a grin he pulled up his banking information on a magical spell, transferring the money over into my account without a word. He waved away my thanks, like it was bad air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re good for it darling. And I know I\u2019ll get it back. I take it you want to keep this on the down low so your parents don\u2019t find out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDone and done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around the room for a moment at all the clothes. It still boggled my mind how he could have such a fetish. I saw his hand reaching up to grab my belt and slapped it away, making him pout like I little kid as he nursed it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Pelei, out of curiosity, did my father come by asking you to take a job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean the little girl? Yeah I took it if that\u2019s what you want to know. She was just too adorable! I couldn\u2019t pass her up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous now with a nice pink dress with some to-die-for lace on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI meant physically and mentally, not fashion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh well come see for yourself. She\u2019s like a doll, but otherwise there is nothing wrong with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe led me into the next room, the one that looked like the ladies version of the last one. Asala sat in front of a mirror with curlers in her hair, holding her teddy bear like I had last seen her. Pelei took one look at her and shook his head, walking over and pulling her clothes off without any hesitation. She stood there almost naked as he rummaged among the racks, pulling out an off white dress which he shoved onto her frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes that looks much better. It works well with her hair don\u2019t you think? Though don\u2019t try taking the bear from her, a monster gets summoned if you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he began to hum while putting makeup on her from the case in front of the mirror. I could tell she had retreated even farther into herself than before and I sadly shook my head. I gave it two days at the most before her body gave out and she died of starvation or thirst. But she had made her choice, I wasn\u2019t going to force something she didn\u2019t want on her. So I said goodbye to Pelei who waved me off absently, consumed in his new project. I stopped in the first room only long enough to gather my tunic and bag before heading back out into the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was safely away I let out a sigh of relief. That had gone better then some visits with him and worse than others. But my mission had been a success. Now to find an ATM and pull some of that money out to complete the rest of my down payment and I could go back home. Home to the perpetual silence. Home to a house that had never sheltered a real family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAre you satisfied with the outcome? With the choices you made? Do you wonder at where the road would have taken you if you had made different choices? It is only natural after all. Humans are such creatures that must always wonder at that question of what if and maybe. Your regret is the very essence of this question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut unlike in your real life, I give you the power to relive this day, to make different choices so you can see what else the future held for young Riktal. Or perhaps I should say holds? Since all this has both happened and has not yet been realized. Perhaps it never shall be realized. Now that is a question is it not? If you never observe a timeline, does that mean it does not exist even though it is all within the possibilities? If you redo this day over making different choices, then what of this day? Will it also not exist or become only a potential again even though it has been observed once? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTruly it is a question that must be pondered and an answer sought. Until next time traveler.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cPish I\u2019ve been running this since middle school, I\u2019ve learned how not to get caught. I just look at it as practice for when I become an advisor for some countries government as an Association spy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHunter\u2019s are autonomous remember? We don\u2019t spy on governments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah right! You can tell me the truth. Even regular citizens know the conspiracy theories and guess at what goes on behind those doors.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd that\u2019s all they are, theories and guesses. Baseless words people come up with because they don\u2019t actually know and think it is more glamorous than it is. And if it were the truth, you would do well to keep it to yourself and not spread it around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang then as everyone scurried back to their seats. Bith giving me a wink before turning away and Wilith shooting me a thumbs up. I simply shook my head at the absurdity of it all. I didn\u2019t have time for such childish things. Though that Kiki girl did interest me. Now that I thought about it, wasn\u2019t Valencia the name of the guy who owned the chain of stores called Hearts-to-Arts? I\u2019d never actually been to the one here in Efinbis since it was out of the way on the south side, but perhaps I should check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMonster Tactics went by pretty quickly, the bell ringing for the end of school going off before I knew it. I thought about introducing myself to Kiki and finding out if she was in fact related to that Valencia or not. In the end though I decided against it. It would be better to check the place out and carefully plan how to approach her. If I went about it the wrong way there would be misunderstandings, not only on her side but also from the whole class. I would rather avoid unnecessary trouble if I could help it, I didn\u2019t want to end up in some bad TV sitcom moment after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I walked out the doors I saw three boys making cat calls and suggestive gestures to Lilia who seemed to be in a dreamy eyed world of her own. When none of their whistling or motions seemed to have any effect they gathered around her like a flock of vultures. I saw her cock her head to the side before a bubble of white light expanded outwards, sending the three boys flying. Two of them smashed into the wall running around the outside of the school and third went through the gate to come crashing down on the sidewalk outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the blue haired bully who had landed on the sidewalk had fallen wrong, snapping his wrist without breaking the skin. Though the bulge showed where the bone was broken at. Even as he began to yell in pain she walked over and laid her hands on him, healing his wounds before giving him a pat on the head like he was a pet and walking off. I grinned as I followed along behind, shaking my head at the boy who was picking him self up and blushing a brilliant shade of red. It didn\u2019t take long to catch up with her, since she seemed to be wandering a bit aimlessly. Stopping to sniff at a flower or to watch a shaft of sunlight or follow some invisible butterfly only she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou handled yourself well back there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBack where?\u201d She got a slightly puzzled look as she glanced over at me with her head tilted to the side. Suddenly dawning entered her gaze at what I meant. \u201cOh! You mean the boys! Yes well It happens from time to time. I\u2019m not sure why they do that though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s because they like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs they should. We are all His creatures and should all be liked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you being serious or are you messing with me here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy? Do I not look like I am serious? If I don\u2019t that\u2019s a problem. I need to make it clear when I am joking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply shook my head letting the matter drop. I guess having a direct line to The One God himself just made her think differently about such things. People mistook that otherworldly vision of hers as her being weird. When we began heading into the north side of town she cocked her head at me, speaking as if we hadn\u2019t just spent the last ten minutes walking in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you not live on the west side? Why are you following me? Do you have business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. Just didn\u2019t feel like going home. I usually roam the town most days anyway. So I thought I would walk you back to the cloisters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain she returned to her own little world. Taking my words at face value and not thinking there was anything deeper. There really wasn\u2019t, but most people would think there was. It was almost like she had only asked the question to fulfill the conventions of human interactions and politeness more than wanting to know the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust as we came in view of the cloisters where the priests and priestesses lived, a gaggle of boys and girls around fourteen or so ran up to meet Lilia, circling around her excitedly. They each sported the double black bands around the cuffs of their white robes that signified they were initiates in training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Lilia! We\u2019re going to go get some vadivin flowers for the Holy Mother! You want to come?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know, doesn\u2019t she usually get them herself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah but it\u2019s a surprise! She\u2019s really busy right now and the old ones have begun to wilt. Boris knows where there is a whole field of them out in the Whispering Woods.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you shouldn\u2019t go. The Holy Mother told us not to go outside the shield without her approval.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh come on Lilia! The Whispering Woods are right outside the shields. The only monsters inside it anymore are Snaal\u2019s and even we can beat them off. Rumor is, the city council is planning on expanding the perimeter to encompass the woods because of how safe they are. They are just waiting for the seniors at the academies to graduate so they have enough Hunter\u2019s to power the spell. Weren\u2019t you just saying you wanted to help the Holy Mother out the other day because you thought she looked tired?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia nibbled on her lower lip for a moment before finally nodding her head and saying she\u2019d go. The five younger initiates all cheered and grinned at each other while Lilia turned and looked my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you are doing nothing do you want to go too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you get a message from Him saying to ask me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a puzzled look, cocking her head to the side as if wondering if I was joking or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. He doesn\u2019t tell me everything. That\u2019s not his way. He only lets me know some things, the rest he leaves up to me to decide. It\u2019s not like I have no free will you know. But you had said you usually roam the town so that means you don\u2018t have anything to do. I simply thought you might like to come to fill your time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI thought about it for a moment before shaking my head and declining the offer. The initiates where right, the Whispering Woods were almost completely safe. The last time anything higher than an E class monster showed up there had been almost two years ago. One side of it was already butted up against the shields, so extending the spell to encompass that four miles of territory wouldn\u2019t be that difficult. I mainly didn\u2019t want to go with them because I knew they would chatter on about things I had no interest in, and would most likely try to convert me. I knew The One God existed like everybody else, and I knew some of the teachings. But the whole devout believer thing just wasn\u2019t for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll keep this a secret won\u2019t you Mr. Hunter? We really aren\u2019t supposed to go outside the shield and we will get in big trouble if the Keepers find out. Promise you won\u2019t tell please?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not like I talk to the Holy Mother or the Keepers or even any priests and priestesses on a regular basis. I don\u2019t plan on sticking around anyway, I do plan on getting something to eat though and then going home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you so much Mr. Hunter!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave the pink haired girl a small smile before heading off deeper into the north side to find a restaurant. Looking over my shoulder I saw Lilia give me a wave of farewell before heading back the way we had come with the five initiates. Honestly I felt a bit awkward promising such a thing. I had been taught never to make promises if I could help it, because sometimes they could come back to bite you. If my promise were to ever conflict with the first rule of Hunter\u2019s to protect people, I would end up doing harm no matter what. Keeping the promise might endanger the people, breaking the promise would bring the credibility of my word into question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut as I had already said, in this instance I didn\u2019t have much to worry about. The woods were safe, and I wasn\u2019t one of the religious devotees so I had no business at the cloisters or hanging around any of the priests. The only time I dealt with them was on monster hunts and the few festivals the city held every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe diner I ate at was nice enough I guess. I didn\u2019t remember seeing it the last time I found myself in this part of the city, so it must be new. It featured a small outdoor eating area which allowed me to watch the people going past, but the prices were slightly steep for the quality of the fare. Still I tipped them well and left, heading back towards the center of town at a sedate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I came up on the cloisters again I saw a woman seeming to just be loitering around on the sidewalk waiting. But I knew this wasn\u2019t just any woman. She wore the pure white robes of a priestess, but unlike the rest she also sported a small cape embroidered to look like white wings. She also wore a wreath of flowers on her head, the tips of the petals slightly brittle looking but still pristine white. If these signs of office were not enough, the almost visible aura of power she was sheathed in would have given it away as she looked around with the same dreamy eyed gaze as Lilia. Even though I had never met her before I knew who she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh Riktal! How are you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI am doing well Holy Mother. What brings you outside of the cloisters today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me puzzled, as if I had just asked if she believed The One God was real. After asking the question I realized the answer. It was the same reason she knew my name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy waiting for you of course. He told me you would come.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what would He want with me Holy Mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cActually I am not quite sure. He simply said you could answer my questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what would those be if I might ask.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHave you seen some initiates? Keeper Ur has been searching for them for around thirty minutes now but they are nowhere to be found on the grounds. She can be a bit of a worry wart, but she came to me with a sense of unease about her five charges. There are three girls and two boys, all of them around thirteen and fourteen.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Though it pains my heart that one of His children has gone astray, unable to tell me the truth even when it is obvious that is His desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry ma\u2019am but I don\u2019t talk to him like you do. If it really is His desire that I tell you then he can tell me directly. Or better yet, He can tell you directly if He really wants you to know so badly. Otherwise I must believe that it is simply your free will talking trying to guilt me into speaking. You are still human for all that you are his mouthpiece and not above such sweet talking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you insinuating that I would do such a thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer face took on a look of surprise, as if the thought had never crossed her mind. I actually believed it hadn\u2019t, but that didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t suspicious of such actions having dealt with them before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot at all Holy Mother. I truly believe you are as holy as you look. But that doesn\u2019t mean I have not dealt with priests and priestesses before who were not above such trickery. You may call me paranoid if you wish, but any Hunter looking to live past the age of twenty three has to be. Good day to you ma\u2019am, I\u2019m sorry I could not help you out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left then, heading off towards the center of town again with every intention of going straight home. But when I came in sight of the Whispering Woods next to the road across one of the bridges out of town I changed my mind. I really didn\u2019t think anything would happen to them, but if God had directed the Holy Mother herself to wait on the sidewalk for me to come back past, I had better keep an eye on them just to be on the safe side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce inside the woods I made a few constructed beasts out of the gold wiring in my duffle bag and a bit of magic. These golems were only useful as scouts, looking like little hummingbirds so would not be noted unless one looked closely. I sent them out searching for the party before making another slightly more complex construct of the same type. This one I left perched on my shoulder so it could relay mental images to me from the four lesser minions. I wasn\u2019t good enough yet to make such constructs speak verbally into my mind, but pictures were universal even if language wasn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy magic birds soon found and led me to the field where the six were cheerfully picking flowers and romping around, acting like birds that had been let out of their cages for a little bit. They chased each other around and made garlands to wear on their heads. I heard snatches of a story Lilia was telling the younger children from where I was hiding in the tree line. I sent my little birds to scout out the area around the meadow and to relay any signs of trouble while I remained hidden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wouldn\u2019t spoil their fun, and coming out into the open after having declined their offer previously might make them think something was wrong. If there was something big mean and scary out here, I would make sure it didn\u2019t even come in sight of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about five minutes of leaning against the tree in the shadows, one of my eyes in the sky relayed an image through the construct on my shoulder. At first I didn\u2019t see what was wrong, just a quiet stretch of woods devoid of any wildlife with dead leaves littering the ground along with some fallen branches. Then I saw one of the branches rise and fall ever so slightly. More like a mirage than anything definite, but the construct had noted it first so I knew it wasn\u2019t my inner eye playing tricks. Judging by the position of the sun it was almost directly north from my position across the field and heading directly towards Lilia and the other\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly monsters of the worm family would be able to burrow underground and leave that unique ripple pattern. If it was coming from the north then it was one of thee subclasses, all three of them were D class or lower. Picking up a bit of speed, I skirted the edge of the open area and headed towards the spot in question, letting the mental image guide me. I didn\u2019t get far past the field though when I finally found it, the ripple more pronounced now that I saw it with my real eyes. Judging by the size of the ripple the beast was two feet underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDigging into my bag I picked over the small selection of swords at my disposal. I needed something sharp enough to slice through the tough skin of a Wurmling, the highest of the three subclasses. Until I found out otherwise I would assume this was the strongest of the three heading my way. I found one that was almost perfect for my needs, it didn\u2019t have the length I needed, but the edge was almost paper thin, allowing it to cut through almost anything if used right. What\u2019s more, though it was straight along the length, it curved at the very tip, ensuring it wouldn\u2019t catch in bones or cartilage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding right in the middle of the oncoming wave I shoved the blade into the ground up to the hilt. That was only a foot and a half to the target but that was fine, it was the essence of the blade I needed. Pouring my power through my hand and into the hilt I forged a blade of pure purple power extending down another three feet with all the same properties as the base blade. Grabbing the handle in both hands I waited until the ripple was inches from the hilt before yanking back with one hand and pushing forward with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was met by resistance at first and then it slid through easily as the momentum began to pick up. The four and a half foot blade popped out of the ground, leaving a thin scar in the dirt as evidence of it\u2019s passage. The ground heaved up slightly as it contained the explosion of the body below before settling down again. Letting the blade return to normal I put it back in my duffle bag before returning to the meadow to continue my vigil from the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was another ten minutes before they left, their arms and little baskets full of the vadivin flowers. I followed behind silently, watching their backs while my birds scouted ahead and to the sides. But aside from that one monster nothing else came even close to them. That worm had probably been on the move for weeks, since they didn\u2019t live in these woods naturally. Just a freak coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waited at the edge of the woods until they were out of sight on their way back to the conclave before leaving myself and finally heading home. I had been able to keep my promise and protect the innocent at the same time. This time at least. I needed to be more careful with my words from now on, because there was no guarantee I could always do both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuch interesting choices. And such an interesting end to the day. Where else could you have ended up. Or should I say where else could you have taken Riktal? Are you proud of the day you have had? The choices you have made? Are you wondering that ever insidious question of \u201cwhat if?\u201d Come again travel if you wish and I shall grant upon you the power of choice once again. Through my powers I shall reset this day, allowing you to answer that burning question. And I shall continue to observe, seeking the answer to my own questions as I study you humans with great fascination. Until then traveler.</span></div></div>",

They just went to the Whispering woods to pick vadivin flowers as a surprise for you. They said you were busy and they noticed your other ones were wilting. Even though it\u2019s just outside the shield, it\u2019s tamed land.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh dear. Those children shouldn\u2019t have. Even if those woods are safe, I won\u2019t be able to use those flowers. They need to be picked at the right time for the spell to work. Thank you for telling me child. I\u2019m sure it was a difficult decision for you to make. But I really must send someone to go pick them up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy? Let them have a bit of fun. It\u2019s not healthy to be cooped up behind these walls all the time. I\u2019ve always believed that. I might not be one of you priests, or a diehard devotee, or even know and understand all your rules. But I do know keeping them cooped up like that is little more than being in a prison cell for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut the world outside is dangerous! They aren\u2019t ready to handle it yet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe world outside will always be dangerous. Keeping them from experiencing it isn\u2019t going to make them more prepared. If anything it will make them less prepared. Unless you are aiming to make them cling to The One God and their faith out of fear of the outside world and not out of true belief. Then keeping them imprisoned behind the walls of the cloisters will do that job nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is not my intent at all! Do you think I would really do such a thing? Or that is what He desires?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m just telling you as I see it Holy Mother. Not to be too rude but though I do not think that is your intent, or the intent of The One God, that is what you are doing. You may be the Holy Mother but I\u2019m not one of your acolytes. I respect what you say and I am a bit in awe of you for being able to talk to Him directly, but you are still human. Not all the Holy Mothers and Holy Father\u2019s that came before you were able to talk directly to him. Humans are greedy people who seek power. Priests and priestesses are not exempt from this desire. Power through fear or power through faith, in the end it is still power. If you are simply following rules passed down by the previous Holy Parents, then you cannot say what there intentions were in making those rules with one hundred percent confidence. But if such a decree was passed down to you directly by God himself, that is a different matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head tilted to the side as she stared at me thoughtfully. Her brow furrowing in contemplation as she silently stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour words have some merit and ring of the truth. Indeed such rules were passed down by the previous Holy Parents. I must contemplate upon this and seek His guidance. Perhaps you are right and it is time for some changes. Though I am still worried about my flock. I fear something might happen to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould not God have told you if that were the case?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, he rarely tells us the answers directly, he only guides and advices. He gave us free will, he would not take it away so easily. That is why I needed to stand out here. I was worried and he advised me to do so, saying I might be able to get the answers I seek from you. But He left the asking and the persuading up to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I slipped my duffle bag off my back, dropping it to the ground and pulling out my coil of gold wire along with a short sword and shield. After a moment of thought I also pulled out my Roller Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell you what, if it makes you feel better I will go guard them in case anything shows up. I don\u2019t think it will and I have a feeling neither do you. It will take me a while to find them but I will send a guardian to watch over them until I get there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly if you can promise they won\u2019t get in too much trouble when they get back. I\u2019m sure they will be in for a small scolding or two for running off, but such actions are a risk reward deal. Even if I don\u2019t agree with all your rules, in the end they are still your rules and the ones they must abide by. They shouldn\u2019t be punished harshly for trying to do a good deed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can easily grant that request child. For I am in agreement with you on that point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod I began cutting long strips of gold, creating a magical nexus network from the sword and shield to the gem inset into the Knuckles where the heart crystal was. This would be a jury rigged artifact construct and nothing like any half respected artesian could create, but it didn\u2019t have to be pretty, just functional. The Holy Mother watched on in fascination as I finished bending the wires and connecting them all together. While I began the incantation of creation I pulled out my belt knife, cutting my finger open to sprinkle blood on the items laying on the ground and imbuing them all with a good portion of my magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBorn of the heart of a monster and constructed of the weapons of war. Infused with the power of life by my inner fire. Be given shape and form by the rocks of the ground and bound by my will. Let the wind be your home as well as the earth. And let my blood be your core, binding you to my service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I slathered the blade with my life fluid, flinging it into the middle of the small whirlwind that was standing the weapons up and giving it a vaguely man sized outline complete with limbs. The dagger floated in the air as the cement below us began flowing upwards building the golem from the ground up, making the windy outline more solid until a construct as tall as I was stood before me. He wore my gloves on his hands, or more accurately my gloves were his hands. The shield sat on his left arm while the sword was gripped in his right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bind you to my service with a name. You are Innouso the warrior of blades.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe construct knelt in front of me, putting his shielded arm across his knee while bowing his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is your desire master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo. Fly. Seek out Lilia and the five initiates. Watch over and protect them but do not be seen. If there is danger take care of it before it gets to them. If it is already upon them, do not let them come to harm. Understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you command master, I will obey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt stood up then, two small whirlwinds appearing on it\u2019s back as it leapt into the air and flew off towards the Whispering Woods. Once Innouso was gone I dropped to my knees panting. Such a complicated constructed magic was almost too much for me. I had barely learned how to create such a creature four months ago. It didn\u2019t hold a candle to a true master of the art, but it was more than my parents could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Holy Mother knelt next to me, gently taking my cut finger and healing it with but a touch. She then laid her hand on my head moments before I felt some energy returning to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI sense that magic was almost beyond you Hunter Zelkov. But I am impressed nevertheless. I have never seen a golem made before, though I have seen the finished products.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever stop learning and trying to surpass yourself. That\u2019s the Zelkov motto. Now if you will excuse me I must go after it. I did say I would after all. Don\u2019t worry, I will make sure they come back safe and sound.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I got to my feet and gave her a small bow before picking up my bag and heading off towards the woods at a jog. I simply followed the link I had with my construct through the forest, navigating the landscape with ease. It didn\u2019t take long to come to the edge of the field where the six were playing around and gathering flowers happily. I sent my construct to the other side of the meadow to stand watch while I leaned against the tree in the shadows on this side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey finally left after about fifteen minutes without even the hint of a monster poking it\u2019s nose into the air. But still I tailed them while my golem took point. Only after they were safely back in the cloister walls did I finally recall my golem and break down the magic, returning it to the weapons it was made of and returning the earth to the ground. With a final sigh I turned to head home, catching sight of Lilia half turning her head to wink at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen again, that might have been my imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuch interesting choices. And such an interesting end to the day. Where else could you have ended up. Or should I say where else could you have taken Riktal? Are you proud of the day you have had? The choices you have made?

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWith a sigh I told her what I knew. Yes I was breaking my promise to those children, but I really couldn\u2019t lie to the Holy Mother herself. That was akin to lying to The One God\u2019s face. She was his spokesperson and vessel on this earth for a reason. Like Lilia she had him whispering in her ear all the time. But unlike Lilia she was also the leader of the god\u2019s religion. I didn\u2019t want to make an enemy of her. If I did, she could deny me healing from her priests or any number of other things. Not that she was likely too, since the religion was all about helping people, but she still had that power. Her word was law among the believers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up into the sky a moment after letting out a small exclamation of surprise at my news. She nodded her head slightly with a smile on her face before returning her gaze to mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe thanks you child for the difficult choice you made. He knows your heart was uneasy making such a promise to begin with but you have held up well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf He already knows what\u2019s going on then why doesn\u2019t he just tell you personally. You have his ear, or he has yours, however you want to look at it. Why even bother with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe doe not work like that. He can advise and guide but rarely does he straight out tell. He has given us all free will to do with as we wish, if he told us everything he would take that free will away. Even I can ignore and go against that which he tells me if I so desire. But I have found the folly of such actions when he does give me information. Only rarely does he spell everything out for us, or commands us to action.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019ve heard that before but I never understood why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause each choice is a trial. A test that he has laid before us in a grand scheme that even I cannot comprehend. Only He has the capacity to know. I thank you Riktal Zelkov for the information you gave me. If you will excuse me I must go find some priests to go retrieve them. Their thoughtfulness is sweet, but I will not be able to use the flowers they will bring back. The timing is all wrong. I must also speak with Keeper Ur to not come down too hard on them. Yes they broke the rules, but it was for a kind cause. And those woods are not all that dangerous to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShaking my head slightly I continued down the road as she went back through the gates surrounding the cloisters. In only a few minutes I came upon the bridge that lead out of the city to the north, seeing the edges of the woods in question just outside the shield. Almost of their own accord my feet veered over the bridge and down the road, taking me into the tree line before I fully realized what I was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNothing would go wrong, these woods were safe after all. But there was also no harm in double checking on their safety. Even the Holy Mother didn\u2019t seem too concerned. I mean wouldn\u2019t The One God himself give her a heads up if something was going to go wrong? And that Keeper Ur\u2019s uneasiness could just be regular worry. Still, if they ended up needing a Hunter for whatever reason, I could be there. I wasn\u2019t sure how good Lilia was yet, but I had a feeling her combat skill wasn\u2019t as strong as her skill in healing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI would never find them if I simply wandered around aimlessly though, so I quickly made a few birds out of gold wire. Imbuing them with my magic I sent my new temporary constructs on a scouting mission. Within a few moments one of them came flying back to lead me to an open meadow with bushes of the white flowers all around. It\u2019s job done the construct destroyed itself, the gold wire melting while in mid flight to rain bits of gold down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbsently I caught the falling liquid by making a bowl of wind. The little pieces all merged together before hardening again, allowing me to pocket the small nugget. Gold was still precious after all and being able to save even a little bit could come in handy later. The other three constructs I had made would have already melted from the sky since the four had been linked, their gold returned to the earth it had come from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeaning against a tree I watched the group from the shadows, unwilling to announce my presence if I didn\u2019t need to. If I were to show up they would think something was wrong, or want me to partake in their merriment. But this kind of thing wasn\u2019t for me. I might believe in their religion, but I didn\u2019t practice it the way they did. If I were to go out there it would be like trying to put a square peg in a round hole, I just wouldn\u2019t fit in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbout fifteen minutes later two priests came into the clearing, handing out some admonishments before saying they were leaving. Looking a bit downcast the five initiates followed the two adults. Lilia seemed to have brushed their words off, that is if she even heard them to begin with. She followed too, but with that small smile and dreamy gaze that seemed to be her normal. Just as I was turning to leave I saw the ground out in the field surge upwards slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I watched, the head of a Sanderling poked up, looking left and right as if seeking something. After a moment it dropped its head back underground and kept moving. I saw the small ripple of disturbed ground as it headed off towards the group that had just left. With a sigh I slipped the duffle bag off my back and pulled out my Lexington before walking towards the slow moving ripple at a sedate pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two activate. Phantom shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I twisted the upper barrel off the gun I reattached it onto the main barrel like a silencer. Standing in the path of the slow moving ripple I pointed the two foot long muzzle at the ground and waited. As soon as the ripple was underneath me I fired, using the extra force from the magic to counteract the barrier of rock and stone between us.  Even as I flicked my wrist, making the muzzle I had attached flip back up into position over top the main weapon, the ground heaved upwards like a depth charge going off. Slipping the weapon into my belt I left the meadow to follow the group back into the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAn interesting end to the day. But tell me, what are your thoughts on all the possibilities that now no longer exist because of this timeline? Oh it is true that this day, while it has happened has also not yet happened and may never happen. But because you observed it, does that make this timeline more real than all the others? More valid? Does it deny the possibilities of all the other timelines, making them all false or fake? Can you really say this is the true and real timeline simply because you observed it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat then would happen if you observe this day again, only making different choices and creating a different ending? Would that too be considered truth? How then would there be two endings to the same day that are both truth? Is their any day that could be considered canon? That is, the one timeline that is widely recognized as the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf on multiple timelines he fell in love with Liz, or Lilia, or even the little girl, ending up marrying them. Which of those timelines would be the canon truth that would be accepted? All of them? None of them? Or does it simply come down to the one which you observed first? These are interesting questions that I hope you will help me answer by returning again to watch this day unfold. An outside perspective such as yours would be most beneficial, since I fear I am too close to the subject matter at hand. Being able to see all the possibilities of every second at once as I can. Until then traveler.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s your decision to go sneaking off, that has to come with risks. If I promised not to say anything where would the risk be?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRaising my hand I waved at all of them before heading deeper into the north side. I was getting a bit hungry so I might as well get something to eat before heading home. Lilia returned my wave with a head bob before her and the other five headed off the way we had come. Personally I thought it was a good thing the initiates were going against the teachings. Both because they would never grow without breaking the rules and because I thought the rules of the cloisters were a bit harsh and stifling to begin with. They shouldn\u2019t feel like prisoners, only let out when the wardens deemed it necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI found myself sitting outside at a small diner that looked new. I didn\u2019t remember seeing it the last time I had come to the north side at least. The food was good, but not worth the price they asked in my opinion. I tipped generously anyway before heading back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I passed the cloister entrance again I saw a woman in a pure white gown, sporting a cape that seemed to be made out of feathers and wearing a wreath of snow white flowers on her head. I noted the flowers had a slightly withered look to them, a bit shriveled at the tips of the petals but otherwise unblemished. She was standing out on the sidewalk looking around with the same dreamy eyed stare as Lilia sported. Even though I had never met her I knew who this was. Even if I hadn\u2019t known what that cape of office represented, the almost visible aura of power that sheathed her body from head to toe would have told me this was someone important. This was the Holy Mother herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou boy, your name is Riktal right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even question how she knew my name or why she happened to be standing out here. She had a direct line to The One God just like Lilia did. I was as sure as the sun rose in the morning that she had been directed and told by the god himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHave you seen some initiates around lately? Keeper Ur has been looking for them but has been unable to find them for the last thirty minutes.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They must be picked on the night of a full moon to make the spell keeping them from wilting for six months work. I\u2019ll have to send someone to go collect them before they get into trouble. It\u2019s dangerous outside the shields you know. Even in a safe place like those woods. Thank you for telling me young man and may His wisdom and light guide your path.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she turned, gliding more than walking back through the gates around the cloister. Shaking my head I continued walking. Today had been a strange day indeed. It wasn\u2019t every day one got to talk to the Holy Mother herself. Or meet not one but two people who truly had The One God talking in their ear sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I passed one of the bridges heading off to the left my eyes were drawn to the lush green forest just across the bridge and off to the side of the road. I hoped those kids wouldn\u2019t get in too much trouble when they got back. I had only taken a few steps passed that point when something made me stop and look at the woods again. It was just my paranoia talking. My overactive mind that expected the worst case scenario in everything.

The prime directive of a Hunter was to keep people safe. If someone got hurt because I walked instead of ran I would be failing in that directive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had no clue where to find them, there was four miles of forest to search through after all. That didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t find them. I just needed to take a little bit of time. Slipping the bag off my back I reached into one of the side pockets until I found the fine gold wire I had coiled there.  I stood there in the middle of the woods cutting strips of wire the length of my  palm. Four should be enough for what I wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCarefully I twisted the bits of metal, shaping them into the very basic shapes of small birds. More a suggestion of wings against an ovoid blob, but it met the requirements of constructed magic. Pulling out my knife I cut open my thumb, slathering my blood on the gold wire while shoving my magic into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh gods above and below. You who control the soil from which the gold was born. The fire from which it was forged, the water in which it was cooled grant life to this your lifeless vessel for but a short moment. That it might show unto me that which I seek. Grant this to me oh gods who dwell above and below.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe head section of the gold birds lifted up from where they rested on my palm twitching from side to side. With a jerk I tossed them all into the air where they hovered around my head for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe darted off into the woods, veering to the cardinal directions while I slipped the duffel bag back on my back and started running again. Barely a minute later one of the birds zipped back, circling above my head before zooming off back the way it had come. I followed, coming upon an open meadow filled with white flowers just as one of the young girls let out a scream of terror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA Sanderling burst out of the ground under the feet of one of the boy\u2019s throwing him through the air. His hard scales grated against the leg of the second boy who had been standing right next to him. I saw the flesh get rubbed off on the small scales and begin bleeding profusely even as Lilia sent an arrow of light in it\u2019s direction. The giant worm beast fell backwards for just a second before squirming around to right itself again. But Lilia had taken that time to step in front of the five initiates, throwing a bubble barrier around their little group while the girls worked on healing the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my right hand drop to my waist  as I ran, pulling the dagger back out of it\u2019s sheath just as the monster attacked the shield. It took only another second to get in throwing range. Once I was though I stopped and flipped the knife, holding it by the tip only long enough to chuck it at the monster with a sideways flick. The blade sunk into the hard skin only a few inches but that was all I needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEssence of fire, super compressed by wind. Make the arm a conduit and the fingers the barrel. Up out of the core and shoot like a bullet. The lightning shot from my extended two fingers, making a beeline for the knife stuck in the monsters flesh. I felt the vibrations of my body as I was shocked by some of the feedback but I kept pouring in the magic down that connection between us until the Sanderling exploded into little chunks that dissipated into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little bird I had made of wire melted while in mid flight, it\u2019s job done. Little droplets of gold raining from the sky to be absorbed into the ground. Making my way over to the little group I tried hard not to clutch at my chest and the slightly erratic way my heart was pounding. I hadn\u2019t quite mastered lightning yet, it being a slightly higher tier of fire a normal Combat Hunter like me didn\u2019t really have an aptitude for. A full blown caster type Hunter would have no problems with it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you guys all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah we\u2019re fine. Thanks for saving us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia finished healing the skinned leg of the one boy as I smiled at the girl who had thanked me with a small bow. She stood up and held out her hand to me expectantly. I simply raised my eyebrow as if to ask what she wanted. With a sigh she grabbed my left arm and yanked it into view, cradling it in both hands while she cast her healing onto my blackened fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t you want me to heal your fingers? And why would you use a magic you haven\u2019t mastered yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSave your healing for someone who needs it more. This is nothing, my own ability can take care of it tonight. As to why I used it, well it was just the first thing I thought of that would bridge the distance the fastest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet your heart is skipping erratically too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithout even waiting for me to say anything she planted her hand on my chest and sent her power in to even out my heartbeat so I didn\u2019t have a mini heart attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it best if we all go back, the Holy Mother is looking for all of you so you had best be prepared for some punishment. I\u2019m sure she will be grateful though to find out you are all safe. Don\u2019t worry too much, I don\u2019t think even she thought anything would happen by the way she acted when I talked to her earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe five initiates all agreed a bit dejectedly, but followed me and Lilia out of the open meadow anyway. One of the girls, the one that had thanked me for saving them, handed me one of the vadivin flowers with a smile and a blush. I smiled back before sticking the flower into my hair over my ear which seemed to make her even happier. We were just leaving the forest when two priest came running up slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey started to scold the children but I caught their eyes over all the heads, giving it a small shake that made them shut up. After a bit of explaining they thanked me for my help and took charge of the children. I was about to head on home when something made me decide to walk with them. I probably wouldn\u2019t be allowed in the cloisters, and they would still get a lecture, but they didn\u2019t need these two scolding them all the way home as well. Maybe I was being a bit meddlesome in the politics of their religion, but they still deserved a little leeway and freedom. As our little group walked back to the cloisters I had to wonder what else might happen today. Or tomorrow for that matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOh what a tangled web we weave. Is that not what one of your great writers once said? Indeed, life truly is a tangled web. Normally you only live one life, go down one path at each choice you make and so do not see the different possibilities of where you might have ended up. But through this window you have the power to see what alterations a simple choice can make in someone\u2019s life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt is interesting to see is it not? The farther back one goes the more the differences are sometimes pronounced. Of course this does not take into account the choices that other people make, only the choices you as Riktal were able to control. Still, this is an interesting experiment of mine, as I get to see just what kind of human you are. I find each one of you humans that I have given this power to is different. You each make different choices for different reasons. Sometimes even the same choice for different reasons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhy, there was one guy who made choices based solely on the desire to create his own harem. With the thought that if he did this or that, the girl or girls would fall in love with him. He was quite an interesting fellow, though his lusts did not bear fruit in the end. Whatever happened to the person he had been controlling? Oh yes he died horrible over and over. But I digress, such reminiscing bears no spot in my mind. Some of my one\u2019s and zeroe\u2019s must be crossed. Come again traveler, take up the mantle of god and continue to see what else this day holds.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tParanoia or not I should still investigate. If nothing was wrong all well and good. But if something were to happen and I wasn\u2019t there to stop it or lend a hand when I could have been I would be a failure as a Hunter.  There was no need to run though. I didn\u2019t know where in the woods they were and running around wildly would just tire me out without getting me any closer. I needed to come at this logically, solving the problem with an efficient use of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlipping my duffel off my back I scrounged around in one of the side pockets until I found the gold wire I kept in there. Gold was a great conductor for magic, plus it was pliable. This wire was almost one hundred percent gold, ideal for what I had in mind. I thought about making birds, but instead decided to make miniature Furies. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to have some talking eyes in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo after cutting four strips about as long as the length of my elbow to the tip of my fingers I began to twist and bend the gold into four vaguely humanoid shapes with wings. By the time I was done I had the skeletons of four Furies a little smaller than my palm laying on the ground. A quick nick of my finger with my belt knife and a few drops of blood over top of each of them and I was ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom earth you are born to create the base. The skeleton that upholds the body. Bring forth the rocks, the soil, the clay to become that body. Use my fire as your sustaining force and let the wind be your home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile I chanted the spell I let my magic flow into each bit of gold. To sustain the form I desired. The earth melted, letting the gold sink inside. There was a second of stillness before four mounds of earth bulged up where the wire had been. The ground broke open like cracked eggs to release small half human half bird forms. Furies, an offshoot of Harpies, though with razor sharp claws that could cut anything like a knife. Even if they were only slightly larger than the palm of my hand they were still dangerous constructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFly. Report to me immediately. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. Squawk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe four Furies shoved off, creating great gouges in the ground as their claws sliced through hard stone and dirt. Soon they were out of sight, heading in the four cardinal directions as I packed up my things and returned my bag to my back. Once secured I began walking again, though my searching was rather aimless. The Furies were linked to each other, able to communicate amongst themselves across great distances but not with me. This made them ideal search constructs, able to scour a large area in little time without crossing into one another\u2019s territory or searching an already looked at spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was only a few minutes of wandering when one of my Furies came streaking out of nowhere to hover in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDanger! Folow! Follow! Squawk!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Fury went pelting off away from the direction it had come and I chased after. While I ran I gave the Fury the order to attack and defend to pass along to the others. Otherwise they would simply hover in the air doing nothing with no other orders after they found their target. That was the downfall of such simple temporary constructed magic\u2019s. They couldn\u2019t take complicated orders or adapt to a situation like the a human or a more complicated construct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t The Fury lead me to a meadow with white vadivan flowers growing from bushes all around. A Sanderling was rampaging around the meadow while the other three Furies attacked it from the air. The Fury I had followed flew to assist it\u2019s comrades. Lilia was trying to lure it away from the initiates, the two boys were down, one bleeding from his leg, the other looked like he was just unconscious. There was one girl trying to heal the bloody leg, the other two were nowhere to be seen. No, that wasn\u2019t true. There at the edge of the meadow, the blood streak on the tree telling the tale of how she had been flung into it and slid down where she was now laying unmoving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe other girl was by her side trying desperately to heal her with her limited ability. Even as I dropped the bag to one shoulder and shoved my hand inside the giant worm smacked Lilia with the end of it\u2019s tail, sending her flying as well. She was able to cushion her landing by encasing herself in her white yellow light so she didn\u2019t end up smacking her head into a tree as well. I didn\u2019t let it get any farther as it began to slither towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuries! Attach!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe constructs dive bombed from the air, grabbing onto the monster\u2019s hard flesh and cutting deep gouges in it just like they had the rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFuries! Explode!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll four released the magic holding them together making a smokescreen that threw the monster backwards with a roar. Even as I pulled out my Lexington I could see the great holes the explosions had left in the creatures sides. As I leveled the weapon and pulled the trigger I sent even more of my power to coat the bullet, sending the projectile speeding forward with a green and purple outer shell, the two colors spinning in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bullet hit the unmarred underbelly, the skin refusing to yield for a moment before finally giving way, the twin aura\u2019s coating the slug expanded outward on impact, ripping the beast apart and sending chunks of it flying in all directions. Even as those chunks were falling from the sky along with strips of flesh it all turned into white particles that floated away into nothingness. Shoving the weapon into my belt I assessed the area for any more threats. There was the hole in the ground the monster must have come from, but nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia was already running over to work on the girl with the head injury by the time I got closer. They all thanked me and I absently told them it wasn\u2019t a problem while I kept watch around the meadow for any other monsters that might show up. I noticed the two unharmed girls stuck close by me even as Lilia lifted the one she was working on to bring her towards our little group. Setting her down she worked on the boys leg, adding her skill to the healing he was already applying to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think it best if we leave. I know the Holy Mother said she would send someone to come get you, but the less time we spend in this forest right now the better. I doubt there is anything else out there, but I would rather be safe than sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut where did it come from Mr. Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put my hand on the girls head as she got a slightly worried look, trying to pass on my reassurance and confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFarther north most likely. They burrow underground like the worms they look like. Their natural habitat is warmer climates than this normally so that means north. It was probably migrating south out of necessity, such as a scarcity of prey. Since there is little between here and the Shadow Forest where it is normally found, it\u2019s probably been on the move for at least a week. You just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia agreed with my assessment of the situation and seconded my opinion that we should leave. While she picked up the girl again, I scooped up the still unconscious boy before heading back out of the woods. We stayed in a tight pack, the three initiates not wanting to stray far from my side. It took about ten minutes to get back out of the woods but when we did we were met by two priests running down the road out of breath. They offered to take my burden from me but I refused, telling them I would deliver the boy to the cloisters personally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt wasn\u2019t that I thought they wouldn\u2019t take care of him or anything, but I noticed the glares they aimed at the children but were too in control of themselves to say anything with me around. It wasn\u2019t my place to interfere in the religious politics and rules they abided by, but I also didn\u2019t think these children needed to be needlessly scolded when even the Holy Mother hadn\u2019t seemed too concerned. This was just a freak accident, nothing more. If I could shield them from that until they got to the cloisters then I would. Though I was sure they would still be lectured and reprimanded after I left, but I couldn\u2019t help that. At least this gave them time to collect themselves and get ready for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t know what else this day had in store for me, or what repercussions all this might have on my immediate future. But I had a feeling I would be spending more time with Lilia than I originally thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends the day. A day? Another day? With so many possibilities for just a single day, I sometimes get confused as to what to call it. Perhaps I should say so ends another possibility. I find the choices you made interesting. Though I do not quite understand the reasoning behind all of them. Such knowledge yet eludes me. Further observation is required.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou will assist me in that won\u2019t you traveler? You will come again and watch this day unfold over and over? I will of course grant you the power of choice again, so that you might create another possibility. It is only through constant observation can one truly find the answers they desire. Using this days many infinite possibilities as a control will greatly help out. Why jumping from a day like this to a fast action space battle just wouldn\u2019t do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter all, are your choices the next time going to be altered by what you now know? Are your perceptions of events going to be different now that you know a little bit about Liz and Lilia? This I would very much like to find out along with everything else. So come again fair traveler! I am always here and always watching.</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s not safe out there you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned, taking a single step back towards the gate when she suddenly stopped and stared up at the sky. Finally she turned around again to face me shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh you naughty boy you! You know it\u2019s not nice to lie like that. He doesn\u2019t approve of such fibs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a suppressed sigh I told her what little I knew. I should have figured I wouldn\u2019t be able to get away with deflecting like that. Even though I hadn\u2019t promised them I wouldn\u2019t tell, I had also been under no obligation to actually say anything to anyone either. After I was done explaining things to her she shook her head slightly before patting my head like a little child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere there, I forgive you for trying to lie to me. I understand why you did it, but those children shouldn\u2019t have gone. Even if the woods are safe enough, those flowers need to be picked at a specific time of the month for the spells to preserve them for six months to work. I suppose I should send someone after them before they get into too much more trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe again looked up at the sky, as if having a conversation with God. Indeed she probably was. The slight smile that had constantly been on her face suddenly drooped as her fingers lifted to hide her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes dropped to me, losing that dreamy state as the brunt of her power caught mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou must go save them. They will be beset upon by a Sanderling soon. Lilia cannot take that thing on her own yet. Her attack spells aren\u2019t that strong. Two of the initiates will die if you do not go now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer gaze wasn\u2019t pleading, nor was it demanding. But there was an expectation about her as if she had no doubt I would go because The One God had said I had to if the initiates were to be saved. I didn\u2019t even say goodbye, enhancing my legs with the power of wind and strength before dashing off down the sidewalk. I wasn\u2019t going because God had said I needed to go, I was going because it was my job as a Hunter to protect people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDodging in and out of other pedestrians on my way past, I was little more than a blur. I had no way to gauge my speed but I guessed I was going at perhaps forty five or fifty miles an hour. I was wasting a lot of magic to keep up this pace and would be almost empty by the time I found them, but if it was only a Sanderling. I didn\u2019t need magic; my own skill was enough for such a low D class creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithin the space of two minutes I was inside the woods, ducking under and jumping over low hanging branches and ground clutter. I imagined dead leaves and sticks being picked up and pulled in my wake but didn\u2019t bother to look back. I had no clue where to go in this four miles of woods, all I could do was run and search.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt four minutes there was a scream to my right so I veered in that direction, almost slamming into a tree as I made the sharp ninety degree pivot. Sliding my left hand over my shoulder while I ran, I dug into my duffle bag for a weapon, grabbing the first thing I could. My fingers pulled out what looked like the hilt of two daggers joined together. Activating the artifact, twin curved blades sprang out of the simple leather wrapped handles. A war-glaive. Not a bad weapon for a Sanderling at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe trees suddenly parted to reveal a meadow with white flowers all around. Lilia was holding off the Sanderling with a bubble shield while the three female initiates were trying to heal the bleeding legs of the two boys. I knew the shield wouldn\u2019t last much longer, I could already see it flickering. Running past the bubble I brought my war-glaive up in an underhanded strike while shoving off from the ground. My blade sank in, ripping the six foot tall worm creature in half right down the middle just as the shield gave way. It let out a small scream before breaking into little white particles that drifted off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile Lilia bent down and helped heal the two boys I looked at the other three girls, assessing them for any overt signs of damage. I didn\u2019t see anything obvious though. A glance around the field showed me the hole the worm had probably come from, the vibrations of their footsteps above it had probably attracted it\u2019s attention. I had to wonder from just how far away this monster had come, Sanderlings had never been native to these woods to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce the two boys were up and walking again I looked at all of them as they gave me bows and words of thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to make it in time. But now I think it\u2019s time to head back. You had also best be prepared for your punishment since it was the Holy Mother herself who asked me to come save you. Your absence did not go unnoticed. Just be grateful nothing worse happened than some minor injuries.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey all agreed, giving thanks to The One God for watching over them. I didn\u2019t think it would do to tell them what the Holy Mother had said would happen if I hadn\u2019t shown up. It would accomplish nothing except to make them wonder and undermine their faith.  Lilia gave me a small smile of thanks when the others weren\u2019t looking before lapsing into her own little world again. But I did notice the initiates all stayed close to me until two priests came hurrying down the road just as we left the woods and reentered the safety of the shields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was sure they were all safely handed over with yet more thanks from both the priests and the initiates, I turned and headed home, wondering if anything else was going to happen today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInteresting is it not? Choices that range from the simple to the complex alter the outcome to such a degree. Sometimes the correct path is not always the most obvious one. And always are you left to wonder about what could have happened if you had chosen differently. Even a simple play on words can alter the outcome. Afterwards it is easy to see where you went wrong or what you could have done better, but in the heat of the moment such things are not so easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI thank you traveler for helping me answer a bit of the questions I seek. Please come again, replay this day over with new choices so that I might learn even more. Until then traveler, may the choices you make be the ones you desire.</span></div></div>",

They need to learn what you have to teach  so go do it. Besides I\u2019m not a recognized Hunter yet so me helping you would be opening both the school and the union up for a lawsuit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAwwww! Why do you have to be such a downer Riki tiki? No one will say anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t guarantee that. And don\u2019t call me Riki tiki! Now go. You\u2019ve already caused a big enough scene and wasted enough of the classes time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh and a small pout she finally turned around to address the rest of the class. Grabbing a mini lab kit from the back of the room I returned to my seat while she discussed a bit about Alchemy.  By the time the rest of the students began pulling out their own mini labs and stock of ingredients I already had my desk set up. My sister started walking around the room answering questions, pointing out different tricks and tips and telling them exactly when to add an item or when to stir it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply focused on making a translocation potion while they worked on their basic healing ones. In order to make it really worth making though I would need to get it added into an artifact of some sort so it could be used multiple times. Right now it was a one time use item that wouldn\u2019t justify the cost of making it if it was used as is. But I had decided if I was going to somehow help Lilia as she said I was going to, she needed some reliable way of getting me. Being able to make a summoning portal that would either take her to my location or me to hers was the best thing I could think of right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA ring or a necklace, perhaps with a light purple gem inset into it. That would be easy for her to wear while being able to use the artifact at anytime. It would go well with her purplish blue hair and light brown skin. I could make the artifact myself with the materials I had on me, but I was no master. At most she would get two uses out of it, almost as bad as the single use potion it was now. I knew a good artificer that would set it up to work at least six or seven times before it needed refilled. I could get it done tonight and give it to her tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI finished the brew and was just capping it up with wax when the bell rang. I looked up a bit surprised, having lost track of time while focusing on what I was doing. Quickly I put my stuff away along with everyone else as my sister blew me a kiss and left again using a teleportation potion, telling me she would be on a job for a while before she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I picked up the translocation potion I noticed Lilia was one of the last ones still in the room putting her things away. Shouldering my duffle bag I headed for the door but something made me stop and look down at the potion in my hand. I had a feeling I should give it to her now instead of later. I knew that could just be my paranoia talking, I tended to expect the worst all the time and nothing ever really happened to prove it. What would she really need my help for between now and tomorrow? We would be in classes the rest of the day together and then she would most likely go home and be safely ensconced in the divine cloisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had used my stock of supplies in making this and didn't have enough on hand to make another one at the moment. Giving her this one now with the plans of making another one for the artifact was out of the question. The help I was most likely going to be giving her was going to happen in the far future, such divinations and seer seeing rarely showed the immediate future. In fact I couldn\u2019t recall any I had heard right off the top of my head. So yes, the more I thought about it the more likely it was just me making a mountain out of a molehill. Lilia walked past me with a small smile as she headed on her way to Combat class and I closed my fist over the potion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tEven as she was jumping towards me over the heads of the two boys in front of my desk I was tipping backwards onto one leg of the chair. Balancing on that single leg I spun around quickly before falling towards the floor, using the back of my seat as a shield as I kicked it her way. Even as I sent it flying I rolled to the side so when she shoved it back in my direction it hit the floor harmlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I came out of my rolled I did a handstand, spinning quickly towards the left and shooting out my leg as I bent my waist in an arc. My sister caught the blow on her forearms, blocking just in time to keep my shoe from connecting with her face and sending her flying away from me. It took only a second for her to plant a hand on the floor and come spinning to a stop crouched in front of me ready to leap again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiki tiki! Why won\u2019t you let me fill up my tiki tank! And what are you doing here anyways? Why didn\u2019t mother and father take you slaying with them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe leapt towards me again, doing a little flip in the air to try and distract me, but she had used that tactic on me before. I acted like I was caught off guard before catching the hands she stretched out to wrap around my neck and shoving them to the side as I did a half circle around her body, snagging a low level paralysis potion from her waist, breaking the wax and throwing it onto her back in one smooth motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer body locked up as she hit the floor, skidding to a stop. Casually I bent over her, grabbing the antidote and holding it out for her to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSis really, how many times have I told you to act your age? I haven\u2019t been your Riki tiki for almost ten years now. You\u2019re a Hunter, act like it at least. Now if you promise to be good I\u2019ll release you from the potion. Blink twice if you understand and agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked twice, unable to actually do anything else except breath. With a nod of the head I broke the wax with my thumb and poured the liquid inside of it out. As it hit the air it turned into a gas that surrounded her, allowing the fumes to be breathed in and breaking the spell. I held out a hand, helping her to her feet as she pouted and tried to embrace me again. I held out my hand, wagging my finger at her before pointing towards the front of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. You\u2019ve got a class to teach so teach it. Quit making more of a scene then you already are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLetting out a drawn out sigh she dropped her head before turning to teach the class at large. She began her lesson as I picked up the chair and replaced it, sitting down as unobtrusively as I could and ignoring the wide eyed shock in the faces looking my way. I had figured I couldn\u2019t hide who I was for very long. I was just thankful my name wasn\u2019t on the role call yet. But I had been hoping to get at least another day or two out of it before they found out I was a tenth generation Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I got up to get a lab kit from the back of the room and my sister started instructing them on how to make healing potions, I could feel the calculating eyes on me. The sudden interest in me as more than just a transfer student. Wondering how they could weasel their way into my life and good graces for their own benefit. With a name like Zelkov so many doors could be opened for them they would not otherwise have access to. Just saying they knew me could be the difference between them getting a thousand Reul or five thousand Reul for a monster drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI only listened with half an ear as my sister told them when to stir and when to heat it up. Talking about the importance of following the instructions exactly or they would wind up with a mess on their hands. She had already taught all of this to me years ago. And I had graduated from simple health potions long ago. Instead I worked on my own, making a paralysis potion and antidote to replace the ones I had used on my sister. I might have my problems with all of them, but big sis was the only one I thought of as family. She had raised me for a good portion of my life while my parents were out saving some part of the world or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI also made a third potion. It would be useless right now but later I could get someone I knew to put it into a magical artifact. Then Lilia could create a summoning gateway between me and her if she absolutely needed to. I couldn\u2019t do an instant teleportation spell where she could pull me to her since there was no magic that could do that, and regular teleportation spells only worked on the person who made them since it used their magic. But a translocation portal could bring me to her or her to me so had more utility. A gold necklace artifact with a purple gem might look nice on her. Or a ring. But girls liked necklaces more than rings right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy sister stayed away and let me work as she pointed out different tips and tricks the rest of the class could use to make their potions more effective, or how to set up the area around them for ease of access. The bell finally rang, signaling the end of class. I was a bit surprised as I finished sealing the wax around my potions, it hadn\u2019t felt like an hour already. Big sis came over to me and I handed her the two potions as she looked at me with those big puppy dog eyes and everyone else in the room lingered to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSaves you the trouble of making them yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are the best brother!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe tried to wrap her arms around me and I held her off. She gave me more sad puppy eyes as she pouted, begging without words. With a sigh I took my hand away and she gave a small squeal of joy, hugging me around the neck while rubbing her face against mine. She let out a sigh of pleasure as she squeezed and shook me back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really can\u2019t go on without my tiki juice! I love this feeling! Just squeezing you makes me feel like I can face the world again! I love you so much Riki tiki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally she let me go with another sigh of contentment putting up her fists and bouncing around slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk! Tiki tank\u2019s fully recharged! I\u2019m ready to face my next mission cause I know my lucky tiki juice will protect me. I won\u2019t be back home for about a week so give mother my love when you see her next!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she pulled a teleportation potion from her waist and threw it to the ground, stepping into the green smoke that ushered out. The gas billowed up a second longer before sinking into itself, leaving nothing behind, not even a pile of broken glass. Glaring around the room I heard a few snickers from those who had witnessed the exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? You got a problem? If you do speak up and I will be ever so happy to correct it for you. And I warn you now, if I hear anyone calling me Riki tiki I will personally rip out your tongue. Big sis is the only one allowed to call me that and get away with it. You have been warned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I picked up my bag and left the room ahead of everyone else I tried to mentally compose myself. I could still hear the whispering and even a few giggles, but only at the faintest edges of my hearing. Next was Combat class, so perhaps I could get the Arena Master to give me a small floor to myself so I could work off some of this annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the boys began gearing up more fully based on their specialized weapon of choice. Those who used their fists wore special gloves and added extra padding onto their forearms. Those who used shields wore extra padding all over and one boy even wore full plate mail armor. Gunners had wrist braces, staff wielders had finger guards. Just watching what pieces they put on gave me a good idea of whether they specialized in one weapon or many.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t need any of that extra gear though. There was probably nothing I really needed it for. I doubted they had any A class monsters I would have to go all out on anyways. At the most they might have some B class that wouldn\u2019t even make me break out a second phase on one of my weapons. I could just use some of the stock items the Arena Master could provide instead of my augmented weapons if I really needed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to close the locker on my duffle bag when something stopped me. I wasn\u2019t sure what it was but I had a feeling I should take at least one of my own weapons out with me. When I opened the bag up, the first two I saw were the ones those boys had been handling. Well they would do as well as any others. But which one to take?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tPulling on my Knuckles I touched the small yellow gem stud on the back of my left wrist. I watched with one eye as both open fingered gloves seemed to break up into separate fibers while the blades shrank away, all of it getting sucked into the yellow gem. By the time I had my bag zipped up and secured in my locker, the weapons only looked like two thin black bands wrapped around my wrists. The single jewel on the back of the left one the only indication they weren\u2019t just useless ornamentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master stood in front of the class once everyone had gathered and awaited instructions, informing everyone that today was going to be live combat training instead of sparring matches. I could see the excitement on the faces around me as he explained what was going to happen. He told me and someone named Hawthrope to sit out even as he began splitting the class off into teams. It took me a moment to remember that Hathrope was the last name of the girl I had knifed earlier even as she followed me up into the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI considered asking the teacher if there was a spare monster I could fight just for something to do but he seemed busy with the rest of the class and I felt it unwise to bother him. This class was one of the most important in their academy training. What they learned here could very well mean life or death, and distracting the teacher could prove fatal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo I sat down in the middle where a wall rose out of the floor to split the combat area into two. As the first two groups marched excitedly out onto the field with their stock set of weapons to meet the magically caged monster\u2019s that were rising up to meet them, Liz plopped down onto the bench an arms length away. She didn\u2019t say anything at first, simply watched as the battles below commenced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re a Zelkov. That explains how you were able to get the best of me earlier. I knew you had to be from an old family, fifth or sixth generation at least. But never expected a tenth generation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grunted but otherwise didn\u2019t comment. I didn\u2019t know what she was playing at, but it was best to give nothing away I didn\u2019t have to. Being a Hunter was just a bunch of politics, and old families were especially dangerous since they had more time to hone tweak and tighten their skills to pass on to the next generation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t hold the whole stabbing thing against you by the way. You were perfectly in your right to do so. My brother would have done the same in that position. And like you he would have given me a healing potion. Though I admit, it was the first time I thought I was really going to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain I remained silent, simply letting her chat away a bit. She told me a little about her family until I finally sighed and asked her point blank what it was she wanted. She blinked at me as if the answer was fairly obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWant? I just want to talk. This is the first time since I moved to this city that I really got to talk with someone who understands what being a Hunter is all about. Well at this school anyway. I\u2019ve met a few Hunter\u2019s out in town but they usually want to reminisce about the \u201cgood old days.\u201d I don\u2019t really fit in well around here in case you couldn\u2019t tell. Not much of what they call a people person. I just don\u2019t get the whole fascination with fashion, or the newest boy band or what celebrity is hot. I know enough about that stuff as I need to but it\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the first group finished their match and the next group slipped into the ring to face their own monster I nodded my head slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I can understand that. Doesn\u2019t mean I completely believe you of course but I can understand the desire at least. I\u2019m not much of a people person either. Well not much of a peer person is more like it. I can deal with kids and I can deal with older people, but between like fourteen and twenty five? Totally clueless. It\u2019s like they are alien or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know right! Though I\u2019m more of the twenty three and below category of clueless. I know a bit about how to deal with kids, but you could fit that information into my side pouch. I can deal with traumas of the mind and body on them, but ask me to interact with them on a more personal level? You\u2019d have better luck teaching a troll basic math higher than counting to five.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI couldn\u2019t help but grin at that, making her grin back as we both chuckled a bit. I found myself liking her if for no other reason than she did seem to be a lot like me. I still didn\u2019t completely trust her though, there was still a possibility she was playing a longer ranging game. We chatted a bit more about small things, feeling each other out as to likes and dislikes. I supposed this was what it was like to make a friend, though I really didn\u2019t have much experience at such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the two groups on the field killed their monster a group of five walked onto the field to meet a Glif. I recognized Gregory and Lilia by name and the tank wearing full plate armor and the boy who had been with Gregory earlier by sight. The second girl I didn\u2019t even remember seeing her face. I commented to Liz how this group must be a higher level since they were fighting a C class monster instead of D class like the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah they are all good in their own way. Jethic is a natural tank. First generation and almost no magic to speak of but I could see him taking on a few B class monsters soon with the right grouping. Marsa, the one with the casting staff, has a lot more magic than most. Her spells might not be the strongest yet but she has already mastered a few of the second tier spells. Lilia is a great healer. A bit absentminded at times when not in combat situations, but put her in front of a beastie and it\u2019s like a flip gets switched on in her head. Daniel is the best fister out of the three main ones in this group. First generation as well, but his grandfather was also a Hunter even though his parents aren\u2018t, so I guess a 1.5 generation Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was silent a moment as the five jumped around dodging the swinging fists of the seven foot tall light blue creature. The Glif was a subclass of giant that had a resistance to magic and stuck to mainly physical attacks until it was on it\u2019s last leg. Then it would put up its dukes, countering any attack sent against it while eating any magic cast during that time to throw back in it\u2019s opponents face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen there is Gregory. I\u2019ll give him credit, he is really good with guns. I wouldn\u2019t say he is a natural, but he has good intuitions and he learns quickly. I\u2019ve never seen a faster and more accurate hipshot before. But for all of that he is still a little weasel. Bit of the sticky fingers and he has an ego. Nothing is ever his fault and he has this need to show off all the time. I bet this fight is going to be the same. Probably going to do something stupid during second phase like attack it. Daniel tries to curb his stupidity, but isn\u2019t always successful. But you know what they say, there is no cure for stupid.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I already found out what a slimy rat he is. I\u2019m surprised steps haven\u2019t been taken against him yet. Maybe not Lapiiree but something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell just about everyone knows so they keep an eye on their things while putting a bit of distance between him and them. It will happen eventually though, he just hasn\u2019t done something stupid enough yet. I\u2019ll personally be surprised if he doesn\u2019t drop out by his senior year. Get himself killed if he is really unlucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBelow the Glif went into it\u2019s defensive phase, putting it\u2019s massive fists up in front of it\u2019s face while spreading it\u2019s legs and motioning for the group to attack. As Daniel and Lilia ran towards Jethic to regroup Marsa began casting a magma ball. At first I thought it was a stupid move because the beast sucked it up, throwing it right back at her. But the magma ball bounced off the reflective shield I hadn\u2019t even noticed she had cast, hurtling back along it\u2019s course and slamming back into the monster instead. I nodded my head with a grin, commenting on how smart that had been and Liz agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGregory seemed to want to also show off, casting an enhancment spell to increase all his abilities, but having that spell stolen instead. The beast cast it on itself, growing another foot before running towards Gregory at twice it\u2019s normal speed. I was already vaulting over the banister and onto the dividing wall as Jethic shoulder tackled Gregory out of the way, taking the massive augmented fist on his shield which crumpled like paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Glif brought his leg around from the opposite direction in a sideways kick even as Jethic managed to move his near useless shield around to block. The attack hit the shield and I could hear the boys arm snap as he was flung across the arena to slam into the wall hard. The beast brought his leg down, aiming a heel drop at Gregory\u2019s head. At the last moment the boy who seemed to be unconscious suddenly slid across the floor as Marsa used a force pull spell to grab him. Unfortunately she wasn\u2019t fast enough as the heel smashed into his hip, shattering the pelvic bone and blood splattered everwhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster turned towards Marsa but Daniels was there punching it to grab it\u2019s attention before jumping out of the way of the retaliation attack. By that time I was already jumping off the wall, using a bit of energy to push off while activating my Roller Knuckles. Depressing the hidden triggers on my palms I let the blades spin with a dangerous whirling sound as I punched both sides of the creatures head, rotating sideways and dragging the blades through it\u2019s flesh to score a few deep wounds and tearing off an ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI jumped out of the way of it\u2019s counter attack, turning the beast away from the rest of the group before grinning evilly and licking my lips.</span></div></div>",

I simply kept dodging out of the way, tagging it a few times to keep it focused on me while leading it farther and farther from the group. Liz began ushering them all away, dragging Gregory by the armpits. Once I felt they were all at a safe distance I cracked my neck without using my hands and bounced on the balls of my feet while taking a boxing pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou Glif\u2019s might be pretty good natural martial artist, but you ain\u2019t got nothing on anyone with a bit of training.

Well then as a special treat just for you I will send you off in style.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster put it\u2019s dukes back up in front of its face as it swayed back and forth, motioning for me to attack it. I just gave it a lopsided grin as I touched the yellow gem on the back of my left hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two activate. Jack the Ripper\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe gloves began to extend until they covered my elbow, two thin tracks making a loop from my elbow to my knuckles. Black material wrapped around my legs as well, also creating two thin tracks going from knees to ankles. One of the three saw blades from each fist popped off and floated down to my legs, locking into place along a track in the kneecap. Two more popped off, floating over my head as the last pair rotated into the tracks along the back of my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThirty seconds left on your second phase ugly, then we can dance for real. You creatures are pretty stupid, following a set pattern without fail as if you were programmed robots. If you had a bigger brain in there you would have continued to attack, or turned around to go after someone else. But I suppose we Hunter\u2019s should be thankful you monsters are so predictable ninety percent of the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a roar the beast lowered his hands and charged me. Pushing off I ran forward to meet him, activating the trigger and hearing all the blades coming to life dangerously. Each one spinning round and round in their tracks so fast it looked like there were ten of them instead of one in each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRipper\u2018s Eulogy! Sing the song of death!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he brought his right fist around I brought my right leg up in an arc, meeting it on the spinning blade. The chainsaw like effect tore through flesh and bone even as I jumped and spun, backhanding the monster in the back of the head to tear off huge chunks of flesh right down to the bone and muscle. Reaching up I hooked one of the spare saw blades with a strand of magic. As I came around the side of his head I flung it at the creatures neck like a spinning yo-yo wrapping around it seconds before I pulled myself back towards the monster. The saw blade unwound scoring a deep wound all around the Glif\u2019s neck before returning to it\u2019s position. I brought my left foot up and crossed my right arm over my chest while I prepared for the impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy arm slammed into the creatures face just as my leg smashed into it\u2019s chest. I heard the blades screaming as it met resistance in the form of cartilage and bone before the already weakened neck gave way first, my forearm shoving the head right off it\u2019s shoulders in an unrecognizable mess of shredded flesh and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as my feet finally touched the floor and I returned my weapon to phase one the body began to break up into dust, disappearing into nothingness to leave behind a vial of it\u2019s blood. I knew it had been overkill, my ripper blades hadn\u2019t seen enough use to really justify going to second phase, but I had said I would give it a worthy death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPicking up the vial of blood I hurried over to where Lilia was trying desperately to heal both Jethic and Gregory. But both of them had wounds that anyone who had any experience could tell were job ending. Gregory would never walk again, even if she or someone else somehow managed to fix him up completely. And Jethic\u2019s career as a tank was over, his arm would probably need to be amputated and he would have a perpetual stoop from his broken back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic was barely conscious as he leaned against the wall where he had fallen. He was looking down at his arm knowing the truth even though Lilia and the others were telling him it would be all right. The Arena Master shared a look with me and shook his head slightly. We both knew and Liz knew the severity of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking down at the vial of Glif blood in my hand I knew I could save one of them. Glif blood had properties that could heal any wound if mixed correctly, and I had all the other ingredients I needed on me. But I could only save one, it would take all the blood from the vial for such serious wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I looked up I saw both the Arena Master and Liz watching me. They both saw the vial in my hands and knew what I could do with it. They also knew what a difficult choice this could be. Yes Gregory had caused this mess and angered me earlier, but people deserved a chance for redemption. At least Jethic could still walk at the moment and with intense training and some really good healers he could still become a Hunter with one arm. Right now Gregory\u2019s life was over, gunners needed speed and mobility, neither of which he would have without the use of his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could always not use it on either one of them but that wasn\u2019t even really a choice in my mind. I might not be able to stand most people my age but these people were all still Hunter\u2019s. they all signed up for this knowing the risks yet still wanting to help people anyway. Hunter\u2019s helped one another when they could. That was part of the code we all lived by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHefting the blood in my hands while looking between the two I was about to leave the decision up to the Arena Master when he caught my eye. He shook his head again, telling me without words that it was my choice. I had risked my life and defeated the monster, the blood was mine by right of victory so the decision was also mine by right. With a sigh I closed my eyes, gripping the vial in my hand tightly wondering what to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tOut of the two of them Jethic would be the better Hunter in the future. With Gregory\u2019s personality using the blood on him would be a waste in the long run as he would just end up either dying or screwing over someone else. My decision made, I walked over and squatted down in front of Jethic, looking him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour going to be all right Jethic. You did your shield proud and upheld your status as a real tank. Right now though I need to borrow some of your blood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe barked a small laugh but stopped quickly, clutching at his side where no doubt his ribs were at the least cracked. After a moment he waved his hand all over his body where he was oozing blood from many different cuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake your pick of exit wounds. As you can see I got a lot to spare. But you don\u2019t need to lie to me, I know the deal. My life as a Hunter is over. Short of The One God coming down and laying his hands on me I\u2019m not getting fixed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI said you are going to be all right and I mean it. You got the promise of a Zelkov on that. Just hang in there for a little bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pointed at the caster as the Arena Master ordered everyone to back off a bit to give me room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! Marsa right? I saw your second tier magma ball earlier, can you cast and hold that at an even three hundred degrees without throwing it? Five to ten minutes at most?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I think so. I\u2019ve never really tried to just hold it but if I concentrate I probably could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood then get ready to do so when I tell you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSetting the vial carefully on the ground I pulled off my gloves, setting them down next to the monster blood. As I knelt there on my legs I took a few deep breaths, preparing myself for the next few steps. Jethic saw the vial of blood and let out another painful chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever did understand how it is monsters can drop their blood and body parts in vials like that. You would think it would be spilled all over the ground and you would have to scrape it up or something. But no, their livers or intestines or brains or whatever come in those nice little neat prepackaged cases for our pleasure. Same with raw slabs of meat all cut up nice and neat. And why is it ever only like one or two small slabs when you just killed this giant monster over six feet tall? Shouldn\u2019t you get like pounds of the stuff? Why does it only ever drop like one or two items too? Why not some meat, the fur, claws and everything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAbsently I waved him to silence, my mind settling into the mindset I needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSave your breath. That\u2019s the blood loss talking. They are magical creatures and that\u2019s just the way things work. Save your theological debates and theories for a scholar. I just know that I kill them and it drops the items as I find them. That\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was ready I let out another  deep breath, picking up my Roller Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s been a good run old friend, but it\u2019s time for you to do one last duty. Phase three activate: Ripper\u2019s memories. Sing your final battle hymn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the gloves began their transformation into phase three I shot the magic flowing into me back into the yellow gem, causing a feedback loop and short circuiting the transformation. As the magic fed on itself I ripped the gem from it\u2019s socket and smashed it on the ground hard enough to split the shell in half to reveal the piece of heart crystal inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive me that magma now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPopping the cork on the vial I gathered a bit of Jethic\u2019s blood with it, throwing both it and the heart crystal into the flaming ball of magma before channeling all the power flowing through me from the feedback loop in after it. I had to keep my mind blank, ignoring the heat singeing the hairs on my arm or the smell of cooking flesh. This was a jury rigged alchemic concoction without benefit of burners or real equipment. I had to regulate it all with magic, holding them inside the fire with pure power while I tried to shield myself from the brunt of the flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t A soothing shield enveloped me, probably from the Arena Master but I didn\u2019t dare look away right now to see. In my minds eye I saw what was happening in the depths of the flames. How the blood, magic and crystal were all melting and fusing together to create a heal-all elixir. Any heart crystal would do, but time was also of the essence before Jethic passed the point of no return and his body rejected the treatment. Constantly I twirled the brew, stiring it with magic instead of a glass rod. Ignoring the sweat dripping from my face or the empty feeling in the pit of my stomach telling me my magic was almost gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally it reached the optimal point where everything was bonded perfectly. With the last of my magic I summoned forth a freezing wind and frigid water, circling it around the ball of magma until it was completely encased before crushing my hands together and letting the two opposing forces meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a small implosion as it sank in on itself for a second, moments before hot steam exploded outward and a small tinkling noise could be heard in the mist. Reaching inside the fog I felt around until my fingers found the neck of the elixir bottle. Pulling out the shiny silver casing I could see the almost clear liquid inside, knowing it had been a success. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding right now would be out of the question, I would just fall over or stagger around a bit. So I simple crawled over to Jethic, putting the edge to his lip and telling him to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt might taste like stinky goblin armpit sweat mixed with troll toe jam, but I didn\u2019t exactly have some of the normal extra ingredients you would use to hide those tastes. I used all the bare minimum of ingredients though. Also I will warn you, after you drink it, your body is going to hurt. Feel free to scream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stared into my eyes a moment as if wondering if I was joking or not before holding it with his good left hand and chugging it down quickly. His face contorted at the taste and he gave a small gag, looking like he was keeping himself from vomiting by force of will. After a moment of silence I heard the grating noise. That would be his bones putting themselves back together in the span of seconds without any magic buffering the pain. He gritted his teeth against the pain and I slapped him lightly on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Soon enough you are going to convulse. If you grit your teeth you are going to hurt yourself. Better to loosen up if you can and simply scream it out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSure enough, his broken and pulped up right arm began to spasm and twist disgustingly. The bone shards could be seen moving around under the skin, tearing through muscle to get back into place before that muscle was healed up again. And Jethic began to scream. Tears came down his eyes as his back suddenly popped back into place and the rest of his internal injuries righted themselves. Finally it was all over and he sat there with his head hanging into his chest, panting heavily. But not even a bruise marked his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUsing the wall to steady myself I climbed to my feet, offering Jethic a hand up. After a moment he took it, staggering into a standing position. He experimented by walking around and rotating his shoulders before finally grinning at me with tears in his eyes. I waved off his profuse words of thanks before the world grew dark around me and I collapsed back against the wall, letting unconsciousness take me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cBut ma\u2019am if such things exist why isn\u2019t it more common?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI cracked open my eyes to see a white ceiling staring back at me. The cool sheet and the slightly hard bed told me I was most likely in the nurses office. Looking down the length of my body at the sound of the voice confirmed that it was indeed Jethic talking. Standing next to him were the other three I had saved and all of them were looking at the principal intently. A glance to my left showed the nurse hard at work on a still unconscious Gregory. The principal looked up at Jethic from her wheelchair and shook her head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause the ingredients are so rare. You can get the vial of blood from any subclass of giant C class or higher, but the drop rate is really low. Even at it\u2019s best it is somewhere around like one in twenty kills on an A class. I\u2019m astonished one dropped from a mere Glif. In case you don\u2019t realize how precious it is, you could probably outfit yourself with a new top of the line set of armor from Alves and still have a bit left over. Second, it takes a lot of magical power that needs to be constantly added in a steady stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost Hunter\u2019s don\u2019t have that kind of magic though, only caster specialist like this girl here could pull it off normally. But he used the power given off by his weapons heart crystal when he released his phase three to get around that fact. And since heart crystal\u2019s are used to create artifacts, people don\u2019t usually use them for heal-all\u2019s. They would rather have an artifact weapon that can be used over and over instead of an elixir that is only used once. I\u2019m actually surprised he was able to pull off making one in such a jury-rigged alchemist lab. But I guess that\u2019s a Zelkov for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about my blood? It seems a bit weird he would need that too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNormally heal-all\u2019s are made without DNA from the imbiber so it can be sold to anyone. Usually the person spits into the potion before they drink it since it wasn\u2019t necessarily your blood he was after, just your DNA. But I think he added it in beforehand to try and lower the chances of your body rejecting the healing. Since like with all healing potions, one must use it shortly after the damage is done or it won\u2019t work. The body sets at a certain point if you will and refuses the quick healing of the potion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had heard enough, from the look on Jethic\u2019s face as he began to realize just how much I had given up, both monetary wise and weapon wise and at the principals explanation I was getting a bit embarrassed. So shoving off with my hand I sat up in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou speak too much old lady. I can\u2019t even get a decent sleep around here with all that yakking. Don\u2019t go putting silly ideas into their heads making them think they owe me or anything. I simply helped another Hunter out in his time of need, upholding the code as is my duty. Being the example of what a Hunter is as a Zelkov should.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, yeah. You Zelkov\u2019s are all the same, doing good deeds and hiding behind the whole duty shtick. It\u2019s like you think it\u2019s some sort of disease to do something good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply shook my head, ignoring her comment as I got to my feet only slightly unsteadily. I could feel my reserves were still pretty low even as I suddenly sat back down from getting light headed. Not surprising considering that I had just done the mental equivalent of fighting three A class monsters alone while juiced up to the max. The nurse finally dropped her glowing hands from where they were hovering over the unconscious boys hips with a sigh. She looked over at the principal with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2019That\u2019s it, I\u2019m tapped out. I did what I could but I\u2019m sure you know he is never going to walk again. That monster just messed him up too much. Getting knocked out from your shield bash might have been a blessing to him. He didn\u2019t feel his bones getting pulverized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd it might be the cause of all of this too. If he wasn\u2019t unconscious he might have been able to avoid it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could say anything the principal spoke up, saying the same thing I was going to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps. Or perhaps he would have tried to block it and gotten worse damage. That\u2019s the problem when bad things happen, we always ask that insidious question, what if. Wondering if our course was the best one or the right one. Not all decisions are easy ones to make and in the heat of the moment we tend to just do what seems best at that time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nurse looked down at the boy in the bed before absently shoving me back into a sitting position when I tried to get up again. She glared at me in the no nonsense way of a priestess doing her job before breaking off some ration bread and handing it to me with the order to eat. Only once she was sure I was nibbling on the compressed fruit bread did she turn her attention back to the group by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how did it happen anyway? I heard a bunch of babbling when you came in but I had other things to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Glif ate a self enhancement magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stopped chewing on the rations to shake my head and point at Daniel\u2019s simple explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCall it like it is. That idiot tried to be cocky and show off, not wanting to be one upped by Marsa over there. At least her tactic I understood, a reflective shield doesn\u2019t last long and she didn\u2019t want to waste it. She knew all that before casting her flame spell, knowing it would be eaten and thrown back at her. But that idiot\u2019s ego got in the way of his common sense when he tried casting that spell on himself to be taken. Even supposing he didn\u2019t know it would suck up non-attack type spells, I doubt the Arena Master would have sent you out there without letting you know the dangers and informing him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you\u2019re right, the teacher did tell us exactly what to expect. He said it would suck up any spells once it put it\u2019s hands up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn the end this mess was his fault more than anyone\u2019s. Now I\u2019m not saying the idiot deserved what he got, but he really can\u2019t complain when he wakes up about the outcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNone of my classmates had anything to say to that even as the principal sighed in silent agreement. More things like this would happen over the next three years until they graduated. Gregory wouldn\u2019t be the only casualty of either a training accident or something else. There was a reason classes started off between twenty and twenty five kids their freshman years only to dwindle down to between sixteen and twenty by their senior year. And why transfer students were rare. The people they were in class with now would be the ones they graduated with if they got that far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic looked at me a moment before lowering his head to scratch his neck. I could see him trying to come up with some words to thank me but I cut him off before he said anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour planning on thanking me and saying something stupid about how much it cost me or I gave up my weapon. Don\u2019t bother. I said before, it\u2019s a Hunter\u2019s job to help out his comrades if and when he can. Weapons are just weapons. No matter how long I might have had them or what memories they may have held, they were still not more important than your life. I can always get a new heart crystal to put in the gloves. I might have to retune the magic to synchronize with me but it\u2019s not like it is the end of the world for me to put in a bit of effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook his head back and forth as he clenched his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I am thankful and everything and I sort of understand. But how did you choose? Between me and him? I mean I know he caused this and all and he really isn\u2019t a very likeable person sometimes, but the choice must have still been difficult.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe truth? It came down to the people. Not the ones in here, but the ones out there. The ones we swore an oath to protect as Hunter\u2019s. I felt you would be a more valuable asset to our ranks than he would. I prioritized your life over his for that reason alone. Yes it would have been easy to make the decision based on my dislike for him, or the feeling that he got what he deserved. But such thoughts have no place in the decisions we must make as Hunter\u2019s out in the field. Protecting the people isn\u2019t always so cut and dry as good and bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe might have a bit of a bad attitude or an ego, but even Liz recognizes his skills with his dual guns. The world can use good Hunter\u2019s even if they have such quirks. The One God knows I\u2019ve got my drawbacks personality wise, does that mean I wouldn\u2019t be a good Hunter? That\u2019s why I chose as I did. Even though he might have been better then you skill wise, you have more potential than he does. So I bet on the chance that you will live up to that potential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang and the four looked up at the ceiling before looking at me again. With a few nods they headed for the door to get to their next class now that they had verified I was all right and the nurse had released them.A moment later the principal wheeled herself out the door as well, probably to do whatever she did all day. I started to stand up as well, I really didn\u2019t want to follow them but I didn\u2019t feel like staying here either. The nurse pushed me back down again with a shake of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBed rest for a bit longer young man.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d rather sit around in a classroom listening to information I already know while doing nothing than lay around in bed doing nothing without even a book to read.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah you\u2019re a Hunter all right. All of you people are the same way, always insisting nothings wrong even when you look like you are going to let out your last breath any moment. Fine, but you aren\u2019t going back to class. Go home and rest, that\u2019s an order. Then you can sit around doing nothing while reading a book. I hope. Just wait a moment while I see about getting a hold of one of your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood luck with that. My father is off fighting Sandworms and I\u2019d be surprised if my mother hasn\u2019t run off to some country or another already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waited, sitting on the side of the bed and finishing the ration bread while she pulled the proper contact id card and linked it to her communication spell. I couldn\u2019t hear what she said but it seemed she was actually able to get a hold of my mother, since my father was too far away for a com spell without a booster. After a moment she turned to me, waving towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooks like you are on your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t need to waste your magic to find that out. I was already planning on that outcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding up I began to walk slowly towards the door shoving down the slight light headed feeling. Once I started getting my blood flowing  that feeling would stop. The first thing I did was head for the Arena to pick up my bag. I wasn\u2019t about to leave those here overnight. Slipping in and out without anyone realizing I was even there I finally headed for the door. The principal wheeling up next to me as I walked, a small smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really did do a good thing. Despite your insistence that you don\u2019t need to be thanked I\u2019m still going to thank you anyway for helping one of my students. I know the choice wasn\u2019t an easy one for you but I think you chose well. Stay safe on your way home Riktal Zelkov. Rest up and brace yourself for the hero worship tomorrow. If you are a real Zelkov I\u2019m sure you will just love that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chuckled a bit as she wheeled away without another word. The sarcasm of her last words would probably be plain to even the most thickheaded of people. I simply shook my head, not in negation, but because I knew her words were true. As much as I didn\u2019t want them to shower me with praise and thanks or be looked upon with worship, they would still do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t waste any time once I hit the front gate, simply turning into town to head right home. I had some frozen dinners in the freezer I could heat up and then I could go to sleep early. That still sounded like the best plan as I got home, raising my hand to unlock the spell on the building. My fingers faltered a moment before reaching into my bag and grabbing a short sword, pushing open the already unlocked door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSilently setting my bag on the floor I began hunting through the house for the intruder. They had to be pretty good spell smiths to break that magic lock and not set off the houses defenses. I heard a clanking coming from the kitchen so crept over in that direction while keeping my body pressed to the wall. Using the flat part of my sword as a mirror I could just make out an indistinct blob with dark hair rummaging through the refrigerator. Sliding my knife out of it\u2019s sheath at my side I flipped it and spun, throwing it at the burglar. It was only a warning shot that would hit the refrigerator next to his head, but he caught it in mid air without looking before turning to face me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho taught you to greet your father like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSmart man. How you doing son?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve had worse days. I thought you were still taking care of that Sandworm infestation for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was able to get done a lot sooner then I thought. Got a bit of help from another Hunter in the area. I actually just got back this morning and your mother asked me to help her on a job in Bornica. We will be leaving again in a bit once she takes care of some business. I was just grabbing a bite to eat before heading off into town to stock up on supplies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeaning my swords against the wall I walked over and grabbed the dagger from his hand when he offered it, sliding it home while opening the freezer. With practiced ease I pulled out one of the frozen dinners, hitting the buttons on the microwave and poking holes in the film before tapping the start button. As the artifact came to life I planted my hands on the counter and closed my eyes, resisting the urge to rub them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like you need a drink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m underage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill, I\u2019ve seen drunken sailors that looked better than you do right now. Care to fill me in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe waited until the microwave dinged before following me to the table eating some of the leftover pasta I had made yesterday. After taking the first bite of the meat that claimed to be hamburger steak I recounted what had happened. I really didn\u2019t have much of a relationship with my father, but at least I was slightly closer to him than I was to my mother. I didn\u2019t get the urge to strangle him after only a few moments in his presence. Still he was barely more than a father to me in more than name. Like my mother he was never around and almost never dealt with me as more than one Hunter to another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tProbably the only reason we were able to get along like we did was because interaction between guys was different than that between a man and a woman. There was something about him that let me feel more at ease talking to him than to my mother to begin with. And I knew sometimes there were things you could only say to another guy. I finished my story and my meal as he nodded his head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep that would definitely do it. I\u2019m impressed you pulled it off. These stuffed shells are really good by the way. Did you make them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor lunch yesterday yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurprised your mother didn\u2019t find them last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe came in late, said she was home then crashed on the couch. Don\u2019t know why she even bothered coming home if she is just going to be leaving again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure she was just eager to see you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a snort of derision as I threw my fork in the sink and my plastic tray in the garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat would be a first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father followed me out of the room carrying his plate of pasta even as I ignored him. My feet took me to the living room of their own accord where I plopped onto the couch and rested my head against the back. Now that I had some food in me, my body was telling me how tired it was. And how much it didn\u2019t want to walk up the stairs. Not really too interested I still asked my father what kind of business my mother had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems she has been looking after a little girl for the last three days. But she can\u2019t take her with us so she is looking for someone else to take care of her until someone she knows can come pick her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t see any little girl when she came in last night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cApparently she has a unique magic that some people wanted to study so she stayed at a lab all night with your mother\u2019s aides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnique magic huh? Surprised anyone with a special power would submit to being poked and prodded the way most people hate and fear them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah well I guess she is a bit of a special case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill she failed as a Hunter if she let her client out of her sight when it was her duty to protect her at all times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s really not a fair thing to say without knowing all the circumstances.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t need to know any of the circumstances. Hunter code states that the client is the priority at all times. More important than personal safety, possessions, or image. Until such a time as the client leaves your protection. Isn\u2019t that what you taught me? The only circumstances I could accept are if such a code conflicted with the code we live by that upholds the safety of the many.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just leave the plate in the sink, it will give me something to do later. I\u2019ll see you in a week or two. Or whenever this job is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLater son. Get some rest, you don\u2019t look like you will last much longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave him a small wave, mustering enough energy to stand up and head for the stairs. My legs felt a bit like lead as I climbed to the second floor, my body prioritizing a lethargic state for healing using the food I had just ate. Even though my eyes were burning, sleep eluded me for some reason as I simply fell onto my bed without even kicking off my shoes. That was fine, sleep would come soon, my body would see to that. I would just lie here with my eyes closed until it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hadn\u2019t been in bed long before I heard the door downstairs opening and closing. I thought it was my father finally leaving but his voice proved that wasn\u2019t the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarian! What are you doing here? I thought we were going to meet down at Nerval\u2019s in about ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe school called and said Riktal wasn\u2019t feeling well. I was a bit busy at the time working out a deal with Pelei so they agreed to send him home alone. I came as soon as I could to see how he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s fine. Just a bit of burn out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father quickly recounted what I had told him and my mother responded with surprise much as my father had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised though, Ulicia did teach him everything she knows.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a moment of silence before I heard the distinctive sound of the first step creaking. But only the first step before my father\u2019s voice rang out. I could well imagine my father\u2019s arm on my mother\u2019s, keeping her from going any farther up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLeave it Marian. We both know how things will end if you go up there. In the best case he is passed out on his bed. He looked ready to fall over on the steps after all. Any show of compassion you might make he isn\u2019t going to appreciate or believe, thinking it some deeper plot. Worse case he is still awake and the two of you get into an argument, putting you both in a foul mood for no good reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, I know. But we both know how you are. You have these feelings of motherly affection but as soon as you are actually around a child of any kind, especially your own, it all goes out the window like a switch in your head got flipped. You fumble with your words and actions so much you simply fall back on what you know, treating them all impersonally and like faceless Hunter\u2019s. All those desires of yours get\u2019s all jumbled up as you try your best to connect with them. In the end it just makes it all look and feel fake. That\u2019s the mask Riktal see\u2019s, and too be fair you haven\u2019t done much to help your cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think I know all that! But still\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut still nothing honey. He seems to have grown up just fine without us even looking. I\u2019m sure when all this is over we can set things right. It\u2019s going to take more than a day to fix seventeen years of neglect. Here, have a stuffed shell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was another moment of silence before my mother let out another exclamation of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen did you make it down to the Pasta Palace to buy these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t. Riktal made them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen did he learn how to cook like this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho knows? But considering we are never around, I suspect there are a lot of things he can do that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI couldn\u2019t help but smile a bit as I lay on my side listening to the conversation. Ursa, the chef down at the Palace, had been the one to teach me most of what I knew about cooking. I was no master chef like her, but I had learned a thing or two about making more complicated dishes like the stuffed shells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell at the least we need to buy him another heart crystal to replace the one he used. I might not know him all that well but I know he loves those Roller Knuckles. Olia got them for him three years ago right before she died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo honey, we shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve spent a bit more time with him than you so I know that would only make him resent you even more. He needs to earn a new crystal on his own. He won\u2019t feel he accomplished anything if it\u2019s just given to him. You forget, he\u2019s not a boy anymore, he\u2019s a man now. But don\u2019t feel bad, I had forgotten that fact too until I saw him today. Now let\u2019s go, our flight leaves in a few hours and we still have some shopping to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the front door open again and their voices fading but I could still hear them through my window faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Pelei took the job of protecting the girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, though I still have a few misgivings about it. I had been thinking of asking Riktal but after getting that call I decided against it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of their conversation was lost in the breeze as they got out of range of even my acute hearing. A moment later the sounds of one of the cars starting and then pulling away drifted up to me. This new information put my mother in a slightly new light, but I still couldn\u2019t entirely believe it. A large part of me still said she was just being her, playing even my father and pretending like she always did. Working off the assumption that I was awake and could hear her. After all, she had no problems using her own family to achieve her own ends and she was the one who had taught me the most about the political aspects of being a Hunter. Of how to play the game and devise plots within plots. She was and always would be much better at it than I was, but I was still aware enough of those facts to consider the possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuch hard thinking seemed to be exactly what I had needed as I let out a yawn and felt the natural darkness of sleep closing in. In the end, only time would tell if what I had overheard was all truth or just another devious plot of some kind. For now I just wanted to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTruth and half truth. Lies, deceit, judgments, assumptions, opinions. Each word has a different meaning yet at the same time they share much in common. They can mean different things to different people, but in the end they are simply words. Simply concepts that humans have attached meaning to in their attempt to bring order to the world. To create a system of morals which are in themselves something that humans have created to define the box they live in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut in this world where millions upon millions of possibilities exist at the same time what is truth? Is this day truth? Does it define who Riktal is? What then is the Riktal that lives on the other timelines? The other choices you didn\u2019t make? Are those half truth Riktal\u2019s? Or outright lies? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow did you make your choices? Did you base them on judgments you have made or opinions of what you have seen? Did you make assumptions as to what the outcome might be and base your choice on that? In the end did you simply deceive yourself, choosing as you would choose thinking Riktal would naturally take the same course?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe choices had no feelings though. No morals, no concepts of any of that. They too were just mere words or unformed thoughts until you made them reality. It was you who brought concept and weight to them. So too is it you who must decide if this day was good or bad, since this day just was, much like the choices were before you came along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI have enjoyed our time together human and these theological thoughts we have exchanged. These food for thoughts if you will. I know you shall come again to redo this day and live in Riktal\u2019s shoes, making different choices and attaching importance to different things. Until we meet again traveler.</span></div></div>",

Just throw the plate in the sink when you are done, it will give me something to do when I wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou do that. You look like you are about to pass out any second anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I closed my eyes, waiting for sleep to take over. Even though my eyes burned, I just couldn\u2019t force myself to fall asleep, doing so only made it harder to actually do so. But my body would make me sleep soon enough as long as I relaxed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seemed fate was conspiring against me though as the door opened a few minutes later before I had a chance to relax enough. At first I thought it was just my father leaving, but his voice out in the hallway dispelled that notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarian! What are you doing here? I thought we were going to meet up down at Nerval\u2019s in about ten minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe school called and said Riktal wasn\u2019t feeling well and needed to go home.

He\u2019s in the living room right now trying to get some sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPounding feet followed as I cracked open my eye in the direction of the door. I probably should have gone upstairs after all, since I really didn\u2019t need to deal with my mother right now. She came into the room, a false look of worry written plainly on her features. I could see her mouth opening and closing a few times before the familiar mask of her Hunter face dropped into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBrilliant observation mother. Is burn out supposed to look any other way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat fool thing did you do to get into this state? I thought we taught you better than that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI created a heal-all elixir in the equivalent of doing brain surgery with a hammer and nails while blindfolded to save one of my classmates. I\u2019m sorry if I didn\u2019t live up to your expectations of looking out only for myself by actually helping someone else. And I am sure the great Marian Zelkov never burned out at all in her life either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to get a headache then as she shook her head slightly while clamping down on whatever she was going to say in response to that. With a quick breath she finally spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant or how I meant it. I don\u2019t want to argue, it just came out wrong. Are you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Feigning worry for my well being? What game are you playing at now? We both know you don\u2019t really care if I am fine or not. You are just going through the motions to make it seem like you are a real mother. But I will answer your question anyway so we can meet the minimum requirement of interaction of parent and child, freeing you to go on your way again with the feeling that you aren\u2019t such a horrible person. Aside from a small headache that started the moment you came into the room, I\u2019m fine. Now go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, can\u2019t we just for once talk without turning it into an argument?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShort answer, no. Long answer, perhaps when you stop faking real emotions and actually care about someone besides yourself without trying to manipulate and control everything and everyone around you however you can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father came back into the room then, gently grabbing my mother\u2019s arm and tugging her back into the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on Marian, we will miss our flight if we don\u2019t hurry. We still have things to pick up remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLeave it. We will talk on the way all right? You already knew it would turn out like this so just give him space.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he\u2019s only sixteen!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s seventeen Marian. His birthday was last month remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cActually it was two months ago father, Olia\u2019s death day was last month. Two occasions by the way you both missed again this year. But at least you know how old I am so that scores you a few points.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father looked at me a bit sadly, saying a quite apology but not trying to offer an explanation. With another tug he pulled my mother away until I heard the door opening and closing again. A few moments later I heard one of the cars pulling out of the garage and speeding away. The headache had grown stronger in just those few moments and I knew it would be impossible to get to sleep with it pounding in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I found some energy to stand up again, heading for the kitchen on legs that felt like they weighed a ton. Once there I grabbed a coffee mug from the cupboard, setting it down at the table before going to the cupboards by the stove. Pushing aside the vinegars and wines I sometimes used for cooking I reached into the back and pulled out the strong stuff. Casavian Fire brew. Guaranteed to get you drunk in three shots or less and good for what troubles you. It had been a gift for my birthday a year ago but this was the first time I felt like I really needed a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting at the table I broke the wax seal and poured myself a hefty dollop, at least two shots worth. I downed it quickly, feeling the burn as it slid down my throat and the sudden lightheadedness as it started to work. My headache went away almost instantly as I crossed my arms on the table, resting my head on top of them. Well this wasn\u2019t exactly a natural way to fall asleep but it still worked. My body would get the rest it needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe alcohol took a few more minutes to really kick in but suddenly the world began to go dark as I slipped into sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTruth and half truth.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWith a heavy sigh I slid back onto the bed, propping myself up a bit so I wasn\u2019t laying completely flat. The nurse looked a bit surprised that I was actually listening before turning away. She sat at a desk and began to write, probably a small incident report or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou happen to have something I can read while I sit around here doing nothing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy romance novel, but that\u2019s it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe held up a book where a half naked man was locking lips with a well endowed woman with bright pink hair. I shook my head, waving it away quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGiving me a half grin and a shrug she turned back to her paperwork, jotting down a few more notes before leaning back in her chair to read the romance herself. For my part I simply closed my eyes, hoping I would perhaps fall asleep. I knew I would eventually as my body suddenly realized the fact that I was tapped out and needed to recharge and recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe principal came back about ten minutes later with my bag sitting in her lap, offering me thanks for what I had done even as she sat it on the floor next to me. I waved it off like I had when Jethic had offered them and she didn\u2019t push the issue. Simply said her bit before leaving again. Reaching into the bag I pulled out the remnants of my Roller Knuckles. They still had the saw blades on them but without the heart crystal they wouldn\u2019t spin at all. They were simply glorified gloves right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sang a fine final song old friend. Your sacrifice wasn\u2019t in vain, you did good. Just wait, I\u2019ll find another heart crystal that matches you just as well as the old one. Even if I have to go out slaying the monsters myself until I get the drop. You won\u2019t be forgotten.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked up in time to see the nurse watching me quietly a moment before returning to her reading. I didn\u2019t miss the small nod of acknowledgement she sent my way though. As I bent over the side of the bed to drop the gloves back into the bag, Gregory began to moan as he woke up. I glanced over in time to see him jerk awake trying to move for a moment as the realization he couldn\u2019t move from the waist down came over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat happened! Why can\u2019t I move my legs! Where am I? How did I get here! What\u2019s going on! Why can\u2019t I move my legs!\u201d<br>\r\n\tAs he began to flail around, managing to pull himself into a reclined sitting position, the nurse hurried over, trying to calm him down. She tried explaining what had happened and that he would never walk again, but her words seemed to just make him more hysteric. Throwing off his covers he looked down at his legs, saying they looked normal and accusing her of putting some kind of spell on them as a bad joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis constant accusations and hysterical outbursts were getting on my nerves. Not once did he seem to think he had done anything wrong, or think that this was his reality now. Refusing to believe what the nurse was saying. Swinging out of bed I took the two steps to his side, pushing the nurse out of the way before slapping him as hard as I could across the face to shut him up. With a grunt I looked at the nurse shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeriously, you priestesses need to learn to take a more direct approach. I know your oaths of service make you a bit pacifistic, but you work as a nurse in a Monster Combat Hunter academy, you need to get a bit violent sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning back to the boy who was glaring up at me I glared back until he finally lowered his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t some game or lie. Do you think anyone would waste magic on making you think you will never walk again like you are someone important? Newsflash, you aren\u2019t that important. This is the outcome of your poor choice to cast a magic to stoke your own ego. You were warned not to do so before you even stepped out onto the field and yet you did it anyway. Perhaps the unconsciousness wasn\u2019t your fault but your teammates did the best they could to save your worthless hide. Jethic took the hits meant for you, the only reason he wasn\u2019t killed outright was because he was armored up for heavy blows. And if it hadn\u2019t been for Marsa\u2019s quick thinking it would have been your skull that was crushed and not your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you heal me then! Lilia is a priestess and so is the nurse! Those two combined must have been able to!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLilia did heal you as soon as she could. She spent herself, almost burning out to lessen the damage and reconstructing the bones from splinters. The same with the nurse here. But you should already know by now that no matter how good the priest or priestess or how touched they are by The One God, they can\u2019t fix everything. When something gets too badly damaged, it\u2019s just not possible to fix it all in time. They do what they can and we as Hunter\u2019s have to accept that fact. What good would fixing your nerves have done if your bones never had a chance to heal and set right? Or healing your muscles when they know they are going to rip them apart again while shifting fragments around? They have their own set of priorities when healing even if you don\u2019t understand it. You might never be able to walk again but at least be grateful they didn\u2019t have to cut anything off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHaving said my piece I turned and climbed back into my own bed, turning on my side so I didn\u2019t have to see either one of them looking at me. The nurse went back to explaining things to Gregory who continued to sulk, but at least now he was listening and not making wild accusations. Finally he told her to just leave him alone and she did so, going back to her desk quietly. When I glanced over my shoulder I saw Gregory looking away at the far wall, which was probably the best he could do right now since he couldn\u2019t turn on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA few minutes later the nurse picked up her paperwork and headed for the door, excusing herself for a little bit. The silence that descended after she left was welcome. I hadn\u2019t realized how loud the scratching of her pencil had been as I had tried to fall asleep for even a little bit. Or how much it had tickled at my nerves, preventing me from relaxing. But now I felt that relaxation starting to seep in as my eyes became suddenly heavy and sleep started creeping nearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, are you awake?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI ignored him. I was in no mood to talk right now and in even less of a mood to hear him whining about his situation or fishing for pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I screwed up pretty big this time huh? You\u2019re right, this was my fault. I can complain and blame all I want but in the end it comes back to me. I always wanted to be a Hunter you know. I grew up poor, and I mean dirt poor. I lived with my parents in this two room little hovel that had more holes than walls it seemed. But I was happy you know. Then a monster came and destroyed the placed. Killed my parents in front of me too. Would have killed me as well but then this Hunter came out of nowhere and smashed it up. Even though I was only four I knew that I wanted to be that guy. The one coming to the rescue and saving the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced at him covertly as I heard the choking of his voice, seeing tears coming down his face as he stared at the ceiling. It seemed like he had forgotten I was even there or that he was talking to me, lost in his own memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey sent me to live with my aunt and uncle in Verindis city, but I ran away from there when I was seven. They were really mean and so was my cousin. I was just an extra mouth to feed to them and their precious little boy could do no wrong while I was treated like I was the monster. Fell in with a bunch of street imps, a man named Orsik lead the little gang. We were all still dirt poor, but we survived. Orsik was like a second father to me. We weren\u2019t all noble or anything though, I stole and picked pockets to survive just like everyone else. Even though we didn\u2019t have much, every year for Christmas and our birthday we managed to have a small feast or party and a few gifts. Gifts and food that we had bought ourselves, not stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd still my dream never died. Even when my fingers were slipping into someone\u2019s pockets to take their hard earned Reul, I still remembered the figure of that Hunter with two guns blazing in and killing that monster. Our little territory was eventually taken over. Normally we were able to stay out of turf wars since we were such a small group. But one of the bigger groups made a power play to become a king of the north side of town. They didn\u2019t want to absorb us, they wanted to eradicate us. Orsik stayed behind to fight alone, giving us time to get away. As I left the hideout I looked back and saw the resignation on his face. He knew he was going to die yet he was still going to hold them off for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEven though I was only nine I had already learned a lot from him and a lot about how the world works. I wasn\u2019t the oldest but I also wasn\u2019t the youngest. The youngest of our group were two six year olds. But we ran and they chased us. The only other time I had ever been so scared was when that monster had killed my parents. The older ones kept pushing us on, sometimes staying behind to hold them off, sacrificing themselves as Orsik had. By the time we escaped into the wilds it was just me and four others, the two six year olds and two seven year olds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI pushed them on, as the oldest it fell to me to do what the others had done. I was the one that had to protect them like everyone else had protected us before. We traveled for days, living on the land, getting sick on some mushrooms and berries because we didn\u2019t know any better, but pushing on nonetheless. We were just a day outside this city and we thought we were home free when a monster attacked us. I was scared and I froze. I knew what I was supposed to do. It was my job to let them get away. But instead I ran. I left them all to fend for themselves and I ran for the city shields. I heard their screams as they were caught and killed. Screams that even now still haunt me sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSafe inside the city shields I ran into the nearest alley and hid. Berating myself for being all kinds of a fool. For being a coward for running away from my own death when everyone else had run towards it. A couple found me in that ally crying and shivering from the slight chilly air. A bunch of things happened but in the end they adopted me and took me into their home as their own son. Even gave me their last name. They were normal people, but their parents had both been Hunter\u2019s. I thought long and hard about my life then, and decided I would never run away again. I needed to get stronger and learn all I could if I wanted to be that guy. The one blazing in to the rescue. That\u2019s why I enrolled in the academy when I got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI try to forget about my past you know. Where I come from and the skills I learned as a street imp. But I can\u2019t. My fingers seem to move on their own even when my brain says to leave it alone. I know I\u2019m a pretty horrible person and people don\u2019t like me much. I do some pretty stupid things and have a bit of an attitude. But what am I supposed to do now? Without my legs I can\u2019t be a Hunter. I can\u2018t be the only thing I ever really wanted to be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just because you gave me some sob story about your past doesn\u2019t mean you will get any pity from me. Everyone has some reason or another they want to become Hunter\u2019s. You aren\u2019t the first street imp to claw your way into a Hunter academy. Or the first person to have their dreams shattered either. But we all find a way to move on or not. If you are so weak willed that you can\u2019t figure out a way to move forward then die. Take one of your guns and put a bullet in your own head. Because if all you plan on doing is moping around then you are worse than useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even bother turning over to look at him, simply showed him my back the entire time. What good did feeling such self pity accomplish anyway? I knew myself how useless it was. Compassion had a place, but pity helped no one. It only allowed a person to be weak. No matter what kind of past he had it didn\u2019t negate or make the way he had acted in the present ok. Not that I didn\u2019t have some understanding or feelings for what he was going through. I simply didn\u2019t know how else to express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard him sigh a bit as the sheets rustled and I assumed he turned his face away. We both lay in silence for a while until a commotion out in the hall caused me to turn my head in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 See my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMrs. Zelkov, please. He\u2019s suffering from burn out and needs a bit of rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door was shoved open as my mother strode inside, pulling a white haired girl with crimson eyes and wearing an ugly lime green dress behind her. The girl stood around four and a half feet tall and had the empty eyed expression of shock that made her look like a doll. My mother opened her mouth to say something when she saw me but the words seemed to catch in her throat. After a moment I saw her Hunter mask drop into place over top of the worry that had been there. I knew that open look of worry had been a calculated play of some sort, she was incapable of showing real emotions, simply using them to achieve her own ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like hell Riktal darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure I do. So what do you want mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked from me to the little girl and then back again, shaking her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. I\u2019ll let you think I believe that. As you can see I\u2019m fine, is their anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain she opened and closed her mouth as she tried to formulate words that just wouldn\u2019t come. Finally with another small shake of her head she turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Get well soon darling. I\u2019m going to be going on another mission with your father to Bornica. We will be gone for about a week or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGreat. Have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling the girl out after her, she left the room again. The nurse gave us both a small bow before leaving as well. Letting out another sigh I closed my eyes again, hoping sleep would come soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess you\u2019ve got problems of your own huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n`\t\u201cDon\u2019t act like you care. I don\u2019t even know you. Besides you tried to steal from me remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I deserve that. After you ran me off I realized how stupid I had been. My body sort of acted on it\u2019s own and a small part of my mind was telling me I was being stupid, but the rest just wouldn\u2019t listen. For what it\u2019s worth I am sorry for what I almost did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever. Words mean little, actions mean more. You can be sorry all you want but if you continue to act counter to that it makes a lie of that apology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLittle chance I will get to act like that ever again now is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you had best learn to make your words count if that\u2019s what you really believe. Now leave me alone please, I\u2019d like to get some rest if I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I said that I felt the fatigue fall in on me all at once. As if my body suddenly figured out what my brain had known for a while, it needed rest. My eyes burned even as I yawned, turning on my side away from Gregory and relaxing my muscles to make sleep come easier. A short nap until the end of school would revive me enough to pull me through the rest of the day and then a good night sleep would finish up the recovery process. I felt the darkness of sleep closing in even as I gave another yawn, burying my head deeper into the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTwists and turns along the paths of fate. Decision and consequence, regrets and judgments. This is life in a nutshell is it not?  For every choice you make there are a million that you don\u2019t. Whether because you simply decide not to take them or you don\u2019t even realize they are there. And once a choice is made it is set in stone, closing the doors to some possibilities while opening the doors to others that had never existed until that choice was made. And always that ever present question of what if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat about this day do you regret? What about this day do you wonder about? While most people do not have the chance to go back and do it over, you are not in that position. You were simply an observer into this single life. One with the power to alter the path he walked true, but an observer through a window nonetheless. In a place like this where time is meaningless, you have the option of reliving this day over and over. Making new and different choices to see where else Riktal might end up. To learn new truths about the world, answer questions and come up with new ones. So join me again whenever you wish traveler and I shall again bestow upon you the power of choice.</span></div></div>",

You think telling me your life story means anything? The only person it means anything to is you. It might pull at someone\u2019s heartstrings or bring you pity from the right people but those are your memories and your convictions not mine. Those are the reasons you are who you are and why you do what you do. So you will never walk again, big deal. You\u2019ve still got that mass of meat in your head you call a mind. Your legs may never move again but that doesn\u2019t mean your mind stopped moving. You want to be a Hunter so badly? What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut my legs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLetting out a frustrated growl I rolled out of bed and strode over to him, grabbing him up by his shirtfront and pulling him towards me until I was inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about your legs? Your legs didn\u2019t make you a Hunter. Your legs aren\u2019t the ones that dreamed of being the guy that saves the day! Your leg\u2019s didn\u2019t make the decision to enroll in this academy. From what you\u2019ve just said your legs have only allowed you to run away!. If you really want to be a Hunter then do it! Find a way to make it work, useless legs, wheelchair and all. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the pleading tone of his voice. The sound of someone lost with no clear path in front of him. I shook him hard before slapping his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is the oath of the Hunter? What are the rules that we live by? Answer me! Rule number one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter puts the safety of the people above all else. He will not balk at sacrificing his life for the good of all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRule number two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter never gives up. He fights until his last breath for the things he believes in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRule number three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe seemed to gain confidence then, his head coming up and his chest sticking out as he stared directly into my eyes. His voice became more sure, stronger. That note of pleading gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter is not his weapon. He is not his arms or his legs. A Hunter is his mind. He is an idea and an ideal. He is an example for the people in everything he does.  He brings comfort to those who need it, hope to the hopeless and justice to those who have been wronged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow tell me. Where in those rules does it say you can\u2019t become a Hunter? Will it be hard? Damn straight it will be hard! Will it be impossible? Only if you think it\u2019s impossible. So you might not be able to go out into the field slaying monsters anymore! There are still things you can do to uphold those things we live by. Become a top class alchemist and discover newer better potions, or learn how to create artifacts. Just because you can\u2019t walk doesn\u2019t prevent you from helping citizens in need of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019ve made some bad choices in life. Everyone has done that at some point in time. If they say differently they are a liar. You beat yourself up over running away when you wanted to be a Hunter. You\u2019re right that was a dirt bag move to do, even if you were only nine years old. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand why you did it. Those deaths will be on your head for the rest of your life. Are you going to let them be in vain? You ran to survive. You ran so you could realize your dream! Are you going to waste it all now over something like this? I ask again, is this the strength of your convictions? Because if it is then I\u2019m glad you are never going to be a Hunter. I wouldn\u2019t want someone like you watching my back or protecting my citizens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let go of his shirt, shoving him back down onto the bed before climbing back into mine and laying with my back to him. There was silence for a moment as I heard him shuffling around before he spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. I need to make the decisions I made mean something. I need to make up for the mistakes I made. Do you really think I can do it though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSliding up into a reclining position with the pillow propping up my back I looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll throw that question back at you. Do you think you can do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you are going to fail. If you really want this then you have to be one thousand percent committed. Becoming deaf to those who tell you that you can\u2019t and blind to those who will mock you. You must become so mentally strong that nothing, not even the end of the world can break you. Expect to fail more than you succeed and be ready to pick yourself back up to try again. That is what it will take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw him look down at his hands silently as he reclined in the bed like me. He twiddled his thumbs a few times before taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow can you be so strong? Able to have such conviction? Is it because you are from an old family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn part, because this is what I have trained to do from day one. I was wielding toy sword and shields in my hands in my crib. Instead of action figures I played with suits of armor and learned how to take apart and put weapons back together for fun. But I figured out long ago that this is what I was born to do. Even if I had been born a first generation I would still become a Hunter. That strength comes from my convictions. Because I decided long ago that nothing and no one is going to stop me. That I was willing to do anything to make my dream of becoming a Hunter a reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill\u2026 will you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could hear the hesitation in his voice. Hear how much it cost him to ask for help. He was putting aside his own ego to lower himself into asking for assistance. Something he probably wasn\u2019t used to doing. Slowly I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. We aren\u2019t friends and I\u2019m not going to become your crutch. If you really want to do this then you need to walk it alone for now until your convictions are unbreakable. Friends and those who will encourage you are helpful, but you need to get rid of that ego first. Otherwise you will fail. It sounds cruel but it\u2019s the truth. Kindness for you right now is a crutch that you will find easy to fall back on and slack off because of. But I\u2019ll be glad to slap you around some more if you lose sight of your desires. If you prove to me this is really the path you wish to take of course. Otherwise I won\u2019t waste my energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then there was a commotion out in the hall. I turned to the door in time to see it fly open and my mother come storming in followed by the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026See my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me and suddenly seemed to deflate a bit, looking at a loss for words. The crimson eyed girl with white hair she was dragging behind her just stared blankly, seeming to be barely alive. I saw my mother\u2019s work face come crashing down over top of the false worry as she suddenly found her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBurnout tends to have that affect on most people mother. So what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked from me to the girl and then at me, searching for what to say next. Finally she shook her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure I totally believe that one. But I\u2019ll let it slide. As you can see I am fine, is there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave another shake of her head before turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Get well soon darling. Me and your father are going on a mission to Bornica and won\u2019t be back for a week or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever. It doesn\u2019t affect me any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hesitated at the door for a moment longer, as if she expected me to say goodbye or something before letting out a sigh and leaving, dragging the girl behind her. The nurse gave us a small nod before closing the door and leaving again as well. I took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes with two fingers, resisting the urge to let out a long breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess you got your own problems too huh?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just because I  gave you some advice don\u2019t think that means I like you or anything. I still think you\u2019re a pretty scummy person overall. Now I need to try and get a quick nap to recover from this burnout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned on my side, facing my back towards him so it was clear our conversation was over. Closing my eyes I began a few meditation techniques to relax my body. Right now I was so tense my body wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep even though it needed it badly. Just as I was starting to feel the tension draining away and the edges of tiredness creeping in Gregory spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I deserve that. I really didn\u2019t make a good first impression did I? I know I\u2019m not a very good person. And I get blinded by fame and fortune more than I should. But whether or not you believe me, I am sorry about what I did earlier. My greed got in the way of my common sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you have stolen it if I hadn\u2019t come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to say no, but the truth is I probably would have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you can admit to that then I think you have what it takes to overcome your ego. Only time will prove if you can overcome everything else as well. Now let me get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs sleep began to engulf me I thought I heard him say something else. But his voice was so low I wasn\u2019t sure in my half awake state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day, another timeline full of possibilities made reality. I wonder, would this reality still exist if you were not there to see it with your own eyes? It is true that all realities and possibilities exist in this place between realities. So in a sense yes it would still exist, but at the same time it did not exist. It was simply stuck in that limbo of what if\u2019s and maybe\u2019s that make up that thing called possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo was it you, an outside observer, that made it real? Or could it be considered real without you ever seeing it? Such questions are what keep me going here in this space where time and space have no meaning just like everything else. Perhaps you, an outside observer, can answer them for me. Perhaps I who am the guardian of these infinite possibilities and infinite worlds am how do you say\u2026 too close, to the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again human if you wish to see what other possibilities this day had to offer.

Being from an old family isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. But don\u2019t let this little insight into my personal life go to your head. We aren\u2019t friends now just because I gave you some advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I sort of deserve the cold shoulder. I didn\u2019t exactly make a good first impression did I? I hate to admit it but I tend to let my desire for fame and fortune override my common sense more than I care for. It\u2019s really not an excuse for why I did what I did but I do regret it. Not because I was caught out but because I should have been able to stop myself in the first place. It\u2019s like a switch in my head just gets flipped sometimes you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you have stolen it if I hadn\u2019t come around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably. When I get like that I\u2019m not able to make the best judgments and just sort of let my desires take over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen for what it\u2019s worth, I accept your apology. If you can overcome your ego enough to tell me all of this and admit your intents like that then I think you have what it takes to be a Hunter. Whether you can overcome the obstacles in your path and have that unbreakable conviction remains to be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at his lap for a moment before returning his gaze to me. There was a small smile on his lips and confidence tinted with a bit of fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Zelkov. Thanks for saying all that to me. I know I\u2019m a bit of a jerk and you are totally in your right to hate me. But it gave me confidence and it helped me remember why I wanted to be a Hunter in the first place. Perhaps if things had been different we could have been friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo we wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d never be friends with someone like you. Personally I think you are the kind of person that gives Hunter\u2019s a bad name. Normally I would never associate with someone like you more than I had to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching over the side of the bed I dug in my bag until I found the packet of business cards in one of the side pockets. Riffling through them I quickly found the one I wanted before flicking it across the space to land on his lap. He picked it up and looked at it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArganov Electronics?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey are based out of Falandis city but he has an office down by the river on Hoffer road. Talk to Dimetrov Arganov. Him and his brother run the company together. They specialize in revolutionary electronics and artifacts. Pushing the boundary of merging magical artifacts with science. They make other things too of course, but that\u2019s what they sink most of their money into. They are the ones that came out with the artifact wheelchairs and exoskeleton limbs you see around. Last I heard they were designing a wheelchair artifact that will transform into a pair of legs to help paraplegic\u2019s walk. It\u2019s still in a prototype stage mind but if you tell them I sent you they might be able to give you a deal on something that can help you. I doubt you will be lucky enough to become a tester, but if you drop my name you are guaranteed something high quality at a cheaper price than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis sounds like something a friend would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you are serious about this, you will need the best equipment to help you. The Gregory I met in the classroom coveting my things is the person I could never be friends with. But the Gregory that would be willing to shell out a lot of money for such equipment simply to pursue a dream despite his setbacks and shortcomings. Now that Gregory, the one who is proving the strength of his convictions, I could see myself being friends with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I don\u2019t have that kind of money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot my problem. You don\u2019t need such a thing to press forward, it will simply make things easier on you to have it. This is just one of the many problems you will face if you want to make your dream a reality. If this is truly what you desire then you will find a way to overcome it. Or overcome it without such equipment. Either way it will prove your convictions and I could see myself being friends with someone like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at the card in his hand, wiping away a tear that tickled his eye. His finger ran over the lettering on the card before he spoke again, still staring at the bit of hope I had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould having something they made really make it easier for me to become a Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guarantee it. They\u2019ve been able to create a fully flexible hand that runs on a heart crystal being constantly supplied power from the user. It can\u2019t do anything fancy like go into a second phase or anything. But the Hunter has two fully functional hands and is currently fighting in the field as a tank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll find a way. I don\u2019t know how I will make that kind of money but I will find a way. Thanks Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust doing my job. Rule number three remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd rule number four. A Hunter will help other Hunter\u2019s if and when he or she can. Because we are all in the same business. I know that doesn\u2019t take into account deals between Hunter\u2019s, simply a general rule of thumb. But I also know I really didn\u2019t deserve this either. I haven\u2019t done anything worthwhile lately to get such a piece of fortune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I yawned as I rolled over on my side away from him. My body suddenly feeling the effects of the burnout as it told me it needed sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you had best change your life to make such a piece of fortune worth it. Consider it an advance payment on my belief in the person you want to be, not the person you are now. Now I need to get some sleep since the burnout just caught up to me with a vengeance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I closed my eyes and felt the darkness closing in on me I heard him whispering to himself before I finally passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAdvanced payment of who I want to be. I like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day, another timeline full of possibilities made reality. I wonder, would this reality still exist if you were not there to see it with your own eyes? It is true that all realities and possibilities exist in this place between realities.

I can complain and blame all I want but in the end it comes back to me. I always wanted to be a Hunter you know. I grew up poor, and I mean dirt poor. I lived with my parents in this two room little hovel that had more holes than walls it seemed. But I was happy you know. Then a monster came and destroyed the placed. Killed my parents in front of me too. Would have killed me as well but then this Hunter came out of nowhere and smashed it up. Even though I was only four I knew that I wanted to be that guy. The one coming to the rescue and saving the day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced at him covertly as I heard the choking of his voice, seeing tears coming down his face as he stared at the ceiling. It seemed like he had forgotten I was even there or that he was talking to me, lost in his own memories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey sent me to live with my aunt and uncle in Verindis city, but I ran away from there when I was seven. They were really mean and so was my cousin. I was just an extra mouth to feed to them and their precious little boy could do no wrong while I was treated like I was the monster. Fell in with a bunch of street imps, a man named Orsik lead the little gang. We were all still dirt poor, but we survived. Orsik was like a second father to me. We weren\u2019t all noble or anything though, I stole and picked pockets to survive just like everyone else. Even though we didn\u2019t have much, every year for Christmas and our birthday we managed to have a small feast or party and a few gifts. Gifts and food that we had bought ourselves, not stolen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd still my dream never died. Even when my fingers were slipping into someone\u2019s pockets to take their hard earned Reul, I still remembered the figure of that Hunter with two guns blazing in and killing that monster. Our little territory was eventually taken over. Normally we were able to stay out of turf wars since we were such a small group. But one of the bigger groups made a power play to become a king of the north side of town. They didn\u2019t want to absorb us, they wanted to eradicate us. Orsik stayed behind to fight alone, giving us time to get away. As I left the hideout I looked back and saw the resignation on his face. He knew he was going to die yet he was still going to hold them off for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEven though I was only nine I had already learned a lot from him and a lot about how the world works. I wasn\u2019t the oldest but I also wasn\u2019t the youngest. The youngest of our group were two six year olds. But we ran and they chased us. The only other time I had ever been so scared was when that monster had killed my parents. The older ones kept pushing us on, sometimes staying behind to hold them off, sacrificing themselves as Orsik had. By the time we escaped into the wilds it was just me and four others, the two six year olds and two seven year olds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI pushed them on, as the oldest it fell to me to do what the others had done. I was the one that had to protect them like everyone else had protected us before. We traveled for days, living on the land, getting sick on some mushrooms and berries because we didn\u2019t know any better, but pushing on nonetheless. We were just a day outside this city and we thought we were home free when a monster attacked us. I was scared and I froze. I knew what I was supposed to do. It was my job to let them get away. But instead I ran. I left them all to fend for themselves and I ran for the city shields. I heard their screams as they were caught and killed. Screams that even now still haunt me sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSafe inside the city shields I ran into the nearest alley and hid. Berating myself for being all kinds of a fool. For being a coward for running away from my own death when everyone else had run towards it. A couple found me in that ally crying and shivering from the slight chilly air. A bunch of things happened but in the end they adopted me and took me into their home as their own son. Even gave me their last name. They were normal people, but their parents had both been Hunter\u2019s. I thought long and hard about my life then, and decided I would never run away again. I needed to get stronger and learn all I could if I wanted to be that guy. The one blazing in to the rescue. That\u2019s why I enrolled in the academy when I got the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI try to forget about my past you know. Where I come from and the skills I learned as a street imp. But I can\u2019t. My fingers seem to move on their own even when my brain says to leave it alone. I know I\u2019m a pretty horrible person and people don\u2019t like me much. I do some pretty stupid things and have a bit of an attitude. But what am I supposed to do now? Without my legs I can\u2019t be a Hunter. I can\u2018t be the only thing I ever really wanted to be.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just because you gave me some sob story about your past doesn\u2019t mean you will get any pity from me. Everyone has some reason or another they want to become Hunter\u2019s. You aren\u2019t the first street imp to claw your way into a Hunter academy. Or the first person to have their dreams shattered either. But we all find a way to move on or not. If you are so weak willed that you can\u2019t figure out a way to move forward then die. Take one of your guns and put a bullet in your own head. Because if all you plan on doing is moping around then you are worse than useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even bother turning over to look at him, simply showed him my back the entire time. What good did feeling such self pity accomplish anyway? I knew myself how useless it was. Compassion had a place, but pity helped no one. It only allowed a person to be weak. No matter what kind of past he had it didn\u2019t negate or make the way he had acted in the present ok. Not that I didn\u2019t have some understanding or feelings for what he was going through. I simply didn\u2019t know how else to express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard him sigh a bit as the sheets rustled and I assumed he turned his face away. We both lay in silence for a while until a commotion out in the hall caused me to turn my head in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026 See my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMrs. Zelkov, please. He\u2019s suffering from burn out and needs a bit of rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door was shoved open as my mother strode inside, pulling a white haired girl with crimson eyes and wearing an ugly lime green dress behind her. The girl stood around four and a half feet tall and had the empty eyed expression of shock that made her look like a doll. My mother opened her mouth to say something when she saw me but the words seemed to catch in her throat. After a moment I saw her Hunter mask drop into place over top of the worry that had been there. I knew that open look of worry had been a calculated play of some sort, she was incapable of showing real emotions, simply using them to achieve her own ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like hell Riktal darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure I do. So what do you want mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked from me to the little girl and then back again, shaking her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing, I just wanted to make sure you were all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. I\u2019ll let you think I believe that. As you can see I\u2019m fine, is their anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain she opened and closed her mouth as she tried to formulate words that just wouldn\u2019t come. Finally with another small shake of her head she turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Get well soon darling. I\u2019m going to be going on another mission with your father to Bornica. We will be gone for about a week or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGreat. Have fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling the girl out after her, she left the room again. The nurse gave us both a small bow before leaving as well. Letting out another sigh I closed my eyes again, hoping sleep would come soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess you\u2019ve got problems of your own huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n`\t\u201cDon\u2019t act like you care. I don\u2019t even know you. Besides you tried to steal from me remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I deserve that. After you ran me off I realized how stupid I had been. My body sort of acted on it\u2019s own and a small part of my mind was telling me I was being stupid, but the rest just wouldn\u2019t listen. For what it\u2019s worth I am sorry for what I almost did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever. Words mean little, actions mean more. You can be sorry all you want but if you continue to act counter to that it makes a lie of that apology.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLittle chance I will get to act like that ever again now is there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you had best learn to make your words count if that\u2019s what you really believe. Now leave me alone please, I\u2019d like to get some rest if I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I said that I felt the fatigue fall in on me all at once. As if my body suddenly figured out what my brain had known for a while, it needed rest. My eyes burned even as I yawned, turning on my side away from Gregory and relaxing my muscles to make sleep come easier. A short nap until the end of school would revive me enough to pull me through the rest of the day and then a good night sleep would finish up the recovery process. I felt the darkness of sleep closing in even as I gave another yawn, burying my head deeper into the pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTwists and turns along the paths of fate. Decision and consequence, regrets and judgments. This is life in a nutshell is it not?  For every choice you make there are a million that you don\u2019t. Whether because you simply decide not to take them or you don\u2019t even realize they are there. And once a choice is made it is set in stone, closing the doors to some possibilities while opening the doors to others that had never existed until that choice was made. And always that ever present question of what if.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat about this day do you regret? What about this day do you wonder about? While most people do not have the chance to go back and do it over, you are not in that position. You were simply an observer into this single life. One with the power to alter the path he walked true, but an observer through a window nonetheless. In a place like this where time is meaningless, you have the option of reliving this day over and over. Making new and different choices to see where else Riktal might end up. To learn new truths about the world, answer questions and come up with new ones. So join me again whenever you wish traveler and I shall again bestow upon you the power of choice.</span></div></div>",

You think telling me your life story means anything? The only person it means anything to is you. It might pull at someone\u2019s heartstrings or bring you pity from the right people but those are your memories and your convictions not mine. Those are the reasons you are who you are and why you do what you do. So you will never walk again, big deal. You\u2019ve still got that mass of meat in your head you call a mind. Your legs may never move again but that doesn\u2019t mean your mind stopped moving. You want to be a Hunter so badly? What\u2019s stopping you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut my legs\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLetting out a frustrated growl I rolled out of bed and strode over to him, grabbing him up by his shirtfront and pulling him towards me until I was inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about your legs! Your legs didn\u2019t make you a Hunter! Your legs aren\u2019t the ones that dreamed of being the guy that saves the day! Your leg\u2019s didn\u2019t make the decision to enroll in this academy! From what you\u2019ve just said your legs have only allowed you to run away!. If you really want to be a Hunter then do it! Find a way to make it work, useless legs, wheelchair and all. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the pleading tone of his voice. The sound of someone lost with no clear path in front of him. I shook him hard before slapping his face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is the oath of the Hunter? What are the rules that we live by? Answer me! Rule number one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter puts the safety of the people above all else. He will not balk at sacrificing his life for the good of all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRule number two!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter never gives up. He fights until his last breath for the things he believes in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRule number three!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe seemed to gain confidence then, his head coming up and his chest sticking out as he stared directly into my eyes. His voice became more sure, stronger. That note of pleading gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter is not his weapon. He is not his arms or his legs. A Hunter is his mind. He is an idea and an ideal. He is an example for the people in everything he does.  He brings comfort to those who need it, hope to the hopeless and justice to those who have been wronged.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow tell me. Where in those rules does it say you can\u2019t become a Hunter? Will it be hard? Damn straight it will be hard! Will it be impossible? Only if you think it\u2019s impossible. So you might not be able to go out into the field slaying monsters anymore! There are still things you can do to uphold those things we live by. Become a top class alchemist and discover newer better potions, or learn how to create artifacts. Just because you can\u2019t walk doesn\u2019t prevent you from helping citizens in need of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019ve made some bad choices in life. Everyone has done that at some point in time. If they say differently they are a liar. You beat yourself up over running away when you wanted to be a Hunter. You\u2019re right that was a dirt bag move to do, even if you were only nine years old. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t understand why you did it. Those deaths will be on your head for the rest of your life. Are you going to let them be in vain? You ran to survive. You ran so you could realize your dream! Are you going to waste it all now over something like this? I ask again, is this the strength of your convictions? Because if it is then I\u2019m glad you are never going to be a Hunter. I wouldn\u2019t want someone like you watching my back or protecting my citizens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let go of his shirt, shoving him back down onto the bed before climbing back into mine and laying with my back to him. There was silence for a moment as I heard him shuffling around before he spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. I need to make the decisions I made mean something. I need to make up for the mistakes I made. Do you really think I can do it though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSliding up into a reclining position with the pillow propping up my back I looked over at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll throw that question back at you. Do you think you can do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you are going to fail. If you really want this then you have to be one thousand percent committed. Becoming deaf to those who tell you that you can\u2019t and blind to those who will mock you. You must become so mentally strong that nothing, not even the end of the world can break you. Expect to fail more than you succeed and be ready to pick yourself back up to try again. That is what it will take.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw him look down at his hands silently as he reclined in the bed like me. He twiddled his thumbs a few times before taking a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow can you be so strong? Able to have such conviction? Is it because you are from an old family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn part, because this is what I have trained to do from day one. I was wielding toy sword and shields in my hands in my crib. Instead of action figures I played with suits of armor and learned how to take apart and put weapons back together for fun. But I figured out long ago that this is what I was born to do. Even if I had been born a first generation I would still become a Hunter. That strength comes from my convictions. Because I decided long ago that nothing and no one is going to stop me. That I was willing to do anything to make my dream of becoming a Hunter a reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill\u2026 will you help me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could hear the hesitation in his voice. Hear how much it cost him to ask for help. He was putting aside his own ego to lower himself into asking for assistance. Something he probably wasn\u2019t used to doing. Slowly I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. We aren\u2019t friends and I\u2019m not going to become your crutch. If you really want to do this then you need to walk it alone for now until your convictions are unbreakable. Friends and those who will encourage you are helpful, but you need to get rid of that ego first. Otherwise you will fail. It sounds cruel but it\u2019s the truth. Kindness for you right now is a crutch that you will find easy to fall back on and slack off because of. But I\u2019ll be glad to slap you around some more if you lose sight of your desires. If you prove to me this is really the path you wish to take of course. Otherwise I won\u2019t waste my energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then there was a commotion out in the hall. I turned to the door in time to see it fly open and my mother come storming in followed by the nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026See my son!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me and suddenly seemed to deflate a bit, looking at a loss for words. The crimson eyed girl with white hair she was dragging behind her just stared blankly, seeming to be barely alive. I saw my mother\u2019s work face come crashing down over top of the false worry as she suddenly found her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou look like hell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBurnout tends to have that affect on most people mother. So what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked from me to the girl and then at me, searching for what to say next. Finally she shook her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. I just wanted to make sure you were ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure I totally believe that one. But I\u2019ll let it slide. As you can see I am fine, is there anything else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave another shake of her head before turning to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Get well soon darling. Me and your father are going on a mission to Bornica and won\u2019t be back for a week or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever. It doesn\u2019t affect me any.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hesitated at the door for a moment longer, as if she expected me to say goodbye or something before letting out a sigh and leaving, dragging the girl behind her. The nurse gave us a small nod before closing the door and leaving again as well. I took off my glasses and rubbed my eyes with two fingers, resisting the urge to let out a long breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess you got your own problems too huh?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Just because I  gave you some advice don\u2019t think that means I like you or anything. I still think you\u2019re a pretty scummy person overall. Now I need to try and get a quick nap to recover from this burnout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned on my side, facing my back towards him so it was clear our conversation was over. Closing my eyes I began a few meditation techniques to relax my body. Right now I was so tense my body wouldn\u2019t be able to fall asleep even though it needed it badly. Just as I was starting to feel the tension draining away and the edges of tiredness creeping in Gregory spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I deserve that. I really didn\u2019t make a good first impression did I? I know I\u2019m not a very good person. And I get blinded by fame and fortune more than I should. But whether or not you believe me, I am sorry about what I did earlier. My greed got in the way of my common sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you have stolen it if I hadn\u2019t come back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to say no, but the truth is I probably would have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you can admit to that then I think you have what it takes to overcome your ego. Only time will prove if you can overcome everything else as well. Now let me get some rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs sleep began to engulf me I thought I heard him say something else. But his voice was so low I wasn\u2019t sure in my half awake state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day, another timeline full of possibilities made reality. I wonder, would this reality still exist if you were not there to see it with your own eyes? It is true that all realities and possibilities exist in this place between realities. So in a sense yes it would still exist, but at the same time it did not exist. It was simply stuck in that limbo of what if\u2019s and maybe\u2019s that make up that thing called possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo was it you, an outside observer, that made it real? Or could it be considered real without you ever seeing it? Such questions are what keep me going here in this space where time and space have no meaning just like everything else. Perhaps you, an outside observer, can answer them for me. Perhaps I who am the guardian of these infinite possibilities and infinite worlds am how do you say\u2026 too close, to the subject matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again human if you wish to see what other possibilities this day had to offer.

Being from an old family isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. But don\u2019t let this little insight into my personal life go to your head. We aren\u2019t friends now just because I gave you some advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I sort of deserve the cold shoulder. I didn\u2019t exactly make a good first impression did I? I hate to admit it but I tend to let my desire for fame and fortune override my common sense more than I care for. It\u2019s really not an excuse for why I did what I did but I do regret it. Not because I was caught out but because I should have been able to stop myself in the first place. It\u2019s like a switch in my head just gets flipped sometimes you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you have stolen it if I hadn\u2019t come around?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know, probably. When I get like that I\u2019m not able to make the best judgments and just sort of let my desires take over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen for what it\u2019s worth, I accept your apology. If you can overcome your ego enough to tell me all of this and admit your intents like that then I think you have what it takes to be a Hunter. Whether you can overcome the obstacles in your path and have that unbreakable conviction remains to be seen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at his lap for a moment before returning his gaze to me. There was a small smile on his lips and confidence tinted with a bit of fear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Zelkov. Thanks for saying all that to me. I know I\u2019m a bit of a jerk and you are totally in your right to hate me. But it gave me confidence and it helped me remember why I wanted to be a Hunter in the first place. Perhaps if things had been different we could have been friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo we wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d never be friends with someone like you. Personally I think you are the kind of person that gives Hunter\u2019s a bad name. Normally I would never associate with someone like you more than I had to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching over the side of the bed I dug in my bag until I found the packet of business cards in one of the side pockets. Riffling through them I quickly found the one I wanted before flicking it across the space to land on his lap. He picked it up and looked at it curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArganov Electronics?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey are based out of Falandis city but he has an office down by the river on Hoffer road. Talk to Dimetrov Arganov. Him and his brother run the company together. They specialize in revolutionary electronics and artifacts. Pushing the boundary of merging magical artifacts with science. They make other things too of course, but that\u2019s what they sink most of their money into. They are the ones that came out with the artifact wheelchairs and exoskeleton limbs you see around. Last I heard they were designing a wheelchair artifact that will transform into a pair of legs to help paraplegic\u2019s walk. It\u2019s still in a prototype stage mind but if you tell them I sent you they might be able to give you a deal on something that can help you. I doubt you will be lucky enough to become a tester, but if you drop my name you are guaranteed something high quality at a cheaper price than normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis sounds like something a friend would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you are serious about this, you will need the best equipment to help you. The Gregory I met in the classroom coveting my things is the person I could never be friends with. But the Gregory that would be willing to shell out a lot of money for such equipment simply to pursue a dream despite his setbacks and shortcomings. Now that Gregory, the one who is proving the strength of his convictions, I could see myself being friends with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I don\u2019t have that kind of money!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot my problem. You don\u2019t need such a thing to press forward, it will simply make things easier on you to have it. This is just one of the many problems you will face if you want to make your dream a reality. If this is truly what you desire then you will find a way to overcome it. Or overcome it without such equipment. Either way it will prove your convictions and I could see myself being friends with someone like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at the card in his hand, wiping away a tear that tickled his eye. His finger ran over the lettering on the card before he spoke again, still staring at the bit of hope I had given him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould having something they made really make it easier for me to become a Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guarantee it. They\u2019ve been able to create a fully flexible hand that runs on a heart crystal being constantly supplied power from the user. It can\u2019t do anything fancy like go into a second phase or anything. But the Hunter has two fully functional hands and is currently fighting in the field as a tank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll find a way. I don\u2019t know how I will make that kind of money but I will find a way. Thanks Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust doing my job. Rule number three remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd rule number four. A Hunter will help other Hunter\u2019s if and when he or she can. Because we are all in the same business. I know that doesn\u2019t take into account deals between Hunter\u2019s, simply a general rule of thumb. But I also know I really didn\u2019t deserve this either. I haven\u2019t done anything worthwhile lately to get such a piece of fortune.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I yawned as I rolled over on my side away from him. My body suddenly feeling the effects of the burnout as it told me it needed sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen you had best change your life to make such a piece of fortune worth it. Consider it an advance payment on my belief in the person you want to be, not the person you are now. Now I need to get some sleep since the burnout just caught up to me with a vengeance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I closed my eyes and felt the darkness closing in on me I heard him whispering to himself before I finally passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAdvanced payment of who I want to be. I like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day, another timeline full of possibilities made reality.

If I looked at it only as which of the two was worse off then Gregory won out. Even if inwardly I felt he didn\u2019t deserve it, that was just my personal feelings coming into play. And for a decision like this such feelings had no place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPushing Lilia, who\u2019s hands were covered in Gregory\u2019s blood as she tried desperately to heal him to the side, I took a kneeling position next to the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBack off Lilia, I can see you are almost at your limit. No need to get burned out completely. Focus on patching Jethic up so he can make it to the nurses office, I\u2019ll take care of Gregory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how?

As she slowly moved away to take care of Jethic I pointed at the caster I had saved while the Arena Master told everyone to get back and give me some space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou! Marsa right? That magma ball you made earlier against the Glif. Can you make another one? But this time hold it for five or ten minutes without actually casting it away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2026I think so.

Get ready to make it when I give the signal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to breath evenly, going into a meditative state and drowning out all outside interference as I set the vial of blood on the ground in front of me. Slowly I took my gloves off and laid them down carefully next to the vial. My mind needed to be incredibly focused for what I was about to do since it would be the equivalent of brain surgery with a hammer and nails. When I was ready I picked up the vial, breaking the seal before using the blade on a glove to cut open Gregory\u2019s re-healed flesh, taking a few drops of blood as it came out. I told Marsa to summon forth the flames even as I clutched the gloves in my hand waiting on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve had a good run old friend and you have served me well. Now sing a final song for me. Sing your own eulogy. Phase three activate. Ripper\u2019s memories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe energy began to flow into me as the heart crystal released it all in one shot. I felt as if my skin would explode from the amount of magic coursing in my veins. As the ball of magma burst into existence floating at the end of the girl\u2019s staff I threw the vial inside of it seconds before ripping the yellow gem out of the gloves and smashing it against the ground before the gloves could finish transforming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe magic began to go out of control as it\u2019s connection to the magical circuit\u2019s regulating it was destroyed. Within seconds I had the fragment of heart crystal that had been safely ensconced inside the gem flying into the magma after the vial of blood. I held out my hands, plunging them deep into the magma ball as well while shoving that wild energy in after it, keeping just enough so I didn\u2019t burn alive myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven so I could smell singed hair and burnt flesh as I focused in on what was going on inside the ball with my mind. Ignoring the heat licking at my arms. Since I couldn\u2019t actually see the ingredients I had to play it by instinct and intuition. Constantly mixing it with magic instead of a glass rod. Counting out the seconds in my head instead of watching for the color changes. A few seconds off could make all of this for nothing. Producing little more then toxic chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy magic was draining fast and I had to pull more and more away from what I was using to protect my arms, the heat slowly becoming more than just a distant annoyance in my mind. Sweat dripped down my face and my head began to throb from the sheer focus this took. Suddenly a cooling shield wrapped over me as someone else took up the task, allowing me to dedicate myself completely to the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe last minute began counting down in my head as my magic almost hit it\u2019s limit. In my minds eye it was ready so I pulled my hands out, summoning freezing water and winds to surround the magma with the last of my strength. I made sure it was completely surrounded before crushing my hands together when the mental timer hit zero. The two opposing forces warred with each other before there was an implosion, all that magic falling in on itself. Seconds latter it exploded outward again creating a warm steam cloud that obscured everything inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I reached in anyway after hearing the faint tinkling sound of glass hitting the floor. When I pulled it out I grinned to myself upon seeing the near clear liquid inside of a silvery, almost reflective, vial. Popping off the cork I turned to the unconscious Gregory and pushed down on the sides of his mouth, making it open automatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry about this but you should be glad you\u2019re unconscious so you don\u2019t have to taste it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlowly pouring the liquid into his mouth I massaged his throat, making him reflexively drink. Once that was done I sat back and waited. At first it seemed like nothing was happening. Then his body began to spasm like some mad puppeteer was jerking him around. I heard sickening crunching and grinding noises as his legs flopped and twisted every which way. His back arched moments before he sat bolt upright screaming at the top of his lungs. He looked around wildly while his breath quickened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat happened! Where am I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re still in the arena and I just saved your sorry hide. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia Looked over at me in shock, hope written all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHurry and do that again for Jethic!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I shook my head sadly the Arena Master spoke up for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe can\u2019t. Even if he had another heart crystal on him right now he has no more giant\u2019s blood, only one vial dropped. And even if he did have another vial he\u2019s tapped out. It took all his magic to create just that one heal-all elixir. Besides even if you don\u2019t want to admit it, you know he has passed the point of no return where healing potions of any type just won\u2019t work on him anymore. At least not as effectively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got slowly to my feet, feeling a bit shaky as Gregory stood up as well. He looked a bit confused about what was happening but seemed to understand I had somehow made a choice to save his life. With a grin he held his hand out to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t really get it but I guess I owe you my thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI simply glared at him before slapping his hand away, not even bothering to hide my disdain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make us friends. I made my decision on purely impersonal reasons. I still think you are scum and all of this was your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard some of the whispers from the class then. Words such as why I had chosen Gregory over Jethic when Jethic deserved it more. The grumblings of how Gregory must have somehow won me over or had some dirt on me. It never took long for rumors and wild theories to emerge no matter where you went. Gregory heard those whispers too as a cocky look came over his face and his chest puffed out a bit while he looked around at the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it\u2019s obvious he saved me because he knows I\u2019m better then Jethic. That I\u2019m going to be the greatest Hunter and he wants to give me that chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGritting my teeth I brought my fist around just as he turned to face me, connecting solidly with his temple as I bore him back to the ground, making his head bounce off the treated wood. He was unconscious again before I even pulled my fist away. With a sneer I spit on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo back to sleep. I liked you better that way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI managed to take a few steps away from him, making it to the wall before the headache and light headed feeling of burnout washed over me. Sliding down the wall I closed my eyes, letting the darkness of oblivion take me with a sigh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tWhite washed walls and ceiling, that\u2019s what met my eyes when I managed to crack them open against the burning sensation that wanted me to keep them closed. I knew I had to be in the nurses office, it just had that hospital feel to it. Letting my head roll to the left I saw the nurse applying her healing powers on Jethic who was sitting quietly propped up in bed with a somber look on his face. Marsa, Daniel, and Lilia were all talking to the principal in low voices by the door but I couldn\u2019t catch more than a random word or two of their conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the three noticed I was awake they stopped talking, Marsa giving me a bit of a glare before walking out of the room. Daniel also gave me a speculative look, not one of condemnation, but not one of approval either. Perhaps he was wondering what he would have done in my shoes and couldn\u2019t tell if I had made the right call or not. Whatever the case he nodded his head in my direction slightly before saying he needed to go or he would be late for class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLilia just gave me a soft sad expression tinted with a bit of anger. Probably because I hadn\u2019t been able to save both of them. But her eyes didn\u2019t say she blamed me too much for my choice. She too gave me a small head bow, offering me a small smile before leaving the room. The principal wheeled over to the right side of the bed, dumping my duffle bag on the floor before offering me a smile of consolation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know it must have been a hard decision for you. I also know that not many could have done what you did. Even among top class Hunter\u2019s making a Heal-all elixir like that is difficult. Of the teachers at this school I would guess maybe seven or eight others might have been able to pull that off. For what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t blame you for the choice you made. You helped save my students and for that I am grateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave my hand a quick pat before spinning her wheelchair around to head for the door. She opened it expertly while backing out, letting it swing shut behind her with a small thud.  Next to me the nurse finally sat back on her stool with a sigh, looking at Jethic with a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I did what I could. You shouldn\u2019t have much problems with your back as long as you don\u2019t try doing anything too strenuous. The arm is going to have to come off, I\u2019m sure you knew that already though. I\u2019m not equipped to do something like that here though, you need to go to the hospital for that. I can cauterize battle stumps but fine cutting like that is beyond me. Your insides are still a bit of a mess but I stopped the internal bleeding and shored up your immune system to help fight off the infections.  Take it easy for a while to let your ribs heal naturally. Thankfully I only had to re-break two of them to get them to set right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to beat around the bush nurse. I know what this means even if you are too nice to say it directly. My life as a tank is over. Hell my life as a Hunter that goes out to slay monster\u2019s is over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nurse sighed as she nodded her head, getting up to go over to her desk where she sat again, beginning to write something on a paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. Wearing plate armor and swinging around a heavy sword or shield is beyond you now. You try any of that and your back will give out on you. And if it does there\u2019s going to be no putting it back in place. You will be a hunchback from then on. I think about thirty pounds will be about your limit. You will have to test and learn it yourself, but your body should warn you when it\u2019s too much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head, looking down at his lap as he clenched and unclenched his left fist slowly. He didn\u2019t seem inclined to talking and I wasn\u2019t inclined to begin a conversation or see any accusation in his eyes so it worked out. The nurse finished writing whatever it was, probably a report of some kind, before excusing herself and leaving the room. Jethic continued to stare at his hand as I turned on my side away from him, closing my eyes and trying to get some natural sleep to regain a bit of energy. Personally I would rather leave, but I knew the nurse would be against that idea. I knew my body needed rest, even if it didn\u2019t feel like it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t feel a bit of resentment at your choice. But I also realize it was probably a hard decision to make. Part of me wonders why you chose him over me. What it was you saw in him that I didn\u2019t have. At the same time I figure you made the choice on factors I couldn\u2019t even comprehend. The principal told us about the Heal-all elixir while you were unconscious so I know how much you gave up for Gregory, even if he was a bit ungrateful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I want you to know that this isn\u2019t going to stop me. In the end it\u2019s just an arm. I might never be able to pick up a shield again or go out into the field wearing my plate armor, but I\u2019m going to become a Hunter. There are all kinds of Hunter\u2019s right? I mean alchemist that make potion\u2019s, ones that search out new applications of heart crystal. Those who strategize and advise government officials. Perhaps I could even become a teacher and train the next generation of Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned over, pulling myself into a reclining position before looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shrugged absently while continuing to look at his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not really sure. I suppose I thought you would want to know. In case it was on your mind or something. Old Markus, he is the Hunter that taught me much of what I know by the way, he said things like this can happen to a Hunter. That it happens more often then one might think. But he said how a person handles such setbacks is the mark of a true Hunter. Rule number three you know? He also said Hunter\u2019s end up making some hard choices and they usually wonder if they made the right one. We can\u2019t know for sure the outcome of our choices, we simply do what we think is best and deal with the outcomes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching over the side of the bed I dug through the side pockets of my duffle bag until I found the small packet of business cards. I searched through them quickly before flicking the one I wanted across the space between us to land on his bed. He picked it up, reading the name one the card. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArganov Electronics? Isn\u2019t that the Hunter brother\u2019s who try to merge science items with artifacts in unique ways?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly a little. A regular of my uncles talks about them sometimes. Even gave me a few old magazines with some articles about them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell they have a sub office down on Hoffer road that the younger brother Demitrov Arganov runs. If you go down there and drop my name I\u2019m sure you can get a good deal on an artifact arm. As far as I know they haven\u2019t made an entire arm before, but they have had some success with fully articulated hands. Even if it\u2019s just a bunch of pistons and gears from shoulder to wrist and a fully functional hand, that\u2019s something. I\u2019m sure they would enjoy the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for the offer, but I don\u2019t have that kind of money. My aunt and uncle aren\u2019t exactly poor, but we don\u2019t have much to spare. And my family up north broke what little savings they had to send me to the academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe awkwardly flung the card back to me with his left hand but still managed to land it on my lap. Picking it up I looked at the gold embossed lettering, running my finger over the indents for a moment before looking back up at him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cIf you\u2019d like, you can work for the money. I\u2019ve got a lot of old dusty rooms in my house that could use a good cleaning. And a bunch of old things that need rearranged or gone through. I\u2019m the only one there most of the time and honestly, I just can\u2019t be bothered to do it all myself. You can take your time learning your limits and getting used to your new center of balance. Plus if there is anything you want to keep of the stuff I plan on throwing out you can have it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds a bit like you are taking pity on me. I might not be as good as you but I still have my own pride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease I\u2019m not the type to give other people pity if I can help it. If you take the job I will pay you well but not extravagantly, since it will be coming out of my living allowance. I won\u2019t purposefully throw out good weapons, armor, or items just for you to take. A lot of it really will most likely be junk. That\u2019s not to say old pieces of gear I outgrew or broken artifacts won\u2019t find their way into the pile. Still such things can fetch a bit of extra money if sold to the right people who know how to refurbish or fix them. It will be work, real honest sweat inducing work. And it will take you a while to make the kind of money you need for an artifact arm, even if you drop my name for a discount. At least six months or more for a good down payment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou being real with me here? This isn\u2019t just something to make me feel better or make me feel like I am earning the money when I really aint?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTotally real. My decision to save Gregory over you was purely impersonal. But that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t want to save you too. I admit I can be a bit of a Donglemeister, but I\u2019m human like everyone else. I have feelings of my own and I can be moved by the plights of others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow expensive we talking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, let\u2019s find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly pulled up my communication spell, swiping the small imprint square on the business card to temporarily link me up with the business. I got one of the receptionist on the third buzz and then a direct line to Demetrov once I told her my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! What a pleasant surprise! I was just thinking of calling you! We got a few new artifacts we\u2019d like you to field test for us if you can. We\u2019ve already gotten data from some lower classed Hunter\u2019s and even a good bit from civilians and the military. But we haven\u2019t had any chance to get feedback from higher ranked Hunter\u2019s that can push them to their limits. Me and my brother could do it, but we are afraid we won\u2019t have an impartial eye since it is our products. So what do you say? Interested?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood to hear from you too Demetrov. Same as always I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIndeed on the spell in front of me was a flat image of Demetrov in his white lab coat and black rubber gloves up to his elbows. His hair stuck out in all directions as if someone had just zapped him with lightning. His eyes looked three times larger than they actually were from behind the magnification goggles as he blinked at me and grinned, a single tooth missing from a small explosion last year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot the same Riktal, we are never the same as the day before or even the second before. Our bodies are constantly evolving and dying, changing with each breath. Have you forgotten what I taught you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my hands, patting them in the air to stop him. If I let him go off on one of his lectures he could go on for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnough! Spare me the scientific psychobabble!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine fine. So what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the sudden change in topic. This was just like Demetrov. His brother was a bit better but could jump around just as much from subject to subject with a drop of the hat. I quickly explained what was going on, twisting the spell so he could get a look at Jethic\u2019s useless right arm while he rubbed his chin thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm. It probably won\u2019t be too hard. We did make that hand, and we\u2019ve had some success with partially mobile arms. Granted the arms were attached to artifacts and not a human body, but the concept of linking it to the magic shouldn\u2019t be much different. I can\u2019t promise full articulation but there would be enough movement for most normal everyday things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what kind of price would he be looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see Demetrov thinking for a moment, his fingers making numbers in the air while his other one  moved rapidly in nonsense patterns, probably counting and imagining the parts he would need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFull price would be around a hundred thousand Reul for such an artifact. That\u2019s low end of course, using the bare minimum of supplies. But if you are referring him we could probably drop it down to seventy thousand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on Dem! You can do better then that right? What if I tested those products for you? Think you could drop it a bit more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost I could drop it down to even at that is sixty thousand. That will let me clear costs and make a small profit as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow many of these kinds of artifacts have you made before Dem?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell none of course. That hand was the only thing that comes close.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen how do we know it would work well? Normally you would have to go through a bunch of red tape to get something like this approved through the business administration right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell yes now that you mention it that is true. Even if we made an arm for the boy it would still be two years minimum before it was considered safe. That hand took a year and it was just a bunch of servo fingers manipulated by the hosts own magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen what if you got it passed the administration quicker saying he is one of the first testers? You already have proof of concept and function in the hand you made for Horris, and you\u2019ve created working arms with the AZ-100 series of wheelchairs. It\u2019s not a stretch for them to give you a go ahead for such a project when all you are really doing is merging the two together. If you do that couldn\u2019t you offset some of your costs with funding the administration would provide?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are one devious little monster you know that Riktal? That\u2019s why I never play poker with you anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSimply good business strategy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you\u2019re right. We could get away with that. Would still be at least six months before we could get the go ahead though. With the funding from the association backing such a project I could probably go as low as thirty thousand, twenty five tops. And he would have to be willing to keep in touch on a regular basis, at least twice a year checkups for five years minimum.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd you would pay for those visits as well as any maintenance on the artifact?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. It would still be considered a prototype, so we would have no idea what may or may not go wrong with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Jethic who\u2019s mouth was opening and closing in surprise while his eyes stared at me as big as saucers. I grinned as I raised my eyebrow at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell how does that sound Jethic? I\u2019m sure  in six months or so we can make you around thirty thousand Reul. And you will be guaranteed maintenance on it for the next five years or so. You won\u2019t be getting it for free and you will have to work for it, but you will have earned it in the end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2026I\u2026 yes, I accept.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe rubbed at his face to wipe away the tears forming in his eyes as his voice caught in his throat. My grin grew wider as I said my goodbyes to Demetrov who promised to get to work on the arm right away. Turning on my side away from him I pulled the covers over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that we have things straightened out, I am going to pass into oblivion now. The burnout just caught up to me with a vengeance and I am finding it hard to stay awake. We will hash out the details of your job tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis voice was all choked up and I could barely make out his soft words through his emotions, but I still understood what he was saying. With a bit of a grumble I closed my eyes, letting the darkness begin to descend as I answered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet. I\u2019m going to make you work for that money. I\u2019m sure you will be cursing me soon enough as you wonder why you ever agreed to working for me. I\u2019m the worst monster you will ever face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo, the day ends on a high note I suppose. Was this the best ending to the day though? Could things have ended better? I know they could have ended worse. Are you questioning any of the choices you made? Perhaps questioning why you made them. Were you impersonal in your decision making, or were you influenced by events? Did you simply save Gregory because you believed things would turn out all right for Jethic? If that\u2019s true, then what does that say about you? How would you have felt if it hadn\u2019t turned out so well? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou humans have a very strange and varied way of looking at things I have found. You are not the first I have given this temporary power to and you will not be the last. Each one of you use it in most interesting ways and for the most interesting of reasons. Why I remember this one girl who purposefully took her person down the most dangerous routes because she hated men. But I digress, such things are not for you to know, lest they taint your perception of things in the future. Come again mortal, and test your powers as a god.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve got a few connections around the city that would hire you on my say so. Nothing strenuous or grand, but also nothing you wouldn\u2019t be able to do one handed. It\u2019s not pity or anything if that\u2019s what you are thinking, but even I\u2019m human and feel for other peoples plights. Sure the actual job might be a bit of a handout but it will be you who has to do the job right or get fired if you don\u2019t. You won\u2019t get a larger paycheck just because you know me, but it\u2019s something you can do to earn your new arm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy would you go out of your way for me like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause, I wanted to help you too. Just because I saved Gregory doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do something to try and make your life a bit better. Hunter\u2019s help other Hunters if and when they can remember. Besides, do I really need a reason to help you out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell honestly, you kind of struck me as the type that would rarely do something like this. A bit standoffish you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it\u2019s true I can be a bit aloof and I\u2019m really not what one would call a people person. But I still have my moments. This just happens to be one of them. Who knows, perhaps I would have offered Gregory the same kind of help if the situations were reversed. But don\u2019t think this makes us friends. This is simply one Hunter helping another out. A one time deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at his hand for a moment longer before returning his gaze to me with a small nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll accept your offer. You\u2019re all right in my book Zelkov. Even if it takes me a few years to make the money it still gives me something to work towards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Now that that is settled, I need to get some sleep. The burnout is catching up to me and my body is crying out for some real rest. A few hours should do it for now. We can hash out all the details tomorrow, if you are still in the hospital then I\u2019ll come visit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI rolled on my side away from him, pulling the sheet over my shoulder as I left him to his own thoughts. I had to remember to contact Demetrov later to see about making sure Jethic got a good deal on his artifact arm. Perhaps even pull it off to make him a prototype tester for it so Demetrov and his brother got the association to pay for a large chunk of it. But all of that could be behind the scenes dealings that Jethic didn\u2019t need to see or worry about. If he did he might get the wrong idea or have second thoughts about accepting this offer. Refusing it simply because he felt it was some sort of handout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs sleep began to creep in closer and closer I heard Jethic\u2019s soft voice from the other bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank\u2019s Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t thank me, I really haven\u2019t done anything. And call me Riktal, it\u2019s easier on the ears.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another timeline of many possible timelines. Where possibility meets possibility and a simple word or two can alter things completely. Where choices seem easy at first glance yet make you second guess yourself. Where you question the morality of who you are and why you chose the way you did. Are these some of the feelings broiling around inside you? Do you wonder where else the day might have led? What else might have happened if you chose differently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again traveler and find out. For here time is meaningless and anything but linear. Where the choices made are simply what if\u2019s and not set in stone. All you saw today has happened true, but it is also true that it has not happened yet and may never happen at all. Such is the paradox of possibilities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI replaced the bullets that had been fired into the six shooter before grabbing three re-loaders. If I couldn\u2019t handle anything with eighteen shots I wasn\u2019t worth my name as a Hunter. Slipping it into my belt and the extra bullets into my pouch I left the rest locked up tightly to go wait in the arena, stretching out a little bit as everyone else filed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt would be interesting to find out what kind of skill level these people were at. Judging from first impressions and the amount of extra armor they had put on, I\u2019d guess at around a middle D class overall. Some of them had their own weapons to use, but most of them began equipping up using the standard fair the Arena Master provided on the racks against the wall. Weapons with nothing extra or special about them. Not even a chip of heart crystal to help imbue the weapons with a bit of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of the boys slapped his wrist and a templar shield that stood almost as tall as he was expanded from the small circle of metal wrapped around his gauntlet even as the Arena Master took the floor to address the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cToday will be a bit different. Instead of pairing you up in sparring bouts, you will be applying what you have so far learned against real monsters. These are not fakes but ones that were captured alive and brought here. If you are scared to face them or are unable to handle them it is best to face it now instead of out there where your life is in serious danger. I\u2019ve graded you all on your skills already and will pit you and three or four others against a creature you can handle. It will be challenging but not too difficult as long as you keep your heads about you and do as you were taught. I will assign leaders for each party who\u2019s job it will be to issue orders and make the team work as you take down your given monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cZelkov! Hawthrope! You two can sit this one out today since you are both already past this point.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master began splitting the groups into teams while I waited patiently for him to get done. Once he was free I asked if I could have a small area to myself with a B class monster to spar against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, highest I got is C class. No one in here is ready yet for a B class and the ones I do have for the other classes I don\u2019t have any extra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine, I didn\u2019t need the practice anyway, it was more for personal reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head and returned to overseeing the class, fiddling with a magical box to make a wall split the floor into two areas. I climbed the bleachers and sat in the center so I could look down into both places. The girl I had stabbed earlier got up from where she was sitting a few feet away and plopped down on the bench next to me. I eyed her cautiously, on the alert for any retaliation but I didn\u2019t stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re a Zelkov huh? Well that explains a lot. I\u2019m Liz Hawthrope by the way. Want to thank you for stabbing me earlier. And for giving me that healing potion. I\u2019m being totally serious by the way, I really am grateful for both those things. My brother would have done the same thing if he had caught me napping like that. Saying something like a Hunter should always be alert to his surroundings no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen after almost killing me like you did he would have also given me a potion. Though I will admit, that was the first time in a long while I felt like I really would die. Last time I felt like that was when my brother pitted me against a Crrazz when I was thirteen years old. So what is your first name really?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI studied her for a minute but didn\u2019t sense any kind of deception in her voice or body language. But that didn\u2019t mean much if she had any skill as a Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTenth generation huh? I bet it sucks worse then being a fifth generation like me. People were always trying to get close to me at the beginning until I got them to leave me alone. Doing the whole yes man routine and trying to push their friendship on me as if I wanted to associate with them. Everyone here was just so shallow it seemed. Girls going on about boys and fashion like it really mattered and the boys were almost as bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI only gave a grunt in reply as I watched the groups below switch out against D class monsters, confirming my thoughts of their skill level. I still couldn\u2019t trust her even if she sounded sincere. History had told me not to take anything at face value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat was your first clue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess I really don\u2019t blame you, but honestly I just want someone to talk to that understands me. Everyone else here seems to think this is some kind of game. They haven\u2019t figured out how serious it is yet. My father told me to give them some leeway because they just switched over from going to a regular school to going to an academy to become Hunter\u2019s. But I just can\u2019t do that easily. So why are you here and not out monster slaying\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReasons. What about you? If your so good why are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe lapsed into silence as the fifth and last group stepped into the arena. Though I didn\u2019t say so I really didn\u2019t mind her company. I\u2019d still be a bit leery of her but if she was speaking true I could understand where she was coming from. She seemed to have a feel of when not to push an issue and simply let a companionable quiet fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe last group of five seemed to be of a slightly higher caliber. They were pitted against a C class Glif, a subclass of blue giant with a resistance to magic but was otherwise pretty easy to deal with. I recognized Gregory who was dual wielding pistols and Lilia healing them all. Even though I didn\u2019t know their names I also recognized the boy who had been in the classroom with Gregory and the tank with the templar shield of his own wearing full plate armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA hundred Reul says that idiot Gregory tries to show off on the finishing blow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI learned never to bet against the house, the cards are always stacked in their favor. But I guess he has already made himself disliked by more than just me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot on your bad side the first day did he? What he do? Try to steal something of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot it in one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah he has a bit of the sticky fingers. Daniel, the hand-to-hand fighting with him, can usually keep him in check or get him to give back whatever he\u2019s stolen. But everyone has learned to keep tabs on their things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd he hasn\u2019t been given Lapiiree yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. He hasn\u2019t really taken anything too valuable yet so most people just give him a bit of distance. A bit of the forgive and forget mentality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell as long as he doesn\u2019t do anything too foolish when it goes into it\u2019s second phase he can make a fool of himself all he wants. Perhaps a good thrashing from a beastie will knock some sense into him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I was saying that the monster went into it\u2019s second phase, spreading it\u2019s legs and putting up it\u2019s dukes while taunting the group to attack with one hand. In this mode it would counter anything and everything thrown at it, but it would also absorb any magic cast and throw it back in their faces. The smart move was to just wait it out, regroup and get ready for the last push since the monster wouldn\u2019t do anything while he had his fists up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut true to Liz\u2019s prediction Gregory cast an amplification spell on himself to augment his abilities. The Glif sucked in it\u2019s breath, eating his augmentation magic and casting it on itself instead. It grew a foot taller to stand at a staggering eight feet, with arms and legs like blue mini trees. It\u2019s power, speed and agility suddenly doubled by the spell it had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn stupid idiot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was up and running across the dividing wall with Liz close behind me. Even as I watched the beast charged towards Gregory who lost his cool and fired his pistols at it before shooting a fireball in it\u2019s direction. The tank charged towards the boy as well, shoulder tackling him out of the way and raising his shield in time to take a massive fist on it. The shield crumpled in half even as the next right fist smashed into the side of his head. The caster had pulled him away at the last moment so the blow only clipped him instead of taking his face off like it could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuick as thought he was dashing forward to punch downwards on the unmoving boy. The one named Daniel was suddenly standing over Gregory to meet the fist with his own. I could see the thick coating of magic he had around his hand. Even at that, the monster sucked up the aura as the boys hand snapped in half, the bone breaking through the skin at the elbow. The caster lobbed a low level ice spell at it to grab it\u2019s attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the monster turned towards the caster and Lilia who was standing next to her I pulled out my Lexington and fired while shoving off from the side of the wall at the same time. The wall absorbed the initial kickback even as magic oozed from the top barrel to coat the bullet coming out of the bottom one. The projectile smashed into the back of the creatures head, making a small cut in it\u2019s hardened skin and letting blue blood trickle out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster stopped it\u2019s advance on the two girls to turn and face me as I landed on the floor, my weapon out to the side and still smoking. It was a good thing most giants were stupid and would attack the last thing that hurt them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYo ugly! How about playing a game with me. It\u2019s called I\u2019m going to smash your face in. The rules are simple, I beat the crap out of you and you die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t The beast charged at me as Liz took the opportunity I had created to pick up the unmoving tank and the two girls helped the injured boys towards the exit after her. As the beast smashed it\u2019s fist down towards me I jumped out of the way, firing another round at almost point blank range into it\u2019s face and letting the kickback throw me to safety. Once I saw they had cleared the arena I cracked my neck and rotated my shoulders.</span></div></div>",

Show me what you got.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe roared at me and put up his dukes, motioning for me to attack him. I smiled but did nothing as I grabbed a hold of the top barrel on my Lexington with my right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u201dYou feel all big and bad? Like a B class with that augmentation spell on? Well then just for you I will give you a proper sendoff. Phase two activate. Phantom shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a twist I detached the top muzzle of my weapon before crossing my arms together. The single barrel stuck to the back of my left hand like glue, the end of it resting just behind my knuckles. I felt tendrils flowing along the underside of my arm as a trigger button appeared in my palm. The main body of the gun sat sideways on the back of my right hand, another trigger button flowing into my palm. I began speaking to the Glif for the benefit of the class, perhaps they would learn something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlif\u2019s are creatures of habit you know. Some programmed gene in them makes them react to certain stimuli the same way every time. Your second phase lasts for three minutes, and though you can eat and use cast spells, you cannot do the same to internal enhancements. He would have been fine if the idiot had augmented his own body internally instead of going for a doubling spell. It\u2019s been about two minutes forty seconds since you went into second phase, and the augmentation you stole lasts for four minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a roar he lowered his hands and charged me, swinging his meaty fist coated in magic at my face. I jumped, planting my hands on his fist and flipping over his head before mule kicking him in the back of his neck, causing him to crash to the floor while I alighted on the ground easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he began to lumber to his feet he threw out his right arm, sending a giant fireball hurtling my way. Lifting my left hand I sucked the magic up with the tube on the back of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTwo can play the magic eating game. But all you do is store the magic and imitate what\u2019s cast on you. Once you cast it you can\u2019t use it again unlike us. So you can\u2019t keep recasting that doubling spell. Thirty seconds left on it by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis left hand shot out and a shard of ice came screaming towards me. Negligently I held up my left hand and depressed the button on my palm, sending out a flamethrower to melt it in mid air so I only got misted with warm water. He charged again with his left fist cocked back and I smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd it will wear off right about\u2026 now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I cocked back my right arm and threw it forward to meet his, he began to shrink in size and his fist grew smaller. I fired off the four remaining rounds into the center of his fist seconds before mine smashed into it. The arm ballooned out and then exploded into bits that flew in every direction all the way up to the elbow. My left hand was already in my pouch grabbing a re-loader as he staggered backwards with another roar of pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLifting my right hand I twitched it slightly to open the clip and let the spent bullets drop to the floor even as my left was coming around and thrusting upwards. Time seemed to move in slow motion as I pumped my arm downwards at the same time as the round re-loader came upwards, the new bullets sliding into place even as I pressed the release button on the holder. With another flick the rounds were locked back into place before gravity took control again. As I began to drop my hand back down from that few seconds or reloading, time resumed it\u2019s normal speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Glif charged me again, seeming not to care it was now missing an arm as it hauled back with it\u2019s right fist. I jumped and spun, smashing my foot into the side of it\u2019s face as I dodged the attack. It went flying and tumbling over the ground a good ten feet even as I crossed my hands to grab the two pieces of my weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile it struggled to get to it\u2019s feet I placed the tube in my right hand against the end of the Lexington in my left, creating a super long muzzle. I stood sideways, sliding my left foot forward and bent my knees as I aimed the gun at the creature who had managed to stand again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn the end, you\u2019re still just a C class monster. Explosive shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling the trigger the cement beneath my feet cracked and small craters formed as I shunted the power of the kickback through my body. The bullet slammed into the center of the monster\u2019s chest before detonating in every direction. The body was blown in half, starting to fly through the air before it broke up into dust and disappeared like all monsters did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a flick upwards the second barrel flipped over top of the weapon and resumed it\u2019s normal resting place in phase one. Sticking it back into my belt I turned and went over to the rest of the class who was coming out to congratulate me along with the Arena Master. I pushed passed them all to continue to the sidelines since I didn\u2019t see Liz or the other five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI found Lilia doing her best to heal the injured as Liz and the other caster fed her their power. She might get her divine healing from The One God, but her magic was limited just like everyone else\u2019s. She was just finishing up laying her hands on Gregory when I came upon them, the other two were nursing their wounds and the tank even had a bandage over his left eye. Lilia sat back with a sigh as her divine power puttered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I did all I can, they will probably have to see the nurse but at least they are in no danger of dying or having their wounds heal wrong. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put my hand on her shoulder and gave her a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good. No one expects you to be a master healer just yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at the hand-to hand specialist who was rubbing his left arm where Lilia had put the bone back in as if he still felt the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was a good idea you had. Though next time make a rounded shield of solid air around your knuckles. When the blow comes a rounded shield will shunt the force of the attack to the left and right like shoving aside water. That means it will require less straight up strength to match the monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll remember that for next time. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the caster who was sitting back on a bench with closed eyes as if she just wanted to fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was quick thinking with the force pull spell. It was probably the only thing you could have done to save the tanks life. And it was too quick for him to absorb while in the middle of a counter attack. What\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarsa. And thanks. Though I wasn\u2019t sure if it was going to work or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarsa. I\u2019ll remember that. You earned a bit of respect from me today. Even if it hadn\u2019t worked, at least you didn\u2019t freeze up, that\u2019s what\u2019s important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning my attention to the tank who was touching the bandage gently I gave him a small nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you be able to see out of it again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLilia says I will. I just need to keep it covered for a day or two so the light doesn\u2019t aggravate it. I don\u2019t really understand but I\u2019ll trust her. I\u2019ll have a scar though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Jethic. I must say what you did was foolish. But it was also incredibly brave. You did your shield proud and you have earned my respect. I\u2019ll introduce you to someone I know who can fix your shield for you. He\u2019ll do it free of charge too if I ask him. Such an act as what you did is the mark of a true Hunter and deserves a bit of compensation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stuttered his thanks as I looked down on the unconscious Gregory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn idiot like this doesn\u2019t deserve to be a Hunter. You should have just left him Liz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was tempted to believe me. But even idiots deserve a chance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master came up then and took a look around before saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell they all need to go to the nurses office before I will let them back onto the floor. Lilia you did a great job with initial field healing, but the fact is you still aren\u2019t completely trained yet. I\u2019d like a professional second opinion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand sir.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo I have any volunteers to go with them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could volunteer myself, I had nothing else to do. On the other hand perhaps it was best if I not go. If Gregory woke up I might not be able to contain my anger at him. It wouldn\u2019t do to kill him out of hand. Especially not in front of so many other people. Not to mention something like this could happen again. Like this time, the Arena Master might not be able to respond in time since he was busy with something else.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will do me good to take a little walk to cool my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher gave me a nod as I hefted Gregory none to gently onto my shoulder and headed for the door with the other\u2019s close behind. Once out in the hall I slowed down a fraction so the others could catch up. And also because I didn\u2019t know how to get to the nurses office yet. Glancing over at Lilia I saw she had that unfocused stare again, though I didn\u2019t get the sense she was communing with her god or anything, she simply wasn\u2019t in the here and now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Lilia, it looks like your prediction was true, I was fated to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head absently before turning her gold flecked purple eyes on me. Giving me a look of knowing that managed to send a shiver down my spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. That comes later. Whether you had helped or not today does not affect that moment. I might not know when or how, but I do know that. Your actions simply minimized the damage and kept anyone from dying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI see. Good to know I guess. Makes me feel useful knowing my actions don\u2019t matter in the grand scheme of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. All our actions do not matter when looked at on the grand scheme God has planned for all of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was being a bit sarcastic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh. Why would you be sarcastic when you speak the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive it up. She\u2019s gone into her own little world. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re not crept out by the way she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Marsa and gave her a puzzled frown at her comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou find her creepy? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow can you not? She always has that weird stare that seems to see through you. She makes predictions that always seem to come true and you can\u2019t avoid. She seems to have no sense when you are joking or anything and she\u2019s always doing nonsensical things. I don\u2019t know about you but knowing things like the fact I will fall down the stairs and break my arm no matter what I do to avoid it makes you feel pretty weak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh so you are just like everyone else then. Afraid of those things that you do not understand or can\u2019t control. You\u2019re right that knowing such things can make you feel a bit insignificant, but so what? How many other things happen in your life that no one told you about that made you feel the same way? Were you able to control them any more than when you know it\u2019s going to happen? People are all different, that\u2019s part of being a Hunter. So is learning to work as a team as well as individually. Learning to adapt and accept those differences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe can speak directly to The One God, is it any wonder she has a faraway look? Or that she has the ability to tell the future because of it? You fear her because of her powers, but if you strip all of them away, would you still think she was so weird? And even if you did, would you still be afraid of her? Personally I prefer associating with people like her instead of idiots like this guy here who does things to show off and inflate his own ego. Things that almost kill his teammates simply to fulfill his own desires I might add.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t seem to know how to answer that, getting a thoughtful look on her face as we continued down the hall. When we got to the nurses office the others filed in ahead of me but before I could go in though Marsa put a hand out to stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was all she said before turning and entering the room but I understood she wasn\u2019t thanking me for saving her earlier. Feeling like I had accomplished something I felt my lips curving upwards as I entered the room. I wasn\u2019t even sure why I was so worried about trying to help Lilia in this way, that wasn\u2019t who I normally was. Perhaps the knowledge that I was supposed to help her sometime in the future had altered the way I would normally act. I didn\u2019t know but it felt right somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nurse was a priestess of The One God who also had knowledge of non magical healing. At first I had thought it weird when I had learned some priests and priestesses went to school for medical training like a normal person but then I realized it really wasn\u2019t strange at all. Even divine power was not unlimited, so knowing how to treat a wound without magic would be as beneficial to them as learning to break things with my fists without augmenting my strength was to me. They could save their magic for when they really needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stood about my height at five foot ten with raven black hair that seemed to glisten under the lights of the room. A pair of light gold framed glasses sat on a small nose as her mocha colored skin seemed to accent them. She looked at all of us with those brown eyes even as I dumped my burden unceremoniously on a cot. It only took a few minutes to relay to her what had happened and why we were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a quick nod she wasted no time in checking each person out one by one. I saw her hands glowing faintly while she did her inspection and slightly brighter as she added a bit more healing to what had already been done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you did good work Lilia. I only had to do a little touch up. But nothing a little extra training and experience wouldn\u2019t solve. Daniel your arm will be fine, just no hitting anything with it for the rest of the day and eat a hearty meal for dinner. Jethic, Lilia probably might have said this already but your down to light training for the next few days. You don\u2019t have much magic to help speed heal your body a little faster so you just got to wait it out. You\u2019ll have a nice scar there too, but she got to it fast enough that there won\u2019t be any vision loss or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nurse then went over to the bed and looked down at the unconscious boy with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEvery year we seem to get a few of these types. I know it is uncharitable of me to say I wish the principal would deny them entrance into the academy, but there would be less accidents if she did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe quickly inspected Gregory, proclaiming him fit with just a minor blow to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough I don\u2019t see where he took it from, the monster would have done more damage to him by the sounds and looks of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was probably my fault. When I shouldered him out of the way I think I face checked him with my shield in my haste.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you saved his life by the sounds of things so he shouldn\u2019t have anything to complain about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nurse turned to me then, reaching forward to lay a hand on my arm and sending out her magical probes like she had with the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing wrong with me, you\u2019re just wasting your magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen where did all these small cuts and bruises come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged absently as I gave her a roguish grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPrivate training. I learned long ago not to waste magic healing such small things. They can heal normally just as well. When you come from a tenth generation family they become part of the normal everyday life you just don\u2019t notice anymore. Honestly I don\u2019t even feel them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe made a tsking sound before sending out a bit more power to heal them all up. I only let out a mental shrug of my own as I kept my mouth shut. It would do no good to argue with her use of healing on me, servants of the Church had some funny ideas about healing sometimes. Once she was done she told us to leave the boy here and go back to our class, which we did. I privately hoped the boy never woke up again but I knew that was unlikely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce back in class the others reported the nurses ruling and the Arena Master nodded, jotting something down in his log book. As the others took a seat on the benches next to the racks of weapons I glanced up into the bleachers to see Liz watching us. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI gave Lilia a small nod before heading up into the bleachers to sit with Liz. It wasn\u2019t anything against this group but I felt a bit more comfortable being around someone who was also from an older family. The only one in this group I didn\u2019t feel awkward around was Lilia and that wasn\u2019t enough to stick around dealing with the eyes watching me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was some nice work on the Glif. Though I really didn\u2019t expect anything less.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy because I\u2019m a Zelkov?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn part. But the other part is you had the confidence of every Hunter I have ever known. That surety that it wasn\u2019t a challenge at all, even if you are up against something you know is stronger than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah well it really was no challenge. I\u2019ve fought tougher things for breakfast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd somehow I don\u2019t think you meant that figuratively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHazards of being a Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy parents got it into their head that now that we are a fifth generation we have to emulate the older ones. Like there is this sort of elite club we are now a part of. They keep forcing arranged marriage meetings on me even though they never attended any. They simply ended up falling in love while out doing their jobs. So why do I have to have boys forced on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI feel you. My mother is the one who forces them on me. I usually just skip out, leaving the girl hanging. It might be a bit mean but I never agreed to it to begin with and it saves them from having me blow up at them. My mother seems to think I need to marry someone from another old family or at least another respected Hunter house. So much political BS in being an old family, I hate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSkipping out on them huh? I\u2019ll have to remember that. I\u2019ve got another of those stupid meetings next week but my mother refused to tell me who it is, only saying that she thinks I will like him because he is a lot like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve heard that line before, what they are really saying is I\u2019m not going to tell you because then you will go in with more preconceived judgments then you already have. Ignore what he looks like since he isn\u2019t handsome at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a chuckle at that and I grinned in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere was this one girl my mother forced me to meet after saying those exact words to me that\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang then and I started in surprise. I had actually been enjoying talking to Liz to the point of forgetting my surroundings. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time something like that had happened. But dealing with her felt natural and easy. With a sigh of regret I got up and gave her a small wave as we parted company and I went to pick up my things from the locker room. Two more hours and this day would be done. History class and Monster Tactics and Theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I entered the classroom I noticed Gregory still hadn\u2019t come back. That was all to the good in my opinion. Perhaps the principal would kick him out for his stupidity, though that was probably too much to hope. I also noticed the shifts in power. Most of them were giving me stares of respect and a few of starry eyed hero worship. A few of those eyes were also calculating how best to make connections with me. I could see the thoughts as the girls sized me up and wondered how best to make me their boyfriend and the guys sized me up wondering how best to simply become a friend. Or at least perceived to be my friend and close to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw Marsa, Jethic and Daniel all go over and talk to Lilia who seemed surprised they were paying attention to her and I smiled privately. I had a feeling her lonely school life was about to change. I also noticed that her newfound friendship with the three had also been noted by the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe History teacher came in and took attendance before starting into his lesson. He didn\u2019t get far though before a giant of a man came through the door. He stood at least eight inches taller than me at six and a half feet. He wore a simple white cotton shirt that strained against his chest and the muscles of his arms and a pair of black shorts that also seemed to hug his flesh. The sneakers he wore had to be at least a size eleven and were brand new by the looks of them. A military style haircut made the brown hair on his head look nice and neat to compliment the rest of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked around the room, his gaze seeming to pierce through everyone until his eyes met mine. He pointed at me even as the teacher asked if he needed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal Zelkov. Your mother requests your presence immediately. You will come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think so Buzz. I don\u2019t know who you are or if my mother really did send you, but if she did then you should know I don\u2019t take kindly to being ordered around like that. If she want\u2019s me she can come get me herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stormed through the room and stood over me planting a meaty hand on my left shoulder, gripping tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChildren shouldn\u2019t talk back to their betters. They should do as they are told. Now come with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he pulled up I let him yanked me out of my seat as I reached around and grabbed his thumb, shoving backwards until I heard it snap. At the same time I turned into him, striking him quickly across the throat with a straight edged chop of my left hand before kicking him in the back of the left kneecap with my right leg. As he began to fold I brought my right hand around to grab the back of his head, smashing his face into the desk before wrapping my arms around his neck in a chokehold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo just who is better Buzz? From where I am standing I think I am your better. Now I was in a pretty good mood which you just ruined. So how about we play a game? It\u2019s called get the hell out of my face before I kill you. I think you can figure out the rules yourself right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI released him from the chokehold before stepping back and kicking him away, sitting back down while he tried to catch his breath on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs I said, if my mother wants me she can come for me herself. If I see you again today I\u2019ll kill you do you understand Buzz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe stood up the anger seething from him in waves as he rubbed his neck and popped his thumb back into it\u2019s socket. I could see he wanted to attack me but I could also see he realized I was stronger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe name is Henry kid. And your mother will hear about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. And your name is whatever I feel like calling you. If you want you can be called dog skat. Just be glad I decided on Buzz. You got a problem with that Buzz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw his jaw clenching along with his fists, his knuckles turning white. Finally he took a deep breath and tipped his head to the side in a mock bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. No problems with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he stalked out of the room and was gone. Everyone was staring at me but my glare made them all avert their eyes. The teacher took a moment to collect himself before returning to his lesson. This kind of thing was normal in a Monster Combat Hunter academy. We were only about ten minutes in when the door opened again and my mother walked into the room with a petite silver haired girl in an ugly green dress and crimson eyes. She clutched a tattered brown bear to her chest tightly, that being the only indication she was aware of anything. The girl reminded me of a doll the way she stared blankly and just walked when my mother pulled her along behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother\u2019s raven hair with streaks of grey was a stark contrast to the silver of the girls, and her hazel eyes seemed to pierce me with their gaze when she found me. She was wearing a simple black shirt and pants loose enough to move around in yet with enough pockets to carry her tools. The belt at her waist held a single dagger though I knew it could hold more. With a sigh I grabbed my bag as I got up and headed for the door without a word being spoken. Even if I would only be out of the room for a few minutes, I felt better having a weapon or two at my side. But knowing my mother, whatever she wanted wasn't going to take just a few minutes away from my day. Once outside and the door was closed I faced my mother with a hand on my hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you want? Here to tell me you are off on another mission? Surprised you even bothered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I will be going on another mission, but I want to speak to you, privately if I could. Can we go someplace else to talk?\u201d</span></div></div>",

One of your new aides?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBuzz? Oh you mean Henry. Yes he is. Just started about four days ago. You really shouldn\u2019t have done that to him you know. He was only following orders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really scraped the bottom of the barrel to find him didn\u2019t you? I bet they are getting wise to what a crummy employer you are and won\u2019t work for you just out of principal. As for what I did, I only corrected his mistake. There is a way to go about things and he chose poorly. I\u2019d say you know that I don\u2019t take well to threats or commands but you are you so I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I hope you\u2019re happy because you scared him off. He told me what happened then he hightailed it out of here saying he wasn\u2019t going to be killed by you for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLeast he had some brains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have a feeling I am going to have to find another aide now. Why do you make things so difficult for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m in tears here. Perish the thought that I make my mother\u2019s life so difficult when that\u2019s the only thing she ever seems to want to do with mine. As if she wasn\u2019t happy unless my life was miserable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are ungrateful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m the way you taught me to be. And do you really want to do this? I assume you want something from me and this kind of talk is making it easier and easier for me to say no out of hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe fell silent as we finished our walk to an empty room on the first floor that looked like it was used for student council meetings. I knew she wanted something from me, that was the only time she ever dealt with me it seemed. Never dealt with me as a mother, only as a Hunter. Stuck around home long enough to give me some training and then left me with babysitters. My father had been a little better but not by much. That was my childhood as a Zelkov in a nutshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe offered me a seat at the table as she manually sat the girl down, taking a chair next to her across from me and folding her hands on the table. I noticed the little girl give the bear a slight squeeze before resuming her near comatose state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want you to protect this girl for a few days. Her name is Asala and she just lost her parents three days ago. She\u2019s been like this ever since. Won\u2019t eat, won\u2019t sleep, won\u2019t even bath or take care of her basic urges. Just letting her bladder go whenever she feels like it. She ruined two dresses before we just began treating her like an infant and putting diapers on her. We\u2019ve been sustaining her with magic even as we continued to try to get her to interact with the world, but with no success.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what is so special about her? If she was any other little girl you would let some relative or friend of the family take her. What warrants you personally taking her under your wing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a monster summoner with unstable powers. You are one of the few I know that has no problems with summoners. And one of the fewer still I could trust being able to take care of anything she summons. It will just be for two or three days until someone I know can come pick her up. And since you are good with kids I was hoping you could break her out of this state she is in. You always did have a knack for that kind of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMother, there is nothing special about what I do. Anyone can do it with just a little patience and not acting like the child had no brain in their head. Even someone as crappy with kids as you are could manage it if you tried. You don\u2019t even need to be a Hunter for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI studied the little girl for a bit. With her petite four and a half foot frame I could probably bench-press with one hand, she didn\u2019t seem like she had the ability to summon monsters. But I knew how looks could be deceiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s the highest level monster she has summoned so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn A class, but she fainted right afterwards, cutting off it\u2019s foot as the portal closed. Most of the time she summons C class and lower. Only one other time did she summon something bigger, a B class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill I have Hunter immunity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d prefer this be under the table, just from one family member to another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor something like this? I\u2019d like to have a bit of insurance if I need it. The Zelkov name won\u2019t protect me from everything. If I have to kill people to protect her I want it covered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine I\u2019ll have a Hunter by proxy under my name made up for you if you agree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNibbling my lower lip I narrowed my gaze on my mother. She was worried about something though she hid it well. She wouldn\u2019t have so easily given into my demand for a proxy paper without at least a bit more resistance to the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFourteen thousand Reul. I would have asked for less but your meat brain aide put me in a bad mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. But only if you continue to attend classes. I\u2019ve got my reasons and you going to school here is important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou always have your reasons. But I\u2019ll accept that. Only if doing so doesn\u2019t put her in more danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgreed. I\u2019d say I would have my aide write it all up for you but someone ran him off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wonder who that could be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have no idea. But that does mean I will have to send you the paperwork over the communication spell for you to copy into reality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Get Hilda to do it, I trust her work over anyone else you might have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard a small sound out in the hall by the door so jumped out of my seat and crossed the room to open it up. I spotted a figure turning the corner at a run down at the end of the hall but couldn\u2019t catch a glimpse of who it might be. Had he heard our conversation? Or was it just some random student getting back to class? Or coming from a class for that matter. Seeing running students in a place like this wasn\u2019t that unusual after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a shake of my head I closed the door again and told my mother she could leave even as I knelt on the floor next to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt will probably go better if you weren\u2019t here anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a nod, opening the door and stepping out into the hall silently. Before she closed it however she looked back at me with a fake smile I knew was the prelude to something I wouldn\u2019t like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh before I forget, you have a marriage meeting next week. I\u2019m sure you will like her, she\u2019s a lot like you after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shut the door before I had a chance to tell her I wasn\u2019t going. Instead I simply shook my head before turning my attention to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know you can hear me. I\u2019ve seen you gripping that bear a few times. No one else might have noticed but I did. So I want you to answer a few questions with yes or no nods of the head. If you don\u2019t my left hand will become a tickle monster and find your ticklish spots until you do. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe simply stared ahead blankly without replying so I shot out my left hand and began tickling her side. She lasted a good thirty seconds before giggling and squirming away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s try this again. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt first she didn\u2019t do anything but when I lifted my left hand and waggled my fingers she giggled again before nodding her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI asked her a few questions such as if she had any other clothes and if she liked being treated like an infant. She answered no to both of them, confirming what I had suspected already. When I asked if she was able to deal with crowds of people she shrunk into herself a bit, again answering no. The bell signaling the end of the period rang as I nibbled my lip again wondering what to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cYou know what? Right now I don\u2019t think it would be a good idea to take you to class and see all those eyes staring at you. I bet you are still pretty scared right now and I doubt you trust me too much yet. So we are going to ditch a little early, have a good time on the town where we will buy lots of clothes for you to call your own and get you thinking you are a real little girl again. I know you are sad because you lost your parents, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy and appreciate things in life still. That might be hard to understand, but it\u2019s not a sin against them if you giggle or smile once in a while. Bad things happen, but good things happen too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I will warn you, I don\u2019t take kindly to little girls I take on dates into town not eating if we stop at a restaurant. My left hand might be a tickle monster to make you come alive but you don\u2019t want to see what my right hand can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI raised  my eyebrow in her direction while pretending to squeeze something with my right hand. She smiled and squirmed a bit, making me wink at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo if we stop at a quiet place to eat do you think you would have a problem with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick shake of the head elicited another grin from me as I stood up and offered her my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have to wonder what they were thinking if they couldn\u2019t get you out of your head like I did. I bet they just told you what they expected and pulled you around by the arm didn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA nod up and down as I led her into the hall and to the left towards the front of the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet that big guy also scared you something fierce as well. With all those muscles and that mean looking face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a bob of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do I scare you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t do anything, just sort of hunched her shoulders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe a little? Because you think I am going to hurt you for being a summoner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally just the barest dip of the head as she crushed her bear against her chest again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m not like most other people who think summoners should all die or something. I once had a friend who was a summoner. She\u2019s dead now, but she taught me that summoners are people just like everyone else. I won\u2019t get mad if you summon a monster. You can\u2019t help it at the moment right? Your power is unstable after all. I\u2019m going to do everything and anything I have to in order to protect you. And I\u2019m going to help you deal with your grief over your parents death. That\u2019s a promise from me to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and held up my pinky for her to shake as we left the school gates. She looked at my finger and then at my face before reaching out and hooking it with her own. I gave it a quick shake up and down while reciting the oath before continuing on my way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept up a bit of small talk, mainly to make her feel more at ease around me. That was the trick to all of this, making the child feel at ease. Feel like they are safe or have some amount of safety when you are around. Slowly she began to warm up to me. Even though she might not look it outwardly, I could feel the change in the air. The way she actively stuck close to me and gave my hand small squeezes. I would take it easy with her. There were a lot of different routes I could go down to help her, from acting like a total idiot to get her to laugh and have fun to just pulling her around behind me and forcing things on her without giving her a chance to decide on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI figured this pace would be best for now. Let her come to grips with her grief on her own without me forcing it on her with kind words and a soft voice. If I did things right she would release that pent up sadness soon enough. I had a feeling that was part of the reason her power was unstable, she was holding too much inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe shopped for two hours or so, as I helped her pick out a few dresses she liked and some extras such as undergarments and some jewelry. Dinner was also uneventful as I extracted a few nuggets of information about her without her realizing it. She did slip off to put on some real underwear, which did seem to improver her mood even more. Whoever had thought putting a diaper on her was a good idea was a real idiot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter dinner we walked home, her confidence growing by leaps and bounds as no monsters or summoning circles even hinted at showing their faces, further confirming my belief as to why her power was unstable. She still hadn\u2019t said a word though, just a few smiles and giggles. That was fine, at this rate I would probably get her to say a few words by tomorrow evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce inside the house I handed her the new pajamas we had bought and showed her the bathroom, telling her to get cleaned up. I left her in the bathroom, hearing the water being turned on before heading off to my room. Pulling out an old box from my closet, I began taking out the stuffed animals inside. One by one I laid a trail from the bathroom to my bed with them, setting a tattered blue rabbit missing an eye on the pillow at the end. Once that was done I sat at my small desk and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough the girl came in the room following the trail, her wet hair going in multiple directions as she carried her bear in one hand and a purple elephant in the other. She looked at me with wide eyes and I grinned, pulling a comb from behind my back and telling her to sit on the bed. She did so without question and my smile broadened. So my plan to make her lose all fear of me had worked. Sitting down behind her I began to comb out her hair as I talked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI used to have a little sister who was a bit like you. She loved stuffed animals and I would always comb her hair like this after she took a bath. She would tell me about her dreams and about how her day went at school and every little thing that came into her head. She was pretty popular you know. Had all the boys chasing after her. Well at least according to her. She was sweet and kindhearted, nothing at all like me. I can\u2019t get along with people too well, the only ones I am really good with are kids. So I have no clue how she turned out the way she did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut out of all her stuffed animals, this rabbit here was the one she loved the most. It was like your bear there, she was never anywhere without it. Whenever it needed washed she would give it a bath just like a real person, soap and all. Then I usually had to dry it out with magic because she wouldn\u2019t let go of it even then. She\u2019d even be willing to sleep with that soaked and sodden thing if I had let her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPicking up the rabbit I held it out to the girl who put down the elephant and held it in her hands while I continued to brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHis name is Mr. Snuggles, and she prized him above all else because I put a special magic on him just for her. See, she was a crybaby, but she was always trying to hide it from me. Said she wanted to become strong and not always cry. That she wouldn\u2019t be a good wife to me if she was always crying. That magic made it possible for her to cry all she wanted as long as she was holding it. No one could see her tears or hear her wails no matter how loud she was. She would look like she had on her normal everyday face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow, I can\u2019t give Mr. Snuggles to you forever, but if you want to hold onto him for the next few days until you have to leave, then I don\u2019t mind. If you\u2019re really good I can cast that same spell on your bear as well before you leave. It takes a lot of magic though so I don\u2019t offer that lightly. Now, your hair is all combed out, and you haven\u2019t had any proper sleep for three days. So I want you to be a good girl and go to sleep for me. I know it\u2019s a bit early, but your body needs the rest even if you don\u2019t think it does.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I slid off the bed, she slid under the covers, gripping both the bear and the rabbit in a death lock. After tucking her in I kissed her forehead with a soft goodnight, turning off the light and leaving the door open a crack before going downstairs. My bag stared at me from where I dropped it next to the door, telling me to do something with it. I was tempted to move it but in the end left it sitting there. I would just be taking it to school tomorrow anyways. Instead I turned down the hall into the living room, sitting on the couch before leaning my head back and closing my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat a day so far. Who would have thought this is how it would have ended. But oddly, I didn\u2019t mind. It had felt like I was a big brother again. Like I had family. There was a slight creaking of wood and my eyes cracked open, being drawn to the sound by the door. Asala came hesitantly into the room with both animals clutched tightly to her chest. I motioned her over and she quickly settled her head on my lap before closing her eyes. As I absently began to stroke her hair while she fell asleep I heard her muffled crying but ignored it like I had always ignored Olia\u2019s. Magic rabbit indeed. There was no such magic like that. But she had thought there was, that was all that had mattered. Lilia\u2019s words popped into my mind and I smiled. It seemed there really had been a girl in my future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother day draws to a close and so does this window. Choice and consequence. Action and reaction. One thought popping into the head before another, eliciting one action or choice over others. What decides those thoughts though? What choices bring forth the series of thoughts that dictate the actions? Would Riktal have even considered taking the job if Lilia had never given him that prediction? Would the meeting with his mother have gone differently if he had not decided he was having a good day? From what decision did his good day start? Was it the first second he opened his mouth? Or was it later than that? What would have happened if he had never met Lilia? Come again fair traveler and alter this day once more, find out the answers to these questions and others. Will you regret the decisions you make or will Riktal be the one to regret them?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cDo you think you could deal with a few eyes staring at you for an hour if I\u2019m next to you? I\u2019m tempted to just leave right now, but I did sort of agree to keep going to class. Unfortunately I don\u2019t feel there is a good enough reason not to at this time. I know it might be a bit uncomfortable for you but do you think you could manage for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was still for the longest time, not going back into her mind but deep in thought. Finally a slow bob of the head and I gave her a reassuring grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood girl. After school we will get you all prettied up with some new clothes and maybe a few trinkets. Never met a girl yet that didn\u2019t like her a few rings and necklaces. Get you some real underwear, I\u2019m sure you really don\u2019t like wearing that thing do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she shook her head no I gave her a wink and stood up, offering my hand which she hesitantly took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t trust me too much right now but that\u2019s ok. I will keep you safe until my last breath, no matter what or who I have to hurt. Because I once knew a monster summoner, and she taught me that you are people just like everyone else. Having that power doesn\u2019t make you any less human.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I led her out the door and turned right I gave her hand a squeeze of assurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough I\u2019m not going to keep you running with magic like my mother did. Your body needs food and sleep and everything else. Even if you don\u2019t feel that way because the magic blocks your perception of those needs, it doesn\u2019t fill up your belly like real food will. And using magic to keep yourself awake makes your brain go all loopy after too long. So I expect you to eat and sleep when given the chance you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head in agreement as we came up on a point where another hall shot off to the side. I sensed the presence before we got there so wasn\u2019t surprised when the principal came into view. Asala squeezed my hand in surprise though but didn\u2019t do anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want old woman? I take it you\u2019ve been eavesdropping from the beginning so you already know about the girl and my job. Not even you will be exempt if you try to hurt her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo like you, I have no problems with summoners. I\u2019ve lived a long time boy, and seen a lot of things. I long ago got rid of my notions of having blind hatred for things I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m actually here to help you. I think it best if you leave for the day. There was some overlarge ears at the door that were quick to run back to your classroom with the news of that little girl. I fear there might be some problems if you were to go back there now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould those overlarge ears be attached to a boy named Gregory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI could not say exactly but the face and body did indeed look like such a boy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gritted my teeth as my anger boiled under the surface. Taking a few deep breaths I tried to calm myself down with no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m going to have to deal with this one way or another, whether it be today or tomorrow. Knowing how little love most people have for summoners though I am not willing to take the girl into the lion\u2019s den so to speak. I\u2019m not sure what is going to go down but I have to deal with this now. If I wait it will only get worse as the rumors and the fear has time to seep and spread.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKneeling in front of the girl I looked at the principal and then back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala, do you think you would be able to stay with the principal here for a little bit while I take care of some business? I\u2019ll be right back I promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally nodded her head after clutching my hand tightly. Ruffling her hair I turned to the principal.<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou will look after her for me won\u2019t you? If you have no problems with summoners then I am sure you can keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can and I will, only if you promise me not to kill anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t make that promise. I won\u2019t put my life or the life of this little girl in danger just to save a few people for your sake. If you don\u2019t want to help me then that\u2019s fine I\u2019ll take her with me and probably cause more of a riot then there will already be. I will make the concession that I will try not to kill anyone I don\u2019t have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh she nodded her head as she held out her hand to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, come pick her up in my office when you are done. And god have mercy on that classroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she wheeled away with the little girl following her she began telling Asala a story to keep her occupied. I turned and headed for the  classroom, unzipping my bag just in case even as I hiked the strap farther up on my shoulder. This really was different from other academies I had seen and heard about. It might seem strange to most that the principal was so accepting of the possible bloodshed that might ensue. But considering these kind of things would rear up when they became true Hunter\u2019s, it was best for them to deal with such ideas and decisions now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis was a violent world, and humanity accepted that they were violent creatures by nature. Some kingdoms had tried to go the pacifistic route and it had failed miserably against the threat of monsters. Democracies, dictatorships, everything and everything had been tried. Sometimes they worked, sometime they didn\u2019t. It was only when humanity tried to be purely civilized while denying their violent nature did they fail the worst. So the world had come to accept that violence was a part of life and we had formed a fine middle ground between that part of ourselves and a civilization of peace. Granted most of the violence was left in the hands of Hunter\u2019s, leaving regular people to enjoy the peace we created for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore opening the door I dug into my duffle until I found the small box with the button on the side I was looking for. Carefully I shoved it in between my belt and body, tying it in place with a few strands of magic. Once I was ready I entered the classroom to a small bit of chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll eyes turned on me, but where before those eyes had been calculating and conniving, now there was fear and anger in many of them. An overwhelming number of people had hatred for summoners, fearing what they could do. Indeed, until about a hundred or so years ago summoners had actively went out of their way to try and destroy civilization with the monsters they summoned and controlled. Such old hatreds were slow to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Gregory, I hear your ears got a bit too long for your head and you heard things you shouldn\u2019t have. Didn\u2019t anyone ever teach you not to go blabbing on peoples private matters? Especially when it is Hunter\u2019s business?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey have a right to know what kind of monster your protecting! What kind of monster will be coming into this room with us! How can you even protect a freak like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the unrest growing. The teacher wasn\u2019t even trying to stop it. In fact he even seemed to be in agreement with what Gregory was saying. If this continued there was a possibility of a full blown riot. I had two choices in front of me right now and both of them could go south quickly. There was danger of a riot breaking out on both of them but if I let this go on even I would have difficulty controlling the situation.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cThey don\u2019t have a right to know squat! Hunter business is Hunter business! Not everyone and their mothers! When was the first time you played with yourself? When did you stop wetting the bed? Who was the first person you kissed? Who do you have wet dreams about at night? Everyone has secrets they don\u2019t want to get out! No one has a right to know everything about everyone else! We have a right to our privacy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou will be a Hunter! A poor one but a Hunter nonetheless. You will take jobs you find questionable, ones you don\u2019t agree with or find distasteful all to do your main job, and that is to help people! To save innocent lives and the greatest number of them at that! I already took the safety of everyone in this room into consideration before accepting this job! You would kill a little girl no more than eleven or twelve for a power she can\u2019t control yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to kill her!

I killed one earlier to save your ungrateful worthless hide if you don\u2019t remember!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked to the left at the teacher and at the rest of the class in front of me. My words seemed to be getting to a few of them but I could see the fear of the unknown had already gotten to many of them. They were close to the mob point and had been before I had even come in the room. I could see my words really weren\u2019t having the affect I had hoped. Perhaps if I had killed Gregory at the very beginning I could have shocked the rest of the class into breaking out of this near riot mode. But I had said I would try not to kill anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a still moment when nobody seemed to move or say anything. A moment where even time seemed to stop. Then the fear and madness that had been lurking in Gregory\u2019s eyes reared up as he shouted at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should die too for protecting a monster like that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis hand reached for his waist, touching a blue gem that made a gun materialize. As he began to draw it I summoned a gust of air and shoved it like a wall towards all of them, picking up all the desks and throwing them into the crowd and against the back wall. His first shot went wildly up into the air as he was hit with a desk, some of the class got out of the way while others were caught up in the wave of tables. It was easier to fight in an open space instead of a crowded one anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOther people had pulled out weapons or came at me with their fists. Reaching into my duffle bag hanging at my right side with my left hand I grabbed the first thing I felt, pulling it out even as I threw the bag at the oncoming mob. Blocking an overhead chop of one girls sword with my own I slid it to the side and punched her in the head with my left fist, taking a kneeling position as I spun in a circle, avoiding the staff that had been coming for my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLaunching myself upwards I uppercut the boy who had swung the staff , catching him under the chin as I dashed forward through the throng. My right hand reached into the bag as I caught another sword on mine and shoved it to the ground, coming up with another blade half as long as the one in my left hand. I got my right hand up in time to catch the blade of a glaive on the edge, bringing my left around to punch the girl in the head like I had the last one. Suddenly Daniel was there blocking my fist with his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMake a curved shield of air isn\u2019t that what you said? Seems you were right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad you remembered. But you\u2019re still years too early to face me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShoving his fist to the side I brought the blade around level with his eyes too fast for him to dodge. At the last moment I twisted the sword so the flat of the blade smashed into the side of his head knocking him out. I continued my pivot to block two strikes coming from opposite directions seconds before jumping and doing a back flip in the air. Liz barreled under me as I landed and dashed towards her back. Dropping to my knees in a slide while avoiding the blades passing over my head as I spun, I cut into the back of her knees. As I came back to a standing position I swung the blade in my right hand upwards as hard as I could, cutting off the arm of one of the sword wielders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the power hurtling towards my back more than saw it, slapping the box I had placed under my belt even as I brought my left blade up in a diagonal slash to meet yet another blade. The orange shield popped up around me, taking the magical fireball. I turned just in time to see the teacher with his hand out towards me. Letting my magic coat my blades, I slashed the air quickly in his direction, sending out lines of fire rapidly. He blocked the first five but the sixth one tagged him before he could counter. Four more times I lashed him with flames, not enough to kill but enough to blister and burn his skin until he fell to the ground moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that it was simple to knock the last three attackers out as they beat uselessly on my artifact shield. The ones who hadn\u2019t attacked because I had knocked the fight out of them with a desk or because they hadn\u2019t wanted to fight to begin with I left alone. I stalked over to Gregory who was moaning a bit while trapped under some tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are a worthless pile of trash you know that you piece of scum? This world is not kind to people like you and neither will I be. This is strike three, I hope you find hell comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a quick backhanded swipe I severed his head from his body while he lay there trapped, my sword sliding through flesh and bone as easily as butter. The look of surprise permanently etched onto his face even as the blood began to spray. I went and picked up my bag, ignoring the blood coating my face and clothes as I put my weapons away and looked around one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about me coming to class. Consider this my drop out letter. I feel sick associating with closed minded pigs like all of you. Learn to grow up and learn some tolerance for people different than you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I left the room, striding down the halls until I got to the principals office. When the secretary tried to stop me I ignored her and shoved through the inner doors. The angry words on my lips died off as I saw Asala sitting on the old woman\u2019s lap listening raptly to a story about a talking fox that could steal dreams. The principal saw me even if Asala didn\u2019t, noting my blood splattered clothes and motioning with her eyes to clean myself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI understood. It wouldn\u2019t help Asala at all to see me like this. I should have thought of that but I had been filled with too much anger and battle lust. As quick as I could I used a bit of magic to burn the blood away, returning to looking respectable by the time the story was done. I quickly told her what had happened, making sure she knew the only person I had killed had been Gregory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBetter send the nurse up there though, Lilia won\u2019t be able to handle it all. And I don\u2019t care what my mother wants or her reasons for me being at this school, I\u2019m never coming back. Take me off the records.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was afraid things would turn out like this. I guess I should be grateful you did such little damage. Would it be ok if I saw this sweet little girl again before she leaves though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as she doesn\u2019t mind. It will do her good to see not everyone hates her because of her power. Would you like to see the old lady again Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl nodded her head energetically as she slid off the woman\u2019s lap and came over to me, taking my hand when I offered it. It didn\u2019t take long to exchange magical id\u2019s with her for our communication spells before we were out the door and heading towards the front entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell now, off to town for some snazzy new clothes, maybe some jewelry. A bite to eat wouldn\u2019t hurt either. Then we will settle you in to your new home for the remainder of your stay. I\u2019ve got a few bedtime stories I could tell you if you want. That old lady isn\u2019t the only one who knows a few tales. Do you like the sound of all that Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned up at me with a smile that seemed to give her entire face a divine glow as she nodded her head up and down. That smile and those big eyes made my heart melt, remembering a long lost feeling of being a big brother to another little girl who used to smile like that. I had a feeling it was going to be hard for me to let her go when her new master came to get her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo do you feel your choices were the correct ones? Do you think you should have done something different? Would you have handled things differently than Riktal did? If so do you think he was wrong? Such words as judgment and regret are labels you put on things after all is said and done. Just because one does not think like you or act like you would, does not make their thoughts and actions any less valid. Yet you humans seem to think in this fashion. That if it is not done the way you think it should be done then it is wrong. Immoral, barbaric, or any other number of labels you put on such things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat was one of the reasons I gave you this power to control his life. In an attempt to learn the how\u2019s and why\u2019s of your minds. To figure out what it is that makes you tick. I think I have learned a bit of what I wish to know, but there is yet more I am left wanting. The window closes for now and it is your destiny to return here to my realm between realms. Perhaps next time you shall answer more of those questions for me by again playing god for young Riktal. Come again traveler, to a world made of dreams and possibilities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI let the anger show clearly on my face as I strode towards the little snitch. He was the instigator of all of this. If I let him live he would keep inciting everyone into a higher fury than was needed until they all turned into a mindless mob. With him out of the way I could hopefully talk some sense into everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe saw the anger in my eyes and backed up but it was already too late for him. With one smooth motion I grabbed the knife in the sheath at my right side with my right hand and swung it up in an arc, shoving it deep into his heart. The deft twirl to settle the handle in my palm had taken a fraction of a second while I grabbed his shoulder with my left hand and pulled him in close to me at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRevealing my personal business to everyone else is strike three. Say hello to the devil for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a quick twist of the knife I ripped the blade out and kicked him away, turning to face the rest of the room who stared in shock. Now I needed to take command of the situation while their minds were reeling as to what had just happened. Using their fear as a controller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf anyone else has any objections to me taking this job feel free to speak up! A job I might add is of no concern to everyone else. I already took into consideration your safety before even accepting it. Just who the hell do you think any of you are anyway to determine if someone has a right to live or die based solely on what magic they may have! Her magic is different than ours, but what if it was you! What if you had the power to summon monsters? Would you want someone killing you no matter how nice you might be or how much you might want to help and protect?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis pile of garbage deserved what he got! If he had become a Hunter would you really have trusted him at your back? Would you want someone who would so easily let everyone else know about any job you did be that close to you? This is the reality of being a Hunter! You sometimes take jobs you don\u2019t agree with, have qualms about, or are shady in nature because they will help innocent people in the long run! You want me to kill a little girl who just lost her parents! A girl who is only eleven or twelve years old without even seeing her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter is only as respectable as the things he does! We aren\u2019t always pure and clean and the shining heroes everyone thinks we are! But we hide that from the world so they can live in peace! So they can live their lives in ignorance believing nothing will ever go wrong as long as we are around! A Hunter prevents riots and supports his comrades in times of trouble and need! He does not, I repeat does not, purposefully try to incite them as this rat did! He does not go blabbing his mouth over every little thing he hears!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you really want to kill that girl then expect me to slit your throat before the day is over! Because I made a promise that I would protect her no matter what! I will keep that promise or die trying! Just as I would do for any one of you if you were in that position, whether I thought you deserved it or not. She is human just like any one of you! Now do any of you have a problem with that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glared around the room, my eyes burning holes into each and every person until they looked away. I made note of the ones who stared back defiantly, who still wanted me to kill the girl but were unwilling to say anything. I noticed Liz was one of those people with a bit of a sinking heart. I had begun to like her too. Without taking my eyes off them I called forth a giant ball of fire and threw it at Gregory\u2019s corpse, turning it to dust in a matter of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the girl being a nuisance to you in this class, I won\u2019t be back to school until she is gone. Perhaps I\u2019ll never return to this school where there are so many blind bigots unworthy of the title of Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a flick of my wrist I imbedded the dagger into the wall next to Liz\u2019s face before spitting in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf I had known you were such a worthless bigot as well I would have made sure to kill you earlier. Don\u2019t bother coming near me again. I have no need for friends like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I backed out of the room, never taking my eyes off any of them or giving them a chance to sneak attack me when I wasn\u2019t looking. Once back in the hall I strode quickly to the principals office without once looking back. The girl was sitting on the old woman\u2019s lap entranced by the story of a talking fox she was telling. I didn\u2019t interrupt as the girl giggled a bit at the funny parts, looking nothing like the lifeless thing she had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the story was over she regretfully came to my side when I told her we were going to be leaving. The principal wheeled herself closer to me and put her hand on the silver head, saying she would tell her a story another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you want to keep that promise then it will be outside of the school because I\u2019m not coming back until she is gone, if at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured that might be how things would end up. You didn\u2019t hurt too many of them did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly Gregory. Though I did leave enough ashes for his parents to have a proper funeral. People like that don\u2019t deserve to live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured that would be the outcome for him as well. It\u2019s regrettable but you\u2019re right, he would have made a horrible Hunter with actions like that. If you hadn\u2019t killed him he would have ended up dying some other way or to someone else\u2019s blade. Well get going, I\u2019ll clean up the mess somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned away with Asala\u2019s hand in mine she called out to me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it isn\u2019t too much trouble, do you think I could spend more time with the girl before she leaves?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got no problem with that. You can come over to my house whenever you want if that\u2019s ok. Or we can meet out in town someplace. It will do her good to have more interactions than just me. To see that not everyone wants to hurt her because of who and what she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took a moment to imprint her communication spell with my magical id and my spell with hers. I gave her another farewell before heading out of school with the girl in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you like the old lady huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t A quick head nod and a smile that lit up her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s good. Now lets go get you some new clothes, some food in your tummy, and get you settled into your new home. And then when you are up to it you can cry all you want over your mom and dad. Because in the end your still just a little girl who lost her family and you deserve to mourn for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw a bit of the sorrow creep back into her face as she nodded her head in agreement and squeezed my hand. I gave her a squeeze back while we walked along in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo do you feel your choices were the correct ones?

Granted I never like dealing with you anyway since you seem to know how to get my blood boiling. So I would just as soon get this over and done with so you can go off to wherever you find more important than being with your son. Unless you are too afraid that the class might overhear the fact that all is not roses and sunshine in the Zelkov household, tarnishing the family name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a sigh while rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t remember raising you to be like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. You didn\u2019t raise me. Now can we get on with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, fine, just keep it down will you? This is sensitive Hunter business. To make it short and simple I want you to protect this little girl for the next few days. Preferably an under the table job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is she? Some dignitaries daughter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother looked both ways before leaning in and lowering her voice even further. As if afraid even this low tone would be overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer parents were killed three days ago in front of her, causing her monster summoning powers to activate. She\u2019s unstable right now and you are one of the few I know of who has no problems with special people like her. And one of the fewer still who could deal with any problems that might arise. Though I warn you, you will have to sustain her with magic since she refuses to eat or sleep or do anything at all. We\u2019ve just resorted to putting a diaper on her and treating her like an infant since she will just go to the bathroom wherever and whenever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat must have been your bright idea wasn\u2019t it? Because dealing with her problems would take too much time out of your busy schedule. Heaven forbid if you actually thought of someone else for a change.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not fair. My work really is important. More important than you know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t even get into the topic of fair with you right now. But you are right, I don\u2019t know, because you in your oh so infinite wisdom haven\u2019t decided to tell me a bloody thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to put her in a diaper! Since she\u2019s been sustained on magic for the last three days there is nothing in there anymore to come out. I was considering putting on some regular underwear but I didn\u2019t want her to mess herself while we were here so erred on the side of caution.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou keep telling yourself that mother. Who knows, perhaps I\u2019ll even believe you one of these days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was about to say something else in that hushed whisper we were using when Gregory came down the hall from the stairwell looking a bit haggard from being unconscious. He eyed the three of us but didn\u2019t say anything before opening the door and going into the classroom. I looked from the door to the little girl and then my mother. Pulling my glasses off and rubbing my eyes with a drawn out sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive me proxy Hunter status at least. The Zelkov name won\u2019t protect me from everything. And thirteen thousand Reul for my time and expenses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal. But I also want you to keep going to classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! It\u2019s going to be hard enough protecting her and keeping anything she might summon on the down low. What if she summons something here in the school? I might have no problems with summoners but the same can\u2019t be said for most other people!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI believe you can handle it. I have faith in you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYet not enough faith to let me take the Hunter Exams huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease Riktal darling, this is important. Your great with kids. You have a knack with them. And you continuing to go to school is also important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is no one else? No one at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell there is Pelei, but he isn\u2019t a guaranteed yes and you know how he is to begin with. I know you don\u2019t think much of me and I\u2019ll admit I am horrible around kids. But even I realize how iffy leaving her with Pelei would be. Please darling, I swear I\u2019ll tell you everything eventually, but not right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was beginning to get a headache as I shoved down the anger rising up inside. This always happened when I dealt with my mother. Just being in her presence could get me hot under the collar. But I had to keep in mind I was a Hunter. Even if I didn\u2019t have my license. I needed to do what was best for the girl, not for myself. The question was, what was best for the girl? The obvious answer was to protect her. But was I the best one for that job and more to the point, did she want to be protected? Kneeling in front of the girl I stared into her crimson eyes. I didn\u2019t see any intelligence in them but I knew she could see and hear what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Asala, I know you can hear me. You might have everyone else fooled but not me. So I am going to let you decide what is going to happen to you. I\u2019ll freely admit that Pelei is more experienced than I am. He has about twenty more years under his belt than I do. And he is an A class Hunter just like I am, or I should say as I should be. But he has this little quirk, he likes to dress pretty things up. He has an entire room filled with dolls and such he dresses up all the time. Personally I think it is creepy, but to each his own. If you go to Pelei he will dress you up like one of his dolls. He will put makeup on you and treat you well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut he won\u2019t really care about you or your problems. He will probably keep you locked up in his house until you leave, playing dress up all day long. Nothing will change from how things stand right now. The way you feel and act, it will all stay the same. He will continue to sustain you with magic and your body will slowly eat itself up from the inside until you whither away and die as nothing but a shell. I think a part of you want\u2019s that. A part of you wants to die because you think you have nothing left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I won\u2019t let you get away with any of that stuff. If you come with me, I will force you to eat and sleep properly, I will dress you up in clothes that you like and you pick out. You will be required to answer simple yes and no questions with a nod or shake of your head. I will treat you like an eleven year old girl instead of as a doll or a baby. I won\u2019t blame you for anything you do that isn\u2019t under your own control or tell you not to feel sad for your parents. I will in fact require that you grieve for them. I will hold you and comfort you as you cry for them and I will let you do so as often as you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I won\u2019t lie. If you chose to come with me you will be in slightly more danger than if you go to Pelei. I will protect you until my dying breath just like he would though. He will only offer you the death you seek, I offer you the  chance at a life. So my question to you is, which of those is more important to you right now? I will count to ten, if you want to come with me then take my hand, otherwise do nothing and my mother can take you to Pelei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand palm up, making sure to lock my gaze with hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne. Two. Three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI counted slowly, giving her a limited amount of time to respond. When faced with a difficult decision like this with only a short amount of time the mind would invariably answer with the greatest desire even if the person themselves didn\u2019t know what to do. It based its answers and responses in this manner on prior experience, personality, environment, and many other factors that made each person unique. If her desire to die was greater than her desire to live, it wasn\u2019t my place to deny her. Well intentioned kindness could do more harm than good. People seemed to think everyone had to live no matter what, but the truth was they didn\u2019t. That was only other people shoving their views and values onto someone else. For all I knew, she needed to go to the brink of death to appreciate life or learn to control her powers. If I forced her to live now it might stunt that growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I got to nine she slowly lifted her hand and put it in my waiting one with a small shudder of fear. I grinned at her as I pulled her in close to stroke her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala, that might have been the most important decision of your life. I honestly can\u2019t tell you if it was the right one or not, only time will answer that. But it was your choice and it was the one that you decided you could make without regret. That shows that you\u2019re a brave little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling the end of period and I looked over at the door and then at the girl before looking up at my mother. My eyes were drawn back to the girl who was still shaking slightly while clutching her teddy bear so hard I was surprised the stuffing didn\u2019t explode from it.</span></div></div>",

I can see you barely trust me and you\u2019re scared. Going to class right now might be worse for you in the long run so I\u2019m not going to chance it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door opened and the teacher came out, gaving us both a nod before heading off down the hallway. As I stood up with Asala\u2019s hand in mine and started down the corridor after him I noticed the door creaking open and inquisitive eyes peeking out at us. Yes this definitely was the right call. My mother came trotting after me as we left the prying eyes and ears behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDarling, Are you sure about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes mother I am sure. You thought I was good enough to protect this girl and that is what I am doing. She doesn\u2019t need to be thrown into that den of wolves right now. In her state of mind it is entirely possible she could summon something without meaning to, putting the class and her in danger. I can avoid that outcome by simply skipping out an hour and spending this day with her so she becomes comfortable around me and believes in the fact that I won\u2019t let any harm come to her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling. Do you think\u2026 would you mind if I tagged along with you for a while?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat, get an attack of motherly affection all of a sudden? My words actually get to you? Don\u2019t you have someplace important to be that\u2019s not here? Actually don\u2019t bother answering any of those. You\u2019ll probably give me one of your stock replies like I have my reasons and then lock your lips on actually giving me those reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe closed her mouth on the reply she was going to make and gave me a look of such sadness that if it had been anyone other than my mother I would have thought it was real. But she was fake from beginning to end. The only person she cared about was herself. Such looks were only meant to deceive and get what she wanted. I gave a disgusted tsk, refraining from spitting on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo whatever you want. You always do anyway. I don\u2019t know why you even bothered asking. If I had said no you would still follow me around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a small smile which I ignored while heading down the stairs to the first floor. I could hear her on the spell with my father saying he didn\u2019t need to pick her up at the school. I was actually surprised she had enough thought and consideration to tell him that much. As we left the front doors a thought struck me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait, father is back in town? I thought he wasn\u2019t going to be done with  that Sandworm infestation for another day or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems he was able to wrap that up earlier than he expected. He agreed to help me on my job in Bornica when I found out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a grunt I headed down the sidewalk into town, my mother trailing along behind me. I decided it would just be best to ignore her, my attention needed to be on the girl right now. Hitching my duffle bag higher on my left shoulder I gave her hand a small squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala. Time for a few of those simple yes and no questions I was telling you about. You don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to, but then I might have to let my mother pick things out for you. Just between you and me, if that happens you will probably end up with clothes that are uglier than what you are wearing right now. So question one, do you like the color blue and red?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head slowly as if unsure what I was getting at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood because our first order of business will be to buy you some new underwear and then snag a few pretty dresses. I know a place with a really nice set of light blue and light red ones that I think you will love. Unless you prefer pants and shirts over dresses? I know a bunch of girls do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head no, letting me know she liked dresses and I smiled at her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cObviously if you are getting a few new dresses you are going to need some new socks and shoes. Judging by the ones on your feet right now they might not last much longer. Do you have some attachment to them? Like to your teddy bear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother negative shake of the head as I noticed some of the tension draining out of her body. My conversation was mainly meant to calm her down and make her lose her fear of me. It helped force her mind off all the crap she had dealt with so far as she dealt with what I was saying. If I let her just mull over what was in her head she would lock up again, wanting to crawl back into her little shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about six or seven minutes we walked into a clothing store and headed straight for the undergarments. I ignored the shop ladies as I held out a pair of black panties trimmed with lace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you think? This something you like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head went back and forth so fast I thought it might detach from her neck. Holding up a pair striped with every color of the rainbow I made a grimace while sticking out my tongue at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really hope this isn\u2019t your thing. I\u2019m surprised they don\u2019t scare your dress white.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe also crinkled her nose at the pair I was holding before blushing a bit and looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh I know! Your embarrassed to pick them out with me here aren\u2019t you? I bet you already have your eyes on a few you like but don\u2019t want me to see. Am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blushed even redder but nodded her head at my words. With a grin I squatted in front of her so she could look into my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems you are a girl like any other after all if you are embarrassed by letting me see your underwear. Well then tell you what. How about I turn around and cover my eyes. You pick what you want and hide them so I can\u2019t see. Then you can go up to the register and pay for them with the money I give you. Will that make you feel better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see her eyes go up to the side as she thought about it before finally nodding her head. I made a show of standing up, closing my eyes and turning around while covering them with my hands. I made sure to crack my eye open and watch her between my fingers through one of the mirrors though. Even if my mother was here it was my job to protect her, taking my eyes off her was a big no-no, no matter what the circumstances. I watched as she picked out a few pairs with teddy bear prints on them and hid them behind her stuffed animal before poking me in the back. \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning back around I let my hands drop and opened my eyes before pulling out a thousand Reul bill to hand to her. She took the money and trotted over to the counter while I stayed where I was. The clerk who had witnessed our interaction simply rang her up and took the money, making sure to wrap them and put them in a bag so I couldn\u2019t see. As Asala turned around she glanced up and gave me a smile and a wink of knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe spent a few hours more in the store as she tried on different clothes and began to loosen up more and more. Even though that sorrow was still lurking in the shadows of her face, she was smiling and giggling more at least. I could tell she enjoyed trying on the dresses and looking at herself in the mirror. I even gave a few catcalls and generally made a fool of myself but was rewarded with her blushing and hiding her face in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother kept her distance, not interfering with how I was doing things and simply fading into the background with a thoughtful look on her face. I had no clue what she was thinking or why she had wanted to come, perhaps she actually wanted to learn a thing or two about dealing with children. Though if that was the case I would have to go see if hell had frozen over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I was paying for the four bags of stuff we had bought ranging from clothes, to her own toothbrush and toothpaste, I spied a gold necklace with a bear dangling from it. I pointed at it when Asala wasn\u2019t looking and the clerk grinned conspiratorially, placing it on my bill and handing it to me when the girl turned away. Back out on the street I tapped Asala on the shoulder while the necklace dangled from my fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned to see the jewelry staring her in the face, her eyes going as big and round as saucers while she followed the slight sway entranced. Carefully I unclasped it and hung it around her neck, giving her forehead a small kiss and her hair a ruffle as I knelt there on the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you can remember this day and remember me when you leave. Times will be hard, and you are going to feel like nothing is going right. But I want you to remember that things will get better. That you can always find a bit of joy even in the saddest times. You felt happy today. And it helped push your grief to the side for a little bit. But that doesn\u2019t mean that grief isn\u2019t still there or you aren\u2019t allowed to feel both things at the same time. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a bit hard for you to understand right now, but you remember that. You are allowed to grieve when you need to and are allowed to feel happy when happy things happen without thinking you are doing something wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe threw her arms around my neck and began to cry. Whether they were tears of joy or sadness I wasn\u2019t sure. Perhaps a bit of both. I simply rubbed her back and spoke softly that it would be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer tears didn\u2019t last long as she pushed herself away and sniffed, offering me a small smile as she rubbed her nose. I wondered if I had pushed her far enough for one day, both emotionally and with the crowds here in town.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cCome on Asala, time to get some real food in you. I expect you to eat and enjoy it as well. Eat so much that your tummy feels like it\u2019s going to explode. And then I\u2019ll make sure we get some ice cream for desert. You like banana splits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she wiped her nose with the back of her hand again she nodded her head yes. She reached for my hand before I had a chance to offer it, making me juggle the bags a moment to free up my left for her to take. I took her to a quiet diner across from the bank that served breakfast anytime. It didn\u2019t take long for her to point out what she wanted and slip off to the bathroom with a pair of her new panties while we waited. I kept an eye on the restroom door from my seat. Now that I had gotten this far I needed to give her enough room of her own while being close enough for her if she needed me. If I smothered her too much I might mess up all the work I had done so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe came back a few minutes later looking much more confident in herself. I suppose not wearing a diaper and being treated like a real person would have that affect on most people. The food came surprisingly quickly and Asala dug into her scrambled eggs while I stabbed a sausage link. My mother was still quietly observing us even as she ate her Talbar steak and potatoes. Her silence was actually beginning to unnerve me. I had never actually been around my mother for this long without wanting to choke the life out of her. Or ending up in a giant argument. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time I actually kind of enjoyed being around my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlarm bells went off at the bank across the street just as the clock towers chimed half past five. A masked man cam out with a bag stuffed with money in one hand and shooting back into the building with the other. At least I assumed it was money since it was a bank. As he turned right and began sprinting down the street my mother began to get up to go chase after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t bother, he won\u2019t get far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe went straight. He\u2019s going to run into Freddy and get taken down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pointed at a magic bakery down the road where an old man in his early fifties sporting a wooden peg for a left leg was opening the door. Even from here I could see the magical dust speckling his apron mixed with flower. His brown and grey head turned just as the robber raised his weapon. He bent over as if he was simply putting his box of bread and confectionaries on the ground just as the gun went off. Some might have called it luck, but it had been deliberate and calculated. The bullet whizzed harmlessly over him as the robber ran into his head before he could stop himself. Freddy reached up and grabbed the arm with the gun even as he stood back up, lifting the man off his feet and twisting in a half circle as the body fell.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the robber slammed into the ground he bounced a bit, only to be met by Freddy\u2019s right shoe to the chest. After that the robber lay still. As the police came running up Freddy let go of the man and picked up his box of bread heading to the alley next to his store where a bunch of homeless people were already gathering to receive the meager food. The police thanked the backer and he gave them a wave without looking even as they cuffed the thief and hauled him away. My mother looked at me with a bit of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know he was going to come out right then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe comes out every day at five thirty to give what\u2019s left over of his morning bread to the homeless and needy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s a Hunter isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEx-Hunter. Aside from the leg  he has a bad shoulder that keeps him from fully using his left arm and his ability to touch his magic is weak. He fought a Jikrim and it ate most of his magic along with his leg. Though what he does have he uses to make some of the best magical foods and pastries I have ever tasted. He came up with a way to turn magical potions into dust and mixes it with his other ingredients, turns the food into artifact like creations. Said he wanted to find a way to continue to help Hunter\u2019s even if he can\u2019t fight next to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou seem to know an awful lot about him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged as I stuffed some scrambled eggs of my own in my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI should. I helped him open his shop. Fronted him the money and even funded the initial stocking of supplies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere\u2019d you get that kind of money! I know you don\u2019t get that much living allowance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain I gave her another shrug as I watched the homeless people thanking Freddy like they always did. For some that was the only real food they got all day. Most of the soup kitchens around the city were small and not well funded so they couldn\u2019t always get fed from one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGambling. Big sis taught me the basics and I learned the finer arts of it from some of the best card sharks around. I won\u2019t say I didn\u2019t learn slight of hand and other cheating tactics from them either. Gambled some of my allowance and cheated some crooks out of their stolen Reul\u2019s to pay for it all. He\u2019s still paying me back even though I told him not to worry about it. The money I took from the crooks belonged to the people anyway, it\u2019s only right it got back into their hands somehow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know if I approve of you gambling Riktal darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cApprove or don\u2019t it won\u2019t stop me from doing it if I need to. Besides, I mainly learned to begin with so I knew what to watch out for so I didn\u2019t get cheated myself. You know what they say, it takes a thief to know a thief. Isn\u2019t part of the Hunter code to assist other Hunter\u2019s in need? Two years ago he was just another homeless on the street. Back then he saved my life. Got into a bit of a rumble with a few other Hunter\u2019s and they were better then I had first thought they were. Four A class and at the time I was only a B. I had thought they were three C\u2019s and a D to my detriment. He happened to be sleeping in the alley they had chased me into and he fought at my back. It\u2019s only natural that I repaid the debt to him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know about this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a lot about me you don\u2019t know mother. Because you never bothered to find out. The last seventeen years you and father have been off on one job or another for weeks on end, come home for a few hours and then are off again for weeks or months. Just when in that busy schedule of yours did you ever have time for me? So I grew up without you. You think I stay home all day all the time? I learned a lot about the shady side of life, and the many injustices in this world. I\u2019ve made a name for myself around here with many of the Hunter\u2019s and the shopkeepers. Just about every restaurant knows my face by now. And they already consider me a Hunter even if I don\u2019t have a license, contracting me for odd jobs and the like. It\u2018s not like you ever really cared to know me to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Riktal darling! That\u2019s not true! I admit I\u2019ve been busy, and I haven\u2019t been the best mother but I do care about you! I worry about you all the time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd yet never once do you seem to show it. When was the last time you dealt with me as your son and not as some Hunter you want something from? True or not the facts are still the facts, you were never there in any meaningful way that didn\u2019t involve me training to be a Hunter. But that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ve gotten used to it. I\u2019ve ceased to worry about what you think of me or if you care for me or not. Because the fact is I know you don\u2019t no matter what you might say otherwise. You lie and manipulate to achieve your own ends and your own goals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUsing everyone, even your own son ruthlessly to get what you want. You care about one person and that is Marian Zelkov, everyone else can just go to hell. Your tears and sad eyes and all those other emotions you show in face and voice are just there to make people do what you want. That is the truth of things as I see it mother. My thoughts and actions are simply the product of the life you gave me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA small tug on my tunic made me look over at Asala who was looking up at me with those big round eyes of hers. She clenched the necklace in her hand a moment before blinking at me slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least you still got your momma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was soft and light, just a bare whisper of sound, but after those few words she began to cry and I held her for a few moments until she pulled herself together. I wouldn\u2019t tell the girl that her words didn\u2019t mean much to me. She had thought they were important and perhaps to someone else they would have been, but for me that wasn\u2019t enough. I hated to admit to myself that I still cared about my parents, even though they were barely more than titles. Even I didn\u2019t know why I still loved them even a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re always sorry. Yet it never changes anything now does it? I think you\u2019ve overstayed your welcome. I\u2019ll pick up the tab so you go do whatever it is you need to do. I can take Asala home by myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned my gaze away and out the window again, dismissing her even as she opened her mouth to say something. But instead of words she closed her mouth as a few tears rolled down her cheek before she got up and left quietly. Asala put her hand on my arm as if to console me, even as I wrapped my arm around her for comfort. We sat there like that in silence as I watched my father eventually pull up in the car and pick my mother up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReady for dessert Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again traveler. Time has no meaning here in my domain, and so you can once again relive this day with young Riktal. Choose a different path, find different answers and learn different questions. Will you make choices based on the information you know now? Or will you not let it taint your decisions? It will be interesting to see the answer to that question.</span></div></div>",

So what do you say we go back home and I cook you up something good huh? A bit of home cooked food might be just what your belly needs right now. I think I got some chocolate ice cream in the fridge as well for dessert. Throw on a couple banana slices, a little syrup and you got yourself one tasty dish sure to give your sweet tooth the satisfaction it craves. Does that sound good to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head, wiping her nose again on the back of her hand before grinning at me like a fool. I gave her hair another ruffle as I stood up, having to juggle the bags in my hand to take hers when she reached for mine. As we walked back home I inquired as to her likes and dislikes food wise. Thankfully she didn\u2019t seem to be a picky eater, liking just about everything I asked. When we got back to the house and I dropped my bags I whispered that she should get changed and I wouldn\u2019t peek, giving her a wink which she blushed at before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I headed towards the kitchen I saw her digging into the bags of clothes I had set down in the hall. Soon enough I heard the patter of feet running up the stairs while I dug into the fridge for all the ingredients I would need for an old fashioned stir fry. My mother sat down at the kitchen table to watch me as I quickly and expertly cleaned the vegetables before cutting them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could cook.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Did you think I ate out every single day? Do you have any idea how much free time I have on my hands living here all alone? There\u2019s only so much sparring I can do with practice dummies or running around exploring the town. Sometimes I go outside the shield to do some monster slaying for an odd job or two, but I see no point in slaying for slayings sake. There are people out there who make a living off those monster drops, I wouldn\u2019t want to take that from them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never knew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you never cared to know did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clamped my mouth down on anything else I might have said. I was in a good mood, and I didn\u2019t need to ruin it by getting into yet another fight with my mother. It had actually been nice, spending so much time with her and not wanting to smash a club into her face. For a little while I had thought she had actually cared about me. I had forgotten about what a terrible person she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala came into the room just as I was throwing some cut strips of beef into the pan to cook in the oil along with the rest of the ingredients. She wore a light purple dress with a bit of white lining along the hem and some butterflies embroidered in the fabric as well. She did a small twirl as I whistled appreciatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFeeling like a real girl again Asala?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe bobbed her head as she sat at the table to watch me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt makes you feel good knowing that those clothes are yours doesn\u2019t it? That you are going to be able to take all that stuff with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a quick bob of the head and a grin from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the way, where is your teddy bear? You didn\u2019t leave him all alone upstairs did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a giggle she pulled back a flap on the front I hadn\u2019t even noticed when we had bought it to show the bear nestled in its own little sling. When she closed it back up again I couldn\u2019t even tell there was a bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019ll be! No wonder that one was so expensive! I didn\u2019t even realize it had its own personal mini space! That\u2019s a nice spot for him too. Keeps him nice and safe and there whenever you want him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a rapid movement of her head up and down. If she nodded it any harder her head might come off. When I asked if she was afraid because she wasn\u2019t holding it she shook her head no while pointing at me. I raised my eyebrow as I slid some stir-fry onto three plates and handed them out before grabbing three cups of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019m as soft and squishy as your bear, but you can squeeze me all you want if that helps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to dig in when my lunch with Lilia popped into my head. I set down my fork and clasped my hands. Asala saw what I was doing and nodded as if she agreed, clasping hers as well. We both looked at my mother waiting until she finally folded her fingers together. I said a quick grace and then resumed eating. I made a bit of small talk, telling a few funny stories and making funny faces to make the little girl laugh and feel more at ease. Now that I had brought her this far I had to juggle giving her freedom and staying close enough so she knew I was there if he needed me. I had built the trust, now I had to build a bit of self confidence and self empowerment in her. That would help her with her powers more than anything else right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter dinner and the promised chocolate ice cream Asala ran upstairs to take a bath while I cleaned up the dishes. I saw my mother looking at me thoughtfully from her seat at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are amazing with her you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. Isn\u2019t that why you wanted me in the first place?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes it is. But honestly I didn\u2019t think you would be this good. Most of my information was second hand from your father and sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI locked down the retort I was going to make. Reminding myself not to get dragged into her false sincerity and nice words. I had let myself do that too many times and gotten burned because of it. I could see she wanted to say more but didn\u2019t for whatever reason. That was fine, if she didn\u2019t talk I wouldn\u2019t get angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinished with my cleaning I dried my hands and went into the living room, flicking the TV onto a random cartoon for when Asala came back downstairs. She did so not long after I settled myself onto the couch and my mother in a nearby chair. She wore her new pajamas this time and was toting around her bear in her left hand again. Without hesitation she slid onto the couch next to me and into the crook of my arm while I absently stroked her hair. After only a few minutes her breathing told me she was asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal. Do you know why I wanted to follow you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot the foggiest idea. Probably just one of your whims or to try and get something more out of me to further your own ends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess in a way you are right. I wanted to learn how to be a better mother. Sadly you seem to be better at it then I ever was. It\u2019s never too late to learn a few new things right? Even if it is your own son that has to teach them to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what good does it do you now? I don\u2019t see you going off and finding little kids to be motherly too all that often. Big sis his grown and moved out. And as for me\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs for you, you are a man already. You grew up without me ever realizing it. I wasn\u2019t a big part of your life, I know that. I put work ahead of everything else. Added on top of not knowing how to deal with all the crying and screaming and constant need for attention, I found it easier to just not deal with it period. I made mistakes where you were concerned, a lot of them. Just like I made a lot of mistakes where Olia was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t for one minute think I don\u2019t regret so many things as a mother. Perhaps if I had been more like you Olia would never have died. No. I know she would never have died. All it would have taken was a little bit of attention, but I was so wrapped up in my own problems and my own little world. I beat myself up all the time over all the things I realize now I should have done, or could have done better. I can\u2019t change the past, no matter how much I wish. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t change the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe played with her hands a moment, looking down into her lap as if searching for words she found difficult to say in their depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour father and I\u2026 We decided we are going to quit being Hunter\u2019s soon. Or at least, take a very long vacation from it. We weren\u2019t quite sure how to tell you because there never seemed to be a good time when we could talk like this without fighting. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision for us to make but we both agreed it would be for the best if we were going to have another baby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe both want to be there for him or her like we failed to be there for you. And we\u2019d like it if you were able to help us. We know we aren\u2019t going to be good at it at first. We are going to mess up and want to slip back into our old habits. We will be at a loss as to what to do or how to act. But you have that knack with kids that we don\u2019t. You practically raised Olia on your own and I know she thought the world of you. That was something I was always jealous of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right, today was a bit of a whim. But something told me to put off my trip for just a little while. That this would be a great chance for me to see first hand everything I lack as a mother. To see what it is I can do different. I\u2019m glad I got the chance to spend this time with you. It made me feel like I was actually part of your life for the first time. It made me think I could really change that part of me. I wanted what you were so easily able to obtain with that little girl in one short day that I couldn\u2019t get a fraction of in three days. I really am sorry Riktal. Sorry for not being a part of your life, for not being a better mother, for letting Olia die. I\u2019m sorry for just being me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe covered her face with her hands to hide her tears from me. The water still flowing between her fingers to drip into her lap.</span></div></div>",

Part of my mind wanted to believe her while the other part kept telling me not to get sucked into her lies. I didn\u2019t know why she would lie about this but there had to be a reason. She always had reasons for everything that made sense to her and the way she wanted the world to be. Still that small voice kept nagging me saying what if. What if this time she wasn\u2019t lying. What if this time she really meant what she was saying and she really wanted to change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStroking Asala\u2019s hair a little longer while my mother continued to cry I fought that fierce internal battle until I was ready to open my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was actually nice. Spending the day with you and not getting into any arguments. Knowing you were there even if you were just in the background. And having Asala next to me made me feel like a big brother again. It felt like we were actually a family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy soft words made my mother look up at me in surprise. As if she didn\u2019t expect me to answer so positively if at all. Looking down at the girl sleeping at my side I felt my lips playing up in a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. There is no way to change the past. Change the mistakes we made. No one is perfect or able to make all the right choices. Sometimes we don\u2019t even know what the right choices are or even what the choices are to begin with. But as long as you live you can change as long as you are willing to change. And as long as you live you can forgive, both yourself and others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not so noble as to be able to forgive you so easily. I\u2019m not the best son and I have my own faults as well. I\u2019ll continue to get angry at you and blow up. I still have a short temper and will probably make my own share of mistakes. But if you really want to give this a shot I\u2019m willing to try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh Riktal! Thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my hand before she could start gushing out more thanks or tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly on two conditions. The first is that I will take that baby and run off, hiding myself so you will never find us if you do slip back into your old habits. I will not let that baby grow up the way I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgreed. We really do want to make this work honey. What\u2019s the second condition?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou stop with all the marriage meetings. It is a stupid outdated tradition that only promotes inbreeding of the older houses. In my opinion it is part of the problem with the old houses thinking they are somehow elite and that mindset gets passed on to everyone else. Yes we might be better in combat than most of the other houses because we have had more years to refine training techniques and secret arts to pass down, but we are still Hunter\u2019s like anyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you at least go to just one more? I promise I will stop but I set this one up for next week and it would be rude to cancel so suddenly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I never liked them to begin with. Cancel and be rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk but Mrs. Hawthrope will be devastated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to chuckle from the belly. The chuckle slowly built until I was muffling the laughter to keep from waking Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t see what\u2019s so funny darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs the girl\u2019s name Liz Hawthrope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s in my class. She told me she had a meeting next week but didn\u2019t know who. I told her the guy was probably ugly as sin among other things. I didn\u2019t know it was with me! I\u2019ll let her know tomorrow and you can cancel it without being rude to her mother. Say we already met and it won\u2019t work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother began to chuckle too at the irony of it all before getting a slightly more serious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do you like her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRomantically? No. But I do like her as a friend. Or at least I get the feeling I could like her as a friend. I still don\u2019t know her all that well. We really do have a lot in common so it makes it easy to identify with her. If it turns into something more, then it does. I\u2019m not going to force something that isn\u2019t there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a man grown now aren\u2019t you? Able to talk about such things so easily. I really did miss out on a lot. I guess I should stop treating me like a child .\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her eyes misting up again as she looked at the girl sleeping at my side with such longing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind, as long as you don\u2019t go overboard. The kicker to all of this is I still love you and father even though you were horrible parents. It might be just a small grain but it\u2019s there and it can grow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe smile that grew on her face was one untainted by any hidden agenda, seeming to make her five years younger. With a bit of sudden inspiration I told her to sit on the other side of the couch. When she did so I rolled Asala\u2019s head gently over onto her lap. She looked like a deer caught in the headlights as her body stiffened up and her arm went into the air. gently I brought her arm down to rest on the girls head as I knelt on the floor in front of Asala\u2019s face. I softly sang a lullaby to the sleeping girl, one I had sung to Olia countless times to get her to go to sleep. Even though my voice was pretty bad Olia had always wanted to hear me sing. I was rewarded by her snuggling a bit into my mothers lap and whispering one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMomma.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe look that came to my mothers face was priceless as I told her to wait right there. She held out her hand as I snuck out of the room and upstairs to my own. Digging in my closet I pulled out a stuffed blue rabbit missing an eye and an old shoebox of photo\u2019s. By the time I got back down stairs my mother was hesitantly stroking the little girls hair like I had done with a faraway look in her face. Handing her the shoebox she looked inside curiously, gasping at all the photos of Olia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI spent a lot of magic saving these few pictures and a bunch of stuffed animals from the fire. I\u2019ve kept them hidden because I thought you didn\u2019t want anything to remind you of her. This is Mr. Snuggles, her favorite animal of all of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI handed the rabbit over to her as she shifted through the photos and began crying all over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t want any reminders of her at first. It was just too hard to handle. And then I regretted it ever since. I never thought I would ever see her face again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting back down on the other end of the couch I looked at my lap while squeezing my hands together. This next part was going to be hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMother. What do you think of people with special powers in general? I already know your stance on monster summoners, you tolerate them but you don\u2019t really like them. But what about others?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I really don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve not met many of them in my time. Most of the ones with what might be called cursed blood don\u2019t usually advertise their existence. I know most people hate them simply because they are different. And the few I have met really aren\u2019t that bad. I guess if I had to say I can tolerate them until they prove otherwise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd if I had cursed blood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt her gaze on me as her voice softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHave you ever heard of Imprinters?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother day comes to a close and so many questions and answers. What is it with you humans always wanting to know? Always seeking for some answer or another. Is that why you make the choices you do? To pursue the answers you seek? Or do you make choices in order to create more questions? Perhaps these are one and the same. I have learned a bit in my time observing you as you utilized this power of god. Yet I find myself still wanting more. My desires have not yet been completely fulfilled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo it seems I am not unlike you at all in the end. I myself pursue answers in my own fashion and have made the choice to bring you here and gift you with a gods power. You shall come again will you not? Relive this day making different, perhaps better choices and learning more in your quest for the ultimate truths. Though I ask if you will come again as if you have a choice.</span></div></div>",

I won\u2019t let anyone hurt you or get too close to you ok? After school we will go out shopping and get something to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at my mother as I stood up, barely suppressing some of the words I really wanted to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you got what you came for. Go off and do whatever it is you find more important. I\u2019m sure your next job will keep you away for another week or two this time as well. So no need to say anything redundant like don\u2019t set a plate out for me tonight because I never do. I\u2019m surprised you even remember where our house is most of the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door opened and the History teacher walked out, giving us a nod before going on his way. His appearance made my mother shut her mouth on whatever she was going to say in response to my words. Before he got out of earshot and she could say something I gave her a slight nod of my head mockingly and entered the room he had just vacated. All eyes turned towards me, or more precisely, on the little girl who was clutching at my pant legs and trying to hide behind them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh my god she is so adorable!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow old is she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy is she here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeave it to the girls to go gushing over her right off the bat and asking such invasive questions. What was it about cute things, babies, and animals that turned them into such mindless idiots. Was it some sort of hidden genetic strand that activated some feminine instinct in them at the sight of such things? If that was the case why was it absent in my mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved my way through them, sitting the girl down by the wall at my desk and grabbing a chair for myself. When the girls all began to converge like wild hyenas scenting prey I held up my hand while glaring, forcing them to stop their advance and look at me questioningly. I let my bag drop next to my chair with a loud clank to increase the ominous air I was suddenly giving off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer name is Asala and she will be joining this class for a few days. I\u2019ve been tasked with giving her around the clock protection. Due to a bunch of different circumstances I will still be attending classes and so she will be next to me. She just lost her parents and she is grieving and scared. She doesn\u2019t need a pack of wolves like all of you going after her. I ask that you stay away and ignore her for the time being. She is not my sister and I don\u2019t care how cute you think she is, I will not let anyone get close that she does not want close. Try me if you dare but I will not hesitate to throw any one of you out the window for her sake. This is a job, there is nothing I will not do to fulfill my end of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I shooed them away and sat next to the girl I saw eyes going to the still broken window and then to Gregory. So there were already rumors flying around about what had happened. I had thought it a bit odd no one had really commented on the window, but I guess they already knew or thought they knew what had happened. As the teacher came in and noticed the girl I gave him a quick rundown of the situation as well. He simply nodded his head and gave the class another warning to respect my wishes to keep away. I leaned over so only Asala could hear my whispered words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you get scared just squeeze my hand. It\u2019s just one hour, that\u2019s all. I wasn\u2019t lying when I told them I will do anything to protect you. Until you leave, you are my number one priority. Just be brave for me ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head slightly to say she understood as I slipped my hand into hers. Almost immediately she squeezed it for all it was worth and I squeezed back with a smile. Her right hand was squashing the bear almost as hard as her left was squeezing mine. But she didn\u2019t hide away inside her mind again, even listening with a bit of interest as the teacher started his lesson<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe Cawmacaw is a highly intelligent monster that can communicate with humans. It is one of the few species with the ability to do so. Although it can only make simple words and phrases since it\u2019s beak and vocal cords are not as adaptive as our own. They are a gentle creature, more like an animal than a monster. Some theories say they mutated from a parrot while others think they were constructed using magic using a parrot or other similar bird as a base. Who can tell me what the difference between those two theories is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo one seemed to know the answer except me and Liz, She gave me a raised eyebrow as if asking if I wanted to answer. I shook my fist at her before throwing a scissors and she nodded. We played a quick game of rock-paper-scissors out of sight and I lost to her paper so I raised my hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA mutation of an existing animal would mean it is natural. That it is simply an evolution of a parrot as humans are believed to be evolved from monkeys. Whereas if they are constructed that means they are unnatural to the order of things. That someone used a lot of magic to create something that never would have existed before by altering the parrot physically, leaving it\u2019s ability to reproduce intact. Thereby distinguishing it from a neuter construct such as a golem that has no natural way of replicating itself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I should expect nothing less from a Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA girl in the front raised her hand and the teacher pointed at her with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Horris, is that why most monsters leave regular animals alone? Because they are all mutations or constructs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s actually a good question. The fact is we aren\u2019t one hundred percent sure of why this is so. There are cases of monsters attacking animals but they are rare. Indeed many monsters are found living in harmony with animals out in the wild, some monsters even disguising themselves as regular animals. Some of the more intelligent monsters, especially those of the humanoid family such as trolls and giants, have been known to have primitive civilizations and colonies that include such things as hunting wild game. We have been able to study these primitive settlements to get an idea of how early man might have lived. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t give you a better answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tuned the teacher out after that as my little game with Liz gave me the idea to play some paper and pencil games with Asala. This seemed to help keep her mind off of her surroundings and calm. I drew her a few funny faces on the papers as well, eliciting a couple small smiles that died on her lips quickly. But I could tell they hadn\u2019t been forced so that was a start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I knew it the bell rang and class was over. I gave Asala\u2019s head a quick pet as I grinned in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t too bad now was it? Time to go have some real fun. You like blue? I think you do. You seem like a blue kind of girl. I know a nice little shop with some pretty blue dresses. And it\u2019s close to a quiet little diner where they serve just about anything you could ever want. Their ice cream is really good too. Never met a little girl yet that didn\u2019t like ice cream.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I slipped my arms into the straps of my bag and held out my right for Asala to take, a few of the girls seemed to have already forgotten my warning, heading in my direction. Liz intercepted them for me, giving me a quick wink and a head nudge telling me to get going. I mouthed the words thanks and she mouthed back that I owed her even as me and Asala left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stuck close to me as we left the front entrance and headed for the street. I noticed three boys with the air of those looking for trouble hanging around them standing by the gates. I guess even in a Hunter academy you would find bullies. They wouldn\u2019t last long though, they would get the snot beat out of them soon enough by one or more of the people they picked on. If they didn\u2019t get their act together they would never make it to graduation as Hunters, most likely getting killed or kicked out long before that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I got closer the one in the middle with an eye watering shade of neon blue hair grinned and whistled at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey that your girlfriend? Looks a little young to me don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I pass I hauled back my left fist and sucker punched him in the face. I could feel his nose breaking under my knuckles as he flew through the air to land in the street, almost getting hit by a car in the process. I didn\u2019t even bother replying or giving him any more attention, simply turned and headed towards town. Looking down at the girl next to me I gave her another smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet\u2019s go make you look prettier than you already are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe smile she bestowed upon me while tightening her fingers around my hand seemed to make even the sun dim for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTruly it is amazing is it not? The way each small choice is affected by the ones before it and the ones that others make that you have no control over. How some choices seem so easy at first glance and others feel as if the weight of the very world hangs in the balance. Choices made off of small body cues, whether they be real or imagined, and choices made out of personal preference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was the thoughts behind the choices you made? Were you influenced by the way Riktal saw the world? Or by the way you personally view things? Did you make choices as to what you would do in the same situation? Or for entirely different reasons? It has been entertaining to observe you, though your time here draws to a close. Come again and I shall again bestow upon you the power of choice. The power to alter destiny. To redo or undo the mistakes you felt you might have made. Just remember, unlike in this world between worlds, you cannot remake the choices in your own life.</span></div></div>",

The other three seemed to give Lilia a bit of space making it easy to find a spot. I wasn\u2019t even sure why I sat down here instead of up in the bleachers, perhaps it was some strange connection between me and Lilia. I felt awkward sitting down here with these people I barely knew. Granted I barely knew Liz as well, but at least I was able to understand her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey uh, Zelkov?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCall me Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMarsa smiled at me tentatively as if not sure of the proper response. I could see she had gained a bit of awe for me after witnessing my skill, that was why she was acting a bit hesitant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm, Riktal. What was that thing you did with your gun? You said something about phase two and then it just sort of morphed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling my Lexington out of my belt I noticed the others watching as well. Carefully I made sure to unload it before anything else since this was going to be demonstration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou all know about artifact weapons having heart crystals inside of them right? And how those crystals store magical energy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they all nodded I continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell higher grade artifacts with these crystals inside have up to three phases. This is the default phase or phase one. It is basically just a weapon. Those stock swords and shields you use are phase one, so is your templar shield Jethic. Phase two refers to pulling out some of that stored magic and turning the weapon into something else that is still basically the same thing, just used for different purposes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I detached the top barrel and held both parts out for them to see before placing the single shaft on the back of my forearm with my palm up so they could see the magic taking place to create the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEach weapon has a different action when going into phase two, obviously a sword would have attributes pertaining to its nature, such as multiplying one blade into two, or altering its weight to make it faster or sharper. For this weapon in particular, the magic creates two palm triggers I can manipulate. As you saw the single shaft also gained the ability to eat magic similar to the Glif. That\u2019s because the heart crystal used to create this weapon came from a Glif.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat brings me to the next point. The attributes a weapon can gain from a heart crystal is dependant on the monster that crystal came from. Some crystals are more suited to certain weapons than others. This Glif crystal can be put into say a sword or a shield and also be able to absorb magical attacks, but its effectiveness in returning that magic might not be so great, or the multiple ways to return it might be limited. In the case of this gun, I made the flamethrower but I could have also shot bullets of fire or a big fireball. You also saw how I created an explosive shot by combining the rest of the fire magic with a bullet. That is because the crystal is well suited to this weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw them nodding their head in understanding before looking out over the arena at the different weapons. There was real interest in their eyes, not looks of greed or dreams of power. They wanted to learn this stuff. They had realized this is what they were training for and this too was part of being a Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou would probably learn about this later on, perhaps next year after you get the basics down and you are strong enough to handle a second phase. Make no mistake, you need to have a mental and physical strength to use a second phase. The more powerful the weapon the more skill you need to wield it. If you don\u2019t have that internal strength the weapon can eat you alive. Most reasonably priced and medium level weapons only go up to phase two, but there is also a third phase to any higher grade weapon such as this Lexington.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe thing is, that third phase is usually a last resort kind of deal. Because it draws out and imbues you with the powers of the heart crystal, allowing you to take on the attributes of the beast it came from. Since you are unleashing all the raw magic from the crystal you are able to form and shape it to your will to make your weapon do just about anything you wish it to. This is a sort of overdrive mode that puts a tremendous strain on your body and will usually break the weapon once it is over. In the case of this gun, if I went into phase three I could become a Glif. Able to eat magic at will and counter every attack thrown at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuietly I reattached the barrel to the top of the weapon, returning it to it\u2019s phase one state. Daniel was the first one to ask anything, a bit of tentativeness in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it puts a strain on the body, is their anything we can do for the person afterwards? Or is there anything we can do as a sort of safety measure to minimize what happens beforehand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour thinking, I like that. If they are weakened the only thing you can do is give them a bit of your own magic or try to get some food in them quickly. Most good Hunter\u2019s can store a small bit of their magic in a sort of reserve tank so if they ever go into phase three they don\u2019t come out looking like they are going to stop breathing any second. Learn to carry around a bit of ration bread. The fruits and nuts packed into those bars are designed to restore energy and vitality quickly. Even if you can\u2019t handle a phase three, a lot of Hunter\u2019s who can don\u2019t bother carrying such things around, relying on their own skill to pull them through. But that is something you can do even now that can change the outcome of a battle or even save a life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn a whim I pulled out a few of the small squares of ration bread I kept in my own pouch and handed them out to the four who took them like I was handing them the key to the city itself. They carefully put the wax wrapped bundles in their own pouches with stuttered thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey will last about six months before they lose their effectiveness. I just got these the other day so you don\u2019t need to worry about how fresh they are. There is a guy named Freddy Jang that runs a magical confectionary bakery downtown by the Fast Track Bank of Efenbis that makes some of the highest quality rations for really cheap.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you mean Sweets for Sweets? I love that place! Their bread and pastries are simply amazing! I drop by there at least once a week to treat myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMarsa began describing the bakery to the others while I sat back and listened. I still felt a bit awkward but this hadn\u2019t been too bad. I had been able to have a real conversation with people without getting annoyed over their trivial thoughts on fashion or relationships or the hot new singers. Maybe it was because I was talking about what I knew, being a Hunter. Perhaps I really could fit into this school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang and we all broke up to head back to our respective locker rooms. It didn\u2019t take long to put my weapon away and shoulder my bag before heading back to the classroom. As I settled down to watch the others coming in, I noted the hero worship and awe in many eyes. Also noting the more than passing interest of many of the girls who were no doubt plotting how to make me their boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI also didn\u2019t miss the slight change in power as Marsa, Jethic, and Daniel had come into the room chatting with Lilia who seemed to be surprised they were giving her the time of day. The rest of the class didn\u2019t miss this either and yet more speculation ran behind eyes. I had a feeling Lilia\u2019s school days would not be as lonely anymore. I wasn\u2019t sure why I was even bothering helping the girl like that or worried about her so much. Perhaps her divination had gotten to me more than I cared to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in, took attendance and then started on his History lesson. He was only about five minutes into it though when a woman with gray speckled through her raven black hair came into the room pulling a girl child clutching a tattered teddy bear. The girl was petite, not more than four and a half feet tall with hair as white as snow and eyes as scarlet as a sunset. The woman\u2019s hazel eyes searched the room and found mine before she walked back out pulling the girl behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I picked up my duffle bag and headed for the door telling the teacher it was me the woman wanted. Nodding his head slightly I ignored the stares and the whispers as I left the room, making sure the door was closed firmly behind me. Once in the hall I gave the woman a false smile while crossing my arms in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, lets go someplace more private.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Then lead the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs my mother started off down the hall pulling the girl behind her I fell into step next to her. It wasn\u2019t a comfortable or companionable silence, more of a heavy tense one. Even though I kept telling myself not to get angry at her this time I knew that probably wasn\u2019t going to happen. Being around her for any length of time seemed to set me off no matter what I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI would have thought coming for me in person was beneath you. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t send one of your aides to come get me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes well I originally had told him to get you so I could talk to Val privately for a few moments. But he got a bit heated, saying he wasn\u2019t some gofer. That if I wanted my son I could get him myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we came off the steps Gregory came down the hall to go up them holding his head and walking only slightly unsteadily. When he saw us he stared in surprise. Though mostly he stared at my mother, her being a big name Hunter and all. He gave a quick bow before slipping past us and hurrying up the steps. As my mother turned down the way he came I continued our conversation as if we had never been interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA guy this time huh? He must not have read the fine print to well that says he is a gofer if he works for you. I bet he\u2019s some well muscled no nonsense type who\u2019s arms are bigger than his brain. It\u2019s fifty-fifty for him being ex military or just a workout junkie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow can you say that when you never met him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I know your taste for men. It never hurts to look, isn\u2019t that your motto? You pick strongmen for their muscle not their IQ.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if I\u2019m going to have a guy around all the time what\u2019s wrong with him being a bit good looking? Your father has a few good looking aides as well you know. But you\u2019re right. He is big in the muscles, and a bit narrow in the brains department. Not ex-military though, but he comes from a military family. He\u2019s not working out quite like I had hoped though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo toss him like you toss all the other aides. I\u2019d refrain from saying you get what you deserve for basing his performance on looks alone but I really don\u2019t care enough about your feelings not to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother opened the door to a simple room, a single long table in the middle with six chairs around it. Probably a student council room or something by the looks of it. We sat down across from each other, well me and my mother sat down, the girl was pushed into her seat and positioned like a doll. Once she settled the girl my mother turned to me, folding her hands on the table in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll get right to the point. I want you to protect this girl until someone can pick her up in a few days. Her name is Asala and she lost her parents a few days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s sad and all but why me? Any number of people could do this job. Which begs the question why are you personally protecting her and why do you need me to take over? Is she some foreign ambassadors daughter? Secretly the princess of some country in the midst of civil war?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a monster summoner. With unstable powers at that. You are one of the few I know and trust that is fine with that and would protect her from anything she summons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat may be true but I\u2019m not interested. I\u2019m already stuck in this god forsaken school you shoved me in so I\u2019ve had my fill of acceding to your whims and requests for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease Riktal? It will be easy. She\u2019s run deep into her mind from the first and shut down all her responses. She mostly just summons little weenies now that you could take out in your sleep. Just give her a dose of magic so she doesn\u2019t feel hunger or the need to sleep and check her diaper every so often in case it needs changed and you\u2019re good to go. As you can see she doesn\u2019t resist. Plus you\u2019re good with kids to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHold up, hold up! You put a diaper on her! She has to be at least eleven years old! How could you possible think that was a good idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell she wouldn\u2019t go to the bathroom on her own, simply let it run down her leg or sit in her underwear without saying anything. She ruined a few good pieces of clothes that way too. So I just decided putting a diaper on was easier all the way round. She hasn\u2019t had an accident in  a day or so, mainly because there is just nothing inside for her to expel. I was going to put some panties back on her today but I thought I should err on the side of caution since I was coming to the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd the thought of, I don\u2019t know, sitting down and trying to help her break out of her shell didn\u2019t cross your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think we tried! But everything we did just seemed to send her deeper and deeper! Besides, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s better this way? No need to worry about tough monsters popping up and they don\u2019t show up as often. With her like this it\u2019s like her powers are already partially sealed and contained.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s times like this that I am really glad you had no part in raising me. I doubt I would be as well put together as I am if you had tried being a real mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother was about to reply when her head jerked up. I felt the presence as well a fraction of a second later. Even as I was pointing my finger at the door, my mother was still a fraction of a moment ahead of me. The line of purple energy that shot from her finger happened right before mine left my hand. The magic hit the door and drilled through it like it wasn\u2019t there just before mine did the same slightly lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth me and my mother shoved our chairs away from the table and sprinted towards the door. I was slightly faster this time, yanking it open to see Gregory slumped against the far wall bleeding from a hole in his gut and chest where our attacks had hit him. He held his hands over the wounds, his magic coating his hands as he tried to heal himself. My mother narrowed her eyes down at him for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe looks familiar. He\u2019s the boy that passed us earlier isn\u2019t he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah he is. His name is Gregory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s a sneaky little eavesdropper is what he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe brought her foot up, creating a blade of magic along her sole and stomped down on his neck severing his head from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow his name is dead. He should have known better then to snoop around where he doesn\u2019t belong. Sorry about this Val, can you deal with the family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe principal wheeled around the corner to look at the body with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s regrettable but I understand Marian. I\u2019ll deal with the clean up don\u2019t worry. He must have come down the other stairwell because he didn\u2019t get past me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot blaming you. He wouldn\u2019t have lived long as a Hunter anyway doing things like this. Better to cull the flock now before he has a chance to hurt anyone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked from the principal to my mother to the body and finally back into the room where the girl hadn\u2019t moved a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThirteen thousand Reul for the job plus expenses. That is on top of my living allowance since this is something completely separate. I won\u2019t be attending classes with her or something like this might happen again. Unless you don\u2019t care if I kill off everyone in my class if I have to. Plus proxy Hunter papers as well in case I need them for something the Zelkov name won\u2019t get me out of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you please do it without the papers? It would really benefit me to no end. I\u2019ll agree to the other things no problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. Under the table it is. But send me everything you know about the girl with the money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you so much Riktal darling! I swear you\u2019ll understand it all soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I\u2019ve heard that before. Still not understanding much except how much of a liar you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a quick hug, kissing me on both cheeks which I suffered through before she said a final farewell and hurried away. The principal gave me a nod of farewell also before spinning her chair in a circle to disappear from whence she came. With a sigh I returned to the room, closing the door behind me as I sat next to the girl. I needed to get to know her first and break her out of her shell. Knowing my mother and the quality of most of the people she hired it was no wonder they couldn\u2019t get her to interact with the world. They probably scared her deeper inside with their cruelly thoughtless words. But I had seen the tells that told me she could at least hear what was going on around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala. Looks like me and you will be together for a while. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not like my mother or those other people. I want to know about you and help you. But I\u2019m not going to push. Instead I want to tell you a story about when my little sister died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I picked up her limp left hand I saw her right one squeeze the bear she was holding just a little bit and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends the day, both for the first time and for the millionth time. Only one ending to all the possibilities that exist. As choice and thought clash constantly not only in Riktal\u2019s mind, but in the mind of a thousand others. Every person you interacted with today and every person you didn\u2019t influences those thoughts and choices you have no control over. What makes one thought more prevalent than another? Such as Gregory\u2019s decision to sneak back down and listen or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat in his mind made the urge to listen stronger then the urge to not listen? Would he always listen if given the choice? Are the timelines where he does not listen the false timelines then if he were to always listen? And what about Riktal? Over the course of the day he has already made many choices, well you have made them for him but still. Does that mean this Riktal we see before us is the real Riktal? Or is it a fake that has strayed from the true path? Come again as we delve for the answers to these questions. Replay this day over and over, making new choices to find out the truth. And perhaps continue to find out more about yourself in the process.</span></div></div>",

Unless you\u2019re worried about the Zelkov name being tarnished by having any argument we have overheard by the class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you always have to be so difficult?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you have to be my mother? I\u2019m simply the product of how you raised me, or more specifically the lack thereof. I\u2019m sure you have more important places to be, perhaps some nation to save from the ravages of monsters that only the great Marian Zelkov can handle. So why don\u2019t we just get this over with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRubbing her eyes lightly she expelled gustily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to start with you. I never want to argue with you but every time we get together that\u2019s just how it ends up. Fine we can talk here.

So what is she? A diplomat\u2019s daughter? Some rich person you are sucking up to right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really don\u2019t think much of me do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs it really that obvious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith another sigh my mother looked both ways down the hall to make sure no one was nearby before leaning in to whisper so only I heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a summoner. Her parents died in front of her three days ago and that activated her powers. They are unstable, seeming to activate more often when she has extreme emotions. She shut down on us and turned into this doll like thing you see before you. She won\u2019t eat, won\u2019t sleep, won\u2019t even go to the bathroom for herself. She will just let her bowels or bladder go whenever she feels like it without warning. We ended up just sustaining her with magic and putting a diaper on her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA diaper? What, talking to her and trying to help her with her problems was too much for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think we tried getting her to come out of her shell? Do you think I really liked treating her like an infant? She soiled two dresses before this one and it took forever to clean up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd how did you help exactly? Told her to just get over it? That it wasn\u2019t the end of the world or something like that? Treated her like her feelings didn\u2019t matter in the slightest? I bet she summoned something when you told her crap like that too. Bet you used many of the same words you used when I was broken up over Olia dying. Suck it up and move on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clamped my lips on the rest of what I was going to say. I was in a good mood right now and I didn\u2019t want to ruin it. Not with yet another argument with my mother. I needed to keep what was best for the girl in mind here, not let my feelings for my mother taint my decision. As I looked down at the girl my mother suddenly jerked her head up with narrowed eyes like she had heard some subsonic sound. I felt the presence as well moments before she whipped out her hand to throw a knife down the hall to stick into the wall by the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome out little rat or I might have to do more than just give you such a small warning!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGregory came around the corner slowly, walking over to my mother when she beckoned. She looked down at the boy who kept his gaze averted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd just how much did you hear you little sneak?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing really.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why were you hiding and trying to suppress your presence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I just didn\u2019t want to interrupt that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at the girl and I saw the fear and hatred in his eyes. My mother noticed it too as she scowled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes I totally believe that. Stay right where you are for now boy until my business with my son is done. Then me and you will have a nice long private chat about just how much you didn\u2019t here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me expectantly, as if saying this was my fault. And part of it was I would admit. She had wanted to go someplace more private but I had been stubborn. Looking at the girl again I sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThirteen thousand Reul, for Hunter fee and expenses. I\u2019m in a good mood right now and I\u2019m not going to fail to protect an innocent because of my feelings towards you. I also want Hunter proxy papers since I don\u2019t have my license yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCould you please do this as an under the table deal? It would really help me out immensely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen fifteen thousand in that case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I want you to continue to go to classes. It\u2019s really important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! Do you have any idea\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked from Gregory to the girl before clamping down on what I was going to say. I saw he was trying to unobtrusively back away and escape but a glance from my mother stopped him. Running my fingers through my flaming head of hair I took a deep breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, but only if I feel it doesn\u2019t endanger her or the class. Plus I want you to send me everything you know about her over the com spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can live with that. I\u2019ll have the papers drawn up and sent over later. The money will be in your account by tonight as well. Thanks Riktal darling. This really is important and I really do appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tKneeling in front of the little girl who didn\u2019t even seem to register I was there, I studied her closely, noting the slight clenching of her bear as I smiled a bit. So she wasn\u2019t completely unaware even if everyone else thought she was. That gave me something to work with at least. A glance back at the classroom door before giving her and my mother another thoughtful look. What was best for this little girl right now? And best for everyone? I had said I would go to classes still, but was now the best time to start?</span></div></div>",

I did sort of agree to attending classes still after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! You can\u2019t take that\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake that what boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother beat me to the words by only a fraction of a second, making my voice sound like an echo as we cut off and drowned out Gregory. I saw my mother reach up and grab a hold of one of her earrings in preparation of bringing a weapon into existence even as I placed my right hand on the knife at my side. Gregory looked between both of us, the fear evident on his face as he began to stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2026 that little girl. I was going to say you can\u2019t take that little girl into the classroom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I am sure you are worried about her safety just as much as we are aren\u2019t you boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes ma\u2019am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. Well I trust my son I\u2019ll have you know. If he thinks it\u2019s safe enough to take the girl into the class right now then it is safe enough. After all she is just a little girl, right boy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. Yes she is nothing but a normal little girl Mrs. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll see you in a week or so Riktal darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t hold my breath on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I took the girls unresisting left hand and turned towards the classroom door I clamped my right on Gregory\u2019s shoulder, digging in with my fingers as I leaned in close to whisper in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy suggestion is you find a reason not to come to school for the next few days. I can\u2019t guarantee your safety if you were to come. There might just be a few unfortunate accidents if you catch my drift. I have no love for wagging tongues, especially when they wag over my private business and would endanger someone I am protecting. I dare you to let a word of anything you might or might not of heard today past those lips. No matter where you run or hide I will find you because I have that kind of power and reach. Keep in mind that I won\u2019t limit my tender eyes on just you. I have no problems going after your family as well. Just a bit of friendly advise you can listen to or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let go of his shoulder to open the door, my mother grabbing him by the arm and marching him away seconds later. The look of fear that had been in his eyes was now open terror written all over his face. With a thin smile I entered the lions den with my new charge coming behind me. Instantly all eyes were on me and the whispering started. The girls went all feminine in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh she is so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook at that hair! And those eyes!\u201d I just want to grab her up and squeeze her because she is so small!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she your sister?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWas that your mother? That was Marian Zelkov right? She\u2019s the reason I became a Hunter! I actually got to meet her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuiet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy single shouted word shut everybody up as I cleared my throat and looked around the room to meet everyone\u2019s eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer name is Asala. She will be joining us for the next few days because of a bunch of different reasons. I\u2019ve taken on the job of protecting her from everyone and everything. Ignore the both of us for the next few days and don\u2019t get too close. She will be gone soon enough and she doesn\u2019t need people crowding her. Need I remind you that a Hunter on a job values the contract of the job over anything else, including personal relationships. I will not hesitate to bring harm to any one of you if it is necessary to protect my client. That is all. Respect my wishes and ignore them at your peril.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I walked the girl to my desk, snagging an empty one for myself the teacher cleared his throat and got the attention of the class back on him before continuing with his lesson. This wasn\u2019t the strangest of things they would see as Hunter\u2019s. In the grand design it was actually relatively normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell finally rang ending class as the other students all eyed the two of us with interest. But they respected my wishes and kept their distance. Asala continued to sit and act like a doll, barely breathing or blinking. Simply holding on tightly to the bear. I would have liked to spend a bit of time talking to her and putting her at ease with me while trying to get her out of her shell. I knew she could hear and perhaps see what was going on around her even if she didn\u2019t react. Her lifeless shell routine might have my mother and everyone else fooled, but not anyone who actually paid a bit of attention to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t talk to her now. Everyone else didn\u2019t need to know that much about her and I wasn\u2019t about to let anything of her true nature slip. I resigned myself to sitting her down and talking with her later once we got home. I had a feeling some of the instability of her powers stemmed from her feeling her whole world was unstable. Having lost everything and having a power she didn\u2019t understand on top of that. I just had to power through this last hour and everything would be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in, taking role call after I let him know about Asala joining us for the next couple days. He simply nodded and went into his lesson on the Cawmacaw bird. Everything was going well when a red circle suddenly appeared on the floor in the middle of the aisle and a goblin pyromancer climbed out. The class froze for a moment as the two foot tall wart covered monster with grey-green skin looked around a bit dazed. The bulbous nose bobbing back and forth as it\u2019s gnarled and bent body began to lift a hand with a fireball in it. Then after that single split second the two boys and girls on either side of it pulled out their daggers or summoned swords from thin air to skewer the thing before it could throw any fire around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlmost as one all eyes seemed to be drawn to the girl. As if they all somehow knew it was her that had called the goblin forth.</span></div></div>",

Kill her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as Liz was shouting that I threw out my hand, creating a wall of wind to throw the kids that were already jumping out of chairs and leaping over desks towards us back. With one hand I grabbed up Asala, yanking her towards me without caring if I hurt her or not, bringing my other arm around to scoop her up under the legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI created a shield of magic around us as I ran straight for the broken window. Using some fancy footwork to dodge sword strikes and arrows. My shield could take about ten hits from gunfire, but that number would rapidly decrease if I took unnecessary blows from other weapons. As Liz swung at me with her dagger Jethic was suddenly in the way, deflecting her blow with the edge of his crumpled shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA wall of flames on either side of me rose up, burning the two arrows that came shooting towards me as I saw Marsa give me a nod. Making the leap from the top of a desk I sailed out the window, transferring my power from my shield to my legs so they wouldn\u2019t break on impact. Still as my feet hit I felt the shudder of enhanced muscles straining against the force. Without looking back I began to run for the front gates right ahead of me. Just as I passed through the gates I felt the piercing pain of a knife in my back on the left side. It hadn\u2019t hit any vital organs, but it still hurt like hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIgnoring the blade for the moment I ran, augmenting my speed and stamina with my rapidly dwindling magic. Most of my power going towards minimizing the damage from the knife so I wouldn\u2019t bleed out. Through town and over the river I went carrying the girl, passing untold numbers of people who stared at me in surprise even as I leaked blood all the way. Finally after about ten minutes I got to my house, unlocking the front door spell and slipping inside before activating the defense spells around the estate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnly then after sitting the girl on the couch did I pull the knife from my back, sealing the wound quickly. Even with my quick actions I felt a bit dizzy from blood loss and exerting my body as I had. Throwing a quick spell on the girl so she wouldn\u2019t feel hunger or the need to sleep I sat on the floor and closed my eyes. I knew I would pass out any moment. I\u2019d been here before so I knew the feeling. Just a short rest was all I needed to get my reserves back. The defenses would hold out any pursuers so Asala was safe for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking at the blade still in my hand I saw the poison coating it. It wasn\u2019t lethal, just a common leeching poison. No wonder my energy and strength were all sapped. And why I was already on the verge of unconsciousness from such a small attack and run through town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust a small rest was all I needed. With that the darkness took me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, that turned out a bit unexpected did it not? Was the ending of the day to your liking? Are you already asking yourself what if? Wondering if you had done something different if things would have changed? Or what if I had grabbed for a weapon instead is crossing your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhich brings me to wonder, why did you make the choices you did? Your own personal ideals? You thought that is what Riktal himself would have chosen if he had not been controlled by you? Perhaps a mixture of the two. Or perhaps you simply took the road less traveled so to speak? Going against what you wanted to do simply to see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDo you regret your choices? How do you think this day ended for Riktal? Poorly? Well? Come again and relive this day at your pleasure. Make new choices, see new things, learn new truths. Perhaps even make new friends. Until then traveler, may the doors of possibilities be opened to you.</span></div></div>",

Kill her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as Liz was shouting that I threw out a quick wall of wind to throw the boys and girls already leaping out of seats and over desks back. In that split second I reached down into my bag, pulling out the first thing that came to hand which happened to be my Lexington. With but a thought I activated phase two of the weapon and had it resting on the back of my hands. I raised my left to suck up the ball of ice hurtling my way but the attack was stopped by a swirl of fire from Marsa\u2019s staff as she jumped in front of me. Jethic, Lilia, and Daniel all appeared next to her as a wall between me and the rest of the class. Marsa looked back at me quickly and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t like summoners much either, but what you said to me earlier about Lilia applies to that girl too right? I fear what I don\u2019t understand without thinking. Perhaps it\u2019s time I change that and give it a chance eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sent out a torrent of water to break a volley of arrows even as Lilia threw out her hand, blinding everyone in front of her with a flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have a good heart. I trust you, that\u2019s all I need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that Lilia drew back her hand like she was holding a bow and arrow, releasing her fingers to shoot a shaft of pure divine power to smash into the shield bearer leading a charge and shoving desks to the side. Daniels leapt forward, punching and kicking to break up the small V-formation after the arrow of light. He stuck to mostly kicks, mindful of his still healing arms, jumping back behind the lines seconds later before anyone could attack him back. He gave me a thumbs up and a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou gave me the benefit of the doubt at lunch and you saved my life earlier. Not to mention you tried to teach me how to be a better fist fighter. I\u2019m not doing this for the girl, though I have nothing against summoners personally. I\u2019m doing this because I owe you a debt. My father always told me a man needs to repay his debts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe punched forward quickly, sending out a fist of air to knock a handful of daggers from the sky seconds before Marsa called forth tree roots from the ground to bind up the offending throwers. Jethic jumped out in front of the rest of them, hitting his wrist and making his crumpled shield come into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI owe you a debt too. I redeemer what old Markus told me about being a Hunter. He said sometimes when you don\u2019t know what\u2019s right just follow your gut instinct. And my instinct says to help you and that girl. On me you slugs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the wave pulse out from Jethic as he spread his legs. Everyone in the class had no choice but to turn and attack him. He used his nearly useless shield to great effect, blocking and dodging the attacks without a weapon. Lilia kept him healed up while the other two stayed back to protect Asala. I saw Liz jump up to the ceiling with a half flip, shoving off with her legs and hurtling right towards us like a bullet with her knife held out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI jumped and met her in mid air, taking her attack on the tube sitting on my left hand. She flipped backwards, landing on a desk while eyeing me warily, madness in her eyes. I knew she wouldn\u2019t be stupid enough to cast magic on me for my barrel to eat, but that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t shoot my own power through it if needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you protect such filth! She\u2019s a summoner! They should all be eradicated! Phase two activate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer dagger became two, glowing with an intense blue light. The blades became longer and curved. She flipped her grip, holding them both against her forearm before coming at me. I blocked her blows with my Lexington, kicking her away before shooting a few purple bullets in her direction. She sliced them from the air even as she spun out of the way of the real bullet I sent her way. We exchanged a flurry of blows, neither one of us giving an inch, blocking the others strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t do this Liz! I\u2019m better then you and you know it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever! Summoners all need to die! I was like you once! And then one of those freaks killed my little sister! That\u2019s when I learned how filthy they really are! She\u2019ll do it to you too! She will take away everything you care about! That\u2019s all they are good for! Destroying everything around them! Phase three. Thorns of Desire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two blades I had blocked on my crossed forearms began to pulse even as I shoved her forcefully away. Her body began to sprout knives from all over the place. Shoulders, fingers, elbows, knees. Some even sprouted from her chest and sides, each growing to be at least six or seven inches long to match the ones in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe charged each other at the same time me silently committed and her yelling madly. She swung at me with her right hand, the dagger in it sweeping in an arc towards my face. I stepped inside the swing, bringing my right over to grab her right below the elbow. Bringing my left arm upwards I fired a magical bullet into her joint, blowing her arm clean off. With her severed arm I backhanded her across the face, sending her staggering backwards even as I brought my left fist down, firing another magical projectile into the joint of her other arm and blowing it off as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a grunt I slammed her underneath the chin with a hard right uppercut, piercing her flesh with the barrel of my Lexington. I stared into her mad eyes as she began to choke on her own blood. I let my voice drop to a whisper so only she could hear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen. Because the last person I ever really cared about died two years ago. For your information she was a monster summoner as well and she saved my life. It\u2019s a shame, I was beginning to like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I pulled the trigger, sending a bullet up into her brain to explode on impact, sending skull fragments and brain bits everywhere. Nothing was left of the top of her head past the nose as I yanked my gun out and kicked her body to the floor. I turned to see everyone had stopped fighting to stare in shock and surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI said I would not hesitate to do anything to keep this girl safe! Did you think I wouldn\u2019t kill all you sorry ignorant idiots who blindly hate anything that\u2019s different! Stand down or I will blow the brains out of every single one of you maggots!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey all lowered their weapons and stepped back as I returned to my seat to slip my arms through my duffle bag and shrug it on my back without a word. Unhooking my Lexington I connected the barrel\u2019s together, not yet willing to take it out of phase two as I took the girls unresisting hand. When I began marching towards the door the four who had helped me became a rearguard, protecting me from attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I hit the door I saw the teacher raising his hands with fire lances in them from the corner of my eye. Without looking I raised my weapon and fired, ripping him in half before he had a chance to throw them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGod damn idiot. Sorry Lilia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe was an idiot. You warned him. But thank you for not taking His name in vain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou all know where I live. Feel free to come over anytime. I\u2019d like to thank you all properly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I think we might come over now. I have a feeling we aren\u2019t very welcome in this class right now. Perhaps not even in this school after today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou regret it Jethic?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot for a moment. I feel what I did was the right thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe other three agreed with the shield bearer as we walked down the hall on the alert for any more attacks. But none came as we left the front door and then the front gates. We didn\u2019t let our guards down though until we were all safely back at my house. And through it all the little girl remained as lifeless and unresponsive as ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, that turned out a bit unexpected did it not?

I suggest you make it so he finds a reason to not come to school for the next few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I took the little girl by the hand to lead her down the hall away from my mother I gripped his shoulder tightly, letting my fingers crush his flesh as I leaned in to whisper in his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf I have even an inkling you opened your mouth and told anyone else about the things you didn\u2019t hear, I will not hesitate to slit your throat from ear to ear. This is Hunter business and private to boot, don\u2019t forget how little tolerance we have for snitches in our midst. I have little love for the Zelkov name but I will crush you and your family with it if you dare cross me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSqueezing the girls hand lightly I let the boy go, heading off down the hall with a smile on my face as if I had said nothing to the boy at all. I saw my mother grabbing Gregory roughly by the arm and pulling him after her in the opposite direction, a look of fear written plainly on his features. She let me lead her unresistingly out the front doors and the gates onto the street. Normally I would have headed left to go into town and then home but this time I turned right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took a few minutes of walking to get to the small playground where I used to take Olia all the time. Coming here still made my heart hurt but there was something about the place that kept pulling me back from time to time. I sat her down on one of the benches before sitting next to her and throwing my arms over the back with a sigh. She simply stared unmoving off into space as I let my gaze span the little park area. We sat like that for a good three or four minutes, only the slight rise and fall of our chests showing anyone we were alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI used to have a younger sister you know. She died three years ago. Olia and I, we were really close. She was the one out of all my family that I loved the most. I practically raised her because mother and father were never around and neither was big sis most of the time. Oh we had baby-sitters and nannies, but usually they were just there to make sure we didn\u2019t kill ourselves. Just in it for the money I guess you could say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo whenever Olia was afraid of something, or she got hurt, or her favorite toy got broken, she came running to me. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many times she crawled into my bed because she had a nightmare or bawled into my chest as I stroked her hair. She was a really sweet girl too. She had this smile that seemed to make the very sun dim in comparison. The thing was, she wasn\u2019t suited to being a Hunter. Didn\u2019t have the kind of innate skills at it that me or big sis did. But my mother couldn\u2019t accept that, pushing the training onto her like she had me. In the end that\u2019s what killed her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my hand drop onto the girls head and began absently stroking her hair as I pictured Olia\u2019s face in my mind. The blond hair, the big blue eyes the ever present smile missing a tooth off to the side on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut she loved to come to this playground. We could sometimes spend hours here. I think when she came here she was able to forget all her worries, because in this park it was just me and her. Our own private little world. Why am I telling you all this you might ask? Because when she died I was in a really bad way just like you. I felt like my entire world had been ripped out from under me and I was falling into this bottomless black pit of despair and grief. As if part of my very soul had just been taken from me and lost forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet that\u2019s kind of how you are feeling right now isn\u2019t it? Lost and alone in the word with no one and nothing familiar left to you except maybe that bear. Nothing to call your own and no place to call your home anymore. I don\u2019t blame you for running away into your head. But you know, even big strong men like me needed to cry when my sister died. You should have seen the snot coming out of my nose and how red my eyes got. But I was all alone in my grief. My parents and sister were all off doing jobs as if nothing had happened and I was left in the cold empty house all by myself just like I always am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo if even a person like me needed to cry and let it all out then I know a little girl like you needs to do the same. It doesn\u2019t make them come back to life and it doesn\u2019t change any of the facts, but a good long cry can still make you feel better. And right now you, unlike me, are not alone. I\u2019m right here for you. You can let it all out and I will hold you and comfort you and not tell anyone a single word about it if you don\u2019t want me to. We are in the private little world where only me and my sister existed. Where we could let go of all the other worries in the world that we had. Let go of all the fears in our minds and simply be free.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stopped talking then, feeling I had said what I needed to, simply continuing to stroke her hair as I watched the empty park ahead of us. It started as a small sniffle and then she was clutching my shirt as I pulled her into my chest while she went into a full blown crying spree. I made soft sounds like I had when Olia used to cry like this, rocking her back and forth while petting her hair. She cried until she began to hiccup out her wails. Cried until she began to cough and choke. Finally she stopped, but didn\u2019t pull away as I continued to rock her gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt will hurt for a long time sweetie. For many, many years to come. You will look back and say to yourself you should have told them this or you shouldn\u2019t have acted like that. Wishing to change the past and knowing you will never see them again. Sometimes it\u2019s going to be hard to get through the days. Each breath will seem like a struggle. But you need to remember the good things about the time you spent with them instead of focusing on only how they died or the bad moments. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to get you through this right now. Later on you can remember those bad moments and not feel such sorrow. Because all those moments both good and bad are now precious memories you have to hold onto. It\u2019s proof that they lived and you loved them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou feel warm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was soft and hesitant. Almost a whisper of sound that had a light musical quality to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aren\u2019t afraid of my power?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot in the slightest. I don\u2019t see a monster summoner here right now, I see a little girl grieving for her parents that just got her snot all over my uniform. No matter what you summon I will protect you from it. And I am in the minority of Hunters who see those with special powers as people, not cursed in any way. I\u2019m sure you had a tough time of it while my mother took care of you because she and most of the aides she hires barely tolerate summoners to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head up and down as the arms she had wrapped around me tightened and she let out a sigh of contentment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah they were really scary. They felt cold. Not like you. Telling me to move on and pulling me around. When they tried to be nice it felt fake. Like they didn\u2019t really care. They were always up in my face and monsters came out of nowhere. So I just ran deeper into my head than I was before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you couldn\u2019t run away completely could you? You had to have enough recognition of the outside world so as not to lose your teddy bear. But other than that you just didn\u2019t care.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh-huh. His name is Mr. Cuddles and mommy and daddy gave him to me for my birthday when I was six. He\u2019s been with me ever since.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how old are you now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEleven. I\u2019ll turn twelve next month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then Asala who is eleven and will turn twelve next month. How about me and you go into town and have ourselves a bit of a pre-birthday party? Since I won\u2019t be able to go with you when my mothers acquaintance comes to pick you up, I won\u2019t be able to celebrate your birthday with you on the proper day either. I must warn you, I plan on showering you with a bunch of presents of clothes and jewelry and anything else I feel like. And we are going to go eat and have a birthday cake and everything. Of course we have to buy you new underwear and you have to wear them because no twelve year old I know is allowed to wear diapers. Think you could handle all of that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hugged my tightly again as she snuggled her head against my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as you are there. You\u2019ll stay with me the whole time won\u2019t you? You won\u2019t leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever. My job is to guard you twenty four hours a day, eight days a week. I\u2019m going to stick to you like a piece of old food between your teeth until you leave. You are going to get so disgusted with me being around all the time you will be glad to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled a bit at my words before saying she would never get tired of me. The clock rang out that it was three o\u2019clock as I grabbed her around the waist and stood up. I swung her frail little frame back and forth a few time before setting her down. A small part of my mind noting that she couldn\u2019t weigh more than a hundred pounds if that.</span></div></div>",

Unless you like that ugly looking dress that makes my eyes want to bleed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother giggle at my raised eyebrow and the look of horror on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I think your momma picked it out for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that explains the fashion sense. Well then let\u2019s go find something more fitting for you. I warn you I won\u2018t let you get away without buying three, no wait four new sets of clothes! Oh and a new pair of shoes of course. And they better be slightly expensive. You better not get the plainest, cheapest thing because you think I\u2018m not willing to spend money on you. You understand me missy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me as I bent to pick up my bag of weapons. As I offered her my hand a red circle appeared in front of us. I saw a skinny three fingered insect like hand reach out and grab a hold of the edge seconds before another one come into view. Asala began to whimper even as I pulled out a sword, dropping my bag again before stalking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s just an E class, no need to be afraid. Nothing I can\u2019t handle blindfolded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I raised my sword in preparation to shove it down into the pit before the beast could emerge Asala cried out for me to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t hurt it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tImmediately I held off my thrust, instead stomping down on one pair of fingers making it let go before shoving my foot through the hole to boot the monster in the head. As it fell back into the pit I took my foot away seconds before the hole closed. Putting my weapon away I slid my arms through the straps and walked off hand in hand with the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you want me to kill it? You aren\u2019t one of those CAMPers are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCamper?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s an acronym. It stands for Citizens Advocating Monster Protection. Basically they are a group of people who think monsters should be protected because they are no different from animals. That they only do the things they do because it is their nature and we shouldn\u2019t kill them for the way god made them. Personally I think they are nut jobs. I\u2019d like to see them keep up their do no harm to monsters mentality when one of them is rampaging around destroying their house or has them in it\u2019s claws and is about to eat them. Now CETA I can get behind to an extent since there really are a lot of non aggressive animals out there and animal abuse isn\u2019t really something I go for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I\u2019m not a CAMPer. It\u2019s just, why does it have to die for something I can\u2019t control? It didn\u2019t hurt anybody and it didn\u2019t ask to be summoned just like I didn\u2019t ask for this power. If it had gotten out and started hurting people that\u2019s a different story, but it was still helpless and hadn\u2019t done any harm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it was only a Ski\u2019ter. If it had gotten loose it would have only been an annoyance anyway, eating dead things on the side of the road and rooting through garbage. It\u2019s a scavenger but it rarely attacks humans unless cornered. If it had gotten loose there was a fifty-fifty chance a Hunter would have captured it and released it into the wild anyway. So returning it before it got summoned is no big deal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut aren\u2019t Hunter\u2019s supposed to kill all monsters? That\u2019s what my momma said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice choked for a moment when she mentioned her mother and I pulled her in close, wrapping my arm around her shoulder to hug her against my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSome Hunter\u2019s do live by that philosophy. Because there are a lot of dangerous monsters out there and even the ones that aren\u2019t dangerous are still monsters in their eyes. But there are just as many if not more Hunter\u2019s that believe in only killing the monster if it becomes a danger to humans. Yes something like a troll might be big mean and scary, and dangerous to humans to boot. But if it stays to it\u2019s caves in the mountains and doesn\u2019t come down to terrorize the citizens, why should we go out of our way to kill it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBesides monster slaying is dangerous for us Hunter\u2019s as well. Not all monsters are easy E class like that Ski\u2019ter. I\u2019m an A class Hunter but even I can have trouble with a B class or even if I get into a fight with a few C class at once depending on what they are. And if I were to go up against another A class level monster there is a good chance I\u2019m coming out missing a body part or two if I am not really careful. That\u2019s why we Hunter\u2019s have such a high mortality rate. For every Hunter living right now, at least three others have died. There are a little over two hundred kids in my school, but within the first five years of them graduating at least a third of them will be dead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why do you all become Hunter\u2019s if you know you\u2019re probably going to die?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause our desire to protect the people is greater then our fear of death. Some do it for glory and money, but still at the core we want to make the lives of the citizens peaceful. Protect innocent people like you so you can grow up without worrying about having to live in hiding. Able to enjoy the civilization we humans have built.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not going to die too are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne day I eventually will. But I don\u2019t plan on dying for a long time. I guess every Hunter thinks that, but I am a tenth generation Zelkov. I\u2019ve been trained from the day I took my first breath to be a Hunter. It\u2019s programmed into ever fiber of my being. I\u2019m not that easy to kill. I suppose I\u2019m lucky. As much a I hate my parents, I at least still have them. They are pushing forty you know. That\u2019s old for a Hunter. Most don\u2019t live past thirty-five. There is a reason you don\u2019t see a lot of active old Hunter\u2019s around. Age slows us down. We can use our magic to help with that, but there is only so much we can do to slow the onset of time on our bodies. That\u2019s why we marry young and have children early, because there is no guarantee we will be alive later to carry on our family lines.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was quiet as we finished our walk into town and I took her to a reasonably priced clothing store I knew of.  At first she seemed unsure and then I reminder her of what I had said earlier. That seemed to be all the incentive she needed, trying on dresses and chatting away happily. I simply let her go to town, let her forget about her grief for just a little bit. She did tell me to turn around when she went to pick out some new undergarments, blushing a bit as she did so. I grinned but complied, hiding my eyes with my fingers but peeking out through cracked lids to watch her in the mirror anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the clock bells announced it was six o\u2019clock we finally finished our shopping with Asala in a much better mood. She had slipped into the bathroom of the store and come out wearing a light red dress that complimented her eyes and some ruby shoes that matched, giving me a small twirl of exhibition. She had bought one pair of shirt and pants but she said she liked dresses more. I whistled appreciatively before we left the store and headed deeper into town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs it ok if I call you big brother Riktal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind that squirt. If it makes you feel more comfortable then by all means. Besides, it kind of feels like I have a little sister again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned as I ruffled her hair with my one free hand. After a moment she said she wanted to carry some of the bags too, so I gave her the two lightest out of the four bags, which made her grin even more. After a few moments of silence she began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBig brother, am I a bad girl for being happy right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo you\u2019re not sweetie. It\u2019s ok to feel happy when you\u2019re happy, and sad when you are sad. Just because you are sad over your parents doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t allowed to feel anything else. Life will go on no matter what you are feeling, that means you have to go on along with it. I know you are still going to cry over them again and again, and you are still going to feel empty inside over their loss. But you can\u2019t be sad all the time just like you can\u2019t be happy all the time. Life is all about ups and downs, being able to appreciate those moments and seize them when they happen is part of living life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen it\u2019s ok to keep having fun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes it\u2019s perfectly all right to keep having fun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned again as if some burden had been lifted from her shoulder before hugging me around the waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t know how to answer her. I knew I needed to keep a bit of distance between us so that it would be easier to part ways in a few days. I couldn\u2019t go with her and she couldn\u2019t stay. As I stroked her hair I simply kept quiet, that seemed the best course of action to take. After a moment she let go and we continued walking.</span></div></div>",

We were wondering when you were going to be coming back!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s up Patricia. How\u2019s your husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMuch better. It was just a small cold that had lingered a little longer than normal. That apothecary you suggested worked wonders.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad to hear it. Can I get a birthday special? Twelve candles mind you and the works of sides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe middle aged woman looked at the girl and grinned, giving her a wink before telling me it would be a few minutes. She led us to a booth by the window that gave me a good view of the room. There were only a few other customers even though this was still technically dinner service. It was one of the reasons I liked Milly\u2019s, they were almost never crowded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t come with me when I leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, that\u2019s just not going to be possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I\u2019ll make sure to learn everything I have to and become strong that way I can come back here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why would you want to come back for me? Once you get to your new place and settled in I\u2019ll become just another happy memory. You will be there for a few years and make new friends and have a new life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I love you and I decided that I\u2019m going to marry you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh really? That\u2019s a bit of a tall statement. What are you going to do if you get to your new place and find a boy you like and he likes you? A lot can happen in a few years you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNuh-uh. I decided it\u2019s going to be you and only you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could respond four waitresses came out carrying a small round chocolate cake with twelve candles along with bowls of ice cream and trays filled with chips, dips, and assorted finger snacks like pretzels. As they set them all out on the table Joey, the big rotund cook came out and began to sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d in an operatic voice. He made all eyes turn towards us as Asala hid her face in embarrassment. Finally she blew out the candles and everyone in the place clapped and congratulated her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the workers dispersed I made her cut the first piece as the birthday girl should and heaped her plate with all the snacks around before we began to eat. She had a bit of a glow about her, all traces of her sorrow gone for the moment as she ate happily. As I took a bite of ice cream I pointed my fork at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo let\u2019s just suppose you don\u2019t fall for anyone else and you come back to find me in say four or five years. What will you do if I\u2019m already married? I\u2018m seventeen after all, I really do have to start thinking about such things even if I don\u2018t like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up into the sky deep in thought for a moment before giving me a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll let you keep her as a mistress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nearly choked on my ice cream as I kept from laughing, the grin on my face refusing to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd if I refused? What if I didn\u2019t want to divorce her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I\u2019d be ok with being the mistress. As long as you spent more time with me than with her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time I let the chuckle escape from my lips as I shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re too much you know that? I\u2019m afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with you if we got married. So I\u2019ll quietly step back and let some other poor soul take my place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. I won\u2019t allow you. I choose you and I\u2019m not going to change my mind. Oh and you will have to change your name to Heinfield because I won\u2019t change mine to Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to laugh again, simply shaking my head as I ate another potato chip. So was this what Asala had been like before her parents had died? Or was this just another coping mechanism. I knew part of it was because I had reached out to her in her time of need. She had latched onto me like a drowning man clutches a life preserver. She found comfort and safety around me, but anyone could have made her feel the same way if they had really tried. I just happened to be the one to do it. Perhaps I had gone a bit overboard in making her feel safe, but feeling like a big brother again had made me want to go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finished the little party while making a few jokes and her telling me how she wanted to be a wood worker when she grew up because that\u2019s what her father had been. We left the diner and headed home, with Asala telling me bits and pieces of what her life had been like before as I asked leading questions. It was more of the process of grieving as I made her remember the good times over the bad ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce home I quickly showed her around the house before scooting her off to take a bath with a reminder to brush her teeth. While she was in the bathroom I pulled out the old shoebox from my closet, slipping out the pile of photos and looking through them. They were all of Olia spread out across her baby pictures up until two weeks before she died. Showing all the different phases she had gone through, with pigtails, and curls, and even coloring her hair. Funny faces, happy faces, sad faces, each one captured a fragment of her. I wiped at my eyes when a drop of water hit the picture that looked like she was going to reach through the camera any second to grab you around the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe was pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes she was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked up to see Asala standing in front of me with her pajamas on and carrying her teddy bear in her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDoes it really get better? Will it stop hurting so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt really does. It never completely goes away though. Sometimes some small thing sets you off remembering and you feel their loss all over again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least you have pictures to remember her by. I\u2019m afraid I will forget what they look like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled her in as she began to cry again, letting her work the tears out of her system. Her bout didn\u2019t last long this time  before she pulled away sniffing and rubbing her eyes. Setting the photos to the side I pulled back the covers of the bed, telling her to hop in. as I tucked her and the bear in she grabbed my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou're not going to leave are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I was going to be right next to you? I\u2019m going to get myself a bath of my own and then I will be right back in here. I\u2019ll make myself a little bed on the floor in case you need me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you sleep with me? I don\u2019t want to be alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure if that\u2019s what you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let me go, watching me silently as I grabbed a fresh set of clothes and headed out the door. I didn\u2019t have any fear of someone getting to her in this house. There were so many protection spells and artifacts on and around the place it was like a fortress. Still I finished quickly, just in case another monster got summoned or she needed me. She was still staring at the door when I came back in, as if she had been afraid to blink in case that kept me from coming back. I saw a shadow of fear she had been holding in disappear at the sight of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBig brother, why don\u2019t you hate me or my powers?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you want me to hate you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen isn\u2019t that enough? I\u2019ve got my reasons, but they aren\u2019t that important. The fact is I don\u2019t hate you so that\u2019s good enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I draped the towel I had been using to dry my hair over the back of the chair my fingers stilled. Wasn\u2019t that one of the very reasons I hated my mother so much? She was always saying she had reasons but never saying what those reasons were? Always putting me off whenever I asked? Going over to the bed I looked down at the girl a moment as she stared back at me with those big trusting eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I see Mr. Cuddles for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod she handed me the bear, only a hint of reluctance at letting it go. I coated it in my purple magic, imagining what it was I wanted to do and then made the unique twist of the mind to activate my ability. I continued to concentrate even as I felt a bit of blood coming down my nose until I was done and the bears black eyes were as crimson as the girls. With a sigh I handed it back to her while wiping my nosebleed. Pulling back the covers I slid into bed next to her with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wanted to know why I don\u2019t hate you or your powers. Well that is one of the reasons. It\u2019s because I\u2019m just like you. Well not exactly of course since I can\u2019t summon monsters. But I have a special power others might call cursed. It\u2019s a bit complicated to explain and I won\u2019t go into the details but basically I imprinted your parents onto that bear. Now whenever you go to sleep thinking about them with that bear in your hands you will see them like they are still alive. They will talk and act just like you remember them. The more information I get the more I can add to the bear to increase the things they say or their movements or the thousands of other little things that made them your parents. Now get some sleep, your parents are waiting for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leaned forward and kissed her forehead as she blinked at me, her mouth opening in a round O of surprise. Clutching the bear tighter she snuggled closer to me while closing her eyes, a smile almost wrapping around her head. Sending out a bit of magic I flicked off the overhead light before draping my arm over her small body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you big brother. This is the best present of them all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day. Even if it is the same day over and over it is still another day. How do you feel about your choices? Do you wonder what other paths might have been taken? If so then come again and play god. Pursue different choices as you relive this day. See just how different the day could be depending on all the important and unimportant choices not only you but everyone else makes in the course of a single day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWe need to go eat out first. After all in a real birthday party you always get your presents after the cake. You like that idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to pick up my bag when a red circle appeared on the ground in front of us. Even as Asala began to whimper a little bit I noted the small form shooting into the air so didn\u2019t even bother grabbing a weapon. The circle closed up only seconds after opening, leaving Asala clutching at my leg in terror. With a gentle hand on her head I reached into my pouch and pulled out some of my ration bread. Breaking off a small bit and using magic to moisten it I told her to hold out her hand. When she did so I dropped the crumbs and fruits into it, holding her wrist so she wouldn\u2019t jerk it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKeep very still for right now ok? I\u2019m right here so nothing is going to go wrong. I want you to meet the monster you just summoned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhistling a quick tune before clucking my tongue like I was calling a dog I waited. We didn\u2019t wait long before what looked like a green mini dragon came swooping down towards us, hovering for a moment as it eyed both us and the offering before alighting on her hand and beginning to eat. It\u2019s tiny hind claws gripped her flesh gently as his front ones picked up the fruit and ate it daintily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is a Dagal. Some call them midget dragons or mini dragons because that\u2019s what they look like. They can get aggressive just like any monster, but they are normally quite tame and peaceful as you can see. They eat just about anything but they prefer fruits. Well except for apples, those mess with their systems. Do you want to tame him? Make him your first monster tame?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was such awe and wonderment in her eyes and voice as she spoke in a bare whisper. As if she would frighten it away. I grinned as I told her to scratch it under the chin, an act she did with slight hesitation. The Dagal cooed in pleasure while flapping its wings before picking up the last slice of apricot and flying into the air. It circled quickly before landing on her shoulder, giving her face a nuzzle and going back to eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey only need about half their body weight twice a day. They are smart so they won\u2019t glutton themselves if they are full. You\u2019ll learn how to communicate with him, or perhaps it\u2019s a her, in time. Only the red ones like hot water so keep your friend away from such things. They don\u2019t mind hot weather or hot steam, just not direct contact with hot water. There are five main colors of Dagal, each with their own specialty of magic that they know and can learn. Since your\u2019s is green it will focus on earth skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf your friend there has an aversion to a person, drink or food trust it\u2019s instincts over your own because they have a good sixth sense and incredible sense of smell. Those two things allow them to detect just about any kind of poison known to man and let you know if a person is trustworthy or not. You might want to think of a name for it as well, unless you just want to call it Dagal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do I know if it is  boy or a girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsk it to fly to either me or you to tell us if it is male or female. I told you they are smart and they can understand human tongue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala asked the creature, probably feeling a bit foolish for doing so. But the creature flapped it\u2019s wings and circled a few times before landing back on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell now you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I am going to name her Etoile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy that name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I remember my mother used to call me that. She would say I was her little etoile.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you even know what it means?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. but I thought it sounded pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt means star. As in a dazzling light to brighten the darkness. I think it\u2019s a good name for your new friend. Now come on, lets go show her off to the world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged my arms into the bag, wearing it like a backpack before taking her hand and heading off towards town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t people know I\u2019m a monster summoner if they see her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNah, anyone can tame a Dagal if they want, it\u2019s just incredibly hard to either find them or get them to come to you if you don\u2019t know how to deal with them. I\u2019ve seen a few Hunter\u2019s and even a few regular people with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh. I thought all monsters were bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost of them are. But like with everything, you get good things mixed with the bad as well. Some Hunter\u2019s think they need to kill every monster simply because it\u2019s a monster, but most of us have an unspoken rule that we kill only the ones that threaten humanity. Even if it\u2019s a big nasty creature like a troll or a giant. If the troll or giant or whatever stays in it\u2019s part of the wilds and doesn\u2019t harm humans why go out of the way to find and kill it? This job is dangerous for us Hunter\u2019s too you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why do you do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo people like you can live safe and free. Able to enjoy life and all the things we have managed to create in this civilization of ours. people go to sleep easy at night knowing no monster is lurking right outside their door. Or not afraid they have to run and hide in a cave because something big mean and scary comes crashing through town. That\u2019s because the people know we Hunter\u2019s are protecting them from all of that. That\u2019s why we do it, for the people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen I learn to control my powers will I be able to help people like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you will be able to. And I\u2019m sure you will be amazing at it if that is what you want to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we passed the movie theater she pointed up at it excitedly. When I looked I saw the highlighted title film called Freedom Pony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want to see that one! The first one was about this horse that got captured in the wild but refused to be broken. Then when she finally got free she came back to captivity and allowed herself to be tamed because she bonded with a little boy. The second one was bout her fowl growing up in captivity wanting to be free and finally got his wish at the very end. That\u2019s the third in the series!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhoa there! Hold your horses! I have no clue what you are talking about. Last time I went to see a movie was about six months ago and that was because I was bored and not because I was really interested. So tell you what, we can come see it tomorrow if you want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes really. But first we need to have your birthday party and your present opening. So come on scoot yourself onward! You got a cake to cut missy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe began to hum happily and the Dagal on her shoulder stretched out her neck to croon along as well. I grinned to myself as we rounded the corner and entered one of the many diners I frequented to be greeted with hearty hello\u2019s and  few exclamations of surprise at the tamed monster on her shoulder. The creature seemed to preen under the attention, eliciting laughs from both me and the little girl. Watching Asala I felt like a big brother again. For the first time I felt like I wasn\u2019t alone in the world and had a real family.</span></div></div>",

How\u2019d you know I was afraid of them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA lucky guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, um Riktal, can I call you big brother? Because you feel and act kind of like daddy but not as old.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess I should be grateful for that. I don\u2019t know if I want to be seen or felt as old for a while yet. But if you want you can. Because being with you makes me feel like I\u2019m a big brother again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe suddenly stopped walking to wrap her arms around my waist, burying her head in my stomach. Etoile gave a small squawk of indignation as she balanced herself on Asala\u2019s shoulder. I could see a few eyes from random passerby\u2019s turning and smiling at us but I ignored them as unimportant. Gently I stroked her hair as I let a small smile creep onto my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you too little one. Now on to the next place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned at the high pitched squeal to find two of the girls from my class standing there watching us. I knew them by face if not by name, wishing I was better with people my own age so I could get them to go away nicely. I really didn\u2019t want to deal with this right now. Asala clung to me as the two girls came closer, a slight tremor showing she was still a little afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought you looked pretty mean at school but you\u2019re really a big softie aren\u2019t you! She\u2019s so cute! Is she your little sister? And look she has a Dagal for a pet! Ohhh I want one too! They look so adorable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m on a job now ladies. Her name is Asala and you will meet her formally tomorrow since she will be wherever I go. But for now could you please go away? This is a special private time for just me and her. She\u2019s unused to this area and scared of people, you are not helping her right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen wouldn\u2019t being around more people help her get over her fear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know what? Let me make it more plain since my attempt at being nice failed. Go away. This is not a request, it is an order. I am not a big softie like you think I am. I will not hesitate to hurt you to get you to leave. Your presence is not required nor wanted here. Is that plain enough for even simpletons like you to understand? Come on Asala, time to go shopping.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took her hand, crossing the street and leaving the two girls to stare after us in shock. Rubbing my eyes under my glasses I let out a sigh as they faded from sight. What was it about people around my age that made them so stupid? Girls seemed to be especially prone to these bouts of intense stupidity when babies, animals or cute things were involved. It was like all their common sense just shot out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust so you know Asala, if you ever grow up to be like those girls in five or six years, I\u2019m not going to admit to knowing you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey were just trying to be nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh Asala, I envy you your innocence. If they were regular people that might be the case. Vapid, sappy and stupid perhaps, but still with only good intentions. But that\u2019s not the way the world of Hunter\u2019s works. There is always hidden agenda\u2019s behind everything. Who you become friends with is more important than actually having friends. Because who you know can make or break you as a Hunter. They were going all sappy over you but they were also doing it in the hopes of spending time with us, or more specifically me. Thinking I will fall for one of them, meaning their status would shoot sky high because they were dating a Zelkov. It\u2019s a bunch of politics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf that\u2019s the case I don\u2019t allow you to go out with any of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on it shrimp. But why so vehement about it all of a sudden?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you\u2019re going to marry me when I get older!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh and just who decided this now? And when?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did just now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell isn\u2019t that against the rules? I mean if I\u2019m your big brother and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe aren\u2019t blood related so it\u2019s fine. Besides you are only like a big brother, not my real big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re too quick for me, I just can\u2019t keep up. But we shall see if you still feel that way in four or five years once you get done with your training. That is four or five years you will be away from me mind you. And time where you will make new friends and meet new boys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. I decided and no one is changing my mind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re a brat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned up at me with a smile that lit up her entire face as I ruffled her hair and continued walking. Soon enough we came to the clothing store and I told her to go to town. She was  bit hesitant at first, picking out a plain white dress from the half off rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that really something you want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think it is. Excuse me Sales lady! Can you show us some of your nicest dresses in a red color? Something to match her eyes. Oh and shoes to match as well. If they are on sale that\u2019s fine but if not I\u2019ve got no problems. Money is not a question, just don\u2019t try to rip me off too badly ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course sir Hunter. If you and the young lady would follow me I\u2019ll show you some things you might like.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that it didn\u2019t take long for Asala to get into the shopping mood I had found almost all girls seemed to love. She tried on dress after dress as I commented on each and made appreciative sounds. She made me turn round though when she bought new underwear, but I watched her in the mirror anyway. After a few hours of shopping we left the store with four bags loaded with stuff. The sales lady had also gotten a nice tip from me for her services, a fact that seemed to make her extra happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe clock was striking eight and Asala was yawning by the time we got back to the house. I wasted no time in shooing her up to take a bath and get ready for bed even as I followed a moment later to get the room ready. As the water began to run in the bathroom I stripped off my clothes, throwing on some fresh ones before hanging my school uniform up. I could take a bath tomorrow, right now it would be best to spend as much time with the girl as possible to further cement that bond of trust between us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt would be hard to see her leave in a few days, but tomorrow I would need to start gently creating a bit of distance to make that easier on the both of us. I hadn\u2019t meant to get so close to begin with, but feeling like a big brother again had made spoiling her so much easier. In the end she was just a job. When she left I needed to simply fade away as a happy memory for her so she could get on with her life instead of chasing after a dream and getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBrother, is it wrong that I\u2019m happy right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning towards the door I saw Etoile rubbing against Asala\u2019s face as the girl hugged her teddy bear tightly. Sitting on the bed I patted the covers next to me with a grin. She hurried over and sat down, snuggling into the crook of my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you not want to be happy right now? It\u2019s fine to be happy if your happy and sad when you are sad. That\u2019s just how life is. You can\u2019t be sad all the time or happy all the time or angry or scared. If you aren\u2019t happy isn\u2019t that like you are saying you had wished this day had never happened? Or that it was all pointless? It doesn\u2019t mean your parents should have died or makes your feelings for them any less real because you enjoyed yourself today. It simply means you are able to appreciate the good things that have happened to you. Not every day is going to be like this one. Just like not every day is going to be as bad as the day your parents died. You understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head against me as she clutched me tightly her voice dropping down a notch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI miss them. Am I going to forget them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo sweetie. You will never forget them. It will get easier with time, but as long as you live you will remember them. Here give me your bear for a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe handed me her bear slowly, as if afraid to let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour parents gave this to you didn\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a nod I coated it in my magic, using my special ability to imprint her parents into the bear. I could feel the blood running down my nose by the time I was finished but ignored it. Once done I handed it back to her while wiping the liquid from my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo to sleep thinking of your parents while holding that bear and you will see them. I\u2019ll explain it all to you tomorrow. Just know that it is a special magic similar to your summoning ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe climbed under the covers while the Dagal settled herself on the headrest. After turning out the lights I slipped in beside her, pulling her in close a she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo touching me inappropriately until we are married.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a grin I kissed her on the forehead while she chuckled at her joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGoodnight shrimp.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur tale draws to a close yet again. Or perhaps this is the first time for you? You have been here so many times in so many possibilities it is hard for even I to keep track of them all. Again and again you relive this day over and over. Each time making new choices, walking different paths. Tell me? Have you found the answers you are looking for? Have you gained insight into who you are and the way you view the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn my part I have learned much while watching you. Many of my personal questions have been answered, yet still more arise to the surface. Is this the nature of you humans? Constantly in a spiral of wanting to know more and seeking the answers to those questions you have? If so then this is an intriguing turn of events. Perhaps next time I shall delve into the concepts behind these emotion things you have. Adios traveler, until you come again to relive this day.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With my quick temper and my lack of any real social skills when it came to kids my own age, volunteering was just asking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll go. It gets me out of doing nothing. Besides if the creep wakes up I can sock him in the face hard enough to put him back under. That will be for my own personal desires though, not for his betterment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master nodded at Liz as she headed out the door with the still unconscious Gregory slung over her shoulder like a sack of flour and the other four close behind. The teacher got everyone regrouped and reorganized, sending two more groups out onto the field to continue practicing after giving them a small heads up on what they were going to face and how to handle it. I stood next to him, watching as the battles began and he manipulated his magical box, recording data and other statistics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for assisting back there. I was a bit far away to react in time. I took my eyes off them for only a moment to answer a question. I even warned them what they would fight and what not to do. I thought they were all ready for something easy like that. I guess I was wrong.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot your fault. They would have been fine if you hadn\u2019t paired them with Gregory. But you know what they say, there\u2019s no cure for stupid. You can teach those who lack knowledge, and enlighten those who are misinformed. But being stupid like that is a choice. You can\u2019t cure it if they don\u2019t want to be cured.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnfortunately that\u2019s true. He\u2019s not the first one like that I\u2019ve seen come through here. Nor is he the first Hunter I\u2019ve fought beside like that. It\u2019s my job to train it out of them if I can, but some just don\u2019t want to learn. Just between you and me, I give him another year, maybe two tops before he winds up getting himself or one of his comrades killed. I really don\u2019t see him graduating though. By the way, is it true what your file says? You passed the mock Exams as an A class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true. And got about half the points I would have needed to hit S class. Though I never really thought I would get it anyway. Only one in fifty ever make S class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill that\u2019s some feat. I capped out at the low end of the A spectrum before I began working here. Worked with your dad years ago, he saved my life back then. I\u2019m actually honored to have his son in my class. Though don\u2019t think that will get you any special privileges.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNever crossed my mind. You are the Arena Master. You have to be impartial and strict because you are the one who decides if the students are ready or not. If you play favorites that could end up with one or hundreds dying. Your job isn\u2019t to send them out to die, but to send them out to survive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad you understand. Think you could lend a hand in the Arena as a deputy instructor of sorts from time to time? Mostly just combat demonstration and the like but if something like this happens again I\u2019d like another set of eyes and hands if possible. I\u2019ve asked Hawthrop but she declined. I\u2019m actually supposed to have a real one but  because of funding cuts no one seems to want the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Hunter\u2019s helping each other out from time to time is part of the code after all. It will keep me in shape as well. Only so much sparring I can do alone at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad to hear it. Think you could stick around for next period? I\u2019ve got a group of seniors coming in and I plan on pitting them against some A class mobs. With another A class Hunter here I can split them into two groups at once instead of one group at a time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two groups on the field killed their  monster and switched out for the next two groups. I waited until the teacher was done fiddling with his black box and adjusting whatever it was he was doing before continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomehow I feel like I just got suckered into something here but I don\u2019t mind. Next class is History and I really won\u2019t learn anything new there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah from what\u2019s in your file you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m actually a bit surprised you are even in this academy. I would have thought with your record you would have taken the real Exams by now and got your license. Why are you here anyway if you don\u2019t mind my asking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll let your History teacher know where you are. Who is it? Mr. Ghetz or Holiday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGhetz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll send him a quick text after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI walked away, taking a seat on the empty benches against the wall as I continued to watch what was going on. Making a mental skill chart for each person in the class. Such things were just near automatic for me anymore. After about three or four more minutes as the two groups finally killed their monster, Liz and the others came back without Gregory. They told the Arena Master the nurses verdicts to bench them all for a day or two as Liz came to sit next to me. The teacher nodded his head a moment before the four sat on benches nearby as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnfortunately the little bugger didn\u2019t wake up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell from his perspective it seems fortunate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe sat in silence for a bit watching the groups, the two of us having our own little bubble space no one wanted to intrude upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe teacher asked me to be a sub instructor. Said he asked you but you declined.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, seemed like too much hassle at the time. I didn\u2019t want to be here at this school to begin with so I felt no need to play nice so to speak. Now I\u2019m regretting not taking him up on the offer. I see I\u2019ve gotten more than a bit lax after watching you. I need to get back into shape and catch up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWant me to let him know you\u2019re willing to sub in for me sometimes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould he go for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t see why not. If most of the time it is just a knowledgeable partner to showcase combat moves, you would do as well as I. Plus it gives him a wider array of options and experiences to chose from.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if he\u2019s agreeable then I\u2019ll do it. I\u2019ve got a feeling school will be a lot more interesting with you around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBe careful what you wish for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang then, and everyone headed off back to the locker rooms. I threw my Lexington back in the bag. If there were going to be A class monsters I wanted something with a bit more oomph. My gun was nice and all but it wasn\u2019t the best for A class beasts. My Roller Knuckles would do the job, but  I would prefer something that had both short range and long range utility. Only the third phase of my fist weapons would apply there. Reaching inside I pulled out a sword handle with a large green stone inset into the pommel with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the other boys began to file out I quickly sent a jolt of magic into the stone, activating the artifact which grew from the end until it was a six foot long double sided barbarian blade I slung on my back and kept there with a touch of magic. It had been a while since I had used this sword I had affectionately named The Eviscerater. It was nothing like the ten foot long version my father swung around, but it got the job done. Locking up my other weapons I strode out the door to wait in the Arena just as the first few seniors came walking in. They gave me a few sideways looks but otherwise ignored me. That was fine, I\u2019d see what they were made of soon enough.</span></div></div>",

Don\u2019t be afraid of grabbing agro from the thing! That\u2019s what the tank is there for! To keep it\u2019s eyes off you while you push out the pain! Dual swords! Where the hell are you looking? As a melee you need to be aware of your surroundings! Otherwise you might get in the way of someone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw up my right hand, placing the palm against the flat of the blade while bracing my leg to catch the swipe of one of the Spidlar\u2019s six claws. Even digging in it still pushed me back, sending dust flying from my heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSonic Shock!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tank raised his shield and smashed it into the ground, sending out a wave against the monster that looked like a giant black widow spider had attached itself to the back of a seven foot grey troll. It\u2019s rear abdomen twitched as it rocked backwards to squirt acidic web at us. The tank\u2019s shockwave hit the attack in mid flight, sending it back at the creature seconds before the wave hit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMagma Eruption!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe caster\u2019s spell brought a mini volcano into existence that shot out flaming balls of magma as if they were launched from a mortar. The four shells fell from the sky even as the beast created a shield with his webs and held it over his head. The dual sword wielder took that opportunity to jump forward with both swords crossed in front of him in preparation for a double cross slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMana!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlready the female gunner was throwing out a lasso of magic to grab the guy in mid air, yanking him back seconds before the beast would have impaled him on a sword of acidic webbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDamnit what did I say! Fall back and cool your head! Gorin! Get in here!  You too Sally! Take over for the tank! Caster and gunner! Lay down suppressing fire!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the boy with the two swords ran off the field a boy that looked like a linebacker for a football team came running in, a crossbow attached to the back of his left arm. He had a loader attached to the inner area of his right arm filled with small rocks. As he placed his right hand over his left a rock dropped in, turning into an arrow even as he cocked back the string and sent it flying. Arrow after arrow he sent in rapid succession at the monster, hitting the web shield a few times before he snapped his fingers causing the tips to explode, shattering the shield. The caster and gunner then began attacking in earnest now that the shield was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe new tank Sally flung her buckler at the beast smacking it in the head before it returned to her like a boomerang. The beast turned it\u2019s attention on her even as she flicked her sword, turning it into a whip and sending the tip towards the Spidlar. The tip impaled itself in the creatures chest as the girl jumped and retracted the extended sword, flinging towards the beast at an amazing speed. At the last moment she spun in the air, dodging a claw strike to smash her shield into the side of it\u2019s face while pulling the tip out and scoring a shallow gash across the chest as she landed behind it. The other tank backed off, retreating to the sidelines with a bit of sweat on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGunner! Caster! Fall back! You should be at about your limit right now. Get the other Caster in here and the Halberd user! We\u2019ll finish it off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the two girls ran off the field another two guys ran on, one with metal clawed hands he used to cast his spells and  one with a giant staff with an overlarge blade on one end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHalberd! On me! Hit it from the top! Tank get ready to pull it back to you! Caster start hitting it with a glacier! Crossbow! Unleash your strongest attack right before Halberd hits! Phase two activate! Triple juggler!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the guy with the staff ran towards me I grabbed the hilt in both hands, sliding it down and splitting the weapon in two down the middle but not pulling it apart yet. Bracing my legs I held the flat of the blade towards the boy. He leapt, planting his foot on the sword face as I heaved upward, throwing him as high as I could into the air as he sailed over the monster. The creature spit more webbing upwards to attack him but I had already flung one part of my blade into the path, blocking the attack before yanking it back towards me with a rope of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe third foot long blade that had been hidden inside the two halves of the sword began to drop as if in slow motion. Flinging the six foot long half of the blade in my left hand after the boy in the air I kicked the dagger back upwards, grabbing it with my now empty left hand on the backswing just as the half I had used to block the spit with smacked into my right palm. Throwing the dagger a fraction of a second after the other part of the sword I spun and flung the last piece as well just as the boy began his decent towards the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCrossbow now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHarpies Fury!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA rain of at least ten arrows, each one coated with a different element sped towards the beast, smashing into it seconds before the boy came down, slicing deeply into the hard flesh. My three swords which had stopped and floated where the boy had been began to circle, awaiting my commands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMimicry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three blades bent downwards, morphing into halberds that sped to the ground with the same force and speed as the original, creating three more deep wounds, one even severing two arms on the right side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeaven\u2019s vengeance!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA bright orange light shot from the tanks shield, hitting the beast before getting sucked back in, causing it to resume it\u2019s attack on the woman. The ability transferred all the agro from everyone else over to her for a short period of time. Meaning everything we had just done, the monster thought the tank had done it all. Just as she raised her shield to block three swords made of acid web the air around the creature began to condense as everyone backed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBlocks of ice began to form then merge on either side, creating two huge walls of clear frozen water. They slid across the floor, closing together with the Spidlar caught between them. They smashed together with a loud boom before melting away and disappearing. The beast wasn\u2019t dead yet though. It\u2019s insides were hanging out of the deep cuts, the skull and most of its bones were crushed, yet still it had some fight in it. Such was the power and difficulty of an A class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two! Shell Cracker! Pierce the heavens! Tiger shot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA blinding bolt of pure power whizzed from the crossbowman. As it flew it split into three and then three again, before swirling around each other, taking on the face of a giant tiger with mouth wide open. The attack hit and the tiger bit down, eating a giant hole through the Spidlar before vanishing. The monster let out a cry before toppling over, breaking up and dissolving into thin air before it finished hitting the ground. It left behind a shell in the shape of the black widow abdomen, the item as hard as steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe tank picked it up and held it up high as wild cheering broke out not only from the group I was helping but also the group the Arena Master had been training. The treasure from such a high level monster would be taken by the teacher to be appraised and the rewards split between those who had helped defeat it. One of the reasons I had made sure to switch out so everyone got a chance to fight a little bit. With a flick of my fingers my three blades flew back through the air towards me, returning to their phase one by the time I grabbed it and swung it over my shoulder. In high spirits and fist pounding each other we returned to the sidelines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNice work out there Zelkov. We finished ours a few moments ago. Just in time to see your group give it the finishing blow. I think this class has a newfound respect for you and your abilities.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sixteen kids all around nodded their heads in agreement of the teachers words. The group I had been leading all looked at each other before stepping forward and bowing to me deeply. Sally took another step forward with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I speak for all of our group when I say it was an honor being led by you. I was able to learn a lot from that fight. Please teach us again next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey no fair! I want to be in his group next time!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah me too! Don\u2019t hog all the fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I nodded my head to all of them I saw my mother walking towards me with a four and a half foot tall girl trailing long white hair and crimson eyes being pulled along behind her. The girl seemed unaware of her surrounding\u2019s with her blank look but she was still clutching an old teddy bear to her lime green dress that didn\u2019t look good on her at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, can we talk privately for a bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master gave her a nod of respect when he noticed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMrs. Zelkov, you can use one of the locker rooms if you wish. I\u2019ll make sure no one bother\u2019s you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m sure my mother has a very busy schedule and would like to get on with her day as soon as possible. Being able to use such a nearby room will facilitate that nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher gave a nod of his head as I led my mother to the men\u2019s locker room. It honestly didn\u2019t matter which one we used but it was the closest one, that\u2019s why I picked it. My mother pushed the little girl down on one of the benches before doing a quick check of the room for security reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou looked good out there. You commanded with confidence and you let them do most of the work. You have a knack for teaching.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpare me. You and father trained me in all aspects of how to be a Hunter. From doing the grunt work to leading other slayer\u2019s. You know very well how good I am and what my skills are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right. Still that doesn\u2019t make seeing you in action any less impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cImpressive enough to make you change your mind about letting me take the Exams?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t say anything to that, simply got a slightly sad look on her face I dismissed as my mother pretending to care about me in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought not. So really your observation was pointless. Wasn\u2019t that what you taught me? Doing and saying pointless things is a waste of time and breath better put to other things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s called conversation and common courtesy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBoth of which you never applied to me to begin with so why start now? Just get to the point so you can be off saving the world again in some other country for another week or month or year or whatever it is this time. Finding something to catch your fancy for a day or two before you discard it again. I suppose I should feel honored that you keep coming back to me after I get discarded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice trailed off as if she didn\u2019t know how to reply to my accusations. It wasn\u2019t like anything I had said was wrong though, it had all been the truth. She had never had time for me, always gone for weeks at a time on some job or another. She would come home for a few hours, half a day at the most, before running off someplace else. She never treated me like her son, even when I was a kid, simply training me as a Hunter before running off again. I couldn\u2019t even remember the last time she or father had actually been around for a holiday or a birthday. The baby-sitters and nannies I had grown up with had only been there to make sure I didn\u2019t kill myself and continued my training regimes when my parents weren\u2019t around. Even at that I felt more for them than I did for my parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Never mind. I don\u2019t want to argue with you right now. I do have some important business to discuss and arguing with you won\u2019t make it any easier. I\u2019ve been thinking of how to approach you about this but no way seems to be a good way so I will just come right out and say it. This girl\u2019s name is Asala and she is a monster summoner. I want you to protect her for the next few days until someone I know can come pick her up. She lost her parents three days ago which is what prompted her power to suddenly manifest. They are unstable right now and she can\u2019t control them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you can see, she has run into her head and won\u2019t come out even though me and my aides have tried to coax her. We\u2019ve sustained her on magic since she refuses to eat or sleep even when we force feed her. We can get her to swallow if we massage her throat but she somehow even shut down the reflexive muscles of her body. Even the ones controlling her bladder, which is why we put her in diapers. You\u2019ve got that special way with kids that I don\u2019t. If anyone could get her out of her shell it\u2019s you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not special in any way mother. It\u2019s a skill that anyone can learn and master. Even you if you really cared to try. True it might be fake coming from you, but you\u2019re good at faking things aren\u2019t you? After all you have the world fooled into thinking that you\u2019re a real mother. Take her to Pelei, or even Arven. Both of them have no problems with summoners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI already went to Pelei and he will do it, but my gut said not to hand her over to him if I don\u2018t have to. Arven\u2019s a good guy and all but he\u2019s not the most stellar of Hunter\u2019s. I at least know you would be able to handle anything she might bring forth and you wouldn\u2019t sell her out for the right price like Arven might. You would protect her with everything you had despite her having cursed blood, even if the entire world turned against you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTheir blood isn\u2019t cursed mother. Just like a priest or priestesses blood isn\u2019t cursed. She simply uses her magic in a unique way. She is no different than you or I. I know you tolerate them but I also know you wouldn\u2019t shed a tear if one of them died either. It\u2019s that kind of ignorance and fear from an old generation Hunter that makes other Hunter\u2019s continue to think that way. You need to ask yourself if you would think the same way if it was you with that power. Or what if I had a cursed blood power? If you can\u2019t honestly say you would think the same way as you do now then you need to change your thinking. And you can start by not calling them cursed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t have time to get sucked into a theological debate with you on whether people with special magic\u2019s are cursed or not. Will you do it or not? And if you do it I want you to continue to go to school. Your being here Is very important, though I can\u2019t explain why right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy desire to say no simply to spite my mother warred with my obligation to protect an innocent. I didn\u2019t have to take the job since I was already assured she could and would be taken care of otherwise. If I said no my mother would dump her on Pelei. He wouldn\u2019t focus much on pulling her out of her shell, simply treat her even more like a doll. But she would be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen there was the fact that she probably wanted to die right now. Or at least a part of her did. If she didn\u2019t come out of her shell soon her body would eat itself up and she would get her wish. But unlike everyone else in the world who seemed to think a person had to live I had no problem with suicide and assisted deaths. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiving was a choice that everyone made. All that crap about  life is worth living and there is meaning in existing didn\u2019t mean much in the face of the pain that living could cause. Forcing someone who wanted to die to continue to live was a cruel thing to do. Simply stoking their own ego and pushing their own views onto others. No one had to live for whatever reason someone cared to name. The whole argument of the devout that The One God would send them to hell or wouldn\u2019t love them anymore was another bunch of crock in my opinion. Did not the book say all were his children and he loved all equally? Without exceptions. So did I have any right to pull her out of her shell and force her to live?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was the best choice for the girl? Coming with me where I would pull her out of her shell and she would live even if she didn\u2019t want to. Where she would also be subjected to greater dangers because of my mother\u2019s insistence on me coming to school, giving her powers more chances to run amok in public and hurt untold number of innocent people. Or going to Pelei where she might get her wish to die but she would be safe from the world. Her chance of summoning monsters from fear or anxiety or anything else of that nature would be greatly reduced, also protecting hundreds of innocents in the process.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you can hear me then I want you to know what this boils down to. If you go to Pelei you will be safe but nothing will change from how it is right now. Your body will break down soon from lack of real food and water and you will die. If that\u2019s what you really want then I won\u2019t stop you by accepting this job. Your desire will come true if you go to Pelei. But if your desire to live is stronger then your desire to die then let me know somehow and I will accept this job. You don\u2019t have to do anything fancy like blink your eyes or nod your head. Just any small reaction will do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was no reaction at all. She continued to stare blankly at me even as I let out a sigh and turned my head to look at my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell she decided. She wants to die, send her to Pelei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the weight of the sword on my back as I stood up, absently deactivating it with another zap of power into the pommel. As I began to turn the girls arm shot up to grab my tunic, keeping me from moving away. She still had that expressionless face and nothing else about her had moved, as if the right arm had come up on its own to grab me. I kept my face just as expressionless as I turned to my mother again with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGuess she changed her mind, she want\u2019s to live. I\u2019ll take the job. Though if I feel her being here at school is too much of a danger to her or the other kids I won\u2019t come. Twenty thousand Reul as well, on top of my living allowance of course. I assume you want this all done under the table?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf possible. Though isn\u2019t twenty thousand a bit steep?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s the highest I can go for a job like this without a license and a bit extra for being under the table. I still have the option of saying no and you can still take her to Pelei if you don\u2019t like my price. Though knowing him he would probably want almost double that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGeez, I should never have taught you how to bargain. You\u2019re going to bankrupt me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure the small nation you could start with the family funds is crying right now. Do we have a deal or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe\u2019ve got a deal. I\u2019ll have the money transferred over into your account by the end of the day. I really appreciate this Riktal darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever. Now that your business with me is done I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got to run off someplace else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really do want to spend more time with you darling. And I promise I will soon. But my schedule is just so busy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t make promises you don\u2019t intend to keep, it\u2019s unbecoming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother came over and kissed me on each cheek before wrapping me in a hug. I simply stood as solid as a board waiting for her to let me go. I knew this was some ploy for a long ranging scheme. She didn\u2019t show real affection ever. Simply putting on a mask of emotion to fool people and ensnaring them into her plots. Her voice tickled my ear as she whispered into it though while she hugged me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were planning on accepting the job from the beginning. I saw it in your eyes and body language. You simply played it out like that to manipulate the girl for your own ends. You get angry at me for doing things like that but it seems you aren\u2019t so different.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my lips barely move next to her ear, returning her whisper in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re wrong there is a difference. I did it because it will help her in the long run, not for my own personal gain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I pushed her away from me, returning my attention to the girl who was still holding onto my tunic with her tiny hand. My mother slipped out of the room as I sat next to the girl, pulling her into my side while giving her a small squeeze of reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure a part of you thinks you made the wrong move but it was a choice that you decided on. How many things in your life lately can you say you were able to control?  You couldn\u2019t control your parent\u2019s dying, you can\u2019t control your powers, you can\u2019t control being pulled all around to new places and new people. I\u2019m not surprised you hid inside your head, it was one of the few decisions you were able to make to control your own life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLiving isn\u2019t easy kid. You find there are a lot of things you have no control over that you wish you did. The trick to it though is to make decisions you can accept when you have the chance to do so. I won\u2019t say something as thoughtless as live with no regrets, because there will always be things you regret, even when you believe you made all the best choices. Because there will always be this ever present question floating in the back of your head saying what if.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to absently stroke her hair as I stared off into the empty locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI had a little sister you know. She died three years ago right in front of me. I think I was the best big brother I could be to her and I loved her more than life itself. But even to this day I ask myself that insidious little question. What if I had acted sooner? What if I had kept her from leaving? What if I had focused more on training her as a Hunter and less on treating her like a little girl? Could I have prevented it from happening? Would she still be alive today? Would it still hurt so much inside? Was I right in loving her as much as I did?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked down when I felt a slight movement at my side to see the girl staring up at me with those big round orbs of hers. She didn\u2019t say anything, simply blinked at me a moment before tears began to well up in her eyes. Reaching around she clung to my chest, burying her face in my tunic and began to cry. I simply stroked her hair and made soft comforting sounds while rocking her gently. The bell rang and a few boys walked in. They saw me sitting there and turned around to walk back out without a word. After that no one interrupted us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally settled down after about five more minutes and pushed away from me slowly. I gave her a small smile which she returned hesitantly while I gave her hair another stroke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere, feel a bit better? I think you needed a good cry to let out some of that hurt. It doesn\u2019t make the pain go away, that will stay for a long while to come. But it makes it more bearable for a bit. Now how about we get out of here huh? I think we are holding up classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a nod of agreement before I went over to my locker to pick up my weapons. Holding out my hand she took it a bit shyly before we headed for the door. Outside the seniors were all waiting around patiently, holding back the next class from entering as well. They bowed their heads respectfully to me and the girl before finally entering the locker room. I let the Arena Master know I would be indisposed of for the next few days and why his next class was behind, a fact he already knew because a senior had told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe caused a minor stir when the two of us entered the Monster Tactics class but nothing too major. Asala stuck to me like glue, gripping my hand and her teddy bear so hard I was surprised neither one exploded from the pressure. There were a few sidelong glances at the two of us, but for the most part we were ignored which was just the way I wanted it. Asala even seemed to find the lesson interesting, listening with rapt attention to the teacher talking about Cawmacaw birds and Cadaver Dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the final bell rang I gathered up my stuff, offering the girl my hand just as four girls began heading towards us. Liz stepped in and caught their attention, nodding with her head for me to leave. I gave her a wink and a nod of thanks of my own as I led the girl away from the gaggle. I could hear Liz telling the girls not to get to close to someone on a job like that. Reminding them how I had asked them to stay away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce out in the hall I looked down at the little girl. Those were probably the only clothes she had. Some shopping would do her good, but I also needed to get her more comfortable around me and the town in general. Make her feel a bit like she was a part of this place instead of simply being dragged around and not knowing anything.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cCome on Asala, if you\u2019re going to be around for the next few days, I think you need to get a bit familiar with this town. Let you feel like you are really home, even if you aren\u2019t. Just stick close to me and nothing bad will happen, that\u2019s a promise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head slowly, not quite completely trusting my words but at least willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. We went to the second intersection before turning left to go into town, all the while I pointed out small landmarks and interesting things of note. Such as the old troll hut under one of the bridges over the river and a small shrine to a fox monster people had worshiped as a god hundreds of years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSuch things were preserved as reminders of where we had come from as a race, the folly of our pasts and cautions for our future. I told her some stories of the town as it had grown from a simple small farming village into the mini metropolis it was today while she seemed to hang onto every word. People saw us and waved or gave hearty greetings which I returned absently. I was a well known face around town, and even if they didn\u2019t know me personally they recognized me as a Hunter at the least. At first Asala clung closely to me, shivering slightly in fear at the number of people. But when nothing happened and a few of the sidewalk candy stands even offered her free candy she slowly loosened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of time on my hands and I don\u2019t always like sitting around in my stuffy old house all alone. So I\u2019m pretty well known around here. I bet just about half the businesses know me on a first name basis if not more. They are seeing that you are with me, so if the worst were to happen and you get lost somehow, they will protect you until I can come get you ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head in agreement, though clung even tighter to my shirt as if trying to convey that she wasn\u2019t planning on getting lost. With a grin I ruffled her hair a bit just as I heard a loud shout. I glanced up looking far off down the sidewalk to see a little boy of seven years old running up to me gleefully. He jumped up when he got close enough and I caught him with a grin while he gave me a quick hug. Lifting him up I sat him on my shoulders as his mother and father came over to us with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! It\u2019s a bit of a surprise to see you here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boys father reached over and grabbed his son from his position, placing him on his broad shoulders instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was just showing Asala here a bit of the town. Asala, I\u2019d like you to meet Mimsy and her husband Markus. The ball of energy on Markus\u2019 shoulders is Bilbin. They own a small restaurant on the other side of town called Whimsical Mimsy\u2019s. They serve some of the best home made cakes in the city.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMimsy grinned, squatting down while looking at the girl who shuffled in a bit closer to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if you have Riktal looking after you I doubt you have anything to worry about. He might downplay himself at times and he has a bit of a tsundere attitude, but he has a heart of gold. It\u2019s not too much of a stretch to say he single handedly helped me keep my business open when I was in a tight spot. Not to mention when Bilbin got lost in the woods outside the city he was the first Hunter to react, going out in search for him at least an hour before anyone else. And because of that quick action he saved my son from a nasty snake monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal\u2019s awesome! I\u2019m going to become a Hunter just like him when I grow up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl\u2019s eyes grew a bit larger as she looked from the boy then back at me as if she couldn\u2019t believe her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know what you were thinking about me but I\u2019m not that much of a big bad meanie. You just happened to see and hear me at a bad time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe stood there in the street chatting for a few moments and exchanging some random bits of news. This was part of how I kept informed about everything that was happening in the city, gathering these bits of information while I exchanged pleasantries. Just as we said our farewells and we were about to move on, a small red circle appeared on the side of the building next to us. When a green goblin arm reached out I nonchalantly walked over and kicked the monster in the face as it began to climb out, sending it back through the hole before it closed up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a moment of silence as the three stared in shock at Asala who had run and hid behind my legs. I put a hand comfortingly on her head as Bilbin slid down Markus\u2019 back and ran up to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was awesome! Can you do it again! Can you make something cool appear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMimsy came forward and pulled her son away, telling him to keep his voice down or he would attract attention. She gave Asala another smile as Bilbin finally sank into silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry sweetie we will keep your secret. Not everyone blindly hates people like you. I\u2019ll admit we were like that once, but Riktal made us change our minds. You\u2019re just people like me or anyone else. If Riktal is protecting you then you doubly have nothing to fear, He would rather die before letting any harm come to a hair on your head. That\u2019s just the kind of person he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a parting wave the three of them walked off and Asala watched them go with a look of wonder and surprise all over her face. Pulling her in to my side I gave her a quick rub of reassurance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? Not everyone thinks you are some kind of monster because of your ability. Granted such people are in the minority, but it\u2019s a start right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally nodded her head as we turned and continued on, grabbing some sweets and finger foods from different stores or stands set up along the sidewalks. As the time passed I saw the tension continue to drain out of her body and a level of comfort replace it. Spotting a bakery down the way I grinned, leading her towards it and opening the door to Sweets for Sweets. The boy behind the counter looked up and saw me giving a grin before calling into the back room that I was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAn older man in his early fifties came stumping out of the back room, his apron covered in flower and flecks of sparkling magic dust. His wooden peg of a left leg not even slowing him down. With a grin that split his face from ear to ear he brought his big meaty right hand around to meet mine. We clasped each other at the elbow as he greeted me jovially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal comrade! Vat a surprise! Vat can I do fer you today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala let out a little giggle at Freddy\u2019s funny accent. He came from overseas and he hadn\u2019t quite lost all of it. Instead of trying to hide it though he had embraced his difference from everyone else, knowing full well how funny he sounded sometimes. Freddy gave her a sideways look while putting his fists on his hips. But the mock hurt on his face was so obvious even Asala could see he wasn\u2019t offended by her giggle. After a moment he began to chuckle with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cZo little von. You tink my accent iz funny ya? Vell I tink you are looking a bit scrawny. You must eat special donut fer laughing at my accent. I vill not accept any od\u2019er punishment or my name iz not Fredrick Von Lipstinhowzer da third!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that he stumped over to one of the racks holding his special magic infused donuts and pulled a cream filled one off the shelf, thrusting it at the girl who took it tentatively and nibbled on it as if afraid of the taste. Both of us began to laugh at her as her eyes lit up and her face transformed into one of pure delight before she bit deeply into the pastry, getting white cream all over her face. Freddy watched her for a moment more before looking back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cZo Riktal comrade. Vat can I do fer you? You vere just in fer yer new emergency rationz not long ago. I vould like to tink this is just a social vizit but I haf a feeling you are on a job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right, I am on a job. But I\u2019m showing Asala here some of the sights this town has to offer and I thought what better place to bring her than here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head at the boy behind the counter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how is Jarvin over there working out for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe iz doing fine. He cleanz up well ya? A few good meals in him and a few new clothes and one vould never know he vas once a street imp. I\u2019m glad you found him fer me and I tink he is glad az vell. Though he did not tink so in da beginning ya?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both saw Asala sneaking her hand up to grab another donut, grinning to each other as we pretended not to notice, continuing to talk. Freddy told me a few rumors he had heard about the beggar king that ran the east side street imps was making a power play to secure the south side as well. I made a note of this, figuring it was best to send old one-eyed Joe on the south side some help to hold his territory. It wouldn\u2019t due to let one of the four underworld bosses get too strong and control too much of the crime in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you tink da little von vould be interested in seeing how I make da breadz?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked down at Asala who seemed to be in her own personal world of bliss as she savored the donut she had filched. Outside the sun was a bit low in the sky, as the clock rang out that it was four thirty. I still needed to get her some clothes as well today, but I was also sure she would like to learn how he did what he did. She seemed to love learning new things.</span></div></div>",

For a moment Asala didn\u2019t know what to do with her bear but finally tucked it down the front of her dress until it\u2019s front paws and head sat under her chin before accepting the second treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it iz her I vould not mind.

They all seemed surprised to see me, stopping to stare in surprise for a moment. It was a testament of how much safer Asala felt that she didn\u2019t clutch at me reflexively with her sticky fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! I didn\u2019t expect to see you here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave Marsa a nod of recognition before telling her I was simply showing the girl around. Jarvin blushed when he saw Marsa and hurriedly busied himself behind the counter instead of simply sitting on his stool doing nothing. Marsa didn\u2019t seem to even notice him though as the two girls with her began to gush over how adorable Asala was. When I glanced down I saw she had glaze and cream all around her mouth and a bit on her nose. With a sigh I knelt down and pulled a handkerchief from my side pouch, wetting it with some magic made water and cleaning her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBe a little neater while eating that last donut ok Asala? And it will be your last. I won\u2019t let you get a tummy ache from eating too many of these special pastries. I know they are good and all but that doesn\u2019t mean you can eat as much as you want. You understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head as she looked a bit put off that I was cleaning her face but I ignored her look of exasperation. It felt like I was running around town with my little sister again and I didn\u2019t mind at all. I was surprised to find I actually felt really good right now, not even minding the girls making sappy comments about me over my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal are deez young ladiez friends of yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call them friends. But they are classmates. I\u2018m in a good mood right now so treat them well Freddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAz you vish. Fer today only I shall give dem a half price dizcount on everytink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls gasped in surprise at the windfall as I put my arm around Asala\u2019s shoulder and led her towards the door. Before I left though I turned around and pointed at Marsa while looking at Freddy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh this girl here is a pretty good caster. Think you could find your way to getting her some of your special donut holes. You know, the ones that increase magical power? A pack of twelve should last her for a while if she uses them sparingly. She went up against a Glif earlier and she held her own well enough. I was impressed by her performance so I thought she deserved a small token of my respect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnytink fer you comrade. I shall zee you later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waved off Marsa\u2019s thanks as I left the bakery, feeling better than I had in a long time. As if I was somehow free of an invisible burden I had forgotten I was carrying around. Heading off past the bank that was down the road I made a beeline for a clothing store I knew of a few blocks away with some slightly expensive but good quality clothing. Asala ate the last donut slowly, savoring every last bite as I laughed a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHis pastries and bread are imbued with magic. I\u2019ve seen how he does it but even I\u2019m not sure exactly how he makes it happen. It\u2019s a secret that only he knows and has patented. But there is no denying they are effective. Most of his stuff is like what you just ate, seeming to be a small slice of heaven in every bite. But he has other stuff that can actually help with magic and stamina and such that a Hunter can use in the field. His stuff is usually a bit pricey, but he can get away with selling at a higher price because it is worlds better than anything any other magic cook can do. So did you like that little treat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala\u2019s head bobbed up and down so hard I thought she would take off into the sky at any moment. But it wasn\u2019t long before she began to fidget around a bit. It took me a moment to figure it out but then I grinned in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh after three days of your body being sustained on magic, eating real food is doing a number on your digestive system. Think you can hold it for just a few minutes? We\u2019re almost at our destination.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes began to tear up as she shook her head no while looking away from me. That was all I needed to know as I scooped her petite four and a half foot frame up in my arms like she weighed nothing to run the last few feet to the store, kicking open the door and dashing to the restroom area. I didn\u2019t even stop at the ladies door, pushing it open and going to the nearest open stall in the empty bathroom before setting her down. Only then did I leave the restroom and stand outside to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that\u2019s certainly one way to make an entrance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a grin I gave the sales lady a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Sue. I had a bit of an emergency on my hands.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLooked more like it was in your hands and not on it. How you doing Riktal honey?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRoses and sunshine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKnowing you I bet it\u2019s more like thorns and overcast skies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSurprisingly enough not today. When the little girl comes out we need to outfit her with some new clothes and undergarments. Think you could spare the time to help us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor you honey, anytime.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou will keep anything you might see or hear confidential of course. And make sure no one else is near enough to eavesdrop?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wound me if you think I would do any less. I figured you was on a job of some sort. That\u2019s the only time you act like this, disregarding common decency and all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala came out of the bathroom then and I introduced the two quickly before Sue led us to the women\u2019s section, procuring us a private changing area. Asala had a grand time picking out clothes for the next two hours. She got a bit embarrassed a few times, mainly when I was helping her pick out undergarments until she mimed for me to look away. I teased her a bit but did so while Sue helped her find a few things she liked. Of course I watched her out of the corner of my eye, it wouldn\u2019t do to let my eyes off of her for even a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time we left Asala was wearing a new light blue dress and real underclothes, Sue having discreetly discarded the diaper without anyone the wiser. I was loaded down with bags, my duffle riding on my back and five shopping bags juggled between my two hands. She was yawning by the time we got home so I told her to go get a bath and brush her teeth. She nodded her head and grabbed out the pajamas she had chosen before heading up the steps. Setting the things in the hallway for the moment I went into the living room and sat on the couch, listening to the water running upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was tired. This was the first time in a long time I could remember being this tired from simply running around town. But then again, this is what it had felt like when I had taken Olia on dates into town. A feeling I didn\u2019t mind at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI must have lost track of time a bit and zoned out because next thing I knew Asala was climbing under my arm and snuggling into my side contentedly, her teddy bear clutched tightly in her hand. Combing my fingers through her damp hair I let out a sigh of contentment, one she echoed a moment later. Suddenly she spoke, her voice soft and slightly lilting, almost musical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAm I bad for not thinking about momma and papa much today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo sweetie. It just means you were able to enjoy today. You were able to find good things in all the bad that has happened to you lately. The silver lining as they call it. Not everyday is going to be like this. And you are still going to hurt and think about them again and again. And just as it\u2019s ok to feel happy in the happy moments, it\u2019s ok to feel sad in the sad moments. You\u2019ve got your entire life ahead of you right now. There is no reason it all has to be sad. No reason that you need to think that there is nothing more because your parents are gone. You understand what I am trying to say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh-huh, I think so. Is it ok if I think of you as family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure. I\u2019d like that. You already remind me of my little sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Because I wish I had a brother like you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe squeezed me tightly as she closed her eyes with a smile on her face. I continued to stroke her hair as her breathing evened out and she fell asleep in my lap. I stayed awake for a few more moments before I let my head fall backwards and fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat other truths might have been reveled if you had gone down another possibility? Would this day have turned out so well? Would it have turned out better? Or perhaps it was always destined to turn out like this? Context and course of events. Do these things mean anything? If supposing down this path things happen as A goes into B goes into C makes D outcome. Then if the course of events were to change, would it matter in the long run? If C goes into A goes into S would or could the outcome still be D? Would the context of those two timelines matter? That is, the same words, spoken by the same people. Or would their meaning change, resulting in different actions?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEverything you have seen today has happened, but at the same time it has not yet happened and might never happen. Even as it will happen. Come again traveler and delve deeper into the mysteries that is this world of possibilities.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will probably be the only time she will get to see something so unique.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFreddy grinned as he looked down at Asala who was in her own little world savoring the glazed donut in her left hand and dropping crumbs onto the stuffed animal she clutched in her right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly fer you and your friends comrade vould I offer such an opportunity. Bezides, she reminds me of my little von back in Custanvia. Vell, vhat my little von vas like thirty years ago ya? Zo comrade, ven do you plan to zettle down vith a good bushka and haf little von\u2019s of yer own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door jangled while he was talking but I ignored the intrusion as I gave him a grin and stroked Asala\u2019s head absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps when I can find a good bushka like your Wilhameina yes? From what you have told me of her she was my kind of woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe broke out in a belly laugh as he clapped me on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cComrade! I haf much respect for you ya. But I tink even you vould not last vith a bushka like her. I do not know how I lasted twenty-five years with her before Da One God decided he needed her at his side. I bet even now she iz putting Nirvana in order fer him! And tellink him how to do his job to boot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI returned his grin before turning to see Marsa and two girls from class staring at us in surprise. As if they had never seen two men acting so close. Looking down at Asala I saw she was eyeballing another pastry on a shelf with glaze and cream all around her mouth. With a sigh I knelt in front of her, pulling a handkerchief from my pouch and wetting it with some water I conjured into existence before grabbing her chin in my hand and cleaning her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo more girl. I think two is enough for you now, otherwise you are going to get a tummy ache. I know they are good, but too many is just as bad for you as only being able to look. Besides, if you get anymore on your face you might turn into a pastry yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ignored the gushing of adoration over my head as the two girls I didn\u2019t know by more than face commented on how good I was with her, like I was her father or something. Normally such prattling would have got on my nerves, but I found I really didn\u2019t mind them at the moment. Right now taking care of Asala reminded me of how I had been with Olia. It made me feel like a big brother again. When I thought about that, it was like nothing could dampen my mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala for her part suffered me cleaning her face rather gracefully. Pouting only a little at my insistence that she couldn\u2019t have another donut. After cleaning her up I playfuly smacked her on the nose with a shake of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat face might have worked on someone else but not on me. I\u2019m wise to you little girl. So put those lips up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe tried keeping the pout going but could only hold it another moment before beginning to grin, showing a full set of teeth. As I stood up I took her hand and began heading towards the back room after Freddy. On a whim I turned to look at the three girls who were still staring at me, two of them almost having little hearts floating around their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFreddy is going to give us a sneak peek at how he makes his pastries. If it\u2019s ok with him you ladies want to join us? It\u2019s all top secret though so you can\u2019t tell anyone. That is, even if you understand it all. Quite frankly not even I understand how he does it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan we! Are you sure!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf dat iz vat comrade Riktal vishes, I vould be happy to show you as vell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen yes please!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three girls joined us, only Marsa kept quiet, refusing to chatter away like the other two. It wasn\u2019t that she wasn\u2019t interested or anything, I could see her glee plain as day on her face. She was just naturally more reserved and composed. Then again, a good magic caster like her had to be in order to manipulate the magic with a greater skill then a combat oriented Hunter like me. I might have more variety with what I could do right now, but her spells packed more of a punch then any of mine ever could unless I used a lot of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce in the back Freddy led us all over to an alchemic table where various concoctions were brewing, some of them had probably been steeping all week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere iz vere it all starts. I make potions of all shapes and sizes. Fer the more complicated von\u2019s I get dem elsewhere. Zo I must haf a good knowledge not only of my own skillz but also a good eye fer the skillz of od\u2019ers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe led us to the next table in the assembly line, this one with a pressure pot and some fast freezing water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDa next step is complicated and da secret of it all. But in a nutshell I take da potion I vish to use and apply great pressure to it, making it boil vith no heat. Vhile it iz pressurized I add a touch of my magik and inject some of this vater that can freeze yer flesh if you touch it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe demonstrated by putting on a rubber glove and picking up a small bit of dough from a table behind us. He dipped the gooey dough into the bowl of water that had frost rimming it and vapors swirling like mist over top of the liquid. When he pulled it out he tapped the ball on the table, making it shatter into little pieces. He then lifted the bowl carefully and poured some of its contents it into a small tank attached to the pressurized can with a clear hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter setting the bowl back down and carefully covering it with a metal sheet we all saw him encasing the can with a thin film of pink energy. With a grin at us he slowly loosened a knob holding the liquid back. Even though I was expecting it, I still jumped a bit like everyone else when there was a small pop inside the canister and the clear lid was suddenly covered with little rainbow colored dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt iz like the popcorn ya? When da compressed boiling potion meets da freezing water you get da small boom and voilla! Magik sprinkle dust. Da secret iz in how you regulate yer magik. I vill let it set fer an hour to normalize evenly and be ready fer use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTurning us around he spread out his hand to show the large table spanning half the length of the room behind us that was clearly sectioned off into four parts. Each one had dough on it as well as bowls of magic dust clearly marked with what potion it came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDis is vhere da real magik begins. As I make da dough I kneed in what magical properties I vish. Not too much or da bread vill not cook properly and da magik dust vill fail. Not too little or da magik iz not potent, making it a vaste to put it in. Fer the pasteries that make you feel good or haf fun abilities such as bouncy step it takes a special mixing of ingredients, not just von. Since da dust haz much da same properties as da potion ya? Zo I use multiple potions to counter certain effects just like when making a potion to begin vith. Simple no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know how much is the right amount of each dust to use though?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFreddy winked at the one girl who had spoken while waggling his finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDat my dear iz trade secret. You are friend of comrade Riktal but not even he is allowed to know dat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMoving down the table he explained how each section was set up for different things, and with different magic dusts so there would be no crossover. Telling us all how the breads with specific abilities like increasing magical power or enhancing things like strength and speed were more straightforward, requiring only the dust and the bread to be mixed together in the right portions. Also pointing out that one section was completely dedicated to making normal bread for those who wanted to buy it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll four girls seemed to be interested in the entire process as he explained it to them, a fact which delighted Freddy to no end. He was proud of this specialized cooking that he did with good reason. They hung on to his every word as he finally ended up in front of the array of ovens. Some of them were old fashioned kiln style and other newer models. He told them how certain breads also needed to be cooked certain ways to give it their unique flavors or to pull out the full potency of the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three girls from school asked a few more questions which Freddy answered for the most part, only being evasive when he needed to be. At the end he pulled out some bread that was cooling to the side and gave it to each of them. Saying that it tasted better when it was still warm. When they popped the bread into their mouths it almost looked like they were all seeing The One God himself. Me and Freddy shared a grin as he led the girls back out into the front of the store where they thanked us profusely for the honor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJarvin had a big box of the regular bread sitting on the counter waiting for Freddy who looked at the clock in surprise before nodding his thanks to the boy. He picked up the offering and headed for the door while the girls looked on in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere is he going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe gives the unsold bread he makes in the morning to the homeless at this time everyday. Not the special stuff, since he doesn\u2019t want them to get addicted to it or anything, but the non-magical stuff. Sometimes I think that\u2019s the real reason he makes non-magical bread, since people rarely buy the regular stuff when they come in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust as the door was closing we all heard a gunshot from right outside. Asala jumped a bit and clutched at my leg as the three girls all looked at each other with degrees of shock and fear.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAs the three girls from school hurried to the door to find out what had happened, I followed at a leisurely pace. By the time I got to the door I was just in time to see Freddy waving off the thanks of two police officers who were pulling a masked man off the ground and cuffing him. I gave the girls another grin as they kept glancing back and forth between Freddy who was already handing out bread to the homeless in the alley next to the bakery and the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe might be old but he is still a Hunter, and a tough old coot to boot. Survived two S class monsters, stood alone against an invasion of trolls for half a day until help could arrive, and lived with a monster for twenty five years. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he could give any one of you a run for your money still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFreddy overheard my comment, giving a braying laugh as he handed out another small loaf to a thankful woman but didn\u2019t comment further. Asala began to fidget a bit, dancing from foot to foot. It took me a moment to realize what was wrong but when I did I smiled privately, opening the door and leading her back inside. Ignoring Jarvin I lead her through the back of the store to the bathroom where she promptly rushed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shouldn\u2019t be surprised, her body had received no real nutrition for three days. Suddenly being flooded with so much food and drink it was a wonder it hadn\u2019t act up before this. Then again maybe it had but she had been too absorbed in learning about the bread making process to really notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally came out, nodding her head when I asked if she had washed her hands. With a grin I took her tiny fingers in mine when she reached over for me, leading her back out into the main room where Freddy was sitting behind the counter with Jarvin watching Marsa and her friends browse the wares. Before I left though I pointed at Marsa quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a competent caster and she impressed me earlier today while in training. Such things deserve a small reward. Think you can spare say a dozen of your donut holes? You know, the ones that boost magical firepower for fifteen minutes at a time. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s smart enough to know how to make them last for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFer you, anytink.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan we get some too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the two girls who were looking between the two of us with hopeful eyes. Normally such unsolicited greedy desires would make me a little angry, but not today. Nothing seemed to be able to upset me right now. Thinking back to the combat class I finally shook my head no before pointing at the blond on the left and then the black haired girl on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a fister and she\u2019s an archer. They need something a bit more physical. Give the fister some double attack wafers, those magic induced phantom strikes will do more good for her. And speed cookies to the archer. The ability to feel like your arms are weightless will let her fire more rapidly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAz you vish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOpening the door with a little tinkling sound I gave everyone a parting grin while calling over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPahkah Freddy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo svidaniya comrade! Bring da little von again ya!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce out in the open I stoked the girls hair as I lead her down the street into the fading light. A lightness to my step as I heard the little girl humming quietly to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Asala, that was a new experience for you wasn\u2019t it? This world has a lot to offer and you have your whole life ahead of you to experience it. Live it to the fullest you hear me? Be sad if you need to be sad. And let yourself feel happy when you are happy. Cry if you feel like crying and smile when you feel like smiling. Don\u2019t be afraid of who or what you are, simply express yourself when you need to and face each day boldly. That\u2019s all any of us can do really. Now, while we still have some light, we got some shopping to do. We won\u2019t spend long, just enough to get you a few  things. Tomorrow we can get a bit more until you feel like this is really your home. You like that idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head enthusiastically before tugging on my shirt and motioning for me to bend over. When I squatted down in front of her she grabbed me around the neck, squeezing tightly before quickly kissing me on the lips. Her face turned a deep shade to match her eyes as she hid it in her teddy bear, only a small muffled voice emerging from behind the animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe refused to look at me again after that as we continued on our way, a foolish grin plastered on my face. I knew it was only because I had given her stability in her life that she thought she loved me, but I still couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit embarrassed. Even though she refused to look at me, her face still a bright shade of red, she also refused to let go of my hand. Lilia\u2019s prediction floated to the top of my head then and I grinned even wider if that was possible. A girl in my near future indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA fitting end to the day I suppose. Was it a good day? A bad day? Or perhaps it was simply another day, unremarkable and as same as the day before or after. But was it the best day I wonder? Could it have turned out better? I\u2019m sure it could have turned out worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat other truths might have been reveled if you had gone down another possibility? Would this day have turned out so well? Or perhaps it was always destined to turn out like this? Context and course of events. Do these things mean anything? If supposing down this path things happen as A goes into B goes into C makes D outcome. Then if the course of events were to change, would it matter in the long run? If C goes into A goes into S would or could the outcome still be D? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWould the context of those two timelines matter? That is, the same words, spoken by the same people. Or would their meaning change, resulting in different actions? Or could outcome D still happen if X, Y, and Z happened instead of A, B, and C? It is an interesting thought is it not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEverything you have seen today has happened, but at the same time it has not yet happened and might never happen. Even as it will happen. Come again traveler and delve deeper into the mysteries that is this world of possibilities.</span></div></div>",

With a grin I squeezed her hand, leading her to the left at the first crossroads to go into town. When we turned into a clothing store I saw her eyes widen in surprise as I chuckled slightly at her expense<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe first thing you need is stuff. Lots and lots of stuff. I\u2019ve yet to meet a girl that didn\u2019t like to shop, especially when it\u2019s someone else\u2019s money. You might be leaving in a few days but while you are here I want you to feel like this is your home. There is no reason you have to run around with nothing of your own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hesitated for a moment, pulling a plain dress off the sales rack claiming it only cost 5 Reul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that really what you want? If it is that\u2019s fine but I expect you to spend at least a hundred Reul or more before you leave here. That includes shoes, and jewelry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI called the sales lady over, asking her to show us the more expensive stuff, following her to another part of the store. As Asala began to slowly pick through the dresses with the woman\u2019s help I simply stood back. This wasn\u2019t my first choice of stores, since many of the clothes were either of a lesser quality or more expensive than most other places. But Asala seemed to look happy as she began running in and out of the changing room to try on clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blushed a bit, miming for me to look away as she picked out underwear, which made me grin while poking a bit of fun at her. As she went into the changing room to try on another dress I saw the sales lady whispering to another woman. I was able to read a few of the words on her lips as she talked about how Asala was wearing a diaper. Nonchalantly I walked over to the two women, slipping out two five hundred Reul bills and sliding the bills across to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d be appreciative if you completely forget anything you might have seen concerning that little girl. She is getting over an injury causing her to have to wear some embarrassing things at her age. In fact I would be appreciative if you completely forget we were ever here once we leave. Think I can count on you ladies to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman behind the counter gave me a small smile as she slipped the bill into her pocket casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course sir Hunter. It\u2018s been an unusually slow day without any customers at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe other woman hefted the bill in her hand as I saw the gears turning. Of course she would be a greedy type. I knew she was going to try and get more out of me. Before she could open her mouth though Asala came out of the dressing room and posed for me. I whistled appreciatively and continued to watch her until she pulled another dress off the rack and went back into the dressing room. As soon as the door closed I returned my gaze to the greedy woman with narrowed eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t have a problem with that deal do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not sure if a small amount like five hundred is enough to keep my mouth shut. Especially if you are so inclined to have me forget.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to the woman who had accepted my bribe with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cExcuse me, may I speak with your store manager?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat would be me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is your policy on employees accepting bribes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey aren\u2019t tolerated. They would be fired immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I would like to inform you that one of your employees took a five hundred Reul bribe and tried to extort more money from the other person to boot. Now I\u2019m just a concerned citizen here and we Zelkov\u2019s have long upheld the standards of this city. I\u2019m sure you would know how to handle this better than I would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course Mr. Zelkov. Your family has supported this city for many years and I know how upstanding your name is. I\u2019ll take care of it immediately.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman turned to the sales lady who had tried to get more out of me and smiled sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJody honey. It has come to my attention you accepted a bribe. As you know this store does not tolerate such things. Effective immediately you are fired. Go get your things and get out of this store. And a word to the wise honey, you might want to go to another city if you want to stay in this line of work because I doubt any other clothing store will hire you once they find out you tried to extort money from a Zelkov. Actually most places around here won\u2019t hire you on that basis alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman named Jody opened and closed her mouth like a fish for a few moments before I put my hand on her shoulder, leaning forward to whisper in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd as an extra warning, if you wish to continue to make trouble for me I will make sure to remove such trouble from my sight if you get what I\u2019m saying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLetting her go I walked back to Asala who had come out of the dressing room again to showcase the dress she was wearing. I made sure to shower her with praise and appreciation, trying to boost her confidence more than anything. When I glanced back, only the store manager was in sight, coming over to help us finish up with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAn hour later and a thousand Reul lighter the two of us left the store laden down with four bags stuffed with goods. Asala was looking in a much better mood as we headed for home, the sun low in the sky to the west. She still clutched at her bear like a lifeline, but the overwhelming sadness was gone from her face, only lurking in the shadows of her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis was only a temporary high of course, it would wear off by tonight as she had a chance to settle down from the day. I figured she would have another good cry tonight before going to bed and I would hold her again while she let it all out. A home cooked meal would evoke some of those memories of her parents without shoving their death in her face, while laying in bed alone with her thoughts would bring the rest of that sorrow to the forefront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis entire day had all been a calculated ploy to help her deal with her grief in a more healthier way while planting the seeds for her future healing. The biggest thing I felt she needed right now was stability. If she felt her immediate life was stable and she had some measure of power over it, I had a feeling her monster summoning powers would also become a bit more stable and controllable. I didn\u2019t know this for a fact of course, but all the secondhand knowledge I had made this seem likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen we got to the house I unlocked the door, juggling the bags in my hand to turn the knob. I had just stepped inside when the little girl tugged on my shirt and motioned for me to bend over. As I set down the bags I leaned in towards her with a smile on my face expecting her to whisper something in my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed, giving my cheek a quick peck before parting her lips and uttering four words with a soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she blushed a deep red that was almost a match for her eyes before running off upstairs. Touching the spot she had kissed lightly I felt my grin widen foolishly. It had been a while since I had been called big brother. It made me feel really good inside in a way I hadn\u2019t felt in a long time. It made me glad I had chosen to protect her. Lilia\u2019s divination popped into my head then as I headed for the kitchen to make dinner. A girl in my near future who would give me back something I had once thought lost indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I began to hum a little tune my sister had always loved as I began pulling out pots, feeling that the house didn\u2019t feel as empty as it normally did for the first time in three years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends the day. A relatively eventful day I suppose, though at the same time you could say it was uneventful and normal depending on who\u2019s perspective you speak from. Speaking of perspective, how did you decide the choices you did? Did you view this day through your own eyes? Or did you immerse yourself in Riktal\u2019s life, choosing as you thought he would chose? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIs this one of the other times you have lived this day? Even for me such distinctions are hard to make. With possibilities overlapping each other like fine rice paper sometimes details blend together. But if this is one of the multiple other times you have lived this day, did you alter your decisions based on the information you learned on other possible timelines? Or were you able to put that information to the side and choose with an unbiased mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBecause that it a fallibility of you humans I have found. You find it difficult to distance yourself from problems and make choices in an unbiased manner. Especially when you have a little extra information. In fact it seems the more information you have the more biased you become, it is a strange phenomenon indeed that I wish to study further. Feel free to come again so that I may observe you as you interact with this day again. Perhaps I will gain new insights while watching you, just as you gain new insights while guiding Riktal\u2019s life.</span></div></div>",

If there was no one else then it would be different, but that\u2019s not the case. You didn\u2019t want me to become a licensed professional so you have no business asking me to take a job like this. I\u2019ll see you when you get back from your next job if I\u2019m unlucky. That is if I don\u2019t just get fed up with everything and disappear into obscurity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal you wouldn\u2019t do that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you really think that mother then you really don\u2019t know me at all. The kicker of it all is it wouldn\u2019t even affect you or faher in any way. You would both continue to act like nothing changed, same as when Olia died. So in case this is the last time we meet, farewell mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sword on my back bounced a bit as I turned, making me reach up and deactivate the artifact so it was simply a hilt again. I returned to the arena where the Arena Master was on the floor with eight of the sixteen kids fighting an antlion. The ones still on the sidelines gave me a nod of respect as I drew close and then began asking me questions about what they were seeing. Mostly pertaining to reasons why this or that order was given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw my mother look in on me with another pair of forlorn and sad looking eyes but pretended not to notice her while answering their questions until she eventually walked off. The group on the floor finished off their prey, earning an antlion mandible for their troubles before coming back over to us. The teacher gave them all a small lecture before the bell rang a few moments later and the class dispersed. He informed me that he wouldn\u2019t need me until tomorrow if I was available before I returned to the locker room to collect my things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got a few thanks from the seniors for teaching them but otherwise they gave me some space out of respect. With weapons in hand I headed for my class on the second floor. I had just gotten into the room when a rumbling shook the entire school. One of the girls pointed out the window and I dashed over in time to see a giant Shoglim emerging from a red summoning circle. I could just make out my mother and the little girl on the other side of the nine foot tall creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShoglim\u2019s were nasty monsters. With the body of a spider, an outer shell as hard as bone, and a slightly humanoid face they were tough to deal with at the best of times. What was worse was they got larger and stronger with age. Since this one was nine feet tall it was at least nine years old. They grew a foot a year and capped out at nine feet, living at most fifteen years. Add in they were as intelligent as humans and you had a fight on your hands that was a challenge for even an S class Hunter even though this was only an A class monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEveryone get out of this classroom now! Head for the basement! Liz! Send out an alarm to the rest of the school to evacuate to the basement! I\u2019m counting on you to help the teachers keep everyone safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI barely heard the assent as I tossed my duffle bag out the broken window, activating the bit of magic that made the weapons fly out to float around me in a stasis field even as I followed the bag a second later. Pulling the sword from my back I reactivated the giant blade, trying to get a preemptive strike on the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t even turn away from where my mother was holding it off with a buckler made of magic, simply blocking my strike with one of it\u2019s eight legs and throwing me backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two active. Triple juggler.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy feet connected with the wall of the school even as I broke the sword in half. As I shoved off I bit down on the hidden blade while throwing the two half swords out to my sides. Speeding towards the creature I swung the sword in my right hand, getting blocked again without it looking at me. But I used that contact to spin in that direction trying to backhand it with the sword in my left hand. It blocked that blow as well even as I manipulated the handle in my mouth until I could spit the dagger at its face using a bit of magic to speed it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt saw the dagger coming and  jerked it\u2019s head, but I swung the dagger after it using the thread of power connecting the hilt to my tongue, catching it in one of it\u2019s eight eyes. It gave  a scream of pain as I landed, throwing my two sword halves at the Shoglim, dodging the attempt to block them with the threads attached to my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase one activate. On the dagger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sword pieces zoomed like arrows to the dagger, ramming deep into the eye before I used my strings to yank it out again and back to my hand. My mother had grabbed a shield and short sword from the ones floating around me by the time the Eviscerater was back in my hand. Discarding it into my stasis field I grabbed a collapsible bow with bladed arms, beginning to fire shafts of magic arrows at the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase two activate. Blur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as the top and bottom of the bow split and settled against the back of each arm before growing out another limb, teachers were emerging from the school to help. Even though no one said anything we worked together like a well oiled machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI need a boost!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I yelled that the Arena Master was in front of me cupping his hands in front of him. Stepping into his grip he heaved like a strongman, sending me flying to the height of the school roof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase three activate! Seven levels of Perdition!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hands in front of me so the bows were parallel to my body. Five more bows appeared in the air like ghosts of the ones on my hands. I saw three of the teachers setting up a barrier around the creature even as I released the magic suddenly coursing through my veins. Arrow after arrow blasted from each of the seven bows one arrow every second. Each one flaming as hot as magma. The monster deflected most of them by swinging four of its arms wildly through the air, but it couldn\u2019t block all of them. A good fourth of the hundreds upon hundreds of arrows I spammed as I fell hit the carapace and burned through. As I was about to hit I spun, quickly, turning into a cyclone as the five ghost bows did the same. It tried blocking me with its arms but the razor sharp blades of the bow limbs combined with my rotation sliced them up even as I slammed into it\u2019s back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuickly I jumped off even as it twisted it\u2019s head to bite at me. I could see that already it was beginning to heal it\u2019s wounds by covering them with webbing which hardened into near bone density. Mr. Yetz the Alchemy teacher lobbed potions at it while another teacher I didn\u2019t know spammed high level magic from a staff. I saw Mr. Yetz warp through a teleportation potion right onto the creatures back to smash a bottle of some sort of acid into it\u2019s mouth when it turned towards him, stepping back through the green gas before it disappeared to be back safely on the ground. The whole move had taken less than four seconds but it had required precise timing and knowing exactly how long a teleportation spell stayed up for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt spit webbing out of its backside that spread out and attached to the side of the school building. It leapt backwards, standing on the side of the building before leaping off at all of us, its mandibles clacking. As my mother sent out a wave to attract it\u2019s attention and raised her shield, I saw the wall give way as it pulled the building down behind it. Time seemed to slow down as my eyes darted around quickly. It seemed no one had noticed the walls yet, too intent upon the Shoglim. Making a snap decision I expelled all the magic left in my body to create a giant wall of wind that shoved everyone out of the way even as I grabbed the Evicerater for the last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPhase three activate. Pincushion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe sword melted onto my body, growing four to six foot long blades from every section of my body. With a yell I jumped up to meet the monster, feeling one of its claws slide in between two of the blades to puncture a kidney. But I ignored it as I slammed into the creature, head butting the two foot blade on my forehead through its mouth just as it landed on top of me. Grabbing it in a bear hug I kept it from moving as I watched the tons of brick fall on top of the both of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA tragic end to the day. But at what point did this day go wrong? Was it as simple as not accepting the job from his mother? Perhaps it was a choice before that? Perhaps your decision not to escort the group to the nurses office is to blame for this turn of events. Maybe it was destined from the beginning to turn out this way. Do you regret the choices you made? Do you wonder that ever elusive question of what if?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt least Riktal died the way he wished, a Hunter protecting people like he was trained to do. It is an honorable death I believe. One that deserves praise. But did it have to happen? Was this outcome destined to happen all the time or was there another option that he failed to see? Was this entirely his fault though? What if other people hade made slightly different choices? Such as his mother approaching him with her request differently. Or if the two boys had never gone through his bag during lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf those slight alterations had happened, would he have still made the choice to sacrifice himself like he did? Would this entire scenario have never happened? These are all questions that need answers but as with many things, might never get them. Come again traveler and experience this day anew. Make new choices, perhaps find the answer to these questions while finding and asking new ones. You can of course never return to this place and leave this window forever closed without rewriting it. The choice is yours.</span></div></div>",

No offense Arena Master but if what she wants me for lasts overlong I won\u2019t hold up the class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI mockingly held out my hand for my mother to lead the way as the Arena master tipped his head in our direction. My mother gave the class and the teacher a brief nod before turning and marching away, dragging the unresisting little girl behind her. With a sigh I followed, falling into step beside her once we were out in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI saw about the last half of the fight back there. You were impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo use trying to flatter me mother. You know very well my level of skill. You and father are the ones who beat it into me after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t think you were impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot impressive enough for you to think I was ready for the Exams though huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not like that you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I don\u2019t because you never tell me anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was quiet after that, not having any real retort that wouldn\u2019t have been a lie. Even though she was my mother I didn\u2019t feel much for her. A bit of love perhaps but nothing I couldn\u2019t ignore most of the time. She was barely more than a stranger to me, since I honestly couldn\u2019t remember once when she had shown any real motherly affection. The only time she had dealt with me was when she had been teaching me Hunter skills. And then she trained me like another Hunter and not her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t take long before my mother opened the door on a small sparse room with a single table, six chairs sitting around it and a window looking out on the track and field where a class was running in circles. After manually pushing the girl into a seat she walked over to the window, staring outside with her hands clasped behind her back. I could see a slightly thoughtful look on her face in the reflection coming off the sheet of glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m glad to see you are already making friends on your first day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid, they aren\u2019t friends. They\u2019re just senior\u2019s I helped teach that\u2019s all. They are my friends like you are my mother, in name only. The only difference is they might actually be a bit closer to me. Now enough of the pointless chatter. We both know the only reason you are here is because you want something from me. It\u2019s the only time you ever come around of your own free will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I guess I will leave it at that for now. Everything starts somewhere right? You\u2019re right, I do want something from you. This girls name is Asala and she lost her family a few days ago. I want you to take care of her until someone can pick her up. It will only be two days, three max. I\u2019m going to be heading off to Bornica and I won\u2019t take her into such a war torn place. Your father finished his job early so he will be assisting me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill see no reason any of this is my problem. Or any compelling one to help you. If you couldn\u2019t deal with protecting her then you should never have taken the job in the first place. Surprised you took it at all seeing how great you are with kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes well, I sort of had no choice. The job sort of fell into my lap. It\u2019s an easy job, as you can see she is like a lifeless doll. If you can get her to do anything, that would be more than me and my aides have been able to do. We\u2019ve kept her alive on magic to fool her body into thinking it\u2019s not hungry or thirsty, but that can\u2019t last more than another day or two at the most before her body eats itself up. She doesn\u2019t sleep, just stares at the ceiling all night long and we\u2019ve supported her with magic on that front too. But again, we both know how prolonged use of magic to keep from resting messes with the head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s so special about her? Normally you\u2019d dump her on one of your aides or the first Hunter you could think of after only a few hours if that. I\u2019m sure Hilda could break her out of her shell, or any number of people, Hunter or not for that matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s got cursed blood. Monster summoner to be exact. It\u2019s unstable and she can\u2019t control it. You are one of the few I know who doesn\u2019t have anything against summoners. You\u2019re good with kids, and you can deal with anything she can call forth. I already asked Pelei, who is the only other one I could trust with something like this. He was willing to do it, but to be honest I just didn\u2019t feel right leaving her with him. Especially with his little eccentricities. But if you refuse I\u2019ll go with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI realize this is a large job I\u2019m asking you to do. And unfair to also ask you to keep this under the table if possible. But there are reasons for that as well. I know you are going to ask what reasons and it pains me to say I can\u2019t tell you just like every other time you ask that question. I promise I will reveal it all to you soon, but not right now. I\u2019d also like it if you continue attending classes here if you say yes. That too has important reasons I can\u2019t say yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother finally turned away from the window to stare at me with pleading eyes. If it had been anyone else I might have even believed those emotions she had shown in voice and face were real. But my mother was a user. Willing to lie, cheat, steal, or generally do whatever she had to in order to get what she wanted. Even throwing the family name and power around over the smallest things. She did and said nothing that did not somehow benefit her the most. I knew this from growing up. Having been let down and hurt countless times whenever I let my guard down and believed her. So doing the opposite of whatever she wanted was just my natural reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the girl who hadn\u2019t even twitched in all this time, simple squeezed the bear in her hands a fraction tighter. I hadn\u2019t seen her actually move, but I noted the slight change in the size of the stuffed chest since the last time I looked. She was an innocent. I was bound by the Hunter\u2019s code to help her. So in that respect I should accept my mothers request. But I didn\u2019t need to, since Pelei was sitting on the sidelines already willing to protect her. This wasn\u2019t a clear choice I knew how to make as solely a Hunter. If Pelei had said no or there was no one else then the only choice would be to follow my Hunter training and protect the innocent. But right now that warred with my own personal desire to say no simply because my mother wanted me to accept. I knew there was more to this story, there always was with her, that she would never tell me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSince I didn\u2019t know what to do I decided to simply answer with the first thing that came to mind when I opened my mouth. So unfolding my arms, I shoved off of the wall next to the door. Taking one last look between my mother and the girl I stared her in the eyes and opened my mouth.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019m only going so low because I don\u2019t have a license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou won\u2019t do this as a favor to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease, you taught me better than that. No I should correct that. If you were anyone else I might do it for free, but I really have no desire to do anything for free where you are concerned. Besides that\u2019s probably a much better price then Pelei wanted.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you\u2019re right, he wanted thirty five thousand. He wouldn\u2019t do it as a favor to me either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShows he has some brains at least. Have the money transferred over into my account by the end of the day. Is there anything else you need mother? If not I\u2019m sure you have other places more important than here to be. I\u2019m going to spend some time getting to know this girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened her mouth as if to say something then shook her head sadly, a sorrowful look in her eyes. I ignored it as just another attempt to make me lower my guard as she crossed the room and left through the door. Kneeling on the floor next to the girl I lifted her limp right hand in mine, staring into her lifeless scarlet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know you can hear me in there. Pretend all you want but I know you can. I\u2019m sure you are more than a little confused right now. Scared, feeling helpless, and this ever present pit of sadness that feels like it is going to swallow you up. Perhaps running into your head is the only way you knew how to cope with everything. You were able to make a lot of that pain go away by simply shutting down. But it didn\u2019t all go away did it? There\u2019s still a small bit of it that keeps haunting you no matter how far you run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s because such things are not so easy to get rid of. They leave wounds that cut really deep and will last forever and ever. Even after they heal up, those scars are still deep and can still sometimes seem fresh even years and years into the future. Little girls like you aren\u2019t meant to hold it all inside. Even big tough strong men are allowed to let it all out when they need to. Doing so isn\u2019t a sin or wrong in any way. It\u2019s called grief, and everyone deals with it in their own way. For some people holding it in works for them. But I have a feeling you\u2019re a big crybaby and you need to let out a good cry to help you deal with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo reaction. Not even a flicker of the eye to show that she heard me. Well I had no idea what she had been told the last three days under my mothers care. I could guess but it would be foolish to think a few simple words from me without actions might change all of that. Perhaps if things were different my words would sway her, but not this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to react. I\u2019m going to be here with you all the time. If you want to let it all out I won\u2019t stop you. You probably don\u2019t trust me right now and that\u2019s understandable I guess. You barely know me. But I know what you are going through and all I want to do is help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let go of her hand and leaned forward, pulling her into a hug and stroking her soft white hair. I let my voice drop to a whisper to talk into her ear. Even though we were alone in the room it was a calculated act to make my words seem more important and special to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are a very special little girl who deserves to be happy. Even though you are sad right now it will get better I promise. I love you Asala, because you are you, monster summoner powers and all. Because even if you think no one else will, you now know that there is one person in this world that does. Your parents are gone and I can\u2019t change that. But you are not alone in the world. Do you hear me? You are not alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to push her away when her hands came up to grab me around the waist, pulling me back towards her. She began to wail as I gave her comfort. She continued to cry as the bell rang, her tears and snot getting the front of my tunic all wet. Finally after a good fifteen minutes she wound down, pulling away and rubbing her face with the back of her hands.  Cupping her cheek and chin in my big palm I smiled at her until she tentatively smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that\u2019s more like it. I\u2019ll be here whenever you feel like crying again ok? Don\u2019t hold it inside anymore because it\u2019s not healthy. Do you feel a little bit better now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA slow nod of the head, as if she was afraid to admit that fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make the pain and sadness disappear though does it? But it does make it slightly more bearable for the moment. That\u2019s because tears are the bodies natural way of cleansing away some of those pains. So holding them in is the unnatural thing to do wouldn\u2019t you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe simply blinked at me, unsure how to respond to that and I grinned before ruffling her hair and standing up. I held out my hand which she took tentatively, as if suddenly afraid of my touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on Asala, I need to get my weapons then I will introduce you to the class. I\u2019ll be right here the whole time so you don\u2019t have to be afraid. I won\u2019t let anything bad happen to you. After school, well who knows? We\u2019ll play it by ear. If you feel up to it we can go out and buy new clothes and eat or we can go home for the day. I\u2019ll let you decide what you are comfortable with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stuck to me like a burr, gripping my hand almost as hard a she gripped her teddy bear. It only took a moment to inform the Arena Master of my unavailability to help for the next few days before picking up my bag from the locker and heading up to the classroom. The teacher was in the middle of his lesson on Cadaver Dogs when I came in. getting out Asala\u2019s introduction and ignoring the girls gushing over her I headed for my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to the teacher, wondering what it was he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you would please put your weapon away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh right. Sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI absently reached my free right hand over my shoulder, placing a finger on the pommel and sending a jolt of power into it. I felt the blade retract back into the hilt, making my back feel a few pounds lighter. I had honestly forgotten it was there, though I would have been reminded of that fact when I tried to sit down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala wrapped her arm around mine while listening to the rest of the lesson, even seeming to be interested in the discussions. I could see heads looking back at us and small smiles on faces. I could almost see the thoughts going through most of the female minds of how adorable she was and how good I was with her. Just as I could see the thoughts going through some of the guy\u2019s minds about how girly I was or weak because I was acting the way I was. I cared for no ones opinions though. My job to protect the girl came before everything. Even personal pride and image. That was just the code of the Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter class some of the girls converged on us before I had a chance to grab my things and leave. They began bombarding me with useless chatter and words of praise. Things like how cute we looked together and how I seemed to have a knack for little kids. I knew what they were trying to do, they were trying to insinuate themselves into my life while implying they wanted to hook up with me. This was all about politics and future power plays. Asala seemed to sense what was going on too, perhaps through some female radar I didn\u2019t know about. She clutched me around the waist and gave the four girls an evil eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMine! He loves me! Mine!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girls looked at each other a bit shocked then began to chuckle and say how cute. One of the girls finally squatted down in front of Asala with a big smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe aren\u2019t trying to take him from you little one. We just wanted to talk and get to know you both better. We just want to be friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the girl held out her hand for Asala to shake, Asala slapped it away with a resounding crack before hugging my waist again. With a grin I pushed past the four girls while hiking my bag up higher on my left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala has spoken. Your presentation needs work if even a little girl like this can see through your ploys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw Liz walking over to the group standing in shock as I opened the door, hearing some of her words before getting out of hearing range.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got a lot to learn about a Hunter on a job. Rule number one is never try to get between the Hunter and his or her client. You will always come out with the short end of the stick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my hand fall to the girls head, stroking the hair softly and making her look up at me with those big round eyes of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFeel up to going into town for some shopping and a bite to eat? If not we can go home for the day and go out tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded up and down in agreement as I led her out the front doors and eventually down the road towards town. She squeezed me again, uttering only one word softly as if it gave her confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA day comes to a close. Should we call it another day? Or simply the day? For this day has ended time and again in thousands of different ways.  You have been here multiple times to see many of those different endings. So is it another day, the day, or a day? Does it make a difference? Our time together comes to an end yet again, you are free to return to this world of possibilities whenever you wish to continue to live out this day, to learn something new, perhaps answer something unanswered in this day. But no decision is ever made without regrets of some sort. No choice made without wondering \u201cwhat if.\u201d So remember that fact well fair traveler, even though you have the power to change the decisions you make in Riktal\u2019s life the next time you relive this day with him; the same cannot be said for your own life.</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ve been burned too many times by believing you and helping you out of the messes you make. Me not accepting doesn\u2019t put her in danger so I have no feelings of obligation. Now if you decided to give me the whole story and answer all the questions I continually ask that you keep putting off I might change my mind. So how about it? Willing to tell me the full truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother just looked at me with those sad eyes of hers, her mouth opening and closing a moment before she shook her head. With a sigh I turned and opened the door before looking back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t think so. Goodbye mother. Just remember, you reap what you sow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClosing the door with a decisive thud I headed towards the combat arena to pick up my gear, making it there just as the bell rang. A quick stop in with the teacher to find out he didn\u2019t need me and I was on my way again towards my next class. I made it to my seat just before the teacher came in to take role call, noting that Gregory was back from the nurses office as well. As I went to sit down I felt the push of my weapon against the back of the chair, causing me to reach up and zap a bit of power into the pommel to retract the blade. I had forgotten I still had it equipped and active.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe last hour was just as dull and boring as I thought it would be. I learned nothing I didn\u2019t already know and felt like it was all just a waste of time. But I at least pretended to be interested, since the teacher was taking the time to teach. It was just good manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the bell rang I grabbed up my things and headed over to Jethic who was  looking down at the small band of metal on his arm with a forlorn look on his face. He was probably thinking about the ruined shield that band would expand into if he activated the artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic, got some time? If you do then let\u2019s go get your shield fixed. You didn\u2019t think I was just making empty words earlier did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! But\u2026 no I\u2026 are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCompletely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cO-ok.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gathered his stuff quickly and the two of us headed off out of the room. It took only a moment for him to stop at his locker before we were on our way again. When we got to the front door though he looked outside and balked. Stammering that it might be best to do it some other day. Glancing outside and following his line of sight I saw him eyeballing three boys that screamed bully. The one in the middle with the blue hair and leather jacket with metal studs all over it had the unmistakable air of the leader of the group. The two lackeys on either side we so undistinguishable and forgettable as to not even be worth a second glance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll three had the look of idiots who hadn\u2019t figured out they were no longer in a regular school system where violence between students was unacceptable. This was a Combat Hunter\u2019s academy where violence was encourage to an extent. So such things as bullying, lasted only until their victims fought back and put a serious hurt on them. If they were strong, which might actually be the case, then eventually the students would band together to take them out. They might be able to take on a few, but not the entire student body, or even a bunch of upperclassmen stepping in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat, you afraid of those three idiots out there? You\u2019re a tank. You could take them all for breakfast I bet.\u201d<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you\u2026. never mind. I\u2019ve got a bit of a problem when it comes to hitting people. I can beat on monsters all day no problem, but I hesitate when it comes to a real person if it isn\u2018t a sparring match.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell come on. I\u2019m not about to wait around for hours until they leave and it\u2019s about time you stood up to give them a beat down. It will only get worse if you don\u2019t face them. Just close your eyes when I give you orders and imagine you are fighting the Glif again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw him let out a shaky breath but nodded his head, following me out of the building as I headed directly for the group of three boys. The one with the blue colored hair pushed off the wall just as I got close enough to grab him by the belt with my right hand and the neck with my left. Hoisting him up over my head I threw him at Jethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShields out! Mid air takedown!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic slapped his wrist reflexively, making his broken and crumpled shield expend into reality as he jumped up. He caught the boy in the gut with the jagged edges of the shield as he twisted in air, bringing the boy back to the ground in an arc and smashing the air from his lungs. I was already throwing the next boy at him before he had completed his first attack and grabbing for the third before either bully could react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUppercut shield side!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe brought his left fist around and up from his kneeling position, catching the second boy I had thrown in the gut just as I kicked the third one in the back, causing him to stumble forward. As the lackey who got gut checked with his uppercut let out a grunt of pain and toppled sideways out of the air I yelled out my final command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBackhand shield bash in two\u2026 one\u2026 now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe broken shield pounded into the third bullies face, ripping his cheek open on the jagged parts and breaking his jaw in the process. As he fell to the ground clutching his face I walked over and clapped Jethic on the shoulder as he opened his eyes and looked around in shock. He finally returned the grin I gave him as I walked over to the blue haired boy and stomped down on his stomach. Bending over to stare into his face while pinning him in place with my shoe I made sure I had his full attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeople like you are not welcome in this school. Next time he won\u2019t go so easy on you. This is not a regular high school anymore where you can steal peoples milk money with impunity. There are consequences to every action. And I hold a very dim view on bullies to begin with. So consider this your first and final warning. If I ever catch you picking on anyone else again I will kill you no questions asked. This world does not need a Hunter like you. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook his head up and down quickly, too afraid to do anything else. Giving him another evil grin I brought the toe of my boot up into his chin before walking away. I saw a few of the seniors nodding their heads at the spectacle, they had all learned their first years here the way things were. They didn\u2019t interfere though because it was something all new students had to learn, having someone else clean up the mess or step in wouldn\u2019t fix the problem, it would just make the new students think they were weak and lose confidence in themselves. Such was the politics of a Hunter\u2019s academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClapping my hand on Jethic\u2019s shoulder one more time I lead him towards town, leaving the three moaning in pain behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll help make a real Monster Combat Hunter out of you yet Jethic. You\u2019ll find not all monsters are found in the wild. Sometimes they wear a human skin like those three.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I know, old Markus used to tell me the same thing. He said I would need to get over my fear of hurting people if I wanted to become a good slayer. That sometimes I would take a job that would require me to hurt people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt seems I am in need of a few friends. Think you would be willing to fill one of those slots?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally! I\u2019m honored! But is that really ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. I\u2019m a pretty good judge of people and I can tell you are already far ahead of just about everyone else in class in terms of the mentality needed to be a Hunter. Though I warn you, I\u2019m not much of a people person so I don\u2019t really know how to do this whole friends thing. Like how I am supposed to act and stuff like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe began to laugh a bit as we continued on down the road towards town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is no set way to act. You just be yourself. People like you or dislike you because of it and that\u2019s about it. You might be a great Hunter with some amazing skills, but you still got a lot to learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he continued to chuckle I headed left when we came to the first intersection. What did he mean I had a lot to learn? What was there besides being a Hunter to life? Things like friendships and love was all politics at its core wasn\u2019t it? All about who you know and what you can get out of it. Wasn\u2019t that what dealing with my family and everybody else had taught me over the last seventeen years? My offer of friendship to him was also just a calculated move, since I judged him to be the least harmful for my needs. The principal had said to make friends but not what kind. There was no such thing as something for nothing, friendships were give and take relationships that bound you to feelings of obligation to the other person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI guess in the end I was no different than my mother, trying to make things go the way I wanted to benefit me the most. That was a most sobering and unpleasant thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo do you feel you made the best choices? What did you base those choices on? Your own personal feelings? The situation at hand? Riktal\u2019s view of the world? Did some seem like difficult choices? Or perhaps it seemed like no choice at all. As if there was only ever one correct path or option to take. Was it different choosing the course of someone else\u2019s life over your own? Easy to say things like \u201coh I would have handled it differently\u201d or \u201cwhy did he want to make a choice on this thing over that thing?\u201d Such is the way of the outside observer. Able to make such judgments since ultimately it is not you. Come again if you will and relive this day to make different choices. I will not say they would be better for only you could be the judge of that.</span></div></div>",

Keeping up your energy was the most important thing. So I made a quick turn, continuing down the hall until I came to the cafeteria. Nothing too spectacular to chose from but at least it looked both edible and a step up from the slop my last school served. Corn, mashed potatoes and some sort of Salisbury steak in grey gravy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking around I found a good table close to the emergency exit, completely empty with a wall I could place at my back. I was just getting settled in when another tray plopped down across from me. I had seen her coming so wasn\u2019t even the least bit startled. Everyone else seemed to have already decided to avoid me, grouping up in their own little circles. Glancing in our direction as Liz sat down and whispering behind upraised hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLast person who got one over on me good like that was my older brother. Thanks for the potion by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhatever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were right though. A Hunter should always pay attention to their surroundings. If my brother were here he would have done the same thing and he would have been totally in the right to do so. He would have also healed me after giving me a good thumping. I sort of forgot that basic fact somewhere down the line. Being forced to attend school when I should be out slaying monsters, it just isn\u2018t right. Everyone here was just so weak or dense or just plain stupid. I guess you must come from an old family too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThese first and second generation Hunters could never pull off what you did. Nothing against them personally, but it was all too precise and calculated. No hesitation in the movements at all. And the speed was at least a match for mine. You only get that from intense training every day. So my guess is you are at least third or forth generation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t say anything, simply took a bite of some potato\u2019s. Being from a long line of Hunters wasn\u2019t always what it as cracked up to be. People assumed things about you and expected things from you. They kissed your feet in hopes of getting in good with you and your family. Whether you had skill or not they all expected you to be just as good as your father or grandmother or great grandparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t eat that. The steak isn\u2019t too bad but that sauce can mess you up something fierce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lowered the forkful of meat as I looked at her with a bit of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. My guess is you don\u2019t like being from an old family just like me. You\u2019re always expected to uphold the traditions and be the best of the best. Having people smother you with fake smiles and groveling in hopes they can worm their way into your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you pass the qualifications already as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t get enough of school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour parents dumped you here with the whole \u201cyou have to finish school\u201d lecture too huh? Saying it will be good for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBunch of bull isn\u2019t it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeriod after next is combat exercises. Mind partnering with me? I got a feeling you can give me a challenge unlike most of these people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t talk much do you? Though I guess I can\u2019t blame you. New school, new class, you can\u2019t trust anybody because you don\u2019t know who is being real or not. Less you say the less they have to work with. I know the feeling. Don\u2019t worry about the whole almost killing me thing. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve been so close to death. Though admittedly it was the first time I really thought I was going to die. Well see you later. Oh and might want to think about bringing something from home for lunch from now on. The food here isn\u2019t always edible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a grin and a wave before picking up her empty tray, tossing it in the trash before walking out the doors. Strange girl. Not everyday someone almost kills you and you shrug it off like it was nothing. If it had been me I probably would be plotting revenge as soon as I could. Perhaps that was what she was doing. Maybe that whole exchange was just some small piece of a master plan. I\u2019d have to be on my toes just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSeeing that the room was slowly starting to empty I assumed lunch was almost over. Quickly cleaning up I headed back to the classroom, taking my seat moments before the rest of the class came in. They all looked at me for a moment as I could almost see the thoughts going through their head. Some of them had already labeled me as a trouble maker and others were scheming as to how to buddy up to me because they saw me as strong. School was more about politics then anything else sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz came in with a smile and a nod of greeting which I returned. Our little silent exchange was not lost on the rest of the class as whispers began circulating. Those whispers died down though as soon the teacher entered the room. If the schedule was right this would be the second half of alchemy, hands on application. Mr. Yetz gave role call quickly before closing his book and addressing the room at large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe have a special guest today class. She is one of the top alchemist in the nation and she has graciously accepted our request to come teach you. She comes from a long line of Hunters. A tenth generation Hunter in fact \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo, it couldn\u2019t be. She wouldn\u2019t. Please don\u2019t let it be big sis Ulinia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease welcome Ulinia Zolkov!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe crowd began whispering excitedly but then looked around in confusion as no one entered the door. Of course she wouldn\u2019t do something as simple as walk through the door. She was a bit crazy after all. A plume of green smoke appeared in front of the desk suddenly and I resisted the urge to cover my face. Always the showoff with the grand entrances. The smoke rose up and thickened until my sister stepped out, throwing her hands wide to an applause only she heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer hair was colored blue and yellow today, and tied in a ponytail. Her shirt only had one long sleeve on it, the other one ripped off to showcase the tribal tattoo running from her wrist to her shoulder. She wore a pair of loose fitting jeans with bottles hanging all over them on spelled wire, the knees ripped to show her skin. She looked around the room at all the wide eyed faces and spotted me, her face splitting into a huge grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiki tiki!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe jumped onto the teachers table and lept towards me, running across the desks. I only had a second before she threw herself at me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI simply let her launch herself across the last two desks and over the two boys sitting there to wrap her arms around my neck. I suffered her rubbing her face against mine and kissing me on cheek and forehead. It wasn't like there was anything I could do after all. If I had tried to avoid her, we would have probably messed up the room and I would still end up in her clutches like this. She might have even used a potion to immobilize me. No point in make more of a scene then I already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh Riki tiki! I missed you so much! Why didn't you tell me you were coming to this school! Why are you even at this school my Riki tiki? I thought for sure mama and papa would have let you go slaying with them. Oh you would have loved the last job I was on! You've got to come with me next time! Say yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gritted my teeth as I peeled my sister away. She kept grabbing at me until I finally snagged one of the potions from her side and threw it in her face. She stiffened up like a board and fell over on her side. Bending down next to her I grabbed the antidote and dangled it over her head so she could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Sis. Get a hold of yourself. Remember where you are. In case you forgot I'm not the little boy you taught to make potions anymore. If you promise to behave yourself, I will give you the antidote. Blink twice if you understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked twice. I nodded and poured the green liquid that turned into smoke the moment it touched the air on her face.  She loosened up again and I helped her to her feet. She pouted, but I kept my face blank and stern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You big meanie! Doing that to your big sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah yeah, the same old song and dance with you. Don't you have a class to teach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me another pout which I ignored, only my mom seemed to have the ability to sway me with her pouts. Finally my sister sighed and turned away, allowing me to return to my seat, ignoring the stares of the rest of the class. Across the way Liz nodded knowingly, giving me a small sympathetic grin before turning her attention to the front of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"One of the biggest things you have to remember about Alchemy is the need to be exact in everything. I'm sure you heard it before but it needs to be said over and over. If the formula calls for the liquid to be at 22.3 degrees, it better not be one point over or under that mark or the whole thing can be ruined. That's not to say you can't find some unique potions on accident, but more often then not it will just fizzle, wasting all the time you spent on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued to give a few instructions before everyone began pulling out their mini chemistry labs. Since I didn't have one yet, I used one of the spares sitting along the back wall. While the rest of the class followed the instructions they were given, and Ulinia walked around pointing out tips to improve what they were doing, I quickly worked on my own. Not waiting to be told to add an ingredient or do any of the small stuff. I had a mid level potion of stasis and the antidote done by the time the rest of the class finished their health potions. When Ulinia came over to me I handed her both sealed vials.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"To replace what I used. I would have made high grade versions but I didn't have the supplies or the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes grew all huge and began to waver like she was going to cry. When she opened her arms to grab me up in a hug I held up my arm to hold her at arms length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Stop! Don't even think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer lower lip quivered slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Please? Just a little one? I need to fill up my tiki tank. It's only at half full right now since you stopped me earlier. I won't be home for a while so I need it to keep me going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I lowered my hand, feeling like a fool for doing so. She gave a small squeal of delight before throwing herself on me and rubbing against my face again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Thank you Riki! My tiki tank is at one hundred percent power now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard a few snickers and glared over her shoulder, which quieted them down. The bell rang and everyone began put away their kits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Gotta run! Give mom my love!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe dropped another transportation potion on the ground, stepping through the green mist after blowing me a kiss. I resisted the urge to rub my forehead as I picked up my bag and headed with the rest of the class towards the combat arenas. They kept glancing back at me and talking under their breath but I did my best not to notice. This was why I hadn't given my last name. I could already see the way things would go. Soon enough a few would approach me to be \"friends\" but in reality they wanted to use me or my family connections. It was just the nature of up and coming Hunter's trying to secure employment in the future at the best jobs they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n         \"So you're a tenth generation Zolkov huh? That explains a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"How'd you figure it out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I don't know, I'm a bit of a genius like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept my face a mask so she wouldn't see the grin trying to break through. She might still be an enemy. I couldn't let myself get too friendly with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You must have it harder then me. Especially with a sister like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"She's not that bad once you get to understand her. Personally, I think she's like that because she's sniffed a few too many of her concoctions. Maybe a potion gone wrong or something. But she's been that way ever since I can remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"So what is your first name anyway? As you figured I was asleep when you came in and no one talks to me. I really hope it isn't Riki tiki, otherwise I might not be able to keep a straight face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Riktal. And only my sister gets to call me that. I won't put up with anyone else using that name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked around to make sure no one was close enough to hear before leaning her head closer while talking in an undertone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My big brothers nickname for me is Lizzy Lili. I think it might be an older sibling thing to give embarrassing nicknames. Now you got leverage against me if I am ever tempted to use your pet name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's your angle anyway? You seem a little too friendly for someone I just stabbed a few hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe simply shrugged and kept walking next to me for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No angle. I told you not to worry about the whole stabbing thing didn't I? It's just-- it's been a long time since I had anyone I could really talk to about Hunter stuff. I'm not talking about schoolroom fluff or amateur stuff like where I want to go when I graduate. I'm talking about things someone from an old family would understand. Like the feeling of the first kill, what training was like and how you handled your first mistakes. It is kind of hard to explain because I'm not good with words but you understand right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Yeah I understand. You want to be able to talk about the hardships of being a fifth generation, always in someone else's shadow and the expectations of you. Just someone who understands where you are coming from and can make you feel better just by lending an ear without the judgments of those who don't know what it's like. In other words, a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What the hell. It's part of my punishment for stabbing you anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand and she shook it, looking at me a bit quizzically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Never mind, it's nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let go of my hand as we came to the arena and split to either side to gear up. It took only a moment to sit my bag in a locker for safekeeping and another to begin digging through it. My hand stopped as I realized I was missing a few weapons. Namely my Lexington double barrel revolver and my Roller Knuckles. Had I left them at home this morning? I wasn't sure. I thought I had packed them, but I had been in a rush. Could one of my new classmates have taken them? It was possible since I had left the bag unattended for lunch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI needed to get them back. They were dangerous weapons in the hands of someone unqualified in their use. But what was the best way to approach this problem? I wasn't even sure someone had taken them. If I told a teacher there was no telling when or if I would get them back. If I didn't get them back soon, there was no telling what damage someone might cause with them. It wasn't like I didn't trust the teacher's, but in this case quicker action might be better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI\u2019d already caused enough trouble for one day. It would be best if I simply informed one of the teachers and let them take care of it. I wasn\u2019t even sure if anyone had stolen them after all. I\u2019d keep my eyes and ears open of course, but it was best to let someone in authority handle the situation. Especially with my short temper, I was likely to do something I would end up regretting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo against my better judgment I took a moment to speak privately with the arena master. He assured me he would be on the lookout for anything suspicious and would pass the word on as well. I thanked him before double-checking that my locker was locked and heading out into the combat area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cToday will be slightly different. We won\u2019t be having sparring practice as normal. Today is a practical application day. You will be split up into five groups of four or five, you will work as a team to take down some monsters. Utilizing what you have learned and the skills you have gathered in hand to hand and weapons combat. These monsters have been deemed a sufficient test of your skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHawthrope! Zelkov! Since you two are already past this point you will sit out for now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI inclined my head to the arena master before climbing up into the bleachers around the large rectangular room. Liz was right behind me as a wall rose out of the floor to cut the room in half. Two of the chosen groups entered the rings as the remaining ones waited on the sidelines in excitement. The floor opened again and a Screecher Bird  came into view. I shook my head as one of the boys ran yelling headlong at the bird with his sword raised. Just as quickly he was flying through the air to land on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStupid. By this time they should know a Screecher reacts to loud noises by emitting a gust of wind from its wings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t tell me the first time you fought a real monster you forgot some of the basics of fighting them in the thrill of the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Liz and blinked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I didn\u2019t. My father tossed me up against a Gorpal giant as my first kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave a low whistle of appreciation. Gorpal giants were mean creatures that were as fast as they were strong. But they were dumb. Still one wrong move against one of them by a novice would turn you into red jelly slathered over their spiked clubs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI faced a Fabrooze my first time. The thrill went to my head and I blew it up with an explosive potion. It reconstructed itself, but not before eating my shirt and pants.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the thought of her fighting the thing in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou best not be thinking anything dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh no not me. I\u2019m imagining them clean and white.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe smacked me on the arm and I laughed while rubbing the spot. It hadn\u2019t been full force but it had a bit of bite to it. Finally she began to chuckle to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk so it wasn\u2019t my finest moment. And they were blue by the way not white.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make sure to keep that in mind for when I remember it in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of us watched as the first groups defeated their birds and the next groups stepped up to fight some Overloks, creatures that looked like five foot tall snakes with three heads. As they fought and surrounded the beast, the natural leaders began to stand out. They issued orders on the fly and changed up battle strategies with split second analysis of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally the three headed snakes were downed and the last group was stepping into the ring. So far it had taken each group about seven or eight minutes to kill their prey proving just how low their skill level was compared to mine. It would have taken me a minute or less for such weak creatures. As the last group got ready a Sengwen rose out of the floor, stomping its front hoof menacingly. The silver talon on the other five shone evilly under the light as its human torso and arms flexed in anticipation. The horses head looked around with beady intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis group must be slightly better then the last four. That\u2019s a step above the other monsters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I just hope they don\u2019t do something stupid like use magic on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou think they would?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGregory might. Just to make it transform and try to show off. He\u2019d get his arms handed back to him separated from his body of course, but he\u2019s the type who doesn\u2019t know when he is outmatched, always trying to prove something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe one she pointed out as Gregory pulled something from behind his back and aimed it at the creature. I jumped to my feet in surprise, pointing my finger at him. He had my gun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t fire that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEither my words didn\u2019t reach his ears or they came too late, I wasn\u2019t sure which one. I could almost see everything happening in slow motion. The bullet exited the bottom barrel as a line of magic left the top. The magic enfolded the bullet , creating a green shroud that would amplify the speed and force of the shot. As the bullet moved forward Gregory was lifted of his feet and thrown backwards by the force of the kickback. As he came down the bullet struck the Sengwen square in the chest. It soaked up the magic which had been increased by the power from the bullet as the projectile stopped as if it had hit an invisible wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already moving as the slug dropped to the ground without doing any damage. The beast glowing with the green magic it had just absorbed. Vaulting over the side of the banister onto the wall I watched the beast closely. I felt Liz\u2019s presence right behind me as we ran towards the creature. It grew another set of arms and the mouth opened as the human like teeth turned into green tipped fangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI got the head. You get the backside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRoger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leapt off the wall with Liz a second behind me. As I spun to the right I imbued my legs with magic for extra strength. External magic was useless against these creatures, it only made them stronger. My right leg shot out and connected with the side of its head just as Liz\u2019s left foot smashed into its flank on the other side. It twisted and crumpled under our attack, falling on its side and skidding along the ground. But that wouldn\u2019t stop it for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDashing over to Gregory I yanked the weapon from his hand, giving him a look that could have made steel instantly combust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you later idiot. Just answer yes or no. Do you have my knuckles to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook his head quickly, pointing to another boy close by. I held out my hands and the boy pulled the weapons out so fast I thought his hands would detach from his arms. Snatching them off of him with a growl I pointed to the arena master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll of you go! Get out of here now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey ran like bats out of hell as the Sengwen began clambering to it\u2019s feet, its now black talons leaving gouges in the cement floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLiz you know how to use these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe saw the knuckles and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell enough. Never actually had a pair but I know the basics.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI handed them to her and she put them on quickly. They had mini circular saw blades inset into the knuckles that would spin when activated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSwitch is in the palm, just clench the fist and they start up. Keep them loose until impact to save on magic usage. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou flank right I go left. I\u2019ll grab its attention first. Switch up when his eyes change color.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe split up, going our respective direction as I hit the switch on my Lexington to stop the magic from flowing out when I fired. Five bullets. More than enough, I only needed three. As the creature began to turn towards Liz I fired a round, smacking it between the eyes. The bullet didn\u2019t even make a dent since it was using the magic it had stolen to become almost invulnerable until it ran out. But I was just buying time. Physical attacks would chip away at that stolen magic until it could be killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI dodged in and out of its swipes, blocking it\u2019s claws with my weapon and keeping it\u2019s attention on me while Liz went to town with the gloves. Jumping over the hind legs when they kicked out, as well as keeping out of reach of the tail that would feel like a whip. The eyes began to flicker from red to blue as the stolen energy began to fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSwitch!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe leapt into the air, coming back down with her right fist leading. I saw the blades spinning as she gave them juice seconds before smashing into the side of the creatures face. I was already  rolling backwards out of the way so the beast would focus on her as the primary and closest target. Blood flew everywhere as they ripped through the flesh of its cheek. When it\u2019s two arms swiped at her she twisted in the air, punching down with her left fist to tear up the flesh while she avoided the attack. While it was turning I launched myself forward, hooking the neck as I swung around over its back, the Lexington in my left hand. As I came around the other side I shoved the gun into the open mouth and fired off two shots up into its brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI landed on my feet as it fell to the ground, dissolving into thin air and leaving a pouch behind. Bending down I grabbed the spoils and opened it up. Inside was a rare heart crystal. I knew a few dealers that would pay good money or even trade high quality weapons for this little thing. They were used to store magic for artifacts and weapons. Liz pulled off the gloves, handing them back to me as the arena master came running up with the rest of the class.</span></div></div>",

But those are worth a small fortune! Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you did most of the work. I just kept it\u2019s attention, you beat its shield down. Think of it as my sign of friendship. If you don\u2019t know anyone who will give you a good deal I can introduce you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought we were already friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe. But now I know I can trust you. My uncle Parlin used to say, you can get a feel for the true nature of a person once you fight beside them. I\u2019ll stick by that. So take it, I really don\u2019t need it. If you really don\u2019t want it or can\u2019t use it I\u2019ll keep it. No use wasting a good heart crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stared at it a moment longer before finally palming it with a soft thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you mean what you said about knowing a good broker?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. If you want I can introduce him to you after school. He\u2019s been a friend of the family for years. He\u2019s the one that made me these Spinning Knuckles. You would be amazed at the things he can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave her a quick smile before turning my gaze on the two boys that had stolen my gear. The grin withered from my lips as my blood began to boil. I felt my fist clench and my teeth begin to hurt from clamping them together so hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master. Am I wrong to believe that stealing another students gear is a grave offence at this school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, you aren\u2019t wrong. Each students gear is like a part of themselves. We don\u2019t tolerate such things lightly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen would I be out of line to wish to punish them myself? More importantly, would I be able to without breaking any school rules?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNormally not. But right now you are in the arena. This is my domain and my decisions supersede even that of the principals in this area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen do I have your permission to give them a good thumping if I promise not to kill them or dismember them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly if you agree to two other conditions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t break more than three bones and you use no cutting weapons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEasily agreed. Since I am much better than them, I don\u2019t mind if they use any weapons of their choice. I\u2019ll stick with my own fists and feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGregory and the other boy I still did not know the name of were both shaking in their boots. Holding up their hands and shaking their heads in negation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook sorry ok! I don\u2019t want no trouble. I don\u2019t want to fight you. Just let us go ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry! It was all Gregory\u2019s idea! I didn\u2019t want to but he talked me into it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFirst Hunters code, all Hunters are responsible for his or her own actions. No one forces you to do anything. Each choice made is a choice the individual makes of his own will. You allowed him to talk you into it. That means you are just as guilty. And quite frankly I don\u2019t care if you are sorry or not, or if you don\u2019t want to fight or not. You don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lunged forward, snagging them both up by the collar and throwing them behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master, please box us in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the class backed away as the Arena Master manipulated an artifact in his hand. Four walls rose around us, turning as clear as glass once they were in place. I simply stood there watching the two after sitting my gear down against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChoose your weapons. I\u2019m sure the good Master will be able to provide them for you. I won\u2019t start until you make your decision and I won\u2019t allow you to leave until I beat the snot out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a bit more sniveling the one named Gregory asked for a standard sword and board set up. A simple long sword and large circular buckler that attached to the arm and unfolded like a fan appeared from the floor. The other boy got a quick load repeating crossbow that used magic arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBefore we begin, what\u2019s your name boy? It\u2019s only proper to know who it is I am going to pound into the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I\u2019m Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPleasure to meet you Daniel. Consider me a monster and give me everything you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I began walking towards them. Not even trying to be quick. Daniel fired an arrow at me that I simply sidestepped. It had been halfhearted to begin with. After a moment Gregory charged at me with his shield up and his sword raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe feinted with the sword and tried to smash the shield into my face but the move was clumsy. He had put too much commitment into the feint, making him go off balance. Twisting to the left was all it took to avoid the sword strike. Daniel was hesitating because I was so close to his partner, a grievous mistake if I had really been a monster. As I walked past, I smashed my elbow into the side of Gregory\u2019s head, continuing to head towards the shooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn a real fight where they knew what they were doing, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad setup. A ranged person being protected by a shield bearer. But right now they were running on fear. Their training and strategy had gone out the window. I made sure to keep myself between the crossbow and the tank. That was all it took to keep him from shooting at me. I gave an evil grin as I slowly got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe finally took another shot when I was almost at point blank range. I saw his finger twitch, that was what I had actually been staring at the whole time. So I knew when it would fire. I did a split, letting it sail harmlessly over my head. Popping back to my feet and continuing to take deliberate steps towards him without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCrossbow wasn\u2019t a bad choice, but you are inexperienced at it, I can tell. You should have got something you knew how to use. It wouldn\u2019t have done you any good of course, but at least you wouldn\u2019t be so far out of your element.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slapped the crossbow out of his hands negligently as I cocked my fist back. His eyes went wide in fright as I dropped to one knee and spun, bringing my fist up into Gregory\u2019s stomach under his sword strike. Spittle went flying from his mouth as the sword clattered to the ground and he fell to his knees clutching his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on. Did you really think I didn\u2019t know you were sneaking up behind me? It was a good try though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned around I brought my other fist up into Daniel\u2019s gut, making him vomit a bit as he sank to the floor.</span></div></div>",

To touch someone else's property without permission and then to use it as if it was their own! Not even caring that the very person they stole it from was in the very same room as them! I should kill them. They deserved to die. a good solid kick augmented with magic strength would take their heads right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I had promised not to kill them or dismember them. I was allowed to break a few bones though. Three of them each. The thumbs of each hand at least, and maybe a leg bone. That would teach them. I looked down at the two rolling and moaning on the ground. They looked pitiful. Hardly Hunter material. They looked like to normal people I might find on the street on any given day. Seeing that my anger drifted away as suddenly as it had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master! Drop the walls please. I\u2019m done. They are too weak for me to even stay angry at. Punishing them just isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the walls started to lower I turned, grabbing up my gear and leaving the arena. I was already regretting my hasty action. I knew I was stronger then them. What had that really proved? It had just been me soothing my own rage. Hunter\u2019s weren\u2019t supposed to act like this, they were heroes of the people, protecting those weaker then them. There was enough problems with monsters, people didn\u2019t need to be fighting each other, isn\u2019t that what aunt Ceflia had said? Plus I had to uphold the family name. Even if I didn\u2019t like that name, what I did reflected on the rest of my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBig sis could get away with having such a unique personality because she produced results. And while quirky, her personality didn\u2019t really hurt anyone unlike mine. Compared to everyone else in the family, I was just a no name Zelkov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat on the bench, pulling my glasses off my face and rubbing my eyes. Why did I have to be born like this anyway? I was trying to change, I really was. I didn\u2019t want to be the terror of the school this time. The one everyone feared to cross and was looked at like some super powerful monster. But it seemed that personality kept creeping in, no matter what I did. Any good deeds I did or gestures of peace I made would be overshadowed by my rash actions. I would probably be doomed to repeat the same actions over and over so why should I fight it? If I was meant to be some sort of monster who was I to go against that fate?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReplacing my glasses on my nose I stuffed the recovered weapons back into my duffle bag. I had to go back out there. Class wasn\u2019t over yet and I couldn\u2019t make more of a scene then I already had. I had a duty to uphold the family name after all. With a deep breath I let the mask of indifference I had learned to wear drop over my face and returned to the arena, climbing up into the bleachers as unobtrusively as I could. The groups were still sparring against monsters, but there was a bit more caution in their movements now. Liz gave me a small smile as I sat down next to her before returning her attention to the floor below. We sat in a companionable silence for a bit, neither one of us feeling the need to break it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I probably would have done the same thing. I think you did good. You gave them enough of a beating that they will remember, without going overboard compared to their skill level. You didn\u2019t do anything super crazy or act in any way they couldn\u2019t counter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional. I wasn\u2019t even thinking of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I didn\u2019t think you were. You kind of remind me of my aunt Winny. She would get angry at the drop of a hat and act on it. Then it would all sort of disappear in an instant and she regretted what she did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh and what did she do about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. She just accepted she was wired differently than everyone else and went on with her life. Did what she felt like doing and let her anger make her stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo where is she now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDead. She had a bad break up with one of her lovers. She got angry and chased after him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe was stronger than her and killed her huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. she massacred him and his new girlfriend as well as his parents. So my mom and dad put her down themselves. She had become a danger to the family and our name.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. That story gives me so much confidence in my own future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry. Guess it was a bad example. But I get the feeling you want to change the way people see you. Curb that anger like my aunt wanted to learn to do before she just accepted it as part of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got the right feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you will succeed where she failed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got something she didn\u2019t have. A friend who\u2019s willing to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe didn\u2019t have anyone who tried to help her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe did. But she wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe lapsed into silence again as the groups continued to rotate out against different monsters. Sometimes the members changed or the rules did but otherwise it was all basic procedure. I looked at Liz through the corner of my eye. A friend huh? I\u2019d never really had a friend before. I had spent all my time learning the arts of monster slaying from day one. The only people my own age I had interacted with were cousins who were also in the family business. None of them acted like these high school kids who seemed to think this was all a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first five years after they graduated would be the hardest time for them. As they ended up putting into application everything they learned here and came to realize it wasn\u2019t a game. Out of the twenty boys and girls I saw below me at least half of them would be dead before the first five years was up. The ones that past that first five year hurdle had a good chance of reaching old age. Yet despite all the warnings they received when they entered the academy they all seemed to think it didn\u2019t apply to them. They all seemed to think they were immortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe claw marks on my back ached at that thought. I had learned that lesson the hard way. Even I had been like them once, thinking I was immortal. Thinking I was different because I had received such intensive training. The Bulabear had surprised and almost killed me. If big sis Ulinia hadn\u2019t been there I would have died. Perhaps that\u2019s why I had such a low tolerance for these people. Because they wouldn\u2019t listen. They continued to act like they were regular high school kids in a regular high school. Going star eyed over a pretty face and acting all giddy around the person they liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaybe it was because I had never been in love before. I knew the principal of it. The feelings I was supposed to have. It had been part of my lessons in understanding my own reactions that my mother and father had taught me. But that had been so I could lock it down or ignore it and do my job as a Hunter. If I let my emotions carry me away in the middle of a battle I could wind up dead. Sacrificing your own emotions or someone you are trying to protect or care about was also part of monster slaying sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I glanced at Liz again while pushing my glasses back up my nose. She was pretty enough. I could feel the attraction of my body, but the desire was only a small part. The primal instinct of the human body in that respect. It didn\u2019t affect any decisions I made concerning her or my reasons for thinking of her as a friend. Besides, I couldn\u2019t fall in love with her anyway, I had to marry for the good of the family. Being from old blood was more political hassle than anything else sometimes. My mother would probably try to get me to go to another arranged marriage meeting soon. I had shot down the last three and avoided the first two, but sooner or later I would be pressured into making a commitment. When that time came I wasn\u2019t sure what I would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere something on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou keep looking at me, so is there something you want to ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I was just thinking you were pretty that\u2019s all. And not understanding how everyone seems to act like normal high school students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. For calling me pretty I mean. But I\u2019m not interested in a romantic relationship with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wasn\u2019t proposing one. Just making an observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured. You probably have to marry for the family like me. I was just making sure we were clear. But for the record, I think you are pretty handsome as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. But I\u2019m not interested in a romantic relationship with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust making an observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me and I grinned back. This really wasn\u2019t so bad, having someone like me who knew where I was coming from without me having to explain myself. Who didn\u2019t misunderstand anything I said that might sound misleading or suspect. Maybe I really could make a fresh start here. And maybe I could control my anger if she was there to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang, signaling the end of period. I gave Liz a wave as we split again to go back to the locker rooms. Grabbing my bag out of the locker I headed for the classroom alone. Next group was history. I didn\u2019t think I would get into any trouble there, but I had to be on the lookout just in case. Clamping down on any urges to make a scene I might have. I was a Zelkov after all.</span></div></div>",

Curb that anger like my aunt wanted to learn to do before she just accepted it as part of her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got the right feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m sure you will succeed where she failed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got something she didn\u2019t have. A friend who\u2019s willing to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe didn\u2019t have anyone who tried to help her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe did. But she wouldn\u2019t let them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe lapsed into silence again as the groups continued to rotate out against different monsters. Sometimes the members changed or the rules did but otherwise it was all basic procedure. I looked at Liz through the corner of my eye. A friend huh? I\u2019d never really had a friend before. I had spent all my time learning the arts of monster slaying from day one. The only people my own age I had interacted with were cousins who were also in the family business. None of them acted like these high school kids who seemed to think this was all a game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first five years after they graduated would be the hardest time for them. As they ended up putting into application everything they learned here and came to realize it wasn\u2019t a game. Out of the twenty boys and girls I saw below me at least half of them would be dead before the first five years was up. The ones that past that first five year hurdle had a good chance of reaching old age. Yet despite all the warnings they received when they entered the academy they all seemed to think it didn\u2019t apply to them. They all seemed to think they were immortal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe claw marks on my back ached at that thought. I had learned that lesson the hard way. Even I had been like them once, thinking I was immortal. Thinking I was different because I had received such intensive training. The Bulabear had surprised and almost killed me. If big sis Ulinia hadn\u2019t been there I would have died. Perhaps that\u2019s why I had such a low tolerance for these people. Because they wouldn\u2019t listen. They continued to act like they were regular high school kids in a regular high school. Going star eyed over a pretty face and acting all giddy around the person they liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaybe it was because I had never been in love before. I knew the principal of it. The feelings I was supposed to have. It had been part of my lessons in understanding my own reactions that my mother and father had taught me. But that had been so I could lock it down or ignore it and do my job as a Hunter. If I let my emotions carry me away in the middle of a battle I could wind up dead. Sacrificing your own emotions or someone you are trying to protect or care about was also part of monster slaying sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I glanced at Liz again while pushing my glasses back up my nose. She was pretty enough. I could feel the attraction of my body, but the desire was only a small part. The primal instinct of the human body in that respect. It didn\u2019t affect any decisions I made concerning her or my reasons for thinking of her as a friend. Besides, I couldn\u2019t fall in love with her anyway, I had to marry for the good of the family. Being from old blood was more political hassle than anything else sometimes. My mother would probably try to get me to go to another arranged marriage meeting soon. I had shot down the last three and avoided the first two, but sooner or later I would be pressured into making a commitment. When that time came I wasn\u2019t sure what I would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere something on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou keep looking at me, so is there something you want to ask?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I was just thinking you were pretty that\u2019s all. And not understanding how everyone seems to act like normal high school students.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. For calling me pretty I mean. But I\u2019m not interested in a romantic relationship with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wasn\u2019t proposing one. Just making an observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured. You probably have to marry for the family like me. I was just making sure we were clear. But for the record, I think you are pretty handsome as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. But I\u2019m not interested in a romantic relationship with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust making an observation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned at me and I grinned back. This really wasn\u2019t so bad, having someone like me who knew where I was coming from without me having to explain myself. Who didn\u2019t misunderstand anything I said that might sound misleading or suspect. Maybe I really could make a fresh start here. And maybe I could control my anger if she was there to help me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang, signaling the end of period. I gave Liz a wave as we split again to go back to the locker rooms. Grabbing my bag out of the locker I headed for the classroom alone. Next group was history. I didn\u2019t think I would get into any trouble there, but I had to be on the lookout just in case. Clamping down on any urges to make a scene I might have. I was a Zelkov after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe bell rang and the teacher left, meaning there was only one more class before this day was finally over. But as soon as he walked out the door the talking started. People moved into their own little groups and talked about some of the most unimportant things, like their favorite band, or which boy or girl was cuter. A few brave souls approached me cautiously, I could see they had already formed an opinion of me but still wanted to be associated with my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo it\u2019s really true? You\u2019re from the Zelkov family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat gave it away? My sister or the Arena Master belting it out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhy did they have to ask such stupid questions they already knew the answer to? Did they think they were somehow being clever? The girl who had asked the question sort of looked around for support from her friends at my answer. Finding none, she gave a smile I\u2019m sure was meant to be charming and continued on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name\u2019s Izabelle. I\u2019m a second generation Hunter on my mom\u2019s side. I\u2019d love it if you could teach me how to be a better Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can teach you something right now. Dedicate your everything to being a Hunter. Act as if every decision you make, ever small thing you learn is crucial. Because it is. This is your life on the line. If you think you are in this for glory, or honor, fame and fortune, then you are dead. Those things are simply side effects of your true purpose. Becoming strong enough to protect the regular people from monsters. If you want to become a top rate hunter you throw everything else away until you accomplish that. Relationships? No need for them. Keeping up to date on the current trends or famous people? Unimportant. Quit treating this as a game. This is your life. You eat, sleep, and breath being a Hunter. Anything less and you will be dead before you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs her smile faded one of the boys next to her grinned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on quit scaring the poor girl! It\u2019s not that bad. My dad\u2019s a Hunter too and he\u2019s not that serious about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Hunter is the first line of defense for a town and a town is only as strong as the Hunter\u2019s willing to protect it. One person alone cannot protect a city this size, no matter how good they are. But as Hunter\u2019s we must also be strong enough to take up the load of others when they are injured or killed. You don\u2019t get that strength by doing things halfway. You must be ready to lay down your life and sacrifice yourself and your body at any moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s right. Just as there are all different types of regular people with different strength\u2019s and weaknesses, there are all different levels of Hunter\u2019s. If you want to be the best, you got to work for it. Giving up everything else in the process. You become hard and you learn the meaning of pain. You learn to ignore it and surpass it. That is what it takes to be a top notch slayer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe few gathered around me turned in surprise as Liz came up to stand next to me. Apparently they weren\u2019t used to her interacting with anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. We did it. What we know is what you are supposed to be learning here. So quit treating it like a normal school and grow up already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore they had a chance to say anything else the teacher came in, forcing everyone to return to their seats. He took role call quickly before starting in on the strengths and weaknesses of different monsters. He was just getting into strategies that could be used against the Cawmacaw when the door opened and a woman in a business suit, thin wire framed glasses and neat black hair came in. She whispered something to the teacher and he nodded his head before pointing at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! You\u2019re wanted by your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I grabbed my bag and headed out the door with the woman. What did my mother want now? Couldn\u2019t it have waited until I got home at least? The clacking of her high heels echoed down the hallway as she walked at my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Inga by the way, one of your mother\u2019s aides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not going to see you all that often and you don\u2019t work for me. I don\u2019t need to know your name for you to do your job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInga fell silent again, escorting me to a private room where she asked me to sit down. I ignored the invitation, instead standing by the window and looking outside. What was my mother up to? Where was she anyway? It was unlike her to be late for a meeting that she herself had set up. I heard the door open finally and turned with a few choice words on my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWords which died out as the small white haired girl with red eyes came in the door after my mother. She stood barely four and a half feet tall and had a body like a stick. She carried around a teddy bear in one hand and had a look of perpetual vacant eyed dreaminess on her face. There was a perfectly logical and reasonable explanation for this. She would not have pulled me out of class on my first day for a marriage meeting. Inside the school no less. Even she wouldn\u2019t do something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling! How are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe same as when I left this morning mother. Care to tell me why you wanted to see me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you be a dear and marry this poor child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sucked in a breath, counting to ten. It was a joke, it had to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re telling me you pulled me out of class just for this? Granted I wasn\u2019t thrilled to come to school to begin with but I would think you had more sense then this. So I\u2019m leaving now mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I started to push past her she grabbed me by the arm, her grip much stronger then she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait dear! What\u2019s your answer! You must answer the poor thing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll let you guess at my answer, you got two tries, and one of them isn\u2019t yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe laid her hand against her cheek while sighing dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh dear. I was afraid you\u2019d say something like that. It breaks my heart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer grip tightened as her voice lowered while flinging me back into the room like a toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow sit down, we need to talk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRubbing my arm and using a bit of healing magic, I pulled out a chair with my foot before sitting down in it. My mother and the girl sat across the table from me. The little girl still dreamy eyed and hugging her stuffed animal while my mother had her Hunter face on. The one that said she was being totally serious now and not playing games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t a marriage meeting. I was just teasing you a bit. The real meeting is in a week and you will be attending. I won\u2019t let you duck out of it like you did the last one. You can\u2019t keep shirking this issue. You need to make a decision soon. There aren\u2019t many more eligible girls left of the proper lineage you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust shut up and get on with it mother. I don\u2019t need the lecture. You give it to me often enough and like every other time you are saying nothing new. If this isn\u2019t about marriage then what is it about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWatch your tongue or I\u2019ll give you a thrashing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe so, but I\u2019ll give as good as I get. You know how good I am, you trained me after all. Plus I really don\u2019t care all that much about the family name. What will people think if the two of us start going at it and destroying this school building? Perhaps get a few innocent people caught in the crossfire? What will they say about the Zelkov\u2019s then if a few people got killed and a building destroyed over a small family squabble huh? So enough with the friendly threats mother. Let\u2019s get down to business. You got on your work face right now, well then so do I.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpoken like a true Zelkov. Very well. I got a job for you. Protecting Asala here. Me and your father can\u2019t ,we were contracted to clear out some caverns in Bornica, we won\u2019t be back for a few days. Your sister is on a job now for the military so probably wont be back for a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy me? I\u2019m sure there are other Hunter\u2019s that are qualified for a simple job like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you are a Zelkov. I trust you and as you said, I know how skilled you are. Plus, despite how bad you are with most people, I also know you do well with children. You\u2019re right there are other qualified hunters, but not many I would trust with this task. Especially once they found out what she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd that is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA monster summoner. You know as well as I those with the cursed magic aren\u2019t looked upon kindly even in the best circumstances. It doesn\u2019t matter to most people, Hunters included, if they can control the monsters they summon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s the catch?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe catch is she can\u2019t always control the monsters\u2019 she summons. She hasn\u2019t fully grown into her power yet because it awakened early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer parents?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDead. Murdered in front of her. That\u2019s why her power awakened. It will only be for a few days. I\u2019ve got a friend who is also a summoner willing to take her in but she won\u2019t be able to get away from her work until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLikelihood of danger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDirect threats to her life is minimal. Mostly you will be needed in case she summons a monster that she can\u2019t control. It happens more when she is emotionally unstable, fear, intense sadness, that kind of thing. Plus any dangers once people find out what she can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is no one else you trust to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell\u2026 there is one other person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why come to me first? Especially when you were the one who wanted me to come to school and not work as a Hunter. I mean I assume this is going to be a round the clock thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother was quiet a moment, staring at the tabletop before looking back up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you\u2019re family.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Finally I rubbed my eyes and folded my hands on the table, staring back into my mother\u2019s brown orbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how much am I getting paid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou won\u2019t do this out of the kindness of your heart?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease. I\u2019d never make it as a Hunter if I gave away freebies. You came making an official request for my help. So I expect you to pay me for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a tight lipped smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my boy. How does a new set of armor sound?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow does ten thousand Reul sound? That\u2019s comparable to what a new set of good armor would cost but I can spend it how I want. I\u2019d ask more but this is my first official mission and I\u2019m not technically a licensed Hunter yet thanks to a certain someone telling me I couldn\u2019t take the official test. Personally I think it\u2019s a small price to pay for around the clock protection for at least two days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal. But only if you continue to attend school as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally! You really won\u2019t let me cut for two days or so! That means I\u2019ll have to bring her with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my offer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I  rubbed my temple I saw the little girl squeeze her teddy bear a little tighter. It wasn\u2019t much, but it was the first sign she had shown that she heard our conversation. Damn my mother. She was right about me having a knack with little children. Lord knows why they liked and trusted me, especially when I couldn\u2019t even get along with most people my own age. That small sign of fear swayed me and I let out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. You\u2019ve got yourself a deal. I still expect my allowance this month though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAww, Riktal darling! You\u2019re going to break your poor mother\u2019s purse!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m in tears over here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got to my feet and shook my mother\u2019s hand to seal the deal. I had enough of my allowance left over to take care of any needs for now. Plus I had my small emergency stash saved up if I really needed it. Two or three days shouldn\u2019t be too hard. My mother came around the table and grabbed me up in a hug, kissing both cheeks before saying she had to run. Her aide Inga detached herself from the wall and headed for the door after my mother. Before they got far I quickly called after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSis said to give you her love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blew me a final kiss before the door closed on her. With that I turned my attention to the girl who was still sitting there in a silence that was starting to get creepy. I sat in the chair next to her as I saw her arms tighten around the bear again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo your name is Asala huh? It\u2019s a pretty name. mind telling me how old you are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNothing. Not even a peep. Not a blink of the eyes or a turn of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJudging by your size and your face, my guess is maybe ten or eleven? Have any likes or dislikes? Favorite foods?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill silence. I could see why my mother had wanted to give her to me. She didn\u2019t do well with the quiet types. This girls silence probably unnerved her. And most Hunters I knew would get angry quickly at not getting answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to talk. Perhaps you can\u2019t talk. But right now what\u2019s most important is that I get you to trust me. If I\u2019m going to do my job effectively I need you to let me know if anything is wrong. Even if I don\u2019t perceive anything wrong, what\u2019s important is if you perceive trouble. Because if you do, that might scare you and make your power go out of control. Something we really don\u2019t want to happen now do we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI laid my hands on the table, resting my head on top of them and looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have a cousin who doesn\u2019t talk. He used to, but someone blew up his house because they had a grudge against his dad. His mom and dad died, so he lives with another cousin now. But the explosion took his voice away. Not like he can speak if he really wants to took his voice away, but it messed up his throat. I talk to him using my hands and fingers. We spent hours upon hours together coming up with words so we can communicate. He could write what he wanted down of course, but where\u2019s the fun in that he had said. It made him feel better when he talked with his hands. Said it made him feel more normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lifted my head and moved my hands until I was walking two fingers along the back of my right hand in front of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis was our word for walk. And this is eat, and this is sleep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI mimed poking out my eyes with my left hand before making a wiping motion across my mouth with my pointing finger, finally shoving my fingers in my ears and twisting them back and forth while raising and lowering my eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd that was our special code for I have a secret I\u2019ll tell you if you promise to keep it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave her a lopsided grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was a work in progress and we couldn\u2019t think up a better name for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave a small smile in return and my grin grew. It wasn\u2019t much but it was a start. I looked both ways as if making sure the room was still empty before repeating the motions that I had a secret, raising my eyebrow as I turned my head to the side and gave her a wink. At first I didn\u2019t think she would respond but finally she nodded her head. I leaned a bit closer and lowered my voice conspiratorially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDespite how I look and act I really love my family. Even when they act all crazy like. I don\u2019t mind when my big sister fawns all over me, or when my mother acts all lovey-dovey. Or when my father challenges me to \u201cmanly\u201d games like who can lift the most weight. Sometimes I even let him win so he doesn\u2019t feel bad that he is getting old. But most of all, I like stuffed animals. I have a secret box of them in my closet my family doesn\u2019t know about. There is just something about being able to squeeze them that feels so good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put my finger to my lip and made a shushing sound before looking around again suspiciously. She blinked and for the first time her eyes lost that faraway look as she giggled at my antics. Finally she looked around the room herself before mimicking my motions. I nodded my head that I would keep the secret and she leaned forward just like I had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI miss my mom and dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe put her finger to her lips before her eyes started to tear up. I pulled her into my arms and rocked her back and forth letting her cry herself out. Whispering that I knew she did softly. Finally she stopped crying and I pushed her away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBetter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head with another small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell if you ever want to talk or just have a shoulder to cry on you come see me ok? Maybe when we get back to the house I can show you my collection of stuffed animals. I think I have a little blue rabbit with your name on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding up I offered her my hand. She took it a bit hesitantly as the bell rang signaling the end of school. I picked up my bag and headed for the door. As I opened it I remembered my promise to take Liz to see my broker friend. But protecting this girl was my job. If I wandered around town too much with her in tow it would put her in danger, increasing the chances of triggering her power, putting the citizens in danger from an out of control monster. But I had also been taught to never break promises if I could help it.</span></div></div>",

Because in the end a Hunter had only his word to bind him. A customer or a broker or even an ordinary citizen could trust a Hunter almost instantly because of that fact alone. They gave hope when it was needed most to people who couldn\u2019t defend themselves against attack. I couldn\u2019t prove my words false, especially not to another Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, you don\u2019t mind if  we take a small side trip through town do you? I made a promise to someone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe squeezed my hand a bit while shaking her head no. With that bit of assurance I headed towards the classroom, finding Liz just as she was leaving. She looked down at the girl holding onto my hand and back at me with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA job. You ready to meet my friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sure? If you are on a job I can wait until another day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s no problem. And Asala here doesn\u2019t mind, she already said so. Might do her some good to get some fresh air and see a bit of the town.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz shrugged in a \u201cif you say so\u201d sort of way, trusting I knew what I was doing. We walked out of the school after stopping at her locker for just a moment. Most of my stuff was in my bag as I hadn\u2019t been assigned a locker yet so there were no problems there. People looked at us sideways as we left the building. Mostly they were staring at me and the little girl I had in tow. Her hand squeezed mine as she sidled closer to my leg, trying to hide from the looks. I squeezed back to let her know I was right here, which seemed to give her some confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was about a ten minute walk from the school where we talked about random things like the methods used to train us and weapons we were proficient in. I wondered if my mother would mind if I drove the car to school the next few days to increase security on Asala. Well whether she minded or not I thought it best to just go ahead and do it. She had left the girl in my care after all, she couldn\u2019t complain about how I chose to do my job. As we turned the corner in the middle of town I opened the door to the Pasta Palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour guy works in a restaurant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. But this is where you can be sure to find him every day at this time. He orders the stuffed \u2018shrooms in sauce with a side of linguino every day as a late lunch. He won\u2019t admit it but he comes here because he likes the waitress. Thinks she is too young for him though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNerval saw me and waived, beckoning me over as he stabbed another mushroom and ate it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! Haven\u2019t seen you around for a while! Thought you fell off the map after you helped me out with that Wippal infestation I had. Saved me a bit of money you did. Who\u2019s this? Don\u2019t tell me you gone and finally got yourself a wife and kid!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Nerval. I got in my secret time machine and went back through time, found the fountain of youth and drank from it before zipping ahead to the future. I then settled down and got married after giving her some of the magical water. We have since been living happily raising our daughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot any of it left? I\u2019d pay top dollar for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, I think I poured the last of it down the sink at home yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe let out a laugh as he shook my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what can I do for you? Got some business with me I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy friend here acquired a heart crystal. Told her you were the best I knew and would give her top price for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at Liz who gave a small bow of the head while reaching into her pocket. She handed the item over into his waiting palm and he grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s right. I might cheat a few other Hunters out of a few coins but I know my merchandise. Riktal\u2019s one of the good ones. He may act a bit standoffish but he is ok in my book. And if he vouches for you, then you got my seal of approval as well. What\u2019s your name lass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLiz Hawthrope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHawthrope huh? As in Wilson Hawthrope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeard good things about him. He\u2019s another good one. Never dealt with him though, but a  cousin of mine in the big city has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNerval pulled out a magnifying glass that he stuck over his eye and looked at the crystal, turning it over and over in his hand while running his fingers around it. He pulled a small hammer out of nowhere and tapped it lightly while holding it to his ear. He even licked it, cocking his head to the side while examining the taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell It\u2019s a good one. Not super high quality but still high grade. Come from a Sengwen or some comparable level monster I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen Liz nodded in surprise Nerval continued with a knowing wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFigured. It has the unique taste of stolen magic mixed with horse musk. Well right offhand without weighing it properly or running a conduit test on it, I\u2019d say I can give you seven thousand Reul for it. Or I will trade a weapon worth that much from my shop. If you want me to make you something with it I\u2019ll go up to five thousand, the extra two being my work fee. But if you go with having me make a weapon out of it I can guarantee it will be worth losing out on the extra two thousand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe does good work. I\u2019ll attest to that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNerval handed the crystal back to Liz who put it back in her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you want to check around for a better offer be my guest. Or you can stop by my store next door for a more thorough evaluation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll do that, thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy pleasure Miss Hawthrope. Feel free to bring me any other business you want. I\u2019m sure if I don\u2019t have it I can get it for you. And try to keep this guy out of trouble would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe gave another wave as we turned and left the building. I pointed out his shop to her as we passed, proving it really was literally right next door. She thanked me again for the introduction before saying she needed to get going. I said my farewells as she crossed the street, jogging off out of sight. Asala gave my hand a slight yank and I looked down at her. She was holding her stomach, making me wonder what was wrong when I heard it growl. I gave her a small grin as I gripped her hand a bit tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou hungry huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a slight nod in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then lets get something to eat. You want to find a restaurant or wait until we get home and I will make you something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sort of shrunk into herself when I mentioned eating out, but if I knew little kids they normally couldn\u2019t hold off on eating. She didn\u2019t answer either way so I assumed her reticence at eating out was because she was afraid of people. It seemed like the decision was up to me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tEating out was quicker and it would do her some good. Let her interact with other people and show her not everyone was scary. I was here to protect her in case anything happened and her power went out of control. With that in mind I lead her to a nearby restaurant, letting her order whatever she wanted. The place wasn\u2019t as secure as I could wish and a bit busier than I\u2019d prefer, but my initial threat assessment was low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she began eating I studied her closely. Her green dress really was very unflattering the more I looked at it. With its almost puke shading. Her clothes looked a bit tattered around the edges as well. They had probably yanked her away from her home without bothering to let her pack any extra stuff. That bear was probably the only thing she had left of her past life, that was why she held onto it so tightly. Really, it was no wonder she was a bit leery of crowds and people, being moved from place to place while being stared at by strange eyes. Thrust into the hands of people she didn\u2019t know or barely knew and taken to unfamiliar surroundings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had probably been the first person to actually take a bit of time to sit down and really talk to her. Bonding with her and showing I cared about what she wanted. I offered her a small bit of stability, which was the biggest thing she needed right now. Especially if her powers went all wonky because of instability. Perhaps I was the best choice for this job, because what she needed right now wasn\u2019t a guardian and protector, but more of a big brother. And I had experience being a big brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer mood seemed to lift a bit by the time we finished our meal and left the building. Though it was hard to tell, she wasn\u2019t glued close to my leg like when we started which made me think this outing was having the desired effect on her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we turned the corner I heard alarm bells going off up ahead. A masked man came running out of the bank shooting a gun back into the building. He turned in our direction, taking only a few steps before seeing us. The man pointed his gun at both of us thinking to take us hostage or kill us I suppose. Before I had a chance to act though Asala screamed, shoving her face into her teddy bear. A large red circle appeared on the ground in front of the robber, giving him only a second to look down before a massive hand shot through the hole to tear his head clean off his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe hand was followed by an arm at least two stories tall and then a body proportionate to the rest. I grabbed Asala up, putting a bit of distance between us and the Gog. It was a big nasty creature, one of the toughest class of giants out there. I had never actually fought one before but I knew the weaknesses. By the time I sat the little girl back down the Gog had finally extricated itself from the hole. Standing at a staggering seven stories tall, it was going to be a real pain to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPanic was already setting in as the citizens began to run screaming out of buildings and down the street away from it. The police nearby began unloading their weapons into it but weren\u2019t even making a scratch. It would take at least another five to ten minutes before another hunter or even the military could be mobilized to deal with it. A creature like this could easily destroy half the town if left to its own devices and an untold number of lives would be lost. I wasn\u2019t sure if I could handle it on my own, but I knew I could at least stall it until backup arrived to help me take it down. Minimize the damage and the body count. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlancing down at the little girl who was cowering in fear and crying into her bear I wondered what I should do. I had taken the job of protecting this little girl. I only needed to fight the monsters she summoned if they attacked her. What was happening to the town might be horrible, but my charge wasn\u2019t in danger. The beast wasn\u2019t attacking her. If I left her side there was a chance she would be killed, either in the crossfire or someone seeking retribution that had figured out she had summoned the giant. The wisest course of action was to pick up the girl and get as far away as possible. If the giant followed us then I would deal with it, but if it didn\u2019t then all the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat was I going to do?</span></div></div>",

My duty was to protect the people. What kind of Hunter would I be if I couldn\u2019t protect both this girl and this town at the same time? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling out a small rectangular box I hit the button on the side before handing it to Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is a personal protection field. It will deflect most stray flying rubble and bullets. I want you to go hide ok? I\u2019m going to stall this creature until help arrives. I can\u2019t abandon these people. If you understand then go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe ran a bit farther away, hiding behind a car. I was already sprinting towards the Gog, yanking my duffle bag open as far as I could and throwing the contents into the air. The twelve weapons inside flew through the air, hovering in place as I expanded a magical field around myself. The rest of my things fell to the street but I didn\u2019t care. I grabbed the leg braces and chest plate as I ran, strapping them on with a few practiced movements. As I got close enough I snagged a six foot sword from the air as I jumped, using magic to boost myself up. My right hand grabbed a hand cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI spun in the air, bringing the sword around with all my might to strike the creatures arm. Even with as much force as I had put into the swing, it barely made a scratch. When the Gog turned towards me I fired the gun, the bullet that was half the size of a real cannonball blasted from the barrel to smash into the beasts left eye. It roared in anger, swiping at me in its rage, but the kickback from my shot had already thrown me out of its reach. With a quick flip I landed back on the street next to the police.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEvacuate the streets! Priority on citizen safety you hear me! I want at least a three block radius if you can get it. I\u2019ll keep it occupied until backup arrives!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes sir!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey scrambled without another word as the giant punched down towards me. I threw the gun away, shoving my hand into an oversized gauntlet without looking, making a fist and swinging at the oncoming punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe gauntlet of ogre\u2019s might blew back the punch temporarily as the ground cracked beneath me. While the fist was flying backwards I jumped again, running along the arm as I cocked back my right hand yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSoul of blood and bone! Ogre\u2019s might and unbroken stone! Imbue with power for one last blast! Imbue my fist with an Ogre\u2019s wrath!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a great yell I swung a powerful haymaker at the side of the giant\u2019s head. My fist and the weapon glowing a mixture of purple and black. The gauntlet broke apart around my hand but the Gog toppled to the ground. My weapons were still floating around me as I discarded my sword, grabbing some magical throwing knives. As I crossed my arms a purple string connected the handles of the eight daggers seconds before I threw them. The weapons imbedded themselves into the ground, pinning its arms and legs before it had a chance to stand up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSoul of web and burning fire. Creature of darkest desire. Poison runs within your veins. Show me spider your tangled banes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe daggers shone with a sickly blue light as a phantom spider began to build itself up from the eight knives. The purple threads spreading out into a net across the Gog\u2019s body. Where the lines touched the thick hide began to smoke and burn. It wouldn\u2019t kill it, only make it uncomfortable. But at least this might buy me three minutes if I was lucky. I landed on top of a car, grabbing another shield and sword from my arsenal as I devoted all my magic into keeping the giant pinned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe creature roared as it struggled against it\u2019s bonds, but I roared back, in defiance of it\u2019s threat. The police were working as fast as they could to clear as much space as possible from around the monster from what I could see. I had used up quite a few hard hitting weapons already, breaking the heart crystals on two artifacts in order to call upon the essence of the beast trapped inside. If help didn\u2019t come soon I would probably end up breaking at least three or four more. But none of them would be very effective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around, some sinking feeling in my gut making me seek out Asala. There coming up behind her was another monster. It looked like her power had summoned another one since I could see the red circle just disappearing. It beat on her shields and I knew they wouldn\u2019t stand up forever. Already I could see them beginning to flicker as magic quickly drained from the battery inside. But if I stopped focusing my attention on the Gog it would break out of my chains and I wouldn\u2019t be able to pin it down again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAsala was in direct danger right now. The choice was clear. My mission to protect the girl had to come first. Breaking my focus on the Gog I jumped off the car, running as fast as I could towards Asala. The Ballersnatch, a man sized green humanoid creature with four arms and black bug eyes, saw me coming and cried out a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved my sword through its mouth before it had time to finish hissing its defiance. With a great flick of my wrist I pulled the blade out of the side of its head while kicking it away from me. The body twitched once before laying still even as I spun around again to the right, leading with my shield to smack a large chunk of building the Gog had thrown my way. I yelled back a challenge when it opened its huge mouth to utter an almost sonic blast of a roar, the wind from the sound making the car behind me move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe beast punched a nearby building, ripping off the entire top floor before chucking it at me. I couldn\u2019t block it but I could get out of the way of the projectile. I would have to abandon the little girl to do so though. That was just not something I could do. So closing my eyes and accepting my fate I focused all my magic into the strongest shield I could make as I turned my back on the oncoming building, wrapping Asala protectively in my arms seconds before it smashed into the shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe barrier held for just a second, absorbing some of the force before giving way and smashing like a truck into my back. I felt something inside me snap even as I began to topple forward, no longer able to feel my legs. Sticking the sword into the ground I leaned against it, fighting through and channeling that pain into my fading magic to keep a shield around the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was then I saw a swordsman with a weapon in each hand launch himself from the roof of the car in front of me, his swords glowing a light blue to attack the monster behind me. I could hear the sounds of battle raging as darkness began to envelop me. I couldn\u2019t even turn around, all I could do was focus on one single task. Protecting the girl like I was supposed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry Asala. As long as I draw breath I won\u2019t let anything happen to you. I will protect you no matter what. Just stay right here underneath me ok? I\u2019m a Hunter. I\u2019m the sword that protects and the shield that defends. Right now I am your sword and shield. No matter what happens from this point on, do your best to keep your power under control ok? Can you promise me that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little girl nodded her head as tears flowed down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a good girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that the darkness overcame me finally and I passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI awoke in a hospital room. That wasn\u2019t surprising considering I had just had my back broken. Looking around the room I didn\u2019t see Asala anywhere. With a groan I hit the button to call for the nurse, waiting impatiently until one came. But she wasn\u2019t alone, three hunters came in, one an old woman, one the swordsman I had seen and one a middle aged female wearing plate mail. The nurse gave me a once over before leaving me alone with the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo who are you and what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that any way to greet the people that saved your life?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. Now who are you and what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe swordsman stepped forward with a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is Mason Fullovia. This old bat next to me is Sulia Canalia and the one in plate is Maria Galsworth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal Zelkov. But you probably know that already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIndeed. As to what happened, we got there in time to see you save the girl. But not in time to stop it\u2019s final attack against you. You did well in stalling it for us. You lived up to your family name. With a bit more experience under your belt I doubt you would be in this position now. I\u2019m sure you already realize this but that last attack paralyzed you from the waist down. There was nothing the Priestess could do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman named Maria walked over to the left side of the bed and laid her hand gently on my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou impressed me boy. And I don\u2019t impress easily. You don\u2019t have a license as a Hunter but I would have been glad to have you at my back. Unfortunately, the doctors say any chances of you becoming a Hunter are over. Aside from the paralysis, you overexerted your magic. It\u2019s about half as strong as it once was and you won\u2019t get it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat about the girl I was protecting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old woman named Sulia picked up the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe found you under the rubble, leaning against your sword and unconscious, refusing to fall no matter what. Your shield still surrounding the girl even as it ate away at your body. It was an amazing sight to behold. Something I had only seen once before that would make any Hunter proud to accomplish. The girl seemed to be in shock, unable to speak to us as she held on to you for dear life. She kicked and screamed as we pulled you away from her so we could transport you here. We told her it would be ok but she wouldn\u2019t listen. In the end she summoned a monster, I think she was trying to protect you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat damn freak was of the cursed blood so I slit her throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaria! There was a better way to put it. But yes. It seemed that girl you saved was the cause of all of this, we believe she summoned that Gog. When she summoned another monster, even though it was harmless, Maria put an end to her. I\u2019m sorry that you sacrificed your body for her with nothing to show for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll those cursed magic users deserve to die. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI reached over and put my right hand on top of Maria\u2019s gauntlet that was still resting on my left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaria Galsworth right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked down at me with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll remember that name. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour welcome boy. It was the right thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou misunderstand. Thank you for making what I am about to say and do so much easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI summoned all the magic I had and converted it into electricity, sending it down my arm and into the metal of her armor, as her eyes went wide and her body began to convulse I threw myself out of bed, letting my weight smash her to the floor. I moved my hands around hr neck and began to squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI promised that little girl that I would protect her. That I would keep her safe. I knew full well what she was capable of. That\u2019s why I was at the scene and able to minimize the damage so quickly. It was my job to protect her. To guard her for two or three days until a teacher could come and give her the training she needed. Her power was unstable but it wasn\u2019t her fault. She was scared, that\u2019s why she summoned the Gog by mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow as my final act to her I am going to kill you. I am going to avenger her death and rid the world of a small minded Hunter that can\u2019t see past her own hatred and self interest. It\u2019s an interesting thing how a couple thousand volts of electricity being sent through full plate armor can lock a body up so it can\u2019t fight back. I am going to look into your eyes as the life drains out of them. I want my face to be the last thing you see before you expire. Knowing you were killed by someone who isn\u2019t even a Hunter yet. Someone you would have trusted at your back with your life. By a seventeen year old with probably less than a quarter of the experience you have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd you are wrong about one other thing. I will become a Combat Hunter. That is what I was born and bred to do. Not being able to use my legs won\u2019t stop me. Not having half the power of other Hunter\u2019s won\u2019t stop me. Nothing is going to ever stop me from doing the only thing I know how to do. Slay monsters. And I will dedicate my life to spreading the art of monster summoning to the world just to spite you. Now please die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave one final squeeze, adding a bit of magic into my hands until my fingers ripped through her flesh and came together. As I levered myself up I spit in her face before crawling around on the floor to grab onto the bed. Inch over painful inch I hoisted myself back up until I was reclining back on the pillows with my legs dangling over the side. I looked at the other two monster slayers who hadn\u2019t moved an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEither one of you got a problem with what just happened? If so speak up, otherwise get out of my sight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, it was in your right to do so. A Hunter see\u2019s their job through to the end no matter the cost. You saw justice for your client served like a true Hunter. I always told her that hatred of hers would get her killed one day. Good day to you Riktal Zelkov. I look forward to seeing what kind of Monster Hunter you turn out to be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two walked out of the room after giving me a quick nod. I simply stared at the glassy eyes of the woman I had just killed. My mind filled with Asala. Yet another little girl I had been unable to save and protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was an interesting first day indeed. Are you proud of the choices you made? Were they easy for you to make? Did any of them make you second guess yourself? What would you do if you had the chance to do it over again? Would you make the same choices? Would you change them all? Do you believe there was only one right answer in all of this? Or do you feel your choices didn\u2019t matter? That the same outcome would happen no matter what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn this world of possibilities who can say? This is only one possible future of the young Riktal Zelkov. Only one path his life could and has taken. Just as there are an endless number of possibilities, so to is there an endless number of futures for those possibilities. Choices and actions that are further complicated by the choices and actions of other people. So you see, being a god and unraveling this tangled web is not as easy as it seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur time grows short. You have interested me and sated some of my curiosity. I wish you well until next we meet. Then I shall ask again, what kind of god shall you be?</span></div></div>",

I waited until she was close enough that I wouldn\u2019t miss, holding all my attention on the Gog until the last possible moment. When she was in range I turned, throwing my sword like a javelin and impaling the Ballersnatch through the head. The humanoid like creature with green skin and four arms twitched once as it flew backwards before halting its movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI returned to focusing all my attention on the Gog, but that split second that I had pulled my focus away from channeling every ounce of my magic allowed the beast to break it left arm free from my bindings. It swiped at me even as I pushed backwards with my feet to avoid it. Throwing my right arm up to block the blow with the buckler I held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn mid swing it opened its meaty hand, turning it\u2019s punch into a grab, encasing my right arm in its grasp. I could feel its crushing fingers turning my flesh into a mass of pulp even as the blood oozed out between his fingers. Locking down on the pain I heaved with all my might, tearing the useless flesh off and jumping out of the way while pushing Asala behind me with my remaining arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let the pain and anger flood me, channeling it into my remaining magic power to lock the beast down as long as I could. Now it was a race against time, a battle of  wills to see what would happen first, the monster breaking free from my control or me passing out from blood loss. I managed to lock down its free arm using raw power brought on by the intense pain but that adrenaline rush wouldn\u2019t last long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFortunately I didn\u2019t have to find out how long I could keep this up as three heads poked over the ledges of rooftops. A rain of arrows, bullets and chemical mixtures bombarded the Gog. A female Hunter jumped off the nearby rooftop, throwing her left arm across her chest as she hurtled towards the beast. A massive shield grew into being as tall and wide as she was as she fell. Up and down the length spikes began to sprout, a massive one shoving its way a good seven or eight inches past the rest. She landed on the monsters face with the force of a small earthquake, the large spike slamming into the remaining good eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she bounced backwards, another Hunter around his mid thirties jumped over my head with a sword in either hand. Each one glowed with a light blue color as he brought them both down on the creatures neck, but making only a small scratch. As he pulled one of the swords back he pointed it straight at the small cut he had made before the sound of a gun firing went off and smoke plumed up from the hilt. My bonds were starting to fade as another set of green ropes crossed over the creature. An old woman stepped up next to me, her eyes staring intently at the Gog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good boy. Saved us a lot of work. But I\u2019ll take it from here. Save your remaining strength and stop that bleeding. There\u2019s a Priestess on the way from the church. She will be here in a moment. Try not to pass out until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I let go of my bonds, pulling my magic back inside myself as I staggered back a few steps to sink down to the ground, leaning against a nearby car. It took only a moment to manipulate the flow of blood so I wasn\u2019t leaking my life juice all over the place. Asala was crying as she clung to me, her lips moving but no words coming out. But I still read what she was saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put my hand on her head and stroked her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. I\u2019m the one who made the choice to stall that thing not you. I knew the risks I was getting into. I knew the risks of being a Hunter long ago, but I still decided on this lifestyle. It\u2019s only an arm. I can still be a Combat Hunter without it. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you this was your fault. I\u2019ll fight them tooth and nail if they try. The important thing is you are safe. You understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe buried her face in my chest as I continued to stroke her hair, telling her it would be all right. When my vision began to get blurry and I started seeing two of everything I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths. I couldn\u2019t pass out, I still had to protect this girl. The six Monster Combat Hunters were continuing there assault against the Gog, dancing in and out, never giving it time to recover or counter attack. Slowly cutting deeper and deeper into its almost impenetrable hide. Working in perfect sync while calling out instructions to the others. A Hunter mainly worked alone, but he had to be able to mesh with others at the drop of a hat. These were all professionals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t A soothing hand on my arm made me look over, forcing the fuzziness in my brain to go away. A Priestess was holding her hands over my wound, growing new flesh to scab over into a stump while burning away any infection.. Once she was done with that task she placed a cool hand on my head a moment before I became clear minded again. Handing me some magically imbued bread she told me to eat. I did so knowing it would quickly replenish my lost blood if not my magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs the girl hurt?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo she is fine. I protected her and she is my charge. There is no need to worry about her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Priestess nodded as the Gog gave a final death rattle, the Hunters finally lowering their weapons and the ones on the rooftops jumping to the street. The Priestess quickly examined each of them, healing a few minor cuts but otherwise pronouncing them fit. She looked around at the street and buildings, seeing very little damage and no other bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you guys sure acted quickly this time. I think that\u2019s the first time I have seen such a powerful monster taken care of without  any corpses littered at it\u2019s feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank the boy here. He had it flat on it\u2019s back and pinned by the time we came. Made our job a hell of a lot easier. It\u2019s not everyday you can have such an easy kill.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe man who had been swinging the two swords around held out his hand and I shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name boy? Mine\u2019s Mason. Mason Fullovia\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal. Riktal Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh. That explains how you were able to stall it by yourself. Worked with your father once, glad to see his son is just as good. Any idea how it got into town undetected?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot sure. I think it was summoned in. Saw it come out of a red circle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAny idea who did it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo clue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman who had the giant shield gave a tsk of disgust before spitting to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDamn cursed freaks. They should all just die. This world would be better off without them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hugged Asala tighter to my side as she tried to shrink even further under my arm. Once I had assured her with a small squeeze that I wouldn\u2019t giver her up I staggered to my feet, unobtrusively taking a step forward and to the side to hide the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey aren\u2019t all bad ma\u2019am. They can do some good to. I\u2019d be pleased if you held your tongue on the matter as well. I have a good friend who is a summoner I\u2019ll have you know. If you can\u2019t keep your tongue from wagging with such poison I shall be forced to rip it out for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll the other Hunters laughed at that while the woman glowered at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKid\u2019s got spunk, you got to give him that much Maria. Gets his arm crushed by a giant after incapacitating it single handedly before ripping it off himself. Turns around after draining himself to the dregs to throw out a challenge to a veteran like that. The hell of it is, I even think he could do it too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old woman who had replaced me in holding down the monster put her hand on my shoulder good naturedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI got a feeling you have a bright future as a Hunter boy. Names Suli Canala. I run a private tutoring business for those that want to get an extra leg up on becoming Hunter\u2019s. You\u2019ve got a job if you are interested.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks ma\u2019am. I might take you up on that. But right now I need to get my charge here off the streets and into bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her understanding as I turned away. I heard them begin to shout out instructions to the police who were starting to gather now that the monster was slain. I figured I would be getting a visit from one or more of them later when they finally split up the spoils. But I didn\u2019t need to worry about that now. Right now I just wanted to get home and go to bed. I\u2019d had enough for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, that was an interesting first day indeed. Are you proud of the choices you made? Were they easy for you to make? Did any of them make you second guess yourself? What would you do if you had the chance to do it over again? Would you make the same choices? Would you change them all? Do you believe there was only one right answer in all of this? Or do you feel your choices didn\u2019t matter?

Only one path his life could and has taken. Just as there are an endless number of possibilities, so to is there an endless number of futures for those possibilities. Choices and actions that are further complicated by the choices and actions of other people. And those choices and actions are then in turn influenced by yet more choices by yet more people. So you see, being a god and unraveling this tangled web is not as easy as it seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur time grows short. You have interested me and sated some of my curiosity. I wish you well until next we meet. Then I shall ask again, what kind of god shall you be?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tMy duty to the girl came first. It was a shame, and not a decision I made easily but I had been given a job to do. I couldn\u2019t ignore that job just because hundreds of people were in danger. What kind of Hunter did that make me then? What did it say about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGrabbing the girl up again after quickly slipping my arms through the straps of the duffle bag and hoisting it onto my back I ran. I could hear the sounds of destruction and the screams being cut short as the giant crushed the unknown people. The ground shook as it stomped around and buildings fell. But I didn\u2019t look back, I didn\u2019t falter. I had a job to do. That job did not involve me fighting a monster that was not trying to hurt or kill my charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala continued to stuff the bear against her face while squeezing her eyes shut tightly, trying without much success to muffle her wails. This must be hard on her, summoning monsters she couldn\u2019t control that did so much damage to those around her. Perhaps this was the real reason she didn\u2019t like crowds. Not because she was afraid of them but because she was afraid of herself and what she might accidentally do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t stop until we were finally across the bridge and out of the main part of the city. Didn\u2019t stop until I was shoving open the gate to my house with a solid kick. As I opened the door I hit the security code, sending up a protective wall from the outside fence, encasing us inside. She ran into the living room, curling up into a ball on the couch and rocking back and forth. I could see that she really wanted to wail at the top of her lungs but she was suppressing that urge for whatever reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt took a moment of thought but I ran upstairs, digging through my closet until I found what I was looking for. Sprinting back down the steps, I knelt on the floor in front of her, touching her arm gently. She shrugged my touch off and looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I know, I bet you think I should have tried to help those people didn\u2019t you? Probably think somewhere deep down you don\u2019t deserve to live because your power is only hurting others. I see you want to cry and let it all out. I don\u2019t know why you aren\u2019t, but I have something for you that might help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat an old beat up blue bunny on the cushion next to her face so she could see it. One ear was sewn on haphazardly and the left eye was missing, the hole there sewn shut as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis guys name is Mr. Snuggles. He\u2019s an old veteran of many wars. He didn\u2019t fight monsters like I did, at least not those kinds of monsters. He fights against little girls fears and sorrows. As you can see he lost an eye in those struggles. My little sister used to be a big crybaby. But she was like you and didn\u2019t like people to see her sad. Then I cast a magic spell on her favorite bunny here. A spell that made your wails and your tears unseen and unheard while you hold him. No one could tell anything was wrong, just seeing a regular face when they looked at you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe keeps secrets too. You can tell him anything and he won\u2019t let slip a peep. No one can hear you talk to him either as long as you are holding him. It\u2019s part of the magic. He might be a bit old, but I think he might have a few more battles against such specialized monsters in him. But if you don\u2019t want to hold him that\u2019s fine too. I\u2019ll just leave him here to help me watch over you.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI sat on the floor then with my back to her, turning on the television and flicking through the channels. Making sure to stay away from any news stations that might have some coverage on the Gog. There was silence behind me for a moment before I saw a hand snake out from the corner of my eye to grab the blue rabbit. It wasn\u2019t long after that I heard her begin to cry in earnest. Not even attempting to stifle her sobs. I simply kept pretending to watch TV as if I heard nothing. Asking if there was anything she wanted to watch. Her wails finally started to die down a bit after about ten minutes so I set the controller down next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy sister was a good girl. She never liked to hurt anyone if she could help it. Really wasn\u2019t suited for being a monster slayer like the rest of us. My mother and father really couldn\u2019t accept that, always trying to force her into the family business. We were a long line of monster hunters they said. It was in our blood they said. But Olia, she dreamed of being an animal doctor. Said she wanted to help animals that couldn\u2019t defend themselves and were hurt by cruel humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe had a gift for it too. It was like she could read their minds. All animals loved her. But like I said she was a bit of a crybaby. Always climbing into bed with me when she had a nightmare. If she had a special ability to see the future or read peoples minds or something, she never said anything. But I didn\u2019t ask. I think that\u2019s why she always came to me and not anyone else. Because I didn\u2019t try to push her. I didn\u2019t expect anything from her except that she be my little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen one day mom took her out into the woods to slay her first monster, just like my dad had done with me and my older sister. She didn\u2019t want to go. My mother dragged her kicking and screaming anyway, saying she had to learn sometime. I snuck out after them. I wasn\u2019t supposed to of course, but I did it anyway. I had it in my mind that if I could, I would help her fight whatever monster she faced. I had always been her protector. Fighting tooth and nail with my family so she could realize her dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe was put up against an Antichilla, a sort of giant ant creature. I was relieved, it was a pretty weak creature, even for her skills. But my mother got a call for an emergency job during the fight. It was at that same moment that my mother had turned her back to take the call that it happened. The monster shot some sticky saliva, trapping my sister in place. Before she could use her magic to free herself it skewered her with it\u2019s front claws. Even as I was jumping out of hiding to kill the thing and try to heal her, it bit her head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy mother was never the same after that and neither was I. For a while I loathed myself for not acting sooner. For not fighting harder to keep her from being taken out to the woods. For being unable to protect her. I hated my mother and father for a while too. Because they had kept pushing her into a role she didn\u2019t want. Trying to force her to be a monster slayer just like everyone else. To uphold the family name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think about her as much now. It\u2019s not that I forget her or anything, or because it hurts too much to think about her. That\u2019s just the way life is. Time moves on with or without us and we don\u2019t always have the luxury of not moving with it. But whenever I hold Mr. Snuggles or any of the other stuffed animals I still have that were once hers I remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t remember the body as it dropped lifelessly to the ground though, I remember the girl who laughed and cried. The girl who crawled into my bed and asked me to tell her stories. The girl who said she was going to marry me when she grew up. That\u2019s part of the trick to grieving, remembering the happy moments and the sad ones. The moments you spent together be they good or bad. It doesn\u2019t help to only remember how they died or the regrets you had. You can\u2019t change any of that and it only makes you feel worse.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut it is how they lived that is important, because how they lived reflects on who you are. I wouldn\u2019t be as good with kids today if I had never had a little sister. If I had never acted like her big brother the way that I had. I would have never had the chance to tell bedtime stories or chase away nightmares or listen to her dreams if she hadn\u2019t once lived and changed my life in that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI snuck a glance at the girl who was clutching onto both her teddy bear and the rabbit while watching me. I didn\u2019t think she was going to say anything, but she finally started talking, haltingly at first but in a small quiet voice. I continued to pretend not to notice since she was still holding the rabbit, simply leaning my head back and looking at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy mom used to bake these really delicious cookies. They made your mouth water just smelling them. She would always tell me I had to wait until after dinner before I could have one. I used to pretend to be a Monster Hunter, sneaking into the kitchen on hands and knees when she wasn\u2019t looking. Hiding under the table or the counter when her back was turned. I\u2019d snag a cookie and run, locking myself in my room to eat it. I think she knew though, because she always made sure to turn her back at just the right times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy dad used to let me sit with him while he worked in the shop. My mother always scolded him, saying I shouldn\u2019t be around so many sharp objects but he would just laugh and let me stay. He was a really good wood crafter, people would come from the next town over and farther for his work. He taught me how to handle the tools properly and he had promised to teach me how to make things. That was a few days before he\u2026 before they\u2026 died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped up onto the opposite side of the couch as she began to cry again. As I settled myself in she crawled over to me, settling her head in my lap. I stroked her hair gently as her tears fell silently onto my pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt will get better Asala. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but in time it will. Each day you find something to keep you going. Be it hate, revenge, some small goal or hope. You find that something and you work towards it. Before you know it the day ends and a new one begins. Those hurts heal and you begin to forget what exactly it is that kept you going in the first place. It is replaced by bigger and better things. New dreams, new desires. You never forget though. You never should forget. But that shouldn\u2019t stop you from being happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally fell asleep clutching at my pant leg while I brushed her hair with my fingers. It was a long while before I finally fell asleep. A long while before the tears stopped silently rolling down my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, that was an interesting first day indeed. Are you proud of the choices you made? Were they easy for you to make? Did any of them make you second guess yourself? What would you do if you had the chance to do it over again? Would you make the same choices? Would you change them all? Do you believe there was only one right answer in all of this? Or do you feel your choices didn\u2019t matter? That the same outcome would happen no matter what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn this world of possibilities who can say? This is only one possible future of the young Riktal Zelkov. Only one path his life could and has taken. Just as there are an endless number of possibilities, so to is there an endless number of futures for those possibilities. Choices and actions that are further complicated by the choices and actions of other people. And those choices and actions are then in turn influenced by yet more choices by yet more people. So you see, being a god and unraveling this tangled web is not as easy as it seems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur time grows short. You have interested me and sated some of my curiosity. I wish you well until next we meet. Then I shall ask again, what kind of god shall you be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can hold off for about another five minutes right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl nodded her head and I could almost feel some of the tension draining from her body. With another small squeeze I led her back the way we had come and over the bridge across the river. It only took a few more minutes after that to open the gate into our large yard and then the front door. I pointed at the kitchen table as I pulled out some already cooked ham, some bread and some lettuce and tomato<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aren\u2019t one of those animal lovers are you? You know, with the whole \u201cI can\u2019t eat another living creature\u201d nonsense. Because if you are you and me are going to have some problems. Cause I like a fat, juicy, slab of meat on my plate. Ripping into it while it is still hot and feeling the juice dribbling down my chin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI mimed ripping into an invisible steak, showing my teeth and making growling noises. She giggled a bit at my antics but shook her head no. I took that to mean she didn\u2019t have a problem with eating meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood, just give me a minute and I will have some pigs on toast for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sliced the ham, throwing it in the skillet before popping four slices of bread into the toaster. While those were cooking I ripped up the lettuce and sliced the tomato. Within a few minutes I had four sandwiches on a plate sitting before her. She picked one up, biting into it with teeth bared, imitating my previous mimicking. She grinned at me with another laugh before settling down to eat more normally. I snagged one for myself as I turned on the TV, flipping to the news channel to see if there was anything immediate to worry about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind my asking, how long ago did it happen? When your powers activated I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at the table a moment before raising three fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThree days huh? I\u2019m really sorry about that. I bet you are really confused about what\u2019s going on. Being yanked around wily-nily by people you probably barely know to places far away from anyplace you recognize. I bet no one\u2019s really stopped to ask what you want or tried to understand your feelings on the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head, her eyes still looking at the table as she slowly continued to eat her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeople can be pretty cruel sometimes can\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain the nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet they didn\u2019t even stop to let you pack anything before pulling you along for this crazy ride. That bear is probably the only thing you have left of your old life. I wouldn\u2019t doubt you have been wearing those same clothes this whole time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA slow nod for the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell we will change all that. My clothes might be a little big but I\u2019m sure one of my old shirts will do as a serviceable nightgown for tonight. We can wash those things for you so you won\u2019t stink like a horse stables tomorrow, and then after school you and me are going shopping. A few new clothes should do the trick. It won\u2019t make you forget what happened, and it won\u2019t make the sadness go away, but it will make you feel a bit better. Feel a bit more normal. Tomorrow will be your day. Go where you want to go, see what you want to see, eat what you want to eat. A real date for just me and you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head finally came up and I saw her lips twitching upwards as her eyes gained a bit of sparkle. She nodded her head in agreement that she liked that idea and I nodded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI might only be with you for two or three days but I see no reason I can\u2019t act like you are staying forever. It\u2019s just not right. Girls are supposed to leave a place with more stuff then they came with right? It\u2019s like that unspoken law of being a girl. Well that and having unreasonable crushes on guys that look like girls. Don\u2019t ask me to explain how either one of those works since I have no idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finished her meal in a much happier mood then when she started. I found her a good shirt and got her to change into it after taking a bath, throwing it all into the washer. I offered to wash her bear too but she held onto it like a lifeline. I didn\u2019t push , simply patted her head and said everything was fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe spent the rest of the day watching movies and playing a few games. I told her stories and cracked a few jokes that made her laugh. I even taught her some more hand language until we were talking to each other using simple words and phrases. Even though she didn\u2019t utter another word since her first outburst, I could tell she was slowly healing a bit from her trauma. It would take her a long time to fully heal, but she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she began to yawn and rub her eyes I told her it was time for bed. She didn\u2019t complain or resist, simply nodded her head in agreement. I led her up to my room and pointed to my bed. She wasted no time in crawling into it and under the covers. I pulled out my box of stuffed animals, taking them out and surrounding her with them which seemed to make her happy. When I handed her the blue bunny who was missing an eye  I felt my lips twitch upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHis name is Mr. Snuggles. He was my little sisters before she died. As you can see he gave an eye valiantly protecting her secrets as she hugged him tight. He hasn\u2019t given up any one of them no matter what kind of torture he was put under. He\u2019s also really good at muffling tears no matter how hard you cry. When you are holding him no one around you can hear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned to set up some covers on the floor she grabbed my arm. I looked down at her as her eyes pleaded with me. She didn\u2019t say anything but I knew what she wanted. She wanted me to sleep in the bed with her.</span></div></div>",

I thought she was sleeping when her soft voice suddenly spoke into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I call you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure.

It will be harder on you when you have to leave again with my mom\u2019s friend if you get too attached to me. I know I seem like I am doing a horrible thing, and I am. Asking you to trust me, bonding with you like I have. But you need training in how to use your powers. Training I can\u2019t give you because I don\u2019t understand how they work. If you get too close to me you won\u2019t want to leave, and I won\u2019t be able to go with you. That\u2019s going to break your heart even more. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned away, pretending not to hear the sniffling and the soft cries of loneliness as I set up my bed. Pretended not to see her pressing her face into the blue rabbit as I crawled under the covers of my makeshift bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI laid with my back to her, listening to her crying while remembering how my little sister used to climb into my bed when she had a scary dream. Me, not mom or dad or big sis Ulicia. Out of everyone she had always come to me when she was troubled. Always saying that her big brother Riktal scared away all the bad things. It had been a long time since I had really thought about her, the pain creeping back inside as I remembered her loss. I missed being a big brother. That was probably why I had such a soft spot for little kids. But as much as I had wanted to crawl into that bed I just couldn\u2019t. This really was for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe crying and sniffling quieted down and I thought she had finally gone to sleep. But a moment later the covers lifted and a small body slid onto the floor behind me. Her head rested against my back and I could feel her shaking, but from fear or something else I didn\u2019t know. Her small voice was barely audible but I still heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t leave me alone again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat small plea broke my heart. My conviction melted away as I turned over and wrapped her in my arms. Stroking her hair and telling her it would be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you want to go back to the bed where it is more comfortable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head no, using one hand to talk to me in a few words of the silent language I had shown her today. With a smile I kissed the top of her head as we drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer fingers had said Happy here. Safe.

I was mostly in the dark as to just how stable her ability as a summoner was and with so little to go on pulling her around wily-nily for no good reason was just asking for trouble<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, I just need to make a quick stop before we go. I made a promise to someone that I am going to have to break. You don\u2019t mind do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave my hand a small squeeze while shaking her head no and I squeezed back. With that I headed for the classroom, catching Liz just as she was leaving. She glanced down at the child still holding onto my hand and raised her eyebrow at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA job. And because of that I was wondering if you would take a rain check on meeting my friend. At least for a few days until this is all over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got no problems with that. Duty comes first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. I really will make it up to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.

People were staring at us as we walked through the halls and out the front. Well mostly they were staring at the little girl and whispering to their friends who knows what weird ideas. After leaving the school grounds I started to head towards the house when a thought struck me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, do you have any spare clothes or anything of that nature?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head while hunching her shoulders, holding out the bear to me for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo that\u2019s the only thing you have left from your old life huh? I bet whoever took you away just grabbed you up and left. Didn\u2019t think much about your comforts at all. My guess is you are pretty scared of crowds right now, but if you can handle it you want to go buy some stuff? We can get you a few new dresses maybe a hair ornament. I bet you\u2019d like a new pair of shoes too. Spruce you up and make you look prettier than you already are. I know a few places that aren\u2019t that crowded or busy and I will be by your side the whole time. You like that idea?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes seemed to light up a bit as she nodded her head. I had observed enough girls of all ages in my time to know most of them couldn\u2019t resist a bit of shopping and pampering. Especially on someone else\u2019s money. It was one of those secret rules of being a girl I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led her around town to all the stores I knew of that were reasonably priced. I wasn\u2019t loaded and my allowance wasn\u2019t all that great, but it was enough for my needs. She was a solemn little girl it seemed, though considering what had happened to her she seemed to be holding up well. I had to wonder though how much of that was just an act. She seemed to really be happy though as I took her to the different places to try on dresses, looking at herself in the mirror and posing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat blue dress looks good on you. Much better then that green one I met you in. It brings out your eyes. And the cream one goes well with your hair. Do you like them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she nodded her head I smiled at her reflection looking at me through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then we will buy them both. And you should pick another one as well. You know what they say, three is a lucky number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn the end she picked a deep purple dress with a fine flower embroidery in it stitched with a lighter purple thread. We picked up a few more pairs of undergarments and socks plus a nightgown before I paid the tab and left. We were heading to the shoe store with her sticking close to my side when she suddenly stopped to look in a window. I turned to see what had caught her attention, finding her enamored of a music box with two bears skating on ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou like bears don\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head bobbed up and down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI saw the price tag. It was a bit expensive for my taste but not by too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen let\u2019s get it shall we? Little girls are supposed to have music boxes. Its like an unwritten rule.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me in surprise, her head going back and forth but I ignored her, entering the store anyway as the bell jingled to announce our presence. It only took a few moments before the box was in my possession and I was handing it to Asala. She wound it up a few times, smiling at the sound it made. I gave her head a pet before heading back to the door. On the way I saw a small bear hair comb, buying it on the spot as another gift to her. She held it like it was some sort of treasure as we continued on our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want you to get the wrong idea here, I want to make sure we are on the same page. This may sound cruel, but try not to get too attached to me ok? In a few days you will be leaving again to go to your more permanent home with someone who can teach you what I can\u2019t. I\u2019m doing all this because I want you to trust me and because I want to try getting your mind off what a crappy hand you have been dealt so far. It\u2019s going to hurt, and for a long time to come, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t find things that make you happy even at a time like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl looked down at the comb she was still playing with in her hands then back up at me before bowing her head in a nod. She then poked at her eyes, wiped her mouth with a finger and stuck her fingers in her ears to wiggle them back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knelt on the sidewalk and leaned in closer looking both ways while giving her a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou forgot the eyebrows by the way, but I still understood you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked both ways as well, leaning forward a bit so as not to be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand. Thank you for the comb. Momma\u2026 momma gave me one just like it, but it\u2019s gone now. Now it\u2019s like a piece of momma came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe wrapped her arms around my neck, giving me a quick hug before letting me stand up again. I had to make sure I didn\u2019t get too attached to this little girl. What I had told her was also true for me. If I got too attached it would be harder when she finally left. But it felt good to be able to act like a big brother again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe bought the shoes without incident, stopping at a quiet little restaurant for a late dinner. Her mood had improved steadily all day. Not a hint of sadness or that vacant eyed stare I had first seen haunted her eyes. She almost acted like a normal little girl. It was only her silence that made her different. Her muted giggles and the few words she had spoken to me in secret the only proof that she could talk at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was starting to turn dark as we finally headed off home from our day of shopping, she was looking a bit tired as we walked until finally I ended up carrying her on my back. She draped her arms around my neck, laying her cheek against the back of my head sleepily. I continued to walk on in silence, ignoring the stares of the people around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust as we hit the bridge crossing the river a red circle appeared in front of me. Asala gave a moan, squirming around until she dropped to the ground, backing away from the red glowing circle. Setting the bags down I fished in my duffle for a weapon, pulling out the first thing that came to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t know what kind of beast would come out of the circle but I held the double bladed sword at the ready in front of me. A blue blur shot into the sky as the circle suddenly closed. Tracking it with my eyes I tried to catch a glimpse of what it was. Asala squatted on the ground, covering her head while mewling in fear. When the creature finally stopped flitting around I began to laugh heartily, putting my sword back in my bag and pulling out some of my emergency rations. Breaking off a bit of the hard bread I used a touch of magic to moisten it and let it turn into crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala, come on and stand up. Hold out your hand for a moment, it won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment where she looked up into my eyes she finally stood up and did as I asked. Dumping the crumbs into her hand I whistled a quick tune The Dagal zipped out of the air, landing on Asala\u2019s wrist with dainty claws to eat the bread crumbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s called a Dagal. Also known as mini dragons because that\u2019s what they look like. They are quite harmless and friendly as you can see. They are great messengers and like real dragons they have their own special abilities. This is a blue one so its probably water based magic, like minor healing. They can be trained to learn new magic too. Do you want to keep him? It can be your first tamed monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes were like saucers as she stared at the little blue dragon creature that was picking up crumbs with its front paws before sitting on its haunches and eating daintily. Finally she nodded her head slowly, as if afraid any movement would make the thing fly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen tickle it under its chin. It will imprint on the first person or thing that does so. He, or maybe it\u2019s a she, will follow you and only you until it dies. But they live a very long time so if you take care of it he might be with you until you become a ripe old granny.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer finger came up slowly, reaching out to the creature and stopping as if afraid. But I continued to smile at her, nodding encouragingly. She closed her eyes and thrust out, scratching under the monsters chin. It let out a coo of pleasure while flapping its wings, a look of bliss on it\u2019s face. Finally it flew into the air, circling once before landing on her shoulder and nuzzling her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe look of wonder that grew in her eyes as she looked at me made me laugh again. Picking up the bags I nodded with my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on we are almost home, I\u2019ll teach you how to take care of your new friend before you go to bed. Congratulations on your first monster taming.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe followed me across the bridge as if in a daze. A dreamy expression returning to her eyes, but this time it wasn\u2019t for the same reasons I thought.</span></div></div>",

They will eat meat, but they prefer fruits. Their digestive system can break down just about anything. But try to stay away from apples if you can help it. Something about them messes with their insides and makes them sick. They are also smart creatures. Here, try giving him this orange.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she took the orange from me I continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey will accept food from anyone they know and trust well enough, but mostly they will only accept food from your own hand. Their noses can detect poisons and they have an instinct about people. So if your friend there acts suspicious around food or drink or dislikes a person, you should trust him over your own feelings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Dagal grabbed the orange in its nimble claws, sniffing it a moment before running a single talon around the edge, peeling away the skin and eating the meat inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey actually don\u2019t eat all that much, only about half their body weight twice a day. If you can feed him three times a day all the better. That extra nutrient will help him grow and learn new things faster. No more than four times a day though. They can go at most three days without eating or drinking but if that happens they become really weak and will most likely die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Dagal finished eating the orange and looked around questioningly, I pointed at the trash can and the creature flew over, dropping the peel into the garbage before returning to its perch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTime will show you what kind of quirks your friend has. Each one is different. I once saw a Dagal that could play the piano and another one that couldn\u2019t go anywhere without wearing a hat of some kind. They molt twice a year, when that happens take a damp cloth and rub it across their scales gently to help them shed the dead skin. Other than that they are very dependable creatures. Keep him away from hot water though, only the red ones like hot water, the rest avoid it like the plague. Treat him right and he will do the same to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand close to the creature on her shoulder, making it turn it\u2019s head to the side and inspect it with one eye. Stretching out its neck the monster sniffed my fingers before giving a small coo and a nod. With a grin I reached out and scratched behind its ears, ending by rubbing a single digit up and down the valley between his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems he likes me. Glad I got his seal of approval. Now it\u2019s getting late and you are tired, grab your nightgown from the bags and get yourself cleaned up. After that it\u2019s off to bed with you. And don\u2019t give me no lip little miss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stuck out her tongue at me but ran off back into the hallway. Soon enough I heard her feet pounding up the steps and the water running in the bathroom. While she was getting cleaned up I climbed the steps as well, opening the door to my room and pulling out my box of stuffed animals. As I set them on the bed up by the pillow I grinned a bit foolishly too myself. My mother had thought I had thrown them out along with the rest of Olia\u2019s things. She hadn\u2019t wanted anything to remember my little sister by after she died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I think the truth was, remembering was too hard for her. Seeing her things in her empty room and knowing she was never coming back. Constantly being reminded by her pictures on the walls and her toothbrush in the bathroom. I had saved these few animals and a few photos. They were the only thing left to remind me that I had once had a little sister. Sometimes holding these stuffed creatures let me remember her face and her voice. Remember the way she climbed into my bed after having a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled out the last animal, a blue stuffed rabbit missing an eye that had been badly re-stitched along its ear. This had been Olia\u2019s favorite. I had been the one to do the bad sewing job after I had accidentally ripped it during a fight with her. That was how the eye had gotten lost as well. I never had found it again, simply sewing it up and saying it was a war wound. She used to cry all the time, but whenever I was around she tried to hold it in. I remembered how one day I had said a few silly made up words over the rabbit, telling her I had cast a magic spell on it that would keep anyone from knowing when she cried. That even if she cried in front of someone no one would hear or see it as long as she was holding the rabbit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that I pretended not to notice when her tears flowed in front of me. Acting like nothing was wrong. I never understood why she was always crying, she saw things in her mind but refused to tell anyone what she saw. I guessed she had the gift to see the future or something but I didn\u2019t know. I wondered if she had seen her own death and that\u2019s what made her so scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even realize I was sitting on the floor pressing the rabbit to my face until I took a deep breath. I imagined I could still smell her on the rabbit as a few tears soaked into its colored hide. This was stupid. A Hunter was supposed to have a tight reign on his emotions. Not get sentimental after a simple day out with a little girl that made me think about my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA hand on my head made me jerk a little. I hadn\u2019t even sensed her coming into the room. I had to lock down my grief. If this had been out in town an enemy could have taken me out easily. Her hand reached down and touched the rabbit softly before she came around and looked at me, the question plain in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHis name is Mr. Snuggles. He is a magic rabbit that can make you feel better. When you hold him no one can see or hear you cry. He was my little sister\u2019s a long time ago. But he is mine now. But while you are here he is yours if you want him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out the stuffed animal and she shook her head, pushing it back towards me. She pointed to the rabbit and then held up her teddy bear. Her voice was soft and slightly stilted. Hesitant as if she didn\u2019t know if she could speak without it being a secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour friend like Mr. Cuddles is mine. If I take him, you will be lonely. I\u2019m\u2026 not lonely anymore. I have Mr. Cuddles, Blue and now you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you decided to name your Dagal Blue huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she nodded her head I smiled while getting to my feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I think it\u2019s time for all of us to get some shut eye. You are almost asleep on your feet it looks like. We still have to get up early for school tomorrow after all. There will be more problems to deal with but that\u2019s just the way life is. We deal with them as they come and before you know it the day is over and the next day is upon us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe clambered into bed, surrounded by the stuffed animals as Blue flew up, perching on the headboard. He ruffled his wings a few times before tucking his head into his chest, looking down on Asala who was already blinking sleepily. The girl patted the bed with hopeful orbs as I stood over her. With a smile I slid under the covers, kissing the top of her head as she closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood night and sweet dreams Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stayed awake for a bit until her breathing evened out before closing my eyes and letting slumber take me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that was an interesting first day was it not? Did you regret any of the choices you made? Did it end up as you thought it would? Did you find out something about yourself you never knew before? How did it feel to play god? To have the power of choice in the palm of your hand. Were the decisions easy to make or hard? Do you believe there was only one right answer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn this world of possibilities who can say? This was only one of many possible outcomes from a select few possible choices. But it seems our time is up now, the boundary weakens. It calls you back to your own time and place. So until we meet again.\u201d</span></div></div>",

This isn\u2019t my problem. Go find someone else to look after her. Don\u2019t think you can use the whole family card here mother. You aren\u2019t allowed to have it both ways. I won\u2019t allow you to deny me from taking the Hunter exam, saying I need to finish school and then mere hours later offer me a job as an official Hunter when it is convenient for you. You didn\u2019t want me to be a Hunter no matter how hard I begged, so screw you and your offer. I\u2019m not going to take any Hunter jobs until I finish school just like you wanted. She is not my problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal honey! It\u2019s not like that! There are\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMitigating circumstances? Other reasons? Not so black and white? That\u2019s just the way it is with you isn\u2019t it? Always a reason or an excuse that seems and sounds so reasonable. You think you an get people to do anything if you just double talk and give them some puppy dog eyes. Freely throwing around words like: because you are family, as if that is the answer to everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned around to stare my mother in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell not this time. I won\u2019t let you sucker me into doing your dirty work because you find it distasteful or for whatever reason you might come up with. I feel for the girl, don\u2019t get me wrong, But I\u2019m not taking her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal now that\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFair? Fair! Who are you to decide what\u2019s fair or not? You don\u2019t get to use that word. Especially not with me! If you want to talk about fair, how is it fair that I\u2019m not allowed to take the Hunter exam when you let big sis Ulicia take it at fifteen? That\u2019s two years younger than I am now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow is it fair that I can drive just about anything that moves in air, land, or sea yet I\u2019m not allowed to have a car or a motorcycle? Even if I save up and pay for it with my own money? How is it fair that you keep shoving these marriage meetings onto me whether I want you to or not? Is that your same idea of fair that you used while raising Olia? Forcing her to be a Hunter when even a blind man could see she wasn\u2019t suited for it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that the real reason you took her out into the woods that day? So you could pit her against her first monster to let it kill her? Make her death seem like an accident? It seems pretty convenient how you got a call just at the crucial moment you could have saved her.. Her inability as a slayer sullied the family name so it was easier to just get rid of her is that it? Stop her from tarnishing the Zelkov reputation any further?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grabbed up my bag and stormed towards the door as I heard the chair scrape behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! Don\u2019t you dare walk out that door! I\u2019m not done\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slammed the door behind me without waiting for her to finish the sentence. Even as I turned to walk down the hall I reached into my bag and grabbed my Lexington double barrel, spinning on my heel and pointing it at my mother as she burst into the hall behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive me a reason mother. Say one more word and I will shoot you. I hold no illusions that if it comes down to an all out brawl you will beat me. You have more experience than I do after all. But you are going to have to kill me to make me stop. You know how good I am. I have no problem destroying this family name right now. I have two bullets left in this weapon. The first one will be used to slow you down, the second one will go right between that little girls eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI will then proceed to rampage through this school killing as many people as I can. Wouldn\u2019t that be a great headline? Son of prestigious Zelkov family runs amok within Monster Hunter Academy. Sanity called into question, Can the rest of the family be trusted?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFitting don\u2019t you think? Not to mention the blow having your client murdered by your own son would be to your pride and our name. So take the girl, turn around and walk away right now. And don\u2019t try to give me any of your mother talk. You never had time to be a mother to me before, so don\u2019t start now. Go do your important jobs for the military or whatever country it is today. I\u2019ll finish out my school day and return to the empty house like I always do. I\u2019ll take care of myself like I always have, and I\u2019ll expect to see you in a few days or a few weeks for a few hours before you are off again doing your Hunter things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a sigh, giving me a pair of sad eyes but I wouldn\u2019t let them sway me this time. I simply kept my weapon trained on her as the girl and her aid Inga came out of the room, finally she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right Riktal. I\u2019m sorry I came. I see I\u2019ve upset you. I hope one day you understand. I\u2019m only doing what I think is best. When you become a parent you will see there\u2019s no guidebook telling you what to do. I\u2019m just doing the best I can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t want to here it. Just leave. And by the way, I promised big sis earlier that I would tell you she sends her love.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a soft smile as she took the girls hand, turning and walking away while pulling the girl after. The girl turned her head back to watch me, the blank expression leaving her face for just a moment as a look of sadness crossed her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waited until they were out of sight before finally lowing my weapon and shoving it back into my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got something you want to say to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe principal came out from hiding around the corner, the wheels of her wheelchair rotating noiselessly as she pushed herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not my place, but I\u2019m old and it\u2019s a requirement that we old people be busybodies to some degree. You shouldn\u2019t have been so hard on her. I\u2019m sure she hasn\u2019t made the best choices in her life, just like you haven\u2019t. But I\u2019m sure you know you went a bit too far with some of the things you said. I don\u2019t know any of the circumstances, just the context, but I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t want your sister to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right. It isn\u2019t your place. I\u2019d thank you if you kept your nose out of matters where it doesn\u2019t belong or I might have to cut it off.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved past her and continued down the hall. I only made it a few steps before she called after me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you have really rampaged through the school? Killing innocent would be Hunter\u2019s working to learn how to defend the people?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even turn around to answer her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. It would have been a faster and cleaner death then most of them would get out there in the field. And probably a better one them some of them deserve. This place is a joke of an academy for would be Hunter\u2019s. Almost everyone still thinks this kind of life is a game. That they are still normal people. They need to wake up to the reality of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf this place is such a joke child, then why did you still come here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t bother to answer her, instead striding off down the corridor in silence. Wasn\u2019t it obvious to her? The answer, like everything else, was complicated. There was no one defining deciding factor. No black and white answer.</span></div></div>",

I was so tempted to walk out the front doors right now, but I knew if I did, I would be making a mistake that I would come to regret. The same way I came to regret just about all the mistakes I made every time I let my anger get the best of me. Besides, I had a promise to keep. A promise to the first real friend I had ever had. It wouldn\u2019t do to break it just because my mother made me a little upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped into the class and sat down at my desk, a few eyes watching me. Those stares were now calculating and openly scheming instead of the slight interest they had held when I had first walked in those doors this morning. I simply tried to make myself inconspicuous as the teacher droned on. Even managing to answer one of his questions when he called on me without the usual sulky attitude I had grown accustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the bell rang those calculating eyes converged on me like a pack of starving wild beasts, all of them talking at once. All of them trying to get my attention for one reason or another. All of them trying to butter me up and make connections because of my name. Some of them were roundabout and some of them were just plain blatant about what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father is a weapon maker, would you come over and give your professional opinion on them? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was wondering if you wanted to hang out for a bit? I could show you around town if you are unfamiliar with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI know a guy who can get you a really good deal on anything you want. Do you want me to show you to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYour handsome. Want to be my boyfriend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy family is rich, if you go out with me you won\u2019t regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slapped my hand on the desk as I stood up and grabbed my bag from the floor. Everyone shut up almost instantly at the sound. I didn\u2019t even bother replying to any of them, letting my disdain show clearly as I ignored them completely. Walking over to Liz\u2019s desk I nodded my head towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReady to go meet my broker friend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked past all the dumbstruck faces, keeping our own bland and expressionless. As soon as we were out of sight and earshot we both began grinning like fools and cracking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh man that was priceless! Did you see their faces? Their mouths were open so wide they were making drag marks on the floor! I\u2019ll say one thing Riktal, you got style. You really know how to say a lot without saying much at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you could have done the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I couldn\u2019t have and I\u2019m not ashamed to admit it. I could have tried, but I couldn\u2019t have pulled it off with the same kind of mixture of confidence and disinterest as you did. But I admit, it always feels good to put one over on them. They did the same thing when I first transferred in, trying to suck up to me and become my \u201cfriend\u201d. I don\u2019t need friends like that though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how\u2019d you handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKnocked all their heads together and put three of them in the hospital for a week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was tempted to do the same.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I am still a bit angry right now and I knew if I started I wouldn\u2019t stop. I\u2019d end up going too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCare to tell me about it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter walking along in silence for a bit and looking around the streets of the city I finally told her about the meeting with my mother and the blow up afterwards. I cut out a lot of what was said, trimming it down to the essence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued in silence, neither one of us feeling the urge to talk and she didn\u2019t instantly spew the kind of nonsense someone who wasn\u2019t from a generation family would spew. Words like you were wrong and you should have just done it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not judging since I know that isn\u2019t the whole story, but I think you were both right and wrong. I don\u2019t know what I would have done, probably accepted the job, but you did what you thought was right. What you thought you had to do for whatever your reasons. But I think you went a bit too far in some of the things you said to your mother. Even if they were true, did it really do any good to say them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs Hunter\u2019s we will end up taking jobs we don\u2019t like, or find distasteful. Protecting people we might personally find to be the scum of the earth. Taking jobs under false assumptions and misinformation. We can\u2019t always be picky about every little thing. We keep the regular people in mind, or at least try to, at all times. If times get desperate we won\u2019t turn our noses up at a job that offers us good money. We can try to live off the spoils of pure monster slaying, but even that isn\u2019t a guaranteed thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPointing out the obvious, saying the complete truth, turning our backs on our duty. We can\u2019t always do these things. Not when doing so serves no purpose and might ruin our ability to be effective at our jobs. Or ruin our chances of getting people to trust us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know. Now that I\u2019ve cooled down a bit I realize how much of what I said I didn\u2019t need to say. That\u2019s the way it always is. But sometimes my mother just infuriates me no end.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame with mine. But my grandmother used to tell me before she died, that that was the mark of being a good parent sometimes. You can\u2019t always be your child\u2019s friend. Sometimes you are the villain, sometimes the comforter, and sometimes the friend. If they love you one minute and hate you the next then you are doing your job right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz grinned a bit. \u201cNow I\u2019m not sure how right she was about that of course. Because when she told me that she insisted the moon was just a giant window and we were nothing more than ants in a small box.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019ll apologize to her the next time I see her. Which will probably be in four or five days. That will give me enough time to forget all about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think that\u2019s a good idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led her to the Pasta Palace, opening the door and beckoning her inside with a courtly bow and hand gesture. Once I was inside I pointed out my broker friend who was eating the same thing he ordered every day at this time, stuffed mushrooms and linguino. He saw me and waved, beckoning me over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! Haven\u2019t seen you in a while. Finally decide to listen to your mother and chose a woman from one of her marriage meetings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wish. You know I\u2019ve got to keep my options open. I can\u2019t be weighed down like that, after all I got to be able to steal any woman you are interested in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around the diner, lowering my voice a bit and pointing unobtrusively to a young waitress pouring coffee for another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike Trinity over there perhaps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe blushed a second before laughing a bit and eating another mushroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNerval, this is Liz Hawthrope. She has a heart crystal she would like you to examine for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz pulled out the crystal, handing it over into Nerval\u2019s waiting palm. He took out a magnifying glass which fitted over his right eye, examining the stone while he talked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHawthrope Huh? As in Wilson Hawthrope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCousin of mine who works in the big city dealt with him a few times. Said he was one of the good ones. If Riktal vouches for you then you are ok in my books. This guy might be a bit hard to deal with sometimes, but he\u2019s one of the good ones. So any friend of his is a friend of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe handed the crystal back to her as he pulled the magnifying glass off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell just on a field test I\u2019d say I could give you seven thousand Reul for it. If you want to stop by my shop I can do a more thorough test and you are free to get an appraisal elsewhere if you want. I\u2019ll trade any weapon of equal value for it if you aren\u2019t interested in the money. Or a custom job up to five thousand, the extra two being my work fee. But I vouch any custom job will be worth the loss of a two thousand Reul profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll make sure to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome by anytime if you ever need anything! If I don\u2019t have it I can get it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we left I pointed out Nerval\u2019s shop right next door, telling her he could always be found at the pasta place if he wasn\u2019t in his shop. We continued to walk around town for a little bit talking about small things when my stomach growled. Liz turned to leave, thanking me and giving me a wave goodbye.</span></div></div>",

If so, want to grab a bite before you leave?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned back to look at me for a moment before finally shrugging and returning to my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure, saves me from cooking something for dinner and I don\u2019t really need to get back home for anything. It\u2019s not like there is anyone there waiting for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEmpty house for you too huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, I get to see my parents maybe once or twice a week. Both of them together if I am really lucky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou talk to yourself while you are at home too? Just to hear a voice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought I was the only one who did that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe grinned at each other as we headed deeper into town. Walking in a companionable silence and watching the citizens going by. Some of them recognized us as Hunter\u2019s, or at least ones in training by our uniform and gave us a wave in greeting. We waved or nodded back as we passed but didn\u2019t stop to chat. We found a quiet little diner, sitting down and ordering our meal. Once the waitress left, Liz rotated her shoulders while stretching a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMan I can\u2019t remember the last time I went out to eat with another person. Or when I was actually interested in the conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLast time I was out to eat with someone else was about two years ago, and that was with my big sister on my birthday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOuch. Well I know it hasn\u2019t been that long for me, I just can\u2019t remember when exactly. Don\u2019t you just wish you could somehow get out of being in your own family? Insert yourself in one more normal, or less concerned about the family name and image?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll the time. But then I wonder if I could ever fit in to that kind of life. I mean being a Zelkov is all I know. Acting and reacting based on that fact. Even if I got rid of the family name, I\u2019m still me. I would have still grown up in the Zelkov family even if I was transplanted into another one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, yeah, I know. Still like to imagine it sometimes though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur food came then and we began to eat, talking about a few minor things here and there. Stuff like favorite tactics, a bit about our families, and our views on different subjects. We were about halfway through our meal when Liz got a call. She excused herself for a moment, getting up and walking away to take the communication spell. I could just barely see the transparent green tinted screen hovering on her wrist as she held her other hand over her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe returned a few moments later with an entirely different demeanor. She held herself a bit stiffly and less open then she had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head as we continued to eat. If she didn\u2019t want to discuss it that was fine. Private matters were still private. We all had them and the entire world didn\u2019t need to know. If she felt like sharing or asking for my help, she would do it in her own time. If not than I wasn\u2019t obligated to worry about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finished the meal in silence. It wasn\u2019t exactly uncomfortable, but it wasn\u2019t the same kind of companionable silence we had shared earlier. Finally she put her fork down, pushing her empty plate away and stared t me. I raised my eyebrow as I did the same. Somehow knowing she was about to tell me what was bothering her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose I wouldn\u2019t mind. I could do worse and you aren\u2019t that bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarriage of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho said anything about marriage? What made you think I want to marry you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was my mother on the spell earlier. She said I had a marriage meeting with you next week. I thought that was why you invited me out to eat and why you\u2019ve been so friendly with me. You wanted to get to know me before the actual meeting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is news to me. I didn\u2019t even know my mother had set up another meeting until earlier today. Even then it was just a comment in passing, she didn\u2019t tell me who it was with. I asked you out to eat because I was hungry and I thought you might be too. I enjoy your company that\u2019s true, but not in a romantic sense. If you remember, you asked me to be your friend, not the other way around. I opened up a bit to you because it\u2019s been a while since I met someone who gets where I am coming from and has so many similarities with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really didn\u2019t know anything about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI swear on my name as a Zelkov. Truth is, if I had known I probably would have stayed far away from you. I hate it when my mother shoves these meetings on me, and I try to avoid them like the black death. I\u2019d like to choose for myself who I spend my life with, not have the choice forced upon me. So if that is true then I\u2019m stating right now, I have no interest in you romantically. If I get involved with you in that way it will be because I want to and because I really have feelings for you, not because my mother tells me I have to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe narrowed her eyes as she looked at me for a bit longer before her face split into a grin and she began to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk now I feel a bit stupid. That\u2019s one of my downfalls. I\u2019m quick to make assumptions and act on them as if they are the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGoes well with my quick temper then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t we make quite the pair? I\u2019d make an assumption and start a big argument like I always do then you would get angry and we would have a big fight over it. Only to find out I was wrong and it was a small thing I had blown out of proportion.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, definitely not compatible marriage material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill just friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith twin grins I paid the bill and we left the diner. Before she turned to head home she looked back at me one last time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor the record, I agree with you. I\u2019d rather choose who I get involved with romantically then have them forced onto me. I just got so tired of my mother forcing boys down my throat all the time I was about to just give in and choose one. But I think I can keep fighting her now. Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI raised my hand to return her farewell wave before walking in the opposite direction. My mother wouldn\u2019t dictate my life for me. No one would. I\u2019d go to the marriage meeting, but we would just have a good time and a good laugh at our mother\u2019s expense. If we ended up falling for each other later it would be on our own terms and our own decision. But right now we were just friends and that\u2019s all I wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, this day had it\u2019s ups and downs. A bit of action, a bit of drama, perhaps even a bit of blossoming romance? Did things turn out to your liking?  Do you regret any of the choices you made? Was it easy for you to play god and decide a single person\u2019s fate? Did you really wish to seek out confrontation and danger but refuse to do so because you were playing with someone else\u2019s life? Or did you simply do what you would have done in that situation? Did you take his personality and skills into consideration? Or did you deem them unimportant in the choices you made?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis realm full of possibilities has all the answers. All the what if\u2019s and maybe\u2019s that are out there for young Riktal and everyone else on his planet. This was only a small glimpse at one of the many possible futures. Where the choices he made, or in this case the choices you made for him, altered his destiny. Some choices are small and do not affect much in the greater scheme of things. But others have groundbreaking consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTake for example the little girl you decided not to help. That decision also altered the course of her future greatly. Cutting off the possibilities she would have been presented with and the outlooks on life she would have had if you had accepted the job. The choices you make not only affect you, but those around you. Just as the opposite of this basic fact is true: you are affected by the choices that others make. What will happen to that little girl? Will she die? Will she grow up hating everyone and everything? Will she become a great savior?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll these possibilities are possible and truth. They have both been decided and have not yet happened in this realm I call my own. Perhaps next time we meet I will allow you to gaze into the mind of yet another possibility either in this world or another. Let you play god with another life, to either bring ruin or glory. So until next we meat may the choices you make be the choices you desire.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI watched her leave for a while, thinking that this might just actually turn out well. There was still a nagging suspicion in the back of my mind that she was after something, but that was only a small part. After all, my family had taught me to be suspicious of everything, even them. I did love them, and I did trust them, but I was still suspicious of them. Perhaps I was more suspicious of my own family than other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t feel like she was out for anything, but perhaps she was able to play the game of plots within plots better than I could. I wouldn\u2019t worry about that now though, if I did I would simply end up going all paranoid and pushing her away like I did everyone else. I couldn\u2019t do that, not to my first real friend. This was a fresh start wasn\u2019t it? A chance to reinvent the old me. The old me didn\u2019t have friends. Didn\u2019t have a need for them. But the new me wanted at least one I realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce she was gone I headed for a fast food place, ordering a dragon burger, the Oroni fries and a chocolate cow shaker. Finding a good booth seat by the window I sat watching the citizens walking by outside while I ate. These were the people I was going to save as a Monster Hunter. What Liz said was right, not everyone I saved or protected would be good. I\u2019d make questionable choices in the future for the good of everyone. Sometimes that would mean having to bend my own moral code. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy job was to hunt and slay monsters. Sometimes it would involve guarding some person or other, sometimes it would involve being hired to fight wars in the place of regular soldiers. Sometimes it would be to simply kill monsters that a city or country couldn\u2019t exterminate on their own, either because they didn\u2019t have the firepower or the Hunter\u2019s to do so. I couldn\u2019t read minds, I could only go by the information I was given, body language, and my own instincts. I had to rely on those I trusted even as I expected others to trust me. A hard thing to do when I found it hard to really trust anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps hanging out with Liz would show me how to do that. She seemed to have a pretty good handle on giving out her trust. I wanted to be a Monster Combat Hunter. It\u2019s what I was born to do. I had never wanted to be anything else. I was coming to realize that even though I had the skills I would need down, I had to work on more than just the combat aspects. Perhaps that was why my mother and father had sent me to this school. To learn those other skills, like how to interact with people. Maybe that was what the principal was trying to tell me before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I shoved my garbage into the trash can and left my tray in the pile I looked around one last time before leaving. Only time would tell if that was the truth or not. I would continue to be suspicious of everyone and everything. But maybe I could try to work a bit harder at trusting people and approaching life with a more laid back attitude. Though I wouldn\u2019t act like big sis Ulicia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, this day had it\u2019s ups and downs.

They said a duck can\u2019t change it\u2019s feathers so easily and they were right. It didn\u2019t matter if I attended school or not. They couldn\u2019t teach me anything new. No one would shed any tears if I skipped out early or failed to show up tomorrow. In fact such actions were probably for the best. I wouldn\u2019t be around to cause problems, or show everyone else up by just being me. I wouldn\u2019t make people uncomfortable by telling them the truth they didn\u2019t want to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I walked out the front door I remembered my promise to Liz. I felt a bit guilty about that, but I was sure she was just like everyone else, playing some angle for her own benefit. The more I thought about it the more logical that truth seemed. It was weird for her to want to be friends with me anyway. I wasn\u2019t even sure why I had let her con me into that position. I had been a fool to be nice to her. A fool to let her get so close. Hadn\u2019t I learned the error of caring about people? Of thinking they cared about me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was a fifth generation Hunter after all. She was actually more dangerous then all these first and second generation losers. She already knew how to play the game. How to weave plots within plots and hide them under innocent words. She was no different than my mother. But I refused to get sucked in. Refused to fall into that friendship trap. My mother\u2019s recent little scheme had opened my eyes before I could fall too deeply into that pit. I needed to go home and purify my mind and body. Close myself off and return to keeping absolutely everyone at arms length. They were all enemies. Isn\u2019t that what my family had taught me? That no one could be trusted. Not even your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo. Especially your family. They were always the worst perpetrators. Always expecting things from you and demanding things. Always assuming simply because you are blood they could get away with it. I was done with this family. Done with the Zelkov name. I wanted out. I had to find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI would find a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHmm. Well this day didn\u2019t turn out quite like you expected did it. I saw it of course, I see everything. Every possible outcome of every possible moment. What would have happened if he had fired on his mother? How much of the school would have been destroyed? Those are possibilities that did not happen along this timeline, but can you imagine if they had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDid this exercise of my boredom teach you anything about yourself? I know it taught me quite a bit about you. Did it end to your liking? It should, since it was your choices that defined his life. What would you have done in the same situation? It is easy to decide for another and judge those actions is it not? Easier than deciding for yourself and not wanting to be judged in turn at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUntil we meet again mortal. Until I am again bored and wish for a bit of amusement or simply to have my curiosity sated. When that time comes how will you chose to play god?</span></div></div>",

Just let us go ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry! It was all Gregory\u2019s idea! I didn\u2019t want to but he talked me into it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFirst Hunters code, all Hunters are responsible for his or her own actions. No one forces you to do anything. Each choice made is a choice the individual makes of his own will. You allowed him to talk you into it. That means you are just as guilty. And quite frankly I don\u2019t care if you are sorry or not, or if you don\u2019t want to fight or not. You don\u2019t have a choice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI lunged forward, snagging them both up by the collar and throwing them behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master, please box us in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the class backed away as the Arena Master manipulated an artifact in his hand. Four walls rose around us, turning as clear as glass once they were in place. I simply stood there watching the two after sitting my gear down against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cChose your weapons. I\u2019m sure the good Master will be able to provide them for you. I won\u2019t start until you make your decision and I won\u2019t allow you to leave until I beat the snot out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a bit more sniveling the one named Gregory asked for a standard sword and board set up. A simple long sword and large circular buckler that attached to the arm and unfolded like a fan appeared from the floor. The other boy got a quick load repeating crossbow that used magic arrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBefore we begin, what\u2019s your name boy? It\u2019s only proper to know who it is I am going to pound into the ground.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I\u2019m Daniel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPleasure to meet you Daniel. Consider me a monster and give me everything you got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I began walking towards them. Not even trying to be quick. Daniel fired an arrow at me that I simply sidestepped. It had been halfhearted to begin with. After a moment Gregory charged at me with his shield up and his sword raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe feinted with the sword and tried to smash the shield into my face but the move was clumsy. He had put too much commitment into the feint, making him go off balance. Twisting to the left was all it took to avoid the sword strike. Daniel was hesitating because I was so close to his partner, a grievous mistake if I had really been a monster. As I walked past, I smashed my elbow into the side of Gregory\u2019s head, continuing to head towards the shooter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn a real fight where they knew what they were doing, this wouldn\u2019t be a bad setup. A ranged person being protected by a shield bearer. But right now they were running on fear. Their training and strategy had gone out the window. I made sure to keep myself between the crossbow and the tank. That was all it took to keep him from shooting at me. I gave an evil grin as I slowly got closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe finally took another shot when I was almost at point blank range. I saw his finger twitch, that was what I had actually been staring at the whole time. So I knew when it would fire. I did a split, letting it sail harmlessly over my head. Popping back to my feet and continuing to take deliberate steps towards him without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCrossbow wasn\u2019t a bad choice, but you are inexperienced at it, I can tell. You should have got something you knew how to use. It wouldn\u2019t have done you any good of course, but at least you wouldn\u2019t be so far out of your element.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slapped the crossbow out of his hands negligently as I cocked my fist back. His eyes went wide in fright as I dropped to one knee and spun, bringing my fist up into Gregory\u2019s stomach under his sword strike. Spittle went flying from his mouth as the sword clattered to the ground and he fell to his knees clutching his abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on. Did you really think I didn\u2019t know you were sneaking up behind me? It was a good try though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned around I brought my other fist up into Daniel\u2019s gut, making him vomit a bit as he sank to the floor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To touch someone else's property without permission and then to use it as if it was their own! Not even caring that the very person they stole it from was in the very same room as them! I should kill them. They deserved to die. a good solid kick augmented with magic strength would take their heads right off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I had promised not to kill them or dismember them. I was allowed to break a few bones though. Three of them each. The thumbs of each hand at least, and maybe a leg bone. That would teach them. I looked down at the two rolling and moaning on the ground. They looked pitiful. Hardly Hunter material. They looked like to normal people I might find on the street on any given day. Seeing that my anger drifted away as suddenly as it had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master! Drop the walls please. I\u2019m done. They are too weak for me to even stay angry at. Punishing them just isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the walls started to lower I turned, grabbing up my gear and leaving the arena. I was already regretting my hasty action. I knew I was stronger then them. What had that really proved? It had just been me soothing my own rage. Hunter\u2019s weren\u2019t supposed to act like this, they were heroes of the people, protecting those weaker then them. There was enough problems with monsters, people didn\u2019t need to be fighting each other, isn\u2019t that what aunt Ceflia had said? Plus I had to uphold the family name. Even if I didn\u2019t like that name, what I did reflected on the rest of my family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was alone in the locker room I pulled off my glasses while sitting on a bench. Rubbing my eyes didn\u2019t change the fact that I had just let my anger get the better of me. Again.  But it did help me ground myself a little more firmly in reality and keep me calm. Shoving my recovered weapons back in my duffle bag I pulled the heart crystal out of my pouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhy hadn\u2019t I even thought of offering it to Liz? She had done most of the work after all. I had just kept it\u2019s attention on me while she had chipped away at the shield. By all rights she had more claim to this crystal than I did. Wasn\u2019t that the Hunter\u2019s code I had grown up learning? Was I truly that terrible a person? Or was it just because I didn\u2019t completely trust her yet? She said she wanted to be friends, but I really didn\u2019t know what that meant or how to act. I had never had a friend before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting here caught up in my own thoughts wouldn\u2019t do me any good. The class wasn\u2019t over yet and I needed to go back out there. I couldn\u2019t make a bigger scene then I already had. So hiding the crystal in my bag, I threw on the mask of indifference I had learned to wear before heading back out into the Arena. It didn\u2019t take long to climb the bleachers and take my seat next to Liz again. She gave me a small nod without looking at me as she watched the groups on the floor fighting against different monsters. We sat in silence, it wasn\u2019t a companionable one, but it wasn\u2019t really uncomfortable either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou had some pretty nice moves against that Sengwen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was most definitely miffed that I hadn\u2019t even offered her the crystal. She had to be. That was the only explanation for these suddenly weird vibes I was getting. Stop Riktal. Don\u2019t assume anything. You know better than to assume. Find out first hand before making any judgments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you mad about something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was mad. I could see it in the slight set of her jaw and the slightly clipped tone she was using.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs this about the heart crystal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook sorry about that. I pocketed it without thinking. I\u2019m not really used to working with others so I just sort of reacted how I normally would. It\u2019s yours if you want it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKeep it. I don\u2019t want it anymore. I didn\u2019t really want it in the first place but it would have been nice to be thought of and treated like an equal. Treated like another Hunter. I thought we were really starting to connect. We have a bit in common and I was coming to like you. I thought we might have been able to be friends. But I see you and I think differently about what that means.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stood up and walked off farther down the bleachers, sitting back down and making it clear she wanted to be alone. This whole friendship thing was a lot harder then it seemed on paper. I had studied the basic ideas and the theories of how to interact with people of course, but they didn\u2019t always react how they were supposed to. I knew how to deal with businessmen, government officials, and military types. I could play politics and speak with a silver tongue like the best of them, but dealing with people my own age like this, I just felt clueless. I wouldn\u2019t have thought such a small thing would have made her so mad. Hadn\u2019t I told her I wasn\u2019t used to working with others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I returned my attention to watching the rest of the class fight in groups. Sometimes their teams were switched up or certain people were chosen to lead and issue orders. I could see the slow improvement but they were still far from being good enough for the Hunter\u2019s Exam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell finally rang and I wasted no time in grabbing my gear from the locker before going back to the classroom. I was the first one in the room, a fact I thought would hold true most of the time. These kids didn\u2019t realize the importance of being early. More interested in hanging out and living such laid back lives. That kind of thinking would get them killed. If they continued to act like this was a regular high school and continued to think of themselves as just regular people, they wouldn\u2019t live long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they got out into the real world they would be in for a rude awakening. Someone or something would kill them because they weren\u2019t prepared. Because they hadn\u2019t taken this training seriously. The rest of the class finally entered the room in their little groups, giving me a speculative eyeball or two. Liz came in alone, not even bothering to look at me before taking her seat and looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t know if I was supposed to be bothered by her actions or not. Was this how easily friendships broke? If it was then I was better off without them. Right now I felt nothing over the fact that she wasn\u2019t speaking to me. It was just another fact of how things were. I felt no real urge to try to make things right between us either. It was her problem not mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter the quick role call the teacher started in on his lesson. I learned nothing I didn\u2019t already know, though the information was probably new to everyone else. That is, if they were even paying attention which I highly doubted. But it would be improper of me to not at least try and seem interested. The teacher was trying his best to teach them how to survive after all. He should know there was at least one person in the room that appreciated his efforts, even if that one person was the one who already knew it all.</span></div></div>",

But as soon as he walked out the door the talking started. People moved into their own little groups and talked about some of the most unimportant things, like their favorite band, or which boy or girl was cuter. A few brave souls approached me cautiously, I could see they had already formed an opinion of me but still wanted to be associated with my name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo it\u2019s really true? You\u2019re from the Zelkov family?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s true. Great deduction skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI really didn\u2019t feel like dealing with them right now. Asking such an obvious question only brought their intelligence into question, didn\u2019t they know that? The slight I had done to Liz was really starting to bug me now. Having a whole class to do nothing but let my mind mull over whatever if felt like while she sat on the other side of the room giving off an aura of unwelcome had gotten to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe smile on the face of the girl who had asked the question never faltered. I\u2019d give her credit, she could hold a fake grin with the best of them. Though maybe I gave her too much credit and the insult just went over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe name is Izabelle. I\u2019m a second generation Hunter on my mom\u2019s side. Think you could give me some tips on how to be a better Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou want tips? I can give you tips. Tip one: quit screwing around and take this place seriously. Tip two: Expect to die before you hit twenty one. Tip three: Invest in really good weapons. If you continue to think you are still just an ordinary high school student and not a Hunter in training then you won\u2019t live long. Throw out any ideas you have of having a \u201cnormal\u201d life. You chose to come to this school and learn to be a Hunter. You are no longer normal. You no longer have the option to be normal. The things you learn here cannot be unlearned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThings like love and what the hot new fashion trend is? They mean nothing. If you don\u2019t dedicate your everything to becoming a Hunter then you will die. Good weapons can make up for some of the skill you lack, but never assume you are the best or unbeatable or invincible. You can get taken out by someone much weaker than you if they have a better weapon or they catch you when your guard is lowered.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs a Hunter you must be ready to sacrifice your everything to do the job you have been given. And that is to protect normal people who cannot protect themselves from monsters. We aren\u2019t in it for fame, or fortune, or honor. Those things are just side effects of what we are meant to do. If you lose sight of your main goal and chase after dreams of glory and riches then you fail as a Hunter. Innocent people will die because of that fact. You might think I am being overdramatic but I am not. I am simply stating facts. Facts you should have been told in some way when you entered this academy. If I am scaring you then good, you should be scared. This is your life on the line. But it is also the lives of thousands of others who will be depending on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe small group around me looked at each other a bit worried, wondering how to respond to what I had said. I saw Liz watching me with thoughtful eyes, nodding her head slightly at my words. She wasn\u2019t nodding at me directly, just agreeing with what I had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in then and everyone resumed their seats. After making sure everyone was here he began his lesson on the Cawmacaw. Talking about its weaknesses and strength as well as it\u2019s environment. As he began discussing common tactics that could be used the door opened and a woman in a trim business suit, small wire framed glasses and lustrous black hair came in the door. She whispered to the teacher a moment before he nodded and pointed in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! You\u2019re wanted by your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sigh I grabbed my bag and headed out the door with the woman. What did my mother want now? Couldn\u2019t it have waited until I got home at least? The clacking of her high heels echoed down the hallway as she walked at my side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Inga by the way, one of your mother\u2019s aides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope you are already looking for another job because my mother goes through you guys like an armor piecing round through paper. Longest I\u2019ve seen one last was six months. It\u2019s nothing you guys do wrong just so you know, that\u2019s just how she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInga fell silent again, escorting me to a private room where she asked me to sit down. I ignored the invitation, instead standing by the window and looking outside. What was my mother up to? Where was she anyway? It was unlike her to be late for a meeting that she herself had set up. I heard the door open finally and turned with a few choice words on my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWords which died out as the small white haired girl with red eyes came in the door after my mother. She stood barely four and a half feet tall and had a body like a stick. She carried around a teddy bear in one hand and had a look of perpetual vacant eyed dreaminess on her face. Even though my mother had her usual cheery and flippant demeanor about her there was something in her face that told me she was worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling! How are you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe same as I was this morning mother. So care to tell me the reason you called me here? The real reason. And can we cut through all the regular back and forth and civil pleasantries? I assume you are here on Hunter business or you wouldn\u2019t have brought one of your aides.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe motioned to a seat as her work face dropped into place. I took it across the table from her as the little girl sat down in another chair nearby. Those vacant eyes making me think of a puppet being pulled by invisible strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cVery well. I got a job for you. Protecting Asala here. Me and your father can\u2019t ,we were contracted to clear out some caverns in Bornica, we won\u2019t be back for a few days. Your sister is on a job now for the military so probably won\u2019t be back for a few weeks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause even though you are terrible with  people your own age, you are great with kids. I also know how skilled you are. There aren\u2019t many people I can trust with this task.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s so special about her? Foreign dignitaries child?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a monster summoner. But her powers are a bit unstable. She can\u2019t always control the monsters she summons because her powers awakened early. It seems they are influenced by her mood and her emotions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can see why you wouldn\u2019t trust many Hunters with this task. A lot of them are pretty narrow minded about those with what they call the cursed magic. Yourself included mother. You tolerate them and let them alone but you still don\u2019t like them. But most Hunter\u2019s would rather kill her simply because she is who she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not true dear!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt is. I\u2019ve heard the way you talk about them. I know you\u2019ve dealt with them before but you are never too happy about it. I\u2019ve heard some of the discussions you have had with father when you thought I was sleeping. Deny it if you want but it doesn\u2019t really matter to me. It\u2019s not a view I share. So what about her parents? Will I have to protect them too? Or did they give her up once they found out about her ability?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDead. Murdered in front of her. That\u2019s why her power awakened. It will only be for a few days. I know someone who is also a summoner willing to take her in but she won\u2019t be able to get away from her work until then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLikelihood of danger?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDirect threats to her life is minimal. Mostly you will be needed in case she summons a monster that she can\u2019t control. It happens more when she is emotionally unstable; fear, intense sadness, that kind of thing. Plus any dangers once people find out what she can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd there is no one else you can trust to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell\u2026 there is one other person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you ask them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause it\u2019s Pelei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my understanding. Pelei was a good guy and a great Hunter. But he had strange tastes. Very touchy-feely and wanting to dress up anything he thought was cute. His obsessions could be quite scary sometimes. A girl like this would be eaten up by Pelei. He might even end up scaring her into summoning monsters. There would be no danger of him harming her or doing anything to her physically; but on the other hand he would have no problem ripping her clothes off and shoving some new outfit on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking at the vomit colored green dress she was wearing now I could only imagine that would be the first thing he did if he saw her. On the other hand my mother was asking me to do this as an official job even after stating she didn\u2019t want me to become an official Hunter yet. That seemed a bit hypocritical to me. She would be in good hands with Pelei and he could handle anything she summoned without a problem. I wasn\u2019t exactly needed here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPelei is the better choice still, he is an official Hunter, something I might remind you, I am not because someone didn\u2019t want me to take the exams. He has more experience than me too. So why do you want me over him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at the girl a moment and then at the table, a small smile spreading across her lips as her eyes grew a bit distant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you\u2019re family.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I just knew I could count on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI expect to be paid for this though since this is an official job. And I will still expect my living allowance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou won\u2019t do this for free? For little old me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a chance mother. Nothing less than ten thousand Reul. I\u2019d charge more but I\u2019m not an official hunter yet and I\u2019m being nice in giving you a family discount.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you feel any remorse at breaking your poor mothers bank account?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot an ounce.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother sighed dramatically before waving her hand absently at Inga who was standing against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTransfer the money into his account for me would you please? Thanks ever so much. Oh and Riktal, I still expect you to attend school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can expect it all you want but I can\u2019t promise it if I am going to protect the girl around the clock.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are such a willful child! It hurts me that you don\u2019t listen to your mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so broken up over the fact that you are hurt. Don\u2019t you see me crying you a river of invisible tears?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at the sky shaking her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhere did I go wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you want the list in alphabetical order or just bullet points?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head again but didn\u2019t say anything, just pushing her chair back to get to her feet. I stood up when my mother did, letting her embrace me in a hug before saying she had to get going. Before she left I called out to her, passing on big sis Ulicia\u2019s love. She blew me a final kiss before departing, leaving me alone with the little girl. Even though I was staring at the back of her head, she didn\u2019t turn around or move. As if those invisible puppeteer strings that had been moving her had suddenly been cut. Pulling out the chair next to her, I swung it around a bit so we were face to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala huh? I once knew an Asala. Tasted great on corn chips. Wait\u2026 never mind, that was salsa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe corner of her mouth twitched for just a fraction a second and I smiled. So she knew what was going on around her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you are probably really scared right now and I don\u2019t blame you. You don\u2019t know me or probably anyone else. All you know is you suddenly got a new power you don\u2019t understand and your mom and dad are dead. Then I bet somebody just ripped you away from all of that and said something like you could never go back or that you had to leave. Now you are waiting for someone to come take you to yet another place farther away from anything you know to teach you how to control your power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI also bet no one stopped to find out what you thought about all of this. And I\u2019d wager no one who has found out about your ability has treated you very nicely. Even Hunter\u2019s like my mom who tolerate summoner\u2019s were probably a bit rude and inconsiderate. So I don\u2019t blame you for trying not to show any emotions if you are afraid I will be like the rest of them. But I must tell you, that dead fish face you keep giving me is creeping me out. And in case you didn\u2019t hear what I told my mother, I\u2019m not like other Hunter\u2019s. I have no problem with summoner\u2019s or their abilities. I don\u2019t think their magic is cursed any more than my own is. It\u2019s just different that\u2019s all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe name\u2019s Riktal Zelkov. You might have already known that of course, but formal introductions are important. Mind telling me your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept the smile on my face and didn\u2019t drop my hand. She just sat there staring at it and I sat there offering it. This was mind games 101 that I had learned long ago. On the whole humans didn\u2019t like when nothing was happening. They had a need to fill the silence, or a need to take action. If you created a situation of inaction and silence that only they can break such as this while giving off the air that it won\u2019t end until they do something, ninety percent of the time they will be unable to do nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy smile grew wider as she slowly raised her hand and took mine. She raised her teddy bear to her mouth but I didn\u2019t hear any sound come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that just won\u2019t do little miss. I can\u2019t read your mind and I can\u2019t hear you through your friend there. Unless of course you can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to talk. Then it\u2019s a different matter entirely. Nothing wrong with it and I won\u2019t push you. And I guess that was inconsiderate of me not to ask that first. Seems I\u2019ve been doing inconsiderate things to girls all the way around today. So I guess I should ask now, do you want to talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan you talk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t move for a minute but finally nodded her head up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that\u2019s good at least. Could you imagine being unable to talk and trying to call for help when you really need it? Or laughing without any sound coming out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw out my hand and opened my mouth wide, miming calling for help but not making a sound. I also put my hands on my belly and shook up and down in a parody of laughter but not making a peep. Again I saw her mouth twitch, but this time she didn\u2019t try to hide it as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was making progress. I was establishing a bond of trust between us. One I would need if I was going to protect her. She had to believe that she could come to me with any trouble and feel safe around me. I was willing to work around her reticence to talk. Willing to decipher her body language and moods. It wasn\u2019t the first time I had dealt with someone who couldn\u2019t talk after all. The other secret was to try not to talk down to them. Especially ones that were around eleven years old as this one looked. If you acted like they were stupid because they were younger, they picked up on that fairly quickly. But at the same time you needed to avoid using too many words they didn\u2019t understand. It was a fine line and a hard art to master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I\u2019m going to ask you a few simple yes and no questions. Think you could answer them with a nod of your head? If you don\u2019t want to answer that\u2019s fine too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick nod of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you like stuffed animals?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid they let you pack any extra clothes or toys before they took you away?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you trying not to show your emotions because you think that will make a monster appear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let my voice drop down a notch, filling it with a bit of compassion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you miss your mom and dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t move for a moment but finally her eyes got a bit watery as her head dipped down and then back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you afraid? Lonely? Confused?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a slow nod to all of those questions as the tears finally began to flow and a soft mewling sound came from her throat. I reached out and pulled her into my arms, rocking her back and forth slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCry it all out. It\u2019s not good for a pretty little girl like you to hold it all inside. If some mean nasty monster appears then I\u2019ll just have to make it go away won\u2019t I? That\u2019s my job after all. I\u2019m not going to let anything hurt you while you are under my watch. I won\u2019t tell anyone anything you tell me or let slip anything you do. To me you aren\u2019t a monster summoner. To me you are just Asala, a little girl who just lost her family and is now all alone in this big scary world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe buried her face in my chest to muffle her wails as I stroked her hair gently. Finally her waterworks died down into sniffles and I pulled her away from me slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFeel a little better?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRubbing her eyes she slowly nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Then how do you feel about us going out on a bit of a shopping spree on the town. We can get you some new clothes, maybe another stuffed animal or two and a few toiletries to call your own. You might not be here long, but that\u2019s no reason I can\u2019t try my hardest to make you feel like you are home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she hunched her shoulders and shrunk back a bit at the suggestion I nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfraid of crowds too aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I will be with you the whole time and I promised not to let anything bad happen to you remember. If you don\u2019t trust me just shake your head no and we can go home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally she shook her head yes and I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne last question before we go. Are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head up and down as she clutched at her stomach. I put my hand on her head just as the bell rang, signaling the end of the school day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen lets go on our date shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely got to eat first. If I know little boys and girls, you are always hungry. Sometimes bottomless pits it seems. Since you probably never said a word to anyone else I bet my mother didn\u2019t even stop to feed you lunch. And if I know my mother she probably gave you a bowl of porridge for breakfast and thought that was enough. Come on, I know a nice little caf\u00e9 that can make just about anything you could want no matter what time of day it is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shouldered my bag and opened the door, exiting into the hall a little before the girl to make sure it was safe. I didn\u2019t expect anything to happen so soon, but it wouldn\u2019t do to lower my guard for anything. As we walked out the front door I saw some of the other students staring at us and whispering behind their hands. More specifically they were staring at Asala, probably coming up with some off the wall theories as to who she was and her relationship with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took her to a place called The Pipe, telling her to order whatever she wanted. It took a bit of pointing at the menu but soon enough we were sitting alone waiting for our meal. she stared at the table top quietly, trying to turn invisible.  I watched her for a little bit before finally speaking softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know how you feel and what you are going through. I had a little sister who died when she was about your age. That was about three years ago now. I\u2019m not going to lie. It hurts and it will for a long time to come. That pain dulls with time, but it never completely goes away. You might not believe me now, but there will come a time when you realize you\u2019ve just gone a day or a week or a month without thinking about them. Then something will suddenly remind you of them and that feeling comes flooding back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thought. Thinking you are going to forget about them. Forget what they look like, what they sound like. Your memories of the times you had with them slowly blurring until you aren\u2019t sure if it really happened or not. And I know you don\u2019t want to forget those things. You shouldn\u2019t have to forget them. It\u2019s even harder for you because you don\u2019t even have a single photo to remind you of them do you? At least I was able to keep that much along with a few other things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I hadn\u2019t actually asked her a question she was bobbing her head up and down as if agreeing to what I was saying. Seeing the state she was in and the way she was barely keeping it together made my heart break. She reminded me so much of Olia. I wasn\u2019t sure what exactly made me decide to reveal my secret to her but I somehow felt she needed my unique ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf I told you a secret would you keep it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t A head nod in affirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure? You seem to be a little chatterbox to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer lips curled upwards but she nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a special magic just like you. I can\u2019t do anything fancy like summon monsters but I can make things come alive. I\u2019m not talking about just animating say your teddy bear to make it dance around. No, mine is a bit more unique than that. I don\u2019t tell many people about it because it\u2019s a magic most people don\u2019t understand. And anything people don\u2019t understand they are afraid of. They label it as taboo or cursed. My great-great grandfather had the same ability as me and that\u2019s actually how I learned to use my power.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou see, if I have a picture or a favorite object that a person handled often, something that is imprinted with their essence, I can make them live again. It\u2019s not actually real life, and it\u2019s not like I call the souls back from the dead. At least I don\u2019t think so. It is more like I recreate who they were while they were alive. The more of themselves that was imprinted on the item and the more I know about them, the more complete they become.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy great-great grandfather died a long time ago, but I had his picture and I had heard stories about him. Because of that I was able to see him in person whenever I went to sleep and I could talk to him just like I am talking to you. That\u2019s how I found out about this magic and how to use it, he taught me in my dreams. It was a bit of trial and error in learning of course, and I made mistakes just like you will while learning your power. But I never gave up until I mastered it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell me, that teddy bear you are holding, did your mom and dad give it to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head slowly, her eyes a bit wide at what I had just told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMind if I see it for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe handed me the bear across the table after a moment of hesitation.  After looking both ways to make sure no one was watching I cut my finger with my belt knife and let a few drops of blood drip onto the bears head. I concentrated, calling on my magic until the bear glowed with a purple aura. I began to sweat like I did every time I used this power. It wasn\u2019t that powerful to begin with and it took effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy blood spread out like a thin coating across the entire bear, turning it a muddy red color. This was the hard part, giving it the unique twist of the mind needed to pull out the essence of her mother and father before attaching it to the stuffed creature again. The muddy red color began to pull back from the brown fur, moving as if being sucked into the eyes, changing the black glass buttons into a crimson to match her own. My magic rippled and twisted as I anchored it all in the state between the dream world and the real one. Finally I was done and the aura was sucked into the eyes as well, causing them to glow brightly as if they had an intelligence of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave a short gasp before wiping at my nosebleed and handing the bear back to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow you can see and hear them whenever you go to sleep. Just think about them while holding onto that bear and you will dream of them as if they are really there. There won\u2019t be much to them right now, little more than pictures that will sometimes move and say a few words. But if you ever want to tell me about them I can add that into the magics memory banks to create a more complete essence. You can call on me anytime, even once you get to your new place with your new teacher. You have my name and you know how to get a hold of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur meal came a moment later and she began to eat with a very thoughtful look on her face. She kept touching the bear\u2019s new red colored eyes delicately, as if afraid they were suddenly real and she would hurt it. I was suddenly ravenous. Using my ability on such a large object had burned a lot of energy. Great-great grandfather had warned me to keep quiet about my ability. He said the Priests of The One God and many people thought this skill bordered on the sacrilegious. As if I was somehow transgressing against the order of life itself. Even though this was just a unique form of magic and the spirits were simply shadows of the real thing, people still believed it was calling back the spirits of the dead to trap them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hadn\u2019t believed him at first, until I did research on my own while I was awake, finding other instances of people like me. They were treated like criminals and hunted down like they were some form of new monster. Tortured by people who had once called them friends and family. It was no wonder those with this skill didn\u2019t make it very public. I knew I had taken a chance in telling her my secret, but I also felt that she wouldn\u2019t tell anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was halfway through her meal when she suddenly lowered her fork, putting the piece of sausage back on the plate. She looked at her food a moment and then at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy\u2026 my name is Asala Heinfield.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA pleasure to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill\u2026 will it really work? You weren\u2019t lying?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer voice was small and soft. Almost pleading as she spoke a but stiltedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPromise. Cross my heart and hope to die.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about what I can do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot in the slightest. Once you can properly control the monsters you summon it will be up to you to decide how to use your ability. Will you help people with it? Or will you hurt them? Now that is an answer that I do care about. My job is to protect people. Right now it is you, but in the larger picture it is everyone. If you decide to hurt people on purpose with your ability then I will have to stop you. But it wouldn\u2019t be because you are a summoner, it would be because you are hurting people I am supposed to protect. Right now if you were to hurt someone I don\u2019t think it would be on purpose. So why should I hold anything against you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou sound like my daddy. I got my ability from my mommy\u2019s side of the family. She didn\u2019t have it but grandpa did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds like your daddy was a smart man..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI miss him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I call you big brother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure if I can call you little sis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that. I wish you were really my big brother. You\u2019re different from everyone else. I feel safe around you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m ugly. You can\u2019t always trust a handsome face, but you can trust an ugly one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled at that, this time her laughter sounding more natural and not like she was trying to bite down on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy daddy used to say things like that too. Like never trust boys with teeth that sparkled. Or don\u2019t go out with a boy who wears prettier dresses than you. But that\u2019s not it. You feel\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to explain it. You just feel like a big brother. And for the record, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ugly.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWell you feel like a little sister\u2026 shrimp. Now hurry up and finish, we still got a long day ahead of us. And I won\u2019t allow you to keep moping around all day. There\u2019s a time and place for everything, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy a few things here and there. It\u2019s not a crime or anything to be happy even at a time like this. It doesn\u2019t mean you loved them any less. There is no law that says you have to go around like you are at their funeral all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMommy said something like that too when grandpa died. That he wouldn\u2019t want us to be sad all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? That proves I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe still looked a bit melancholy as she finished her meal but the edge had been taken off her grief. I had to wonder just how badly everyone else had overlooked her the last three days she had been carted around by one person or another. It hadn\u2019t been all that hard to get her to open up. Any half competent person should have been able to do it if they had simply put a bit of time and effort in. But that was the nature of adults I found, always so busy and wrapped up in their own problems and their own things they forget about other people. I held no illusions, I would end up being the same way to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce we were done with the meal I paid our tab and we left. First stop would be the clothing store. She needed new clothes, and ones that looked better on her. I had no doubt she didn\u2019t like what she was wearing. She stuck close to me, but no longer as afraid as when we had first met. She held onto the bear though like it was a lifeline, and I suppose now it was in more ways than one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI talked with her a little bit about small things, trying to draw her into more conversation both about her family and about herself. It was all part of the grieving process that she needed to go through. The longer she held it all in the worse it would be for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she tried to hide the fact, I could tell she was enjoying herself. She would laugh at a joke or giggle at some private thought. She went starry eyed over the clothes in the store and posed in the mirror while trying them on. She hadn\u2019t forgotten her grief, it was still an ever present shadow on her face. But she was slowly coming to realize I wasn\u2019t lying when I had said making herself feel good wasn\u2019t some sin against the memory of her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter about four solid hours of shopping and snacking on treats from random shops I was loaded down with four bags stuffed with new clothes, a new pair of shoes, a few pieces of jewelry, a new stuffed animal and some personal hygiene items such as her own toothbrush and comb, deodorant and perfume. Though even all this wasn\u2019t half the weight of the duffle bag on my back so carrying it was no big deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe just crossed the bridge that separated the main part of the city from the residential area when a red circle appeared in front of us. A hand emerged and then a hunched over grey body. Asala hid behind my legs as the huge glowing green eyes focused on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRelax, you just summoned a Spleef. Probably because you are feeling so happy and content right now. That made your power activate without you wanting it to and pulled this guy from wherever he was.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe creature walked over to us, its knuckles dragging the ground, hunching down and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s a Spleef? And what does it want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell, I guess the best description for it is a Golem. It\u2019s a magically constructed monster that has a will of it\u2019s own. It\u2019s a subclass of giant and as you can see it is docile normally. When it get\u2019s angry it\u2019s eyes change to blue and it gets big. About twice as big as me. And it\u2019s powerful. As to what it wants, I think it want\u2019s you to command it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou summoned it. In so doing my guess is it latched onto your magical outburst. It imprinted on you so to speak. So now it is your pet. It will obey your orders and your orders alone, no matter what they are without question. They are a symbiotic creature. Even though they can survive and reproduce out in the wild, they need magic to sustain themselves. That\u2019s why they usually gather around magical nodes, or carry small stones filled with magic with them when they roam.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think this is a good thing, it will eat your magic so to speak. The stuff you naturally bleed off from being unstable. He will help you not accidentally summon other things when you get scared or angry or whatever other emotion you might have at any given time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut\u2026 but I don\u2019t want him following me around! And how do I even know what you say is true?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEasy enough way to find out. Give him an order. I told you before, they are constructed creatures. As much as they look real they are not. They have no real souls of their own like other monsters do. Their will is only a very primitive one. Tell it to turn into a ring on your finger, or a necklace or something. If it really has attached itself to you, it will do so without question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026 Spleef, turn into a ring on my right hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Spleef\u2019s eyes sparkled for a second before it seemed to compress in on itself, turning into a little ball. A hole widened through the ball as it shot towards Asala\u2019s right hand and solidified into a grey ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should give it a name. That will make it easier to command it. Names have power and a magic all their own.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpleef. I name you\u2026 I name you Orse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe ring glimmered a moment and then went still as I chuckled at the look of surprise on Asala\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOrse?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI had a cat named Orse once. It was the only name I could think of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ruffled her hair as I got her walking again, leading her to the house and inside the gate. After dropping the bags to the floor I nodded my chin to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTomorrow I will show you how to summon and control your new monster. I really only know the theories behind it and I can\u2019t teach you anything else about your summoning abilities, but I know monsters. Anyone can tame a Spleef\u2026 if they can find one. They are pretty hard to find though. Some Hunters spend year\u2019s tracking down a nest of them in order to make a familiar out of one. He will be a strong guardian for you in the future. They may only live about eight to ten years but I\u2019m sure he will get you through some difficult times. But for now, go get cleaned up and get to bed. You had a long day and tomorrow will be even longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right big brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe dug out her pajamas and some clean underwear, heading off upstairs after I gave her directions on how to get to the bathroom. I heard the water running and I smiled to myself while picking up the rest of her bags and heading up the stairs as well. It had been a while since I had heard someone call me big brother in anything but my dreams. I had forgotten how good it made me feel. I had to be careful how attached I got to her though or it would be difficult to see her leave when this was over. I had already grown fond of her and it would be hard enough as it was. But that was no reason to push her away. She needed some form of family right now and at the moment I was it. She would have her parent\u2019s in her dreams, but she needed someone solid that she could touch as well. And right now, I felt I needed a little sister again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, well. A small facet of Riktal is revealed. A facet that only appeared because of the unique choices he made. Or should I say you made. It must make you wonder, would he have revealed such a secret about himself if he had gone shopping first? Would the thought ever crossed his mind if he had never kept the heart crystal to begin with and offered it to Liz instead? Perhaps the decision all began from his very first words. From his decision to tell the class only his first name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust what long ranging affects does each choice have on the outcome of a situation? Is there any way to tell all the time? What small change, or what order in which information is revealed affects the thought process that ends in this or that choice? For each second there is an infinite possible number of choices. All of them slightly different from the last. Some of them make little to no difference on the course of events. But as the choices begin to diverge, so too does the outcomes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis is why this world is so dreamlike. Why I have the ability to grant you temporary godhood. Because all choices have happened, will happen, might happen and must happen all at once. Decisions and choices made affect not only the individual but also all those around him. That in turn affects how they think and react. Even if the words are the same, the context can change depending on the choice. A cheerful goodbye in one possibility and those same words a tear jerking farewell in another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe window closes, though it will open again. And you will be there to make new choices, to lead young Riktal down a new possibility. I know this. For I know everything. I see everything. Your return has been destined to happen for it has already happened a thousand times before and will happen a thousand times after. Good day to you mortal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI wasn\u2019t exactly sure how to reply to that so I fell back on what I knew, I kept silent. We went back to eating, some of the sadness had left her face. I could only hope I had helped alleviate some of that for her and she would see that she didn\u2019t have to be sad all the time. That finding moments of happiness even when she was grieving wasn\u2019t a sin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finally finished eating and left, heading for a nearby clothing store. She stuck close to me, no longer quite so afraid but still wary. The bear in her hands being crushed tightly to her chest as if that would somehow make my magic activate while she was awake. I had to ensure she never lost that bear, if she did she would be devastated. I also had to be careful not to get too attached to her. Doing so would make our eventual parting all the harder. She couldn\u2019t stay here and I couldn\u2019t go with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tried to draw out a little more information about her and her parents bit by bit. To start the grieving process so it didn\u2019t eat her up from the inside out. Asala answered some of them but still seemed a bit reserved overall. That was to be expected, you didn\u2019t get over something like this in a day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut as she tried on new dresses and posed in the mirror, hints of the little girl she must have been before poked through the veil of depression around her. It never went away completely, but I could see it was pushed back every so often. She didn\u2019t talk much to me unless I initiated the conversation, but I could feel the bond between us deepening. She needed someone she could trust right now. Someone she could consider as family. A real person and not the parents she would only be able to see in her dreams. That was part of the reason she had latched onto me so easily. Because I had offered her that hand in the darkness when she had needed it most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter almost four hours of shopping and snacking on treats from random stores we were finally heading back home. The bag on my back weight almost twice what the four bags in my hands weighed. Yet the ones in my hands carried the hopes and dreams of normalcy for Asala. At least some normalcy. And that weight made them feel to be the heavier burden. A burden I was glad to carry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShortly after we crossed the bridge into the residential district a red rimed circle appeared on the ground in front of us. Asala gave a small whimper of fear as she hid behind my leg. A large purple tentacle emerged from the hole, the sucker pads gripping the street in front of me. A moment later another one appeared and then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCalmly I set the bags down and looked back at Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait here for just a moment ok? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began walking forward as a fourth tentacle slapped to the ground on the side of the hole. Slipping off my duffle bag I reached inside without taking my eyes off the monster and  grabbed the first hilt I could find before dropping the bag to the ground. I glanced at the blade and saw it was a modified version of an Arabian scimitar, perfect for my needs. Its steeply curved blade wouldn\u2019t catch on flesh or bone, sliding through it easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the head of the Hool rose out of the hole in the ground I negligently brought the sword around in an arc, slicing through the neck just below where the feathers ended. My strike almost took the head clean off, the owl like head not even having time to let out a gurgle as the head tipped backwards. I kicked downwards even as I brought the sword around in a backhand sweep, severing the tentacles from their grip on the ground. By the time the corpse began to spurt out ink from the wound, the owl-octopus creature was already falling back through the summoning hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA bit of the ink splattered on my boots and I let out a tsk of displeasure. Hool ink was hard to get off and it began to stink after a few hours. Even as I turned to replace my sword in the bag the portal closed up again. It took only a moment to shrug the duffle onto my back again and pick up the shopping bags. With a jerk of my head I started on towards the house, Asala following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it my new little sis. I can take care of anything you can dish out. Until you learn control it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut what if I summon something big and scary that could hurt lots of people? I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I will stop it and I will protect you at the same time. You aren\u2019t summoning these things on purpose are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen there is nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut people blame me when I do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen people are idiots. Do you blame the clouds when it rains? Or the cow for producing milk? It is just a natural action and reaction. Water evaporated and gathers in the clouds until it gets too heavy and falls. The clouds don\u2019t just say to themselves, hey it\u2019s a nice sunny day and I haven\u2019t rained in a while, so let me dump some water on their heads. The cow doesn\u2019t think to itself, hey I\u2019m tired of being milked every day, so today I just won\u2019t produce any at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knelt down and looked her directly in the eyes so she could see how serious I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet this through your thick skull. This. Is. Not. Your. Fault. If you want to be my little sister you have to be smart. I won\u2019t stand for having a dummy of a sister who can\u2019t accept such a simple truth. I\u2019ll tell you that a million times until you believe it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlowly she smiled with eyes that had suddenly begun to water. She wrapped her arms around my neck and hugged me tightly. Her voice was a whisper as it tickled my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you big brother. I think I can believe it when you say it. Because you make it sound real.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI patted her back before pushing her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood, now go get yourself cleaned up. We have a long day tomorrow and you need your sleep. Besides, isn\u2019t there a few people waiting for you in your dreams?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked down at her teddy bear and grinned a bit. As she began pulling out her night wear and clean underclothes I asked to have the bear for a little bit. She looked uncertain until I assured her I was just going to add a bit more magic to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe ran upstairs quickly after I told her how to get to the restroom, the water beginning to run moments later. I grabbed the rest of the bags and took them to my room, leaving the door open so she knew where I was. While she took her bath I sat on my bed adding more substance to the mother and father she would meet in her dreams. Putting everything I had learned about them today into it. These phantoms were far from complete but for now it would be enough. Because right now it was more than she had to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting the bear by the pillow I dug in my closet, pulling out a big tattered box filled with stuffed animals. Mementoes of my sister my mother had wanted to throw out but I had rescued without her knowledge. Pushing them around I found the little blue stuffed bunny missing one eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey sis. Long time no see huh? I\u2019m sorry I haven\u2019t thought about you for a while, things just came up. You know? But I got a lot to tell you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held the rabbit close to my chest. It had been my sisters favorite. I had given her Mr. Snuggles for her third birthday and she was never seen without it from that day forward. It had been the first major project I had undertaken with my power. It had given me a headache for two days straight and made me sick afterwards. But every little detail of her was inside. Every strand of hair, every movement she had ever made, right down to her speech patterns and the smell that had surrounded her. Sometimes I thought I could still smell that unique aroma on the rabbit itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala came in and climbed into bed, pulling her teddy in close to her chest as she yawned sleepily. As I began making up a bed on the floor she stopped me with her soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWill you sleep with me? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave her a smile as I turned off the lights and slipped under the covers with her. She closed her eyes and I closed mine. Olia\u2019s blue rabbit clutched just as firmly to my chest as the bear was to Asala\u2019s<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, well. A small facet of Riktal is revealed.

I know a small diner that won\u2019t have a lot of people but right now is their late lunch early dinner rush. Since you probably don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people we can wait about half an hour or so until it empties out a bit. If your tummy can\u2019t wait we can get a few snacks along the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led her out of the room, letting my eyes move back and forth as I assessed every possible potential threat. These might just be ordinary school kids, but they were also Hunter\u2019s in training. No matter how unskilled they were, it only took a moment of laxness. But we got off school grounds with nothing more exciting than a few speculative glances and hidden whispers as we passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInto town we went. I tried to engage her in conversation with more yes and no questions, but she seemed to have used up her willingness to cooperate. Perhaps the prospect of going into the crowds was making her draw into herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe stopped in at a clothing store and she tried on a few dresses. She didn\u2019t act much like most girls I knew while on a shopping spree. There were hints of that interest in the clothes and the jewelry, but mostly it was like she didn\u2019t care what she wore. In the end I had to decide on a few different dresses. Though I was no expert, I got ones I thought complimented her well and were pretty on top of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we came out of the store we ran into Liz. She looked down at the girl then back up at me with a raised eyebrow but didn\u2019t say anything. I turned to walk away but she stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I looked back she opened her mouth to say something before looking at the ground a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen. I think I was a bit hasty earlier. I realized that our views on things are a bit different because of our backgrounds. You didn\u2019t mean anything by what you did. It seems I\u2019m not so good at this whole friendship and relationship thing as I thought I was. Think we could put this behind us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt my lips curve upwards slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure. Lord knows I\u2019m not all that great at it either. Tell you what, I\u2019m on a job right now and I will be for the next few days. If you want I can introduce you to a weapon broker I know after that and we can split the profits on this crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then the snarling of a dog made me turn in time to see a large mutt barreling down the sidewalk, a leash trailing behind him. He had eyes filled with madness as he headed straight for Asala. She gave a small mewl of terror as she hid behind my legs. Even as he leapt at her with fangs bared I brought my arm around in an uppercut, catching it under the jaw; flipping it through the air before it fell on the ground and lay still. The owner came running up seconds later slightly out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou killed my dog!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt tried to attack my client. And it is not dead, I only knocked him out for a bit. He will wake up with a headache and maybe a bit tongue. Keep a better leash on him next time or I really will kill him. Now get out of here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as the dog was beginning to shake itself awake with a whimper I was reaching into my duffle bag. I twirled, pulling the sword out of its scabbard in one smooth motion while dropping the bag at my feet, catching the blade Liz had tried to thrust into Asala\u2019s throat on the broad face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t do this Liz. Just put it away and walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut she\u2019s one of those cursed summoner freaks! I saw her summon a Gorla when that dog leapt at her! I know it was her! I\u2019m not blind!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right. She is a summoner, but she\u2019s as cursed as you or me. She is under my protection right now and I really don\u2019t want to kill you over this. I truly would like to be friends, but if you are really that narrow minded then I don\u2019t need a friend like you. She didn\u2019t ask for this power just like we didn\u2019t ask to be born into our families. She can\u2019t control her powers right now either so the summoning was only because she was frightened. I saw her summon the creature as well. But my priority is this girl here, as long as that two headed ape doesn\u2019t attack her I won\u2019t go after it. It\u2019s not that strong to begin with so the police can handle it. If you are truly that concerned then go after it yourself. But I swear to god if you make one more attack against this girl, it is going to be your last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe narrowed her eyes at me as if contemplating another attack anyway. I met her gaze with one of my own that said try it and I would have her head in less than ten moves. Finally she pulled her dagger away and shoved it back into the sheath at her belt, spitting at our feet in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll freaks like her should be killed. And people like you too who side with them. I don\u2019t want anything to do with the likes of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. I\u2019m sorry you feel that way, I really was starting to like you. If you decide to come to your senses and quite spouting such poisonous nonsense that you probably overheard from your parents come see me and maybe we can start over. It\u2019s sad that you would rather be content in living with such a petty view instead of trying to get to know her as a person. It is Hunter\u2019s and would be Hunter\u2019s like you that keep such hate alive that  really need to be destroyed. The world would be a much better place without you. So I declare this now so there is no mistake, as of this moment I consider you my enemy. If you try to approach me while not under a banner of truce I will attack without hesitation and I will destroy you. You might be good, but I\u2019m better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally turned and strode away but I didn\u2019t lower my sword until she was out of sight. After sliding my sword back into its scabbard and picking up the bags I put my arm around the girls shoulder and led her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on. Lets go get you something to eat. Do you want to go home and eat? It\u2019s not that far, maybe a five minute walk from here. Or do you think you are up to finishing up our little date?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl didn\u2019t answer, simply buried her face in her teddy bear to hide her tears and muffle her wails. It looked like it was up to me to decide. Going home might be the safer choice for now, but on the other hand I couldn\u2019t let this ruin the potential I had to get the girl to open up more. Out here in town and having her interact with people on a limited basis, experiencing all these new things would prove to her that her power wasn\u2019t bad, or that she didn\u2019t have to be afraid of it. The flip side of the potential good continuing to shop would do was the danger I would be putting her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo did I want to choose immediate safety with little gain or potentially immediate huge gain with a little danger involved?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cDon\u2019t let what just happened get to you. It wasn\u2019t your fault, both you and I know that. There are always going to be people that think like that but that doesn\u2019t mean they are right. So don\u2019t let this ruin our day together. Come on, let\u2019s get something to eat and finish up our shopping. I mean isn\u2019t that like what little girls are all about? Shopping and talking about boys? That seems to be what my classmates are all about anyway. If you want I can be your girl friend, though don\u2019t ask me to wear a dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNothing. Not a hint of a smile or any sign she had heard me. It seemed she had retreated back into herself like when we had first met. All the hard work I had put into pulling her out of her own misery gone in an instant of bad luck and timing. It would be twice as hard to pull her out of her dark thoughts. And until then her grief would feed into the instability of her power, making another outburst likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I headed off towards The Pipe, a thought struck me and I smiled thinly to myself. It was a bit of a gamble but it might work to pull her back into the here and now with little risk. Revealing my own special ability right now wouldn\u2019t do anything except maybe push her farther away or even scare her. She wasn\u2019t open to what I could do at the moment. But just maybe she would be open to Ginger in her current state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo after entering the diner and eating I hurried through buying the rest of the stuff on the shopping list. I kept trying to pull her into conversations but she continued to remain withdrawn. Her body doing things like walking and eating automatically. It had been the worst at The Pipe, I had ended up feeding her by hand because she seemed to lack even the will to do it herself. But as long as I put a hand on her back, or around her shoulder, her legs would start walking when I gave her a push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe crossed over into one of the many residential districts outside of town. Even though going to Ginger\u2019s was in the opposite direction of my house and we had to go through a seedier section of the city, I still thought it would be worth it. Asala\u2019s hand rose up as if on its own to grab my hand. It was only a small concession to the doll like state she had been in until now, but it was enough. Enough to let me know she at least knew what was going on around her, even if she didn\u2019t want to be a part of it right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m taking you to see an acquaintance of mine. I really can\u2019t call her a friend, more like an unusual ally. She might seem a bit strange to you at first but there is nothing to be afraid of. Get as afraid or angry or sad as you want in here, your power won\u2019t accidentally summon a monster no matter what happens. You see she has a\u2026I guess you would call it an ability like you and other special class magic users like you have. Though technically she has no magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s what\u2019s called a Void. A person born without a drop of magic in her system. But her ability creates a field around her that nullifies all other magic out. People think she is cursed just like you, afraid that if they get too close she will suck all their magic away and make them Void\u2019s as well. Its rubbish of course, but people like to believe what ever makes them feel better. The only reason she is so blatant about her ability and doesn\u2019t hide it like most others would is because she has connections and influence. She can afford to stick up her nose at everybody like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are now probably wondering why my mother didn\u2019t leave you with her instead of me. Or why you can\u2019t stick close to her if she can nullify your power. Well for one, she\u2019s not a fighter. Keeping you safe from threats aside from monsters is another part of my job. For two\u2026 well you will just have to see for yourself. Her name is Diedra, but everyone calls her Ginger on account of her hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe came to a large house that was just this side of being called a mansion and I could hear the sounds of a party going on behind the door as e faint smell of Bora weed seeped through the cracks. That wasn\u2019t too unusual, Ginger was always letting loose with one group or another. Before ringing the doorbell I reached into the side of my duffle bag and pulled out two small white pills. Swallowing one quickly I made Asala open her mouth and take the second one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer ability might nullify all magic in the body and from artifacts, but not alchemist products. This will keep you from getting high off the fumes or if you accidentally drink something you aren\u2019t supposed to. Most of her clients and partiers are decent enough people who just wish to remain anonymous but I wouldn\u2019t put it past any of them to slip even a little girl some drugs or alcohol for a laugh. Or for something a little more than that. Just stick close to me and if anyone tries anything funny I will take care of them for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave the pills a moment to start breaking down and entering our system before ringing the bell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA tanned woman with brown eyes and ginger hair answered the door. Standing at about six foot one she was slightly taller than most women. The almost empty bottle in her hand told me she had been drinking, but I knew from experience she wasn\u2019t drunk. Something about her ability kept her from getting drunk or addicted to anything. She looked like anyone else except for the fact that she only had one arm. Her left one had been cut off when she was in a car accident while still a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! What a pleasant surprise! I haven\u2019t seen you in ages! What are you doing here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like your help for a little bit if I could. Maybe a quiet room with a bit of privacy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe draped her arm around my neck and pulled me in close, running her fingers through my hair before kissing me on my nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou finally decide you want a bit of the gingersnap? I don\u2019t mind love, but I\u2019m not so sure about letting the girl watch. Though I guess that would be fun in its own way and my kind of kinky.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned, pretending to lean in to kiss her before shoving her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDream on. Even if you weren\u2019t over twice my age, I got a thing for women with two arms. It\u2018s kind of my fetish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe belted out a belly laugh as she beckoned us in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll have you one of these days my pretty boy! Follow me, the party is in the living room area, we can get to my study without you having to encounter anyone. I\u2019m sure you would prefer that over subjecting the girl here to their merriment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. So who is it this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh the usual, a few dirty cops, some dirty politicians and the military.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? Not a few dirty military?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoney, they are all dirty, you know that. At least all the ones with any power are. It\u2019s just that some are dirtier than others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer study was more like a library, with shelves of books lining the walls and comfortable couches and chairs sitting around invitingly. Along one wall was a mini bar which Ginger wasted no time in going to; pouring herself another drink after finishing the one in her hand. As she sat down in a chair I guided Asala to a couch nearby, gently pushing her into the cushions before taking my seat. Ginger nodded her chin as she pointed at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShock?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSomething like that. She is actually the reason I came to see you. I think you can help me help her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019s that? I know you love. You\u2019re good with kids. Damn good. I don\u2019t know how you do it but you got a knack for doing what other people can\u2019t when it comes to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want you to tell her about Siera. Don\u2019t leave anything out and don\u2019t sugarcoat my part in all of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe narrowed her eyes at me as a hint of sadness crept into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t you be better suited to telling that story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe if things were different, but in this case I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best choice. My words might be heard, but they wouldn\u2019t have the same impact. A few things happened today and she witnessed me make an enemy of someone I had wanted to be friends with. That person said some hurtful words to her which made her turn in on herself like this. If I were to tell her the story she would think I was making it up or trying to make her feel better by telling lies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at Asala sitting there with those dead eyes of hers and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right. I won\u2019t ask any payment for this one. It\u2019s a small favor and I still owe you one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached down and pulled out a golden locket from under her shirt, fingering it with a faraway look on her face before opening it up to look at the picture inside. That of a fourteen year old girl with the bluest eyes I had ever seen and hair as red as the sunset. A girl who had once been called Sierra. As Ginger closed the locket again and looked at the little girl in front of her I stood up to pour myself a drink. Too bad I wasn\u2019t able to get drunk right now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cThis all took place about two years ago. Riktal was finally coming out of wallowing in his own pains at losing his sister the year before. We met by chance much longer ago than that though, back when he was only four or five. I had worked with his father on a job, and his father helped me get settled when I moved here. Riktal used to always come over to my place and play with my daughter Siera. They weren\u2019t exactly friends, but at the time both me and his father thought it would do both children good to interact with each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYears passed and they grew up together, becoming rivals in everything. Who could hold their breath the longest, who could take down the biggest monster the fastest, anything and everything they challenged each other over. Siera was a year younger then Riktal but didn\u2019t let that stop her from pushing him to be a better Hunter. They were much alike and always clashing heads. In their own way they really were friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfter his sister Olia died, Riktal was in a bad way. Angry at everyone and everything. Well angrier then he is now. He blamed his parents, the monsters, but mostly he blamed himself. Siera tried to console him during that year. Even though she wasn\u2019t that good at it and the two of them were always at odds, that was just the kind of girl she was. I don\u2019t know how she turned out that way since lord knows I was never the best mother. I really wasn\u2019t mother material to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe would attack her. Both verbally and with his fists. His sorrow and pain blinded him to the world. He ended up hurting her a few times too. He had always been better at combat then she was. But always she kept going back and trying to help him. Then one day, maybe six months after his sister died, he found out that she was a monster summoner. Normally she was able to keep her ability locked down and under control. But on that one particular day she slipped and called forth a monster that attacked him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe killed it of course. But then he really went after Siera. Before it had just been to try and hurt her. But this time he tried to kill her. He threw everything he had at her and she barely escaped with her life. Coming home bruised, battered, and broken. She told me how he had said all people like her should die. They were a blight on the land that created more work for real Hunter\u2019s. That they didn\u2019t deserve to live. That night had been the first time in a very long time that I remember her crying on my shoulder. She kept asking if it was true, and why was she alive. His words and his actions had hurt her deeply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAbout a month later, we got word that Riktal was in trouble. In his anger he had gone out alone into the wilds to hunt monsters. But he had bitten off more than he could chew, getting into a fight with a giant that ended with him being trapped under a pile of rubble with almost no magic left. With limited oxygen he used the last bit of his magic to cast out a communication spell. He had intended to contact someone in his family but they were all too far away. His spell latched on to me instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen Siera overheard him pleading with me to send help she went to his aid. Even though he was still so angry at both of us he had asked for help. His desire to live made him stamp down his rage. And Siera, bless her soul, despite what he had done and said to her went to help him without hesitation. She used a summoned beast to track him down and then a tamed giant to lift the rocks and free him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen he had asked why, she had said because he had needed help. That even though he had tried to kill her she couldn\u2019t wash her hands of him. They had known each other too long and been rivals even longer. That it wouldn\u2019t feel satisfying to her if he were to die without her beating him at something. From that day on his outlook on monster summoners changed. He began coming back over and playing with her again. Resuming their rivalry. He came to realize she was just another person. One with a special power perhaps, but a person just like him. She helped him end his grieving for his sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen about six months after that incident the two of them were tracking in the woods and hunting low level monsters. Learning how to work together, to mesh her summoner skills with his Hunter skills. To become faster, stronger, smarter. They were attacked by another giant. They fought it off, but Siera was badly injured. She had taken a swing of the giant\u2019s club full in the stomach. Riktal carried her back to town as fast as he could run, but by the time the Priests were able to put their hands on her it was too late.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI got to the hospital in time to witness her last few minutes alive and hear her last few words. She told Riktal the real reason she had saved him was because she thought of him as family. That she had always wanted a brother like him. That she had been really happy when they were together. That was when I told them both the truth.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey really were family. Siera was his half sister. Me and Riktal\u2019s father had had a small fling and she was the product of that. His mother didn\u2019t know though and no one ever told her. That was the real reason I had moved to this town. And the real reason me and his father had them play together. So they could get to know their family even if they never learned the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe had whispered that she had already known. She had figured it out a long time ago. Then Riktal challenged her to a game of rock-paper-scissors. She had never won at that game with him once but she had smiled and accepted anyway. She threw rock and he threw scissors. She grinned and said she had finally won before she closed her eyes and stopped breathing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlmost exactly one year after his sister had died he lost another one. I thought he would go back into his little world of pain but he didn\u2019t. He said he couldn\u2019t. He had to become the greatest Hunter of all time. He had to live up to the expectation of two little sisters so he didn\u2019t have time to wallow in self pity. And every day since then he has grown stronger and stronger. He sees everyone with special abilities as people, not blindly parroting what others have said.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI downed another shot of whiskey before turning to look at Asala for the first time since Ginger started the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe always threw rock first. She never realized that. She had a set order every time. Rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors. That\u2019s why I always won.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWalking over I knelt in front of the little girl who\u2019s eyes had come back into focus as she watched me intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes it\u2019s true. I was just like Liz at one point. I thought the same way. But I was wrong. A monster summoner just like you taught me that. A summoner who was also my half sister. If things had worked out differently I was planning on telling you this story another time. When you were more ready to hear it. But you were so far gone inside your own head after what happened you would never have believed a word I said. By the time you were ready to hear this story from me you would have been on your way again with your new teacher. And I wanted you to hear that story. To prove to you that people change. That you can make a difference as a summoner. That you are not some evil disease. Do you believe me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA slow shake of the head up and down as her eyes began to water up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you feel a bit better now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you still believe you are some sort of monster that doesn\u2019t deserve to live like Liz said?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA slow shake back and forth. No.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s good. It\u2019s ok to grieve for the loss of your family. No one is telling you that you can\u2019t do that. You need to do that. Don\u2019t hold it all inside, it\u2019s not healthy. I know that first hand. Do you want to go home now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk then when we get home I will introduce you to a friend of mine you might like. He has the special power of being able to hide your tears and the sounds of your crying for anyone looking at you. All they will see is your pretty face and nothing else. Would you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnother nod of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Snuggles?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Ginger and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWho else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou still have that old thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAlways and forever. He\u2019s just as precious to me as that locket is to you, and for the same reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reached up and touched the locket absently, nodding her head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell that friend of yours who put the magic on this locket that it still works fine. My ability hasn\u2019t corroded it in all this time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure he knows, but I will tell him anyway. He will appreciate it. Take care Ginger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLater Riktal love. Perhaps next time we could bang a few headboards together and make another Siera.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne of them was enough for me thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI hitched the duffel back onto my back as it slipped down my shoulder a bit before tightening my grip on the three shopping bags. Ginger opened the front door for us, letting us exit into the evening. Asala reached up and held my hand as we began the walk back to my house, smiling happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOften seeming to contradict themselves, humans truly are a fascinating species. So tell me, did you learn something about yourself through all of this? Did the choices you made speak about who you are? Were you able to find some nugget of truth to your own personal dilemma\u2019s through guiding Riktal\u2019s actions? Do you regret the choices you made? Do you wonder what fate might have befallen young Riktal if you had chosen differently?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou will come again. Of this I am certain. For as master of all the possibilities I see this future in nearly all of them. I look forward to meeting you again, and in bestowing upon you the power of choice. A power you have always held, even if it is only within your own life.</span></div></div>",

We have a few nice things for you to wear tomorrow, we can finish this all up later. I\u2019ll make some grilled ham and cheese sandwiches with tomato soup and tonight you can wear one of my oversized shirts as a nightgown. Then I\u2019ll introduce you to an old friend of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t answer, not even with a small nod of her head. It seemed she had pulled back into herself, returning to the lifeless doll I had first seen walking in the door back at school. I clamped down on my bit of anger at this turn of events. All the work I had put into getting her to open up had been wasted. Now I was afraid it would be twice as hard to get her to return from the dark place she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA place where she feared and maybe even hated not only her power but herself. Where she was all alone and afraid to trust anyone. It was a destructive spiral that in the end would only make her power go out of control more often as her emotions worsened. There was a grieving process she needed to go through that she just wasn\u2019t letting herself do. For normal people with little magic they could afford to wallow in their own misery for much longer, but not people like her who\u2019s ability was affected by her emotions and mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI tried to pull her into some conversation as we walked, keeping things light and a bit comedic but she continued to stay in that little shell of hers, clutching her bear tightly. I briefly toyed with the idea of letting her in on my secret and revealing my own special power but decided against it. In this state she wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate or indeed understand. It could scare her into using her summoning magic again which would only create another loop on her personal downward spiral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen we got home I set the few bags down and went to the kitchen to make the meal. When I turned around I found Asala hadn\u2019t followed me. Running back through the house to make sure she was safe I saw her still standing in the entranceway staring off into space. With a gently hand on her back I pushed her towards the kitchen and she walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seemed she had lost the will to do anything for herself while hiding inside her mind. Her body simply moving automatically to outside stimulus using muscle memory. I wondered if this is the state she was in when whoever it was had first found her. If so, it might not be such a wonder that people had ended up disregarding her and simply dragging her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat her down at the kitchen table and watched while cooking as she stared off at nothing in that eerie solitude of hers. Rarely blinking and almost looking like a statue save for the small movement of her chest. Setting the plate and bowl in front of her I gently told her to eat. When she didn\u2019t respond I ripped the sandwiches into smaller pieces and fed them to her by hand. Pressing my fingers on the hinges of her jaw to make her mouth open on its own. Once the food was in her mouth her body took over and began to chew, knowing it needed sustenance even if her brain did not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn this way I got her to eat and drink, dipping the ham and cheese into the soup to get some of that down her throat as well. When she was done she continued to sit staring straight ahead while I cleaned up. I let out a small sigh of sorrow before sitting down next tot her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen sweetie, it wasn\u2019t your fault. I know you don\u2019t believe me right now. Heck you might not even hear me at the moment. But if you do, know that I know you didn\u2019t mean to summon that monster. And no matter what you might think, it isn\u2019t your fault Liz thinks the way she does. Nor is it your fault that I made her into my enemy. Her decision to attack you was because of her beliefs not yours. My decision to stop her was because of my beliefs, not yours. I was given the duty to protect you and that is what I am going to do, even if it cost me everything, including my life. Even if it wasn\u2019t my job, I would protect you anyways because you deserve to be protected. Monster summoner or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStill not a flicker of anything crossed her features. Just that same lifeless silence. With another sigh I pulled back her chair and got her on her feet again, with a gentle hand on her back I led her upstairs and into the bathroom. Treating her just like a doll I undressed her and got her bathed up. Never once did she resist or seem to know what was going on. Her body just moving like a limp rag. Once she was clean I toweled her off and led her to my room, slipping one of my old shirts over her head before ushering her into bed. The only small concession I got that made me know she still had any idea what was going on around her was the way she grabbed for her stuffed animal on her own without me having to push it onto her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI dug through my closet until I finally found what I was looking for, an old blue stuffed rabbit missing an eye and one ear sewn back on badly. Sitting on side of the bed looking down on the girl I showed her the rabbit before putting it in my lap and looking down on it. Gently squeezing it with both hands as the memories came back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Mr. Snuggles. He used to belong to my sister. My little sister. She\u2019s not here anymore, she died just like your parents. I don\u2019t have much left to remember her by, not physically anyway.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI touched my head and my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMost of what I have left is in here and here. She was a bit of a crybaby but she never liked having people see her cry. She would come to me and cry sometimes but mostly she tried to hold it all in. So I cast a magic spell on Mr. Snuggles here to make it impossible for anyone to see or hear her bawling her eyes out when she held it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe helped her win many battles against the scary things that went bump in the night. Fighting valiantly just like a true Hunter until he slew the monsters one by one. As you can see he didn\u2019t come out of it unscathed. But whenever my sister held him she said she felt braver. She had me to chase away the bad dreams for her, so she never needed me to place any extra spells on Mr. Snuggles. But I think you need that extra bit of magic. I doubt you really trust me much right now, or anyone for that matter. Mr. Snuggles has been helping little girls sleep easy at night for a very, very, long time. He\u2019s been retired for about three years now, but he is always ready to return to active service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stared at the rabbit, sending out my magic until it was surrounded with a purple glow anyone could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe who guards the gate between reality and dreams. Chase away those of dark and evil intent. Monsters of figment and fancy, of misfortune and woe. Create for they who hold this mighty solder a peaceful resting experience. Om nurra Kom su. Doroku ma ka fli ni-ma sa su palakama tor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let the magic drop before setting the rabbit down next to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere. Now if you hold him, not only will no one see or hear you cry, but he will chase away bad dreams as well. He is yours for now if you want him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe didn\u2019t move. Just stared blankly at the rabbit sitting inches from her face looking at her with it\u2019s one eye. I gave her arm a small squeeze as I stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet some sleep honey. I\u2019m going to be right back. I just need to get cleaned up real quick and bring your things up here with us so you have something to wear tomorrow. I\u2019m going to be right next to you all night long in case you need anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned on the bedside lamp, tuning the magical bulb down to a low setting so she wouldn\u2019t be left completely in the dark as I turned off the overhead light. Walking out the door I hurried to the bathroom, giving myself a quick shower and slipping on my bed clothes before grabbing the shopping bags from downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen I snuck back into the room to make up a bed on the floor I saw Asala fast asleep, her breathing evened out in a slumber of peace. She was clutching the teddy bear in one hand and the rabbit in the other. Dried tear marks making streaks on the side of her face. With a smile I slipped under the covers with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe whole magical spells thing was nonsense of course. There wasn\u2019t really any magic that could chase away bad dreams. Nor had their been any real magic to mask the fact that her crying had turned invisible. I had simply made up a few words and let my magic surround the animal for a bit without doing anything with it. But my little lies had been effective both then and now to ease the minds of scared little girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I settled down to sleep I saw a small smile creep onto Asala\u2019s face as she snuggled closer to me, resting her head against my chest. Gently I wrapped my arms around her so as not to wake her up. Whispering softly into her hair as I closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood night sweetie. We\u2019ll get you fixed up eventually, don\u2019t you worry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOh what a tangled web we weave. Is that not what you humans say? Plots within plots and divergent outcomes based on the choices you make. Would he have ever found out Liz had such hatred for summoners if he had chosen different choices? Would Liz have acted the same way if she had come to know more about young Riktal or gotten to know Asala before seeing her use her power? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat if, maybe, could have, should have, would have. All of these are choices. Possibilities that lived and died before their name was even uttered. All things are possible until action is taken, once the course is set in motion, the other infinite number of possibilities for that particular second are gone forever. It is from this truth that regret is born. But it is also from this truth that experiences are made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe must part now mortal, but I will see you again. I know this as truth, for I have seen the possibilities.</span></div></div>",

Finally I shook my head as I returned my gaze to my mother\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell Pelei to go easy on her and to curb his natural tendencies. He most likely won\u2019t ignite her power if he does. Sorry mother but I\u2019m not doing it. You didn\u2019t want me to be an official Hunter so you don\u2019t get to decide you need me as one when it is convenient to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up, giving my mother and the little girl a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry Asala, it\u2019s nothing against you, but if someone doesn\u2019t curb my mother\u2019s tendencies to use people however she wants whenever she needs something she will keep on doing it. She needs to learn that throwing the word family around like that won\u2019t get her everything. There are consequences to every action. She taught me that. This is simply the consequence of her denying me the ability to become a Hunter myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood day mother, I\u2019ll see you whenever you get back. By the way, sis sends her love. I need to get back to class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI picked up my pack and left the room, letting the door creek shut behind me. I sensed the presence around the corner ahead of me so stopped when I came to the turn. I didn\u2019t look over at the principal, just stared straight down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you have a problem with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I think you were right to do what you did. Miranda never did think much about using others when it suited her needs. Didn\u2019t have a problem with hiding behind her family name when it suited her either. I think this will do her good. Remind her that things don\u2019t always go the way she wants them to if she bats her eyes and asks nicely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOut of curiosity, do you always take to eavesdropping on private conversations?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do when it\u2019s on my school grounds and one of the Hunter caliber people in question has a short temper. That calls the safety of my student\u2019s into question so I need to know if I have to protect them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at the old woman as she ran her hands over the wheels on her chair. I saw the handle of a gun peeking up along the back of the wheelchair even as she smiled wistfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough I do have to wonder just how safe that little girl will be. I know Pelei too. Even if you tell him to put a leash on his tendencies, he\u2019s going to forget himself and do it anyway. He could very well traumatize that little girl further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen in the end that is just another part of the consequence my mother will have to live with. If she even cares enough about it. Good day principal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI only managed to take two more steps before she stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal, one last question. Why didn\u2019t you get angry at your mother? I\u2019ve read your file so I know that isn\u2019t like you. I was expecting some big blow up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at her over my right shoulder, a half smile curving up the left side of my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I already screwed up the way I dealt with one relationship today. I don\u2019t need another woman angry at me for my own thoughtless actions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds like you made a friend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wonder about that. If I did, I think I lost them just as quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake the advice of an old woman boy. Friendships, especially those between Hunter\u2019s, aren\u2019t so easily lost. We all have our quirks and outlooks on life. Our views clash and we fight over the smallest things. But rarely is it impossible to mend those rifts. Our jobs are dangerous and we have a high mortality rate the first few years we are learning the ropes in the real world. That\u2019s why we make friends fast and try so hard to feel normal. Because every day can be our last. We don\u2019t want to regret having not tried to experience some of what the rest of the world has.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned her chair away and wheeled herself off as I continued down the corridor. She was right, Hunter\u2019s came in all shapes, sizes, and backgrounds. We weren\u2019t carbon copies of each other and it was human nature to want to be right. It was that desire to be right that created conflicts most of the time. This small conflict between me and Liz had come about because of different backgrounds. Even though we were similar in many ways, we had been raised differently. So our mindsets on some things would obviously be different as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt had all started with the crystal. I needed to solve it with the crystal as well. That seemed logical. She wouldn\u2019t accept it if I simply gave it to her. And she wouldn\u2019t thank me if I forced it on her. She was too proud for me to do something like that to her. I might not know her all that well but I knew that much about her already. I realized I really wanted to be her friend. That right now I needed someone to talk to that understood me. I was getting tired of going home to an empty house and doing everything alone. She was the first person I could stand being around that I didn\u2019t think was stupid or useless in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tQuietly I reentered the classroom, pretending not to notice the stares that were calculating how best to approach me. Trying to figure out my weaknesses so they could get close to me and be associated with my family name. New Hunter\u2019s could get a leg up if an old family gave them some good connections to brokers, weapon merchants, and clients. Get them better jobs simply because they knew me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the bell rang signaling the end of school they got up to converge on me, but I was already moving before I could get trapped by them. Before Liz had a chance to escape from my sight. I slapped the crystal down on the desk in front of her looking directly into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was thoughtless and I did you a disservice as a fellow Hunter. Even if you don\u2019t have a license, you still have the skills. I would like that this small misunderstanding not come between us. I\u2019m not very good at this whole friendship thing or dealing with people in general. But this crystal started this whole mess, so let us end it with this stone as well.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The stone shattered into bit\u2019s, small sparks shooting out of the cloudy fragments before they broke up and disappeared into oblivion. I looked back up after finish my task, ignoring the gasps of surprise and the small cries of dismay behind me. Liz\u2019s face was impassive and unreadable as I kept mine the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d rather break this crystal than break this friendship we have started between us. Hunter\u2019s have to choose who to let close to them carefully. People like me and you don\u2019t have the luxury of having many friends or those we can trust. But I would like to count you as one of those people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eye\u2019s narrowed a bit as she studied me. I could almost hear the crickets chirping as the kids behind me held their breath. Acting like our conversation was some TV drama they were watching. I could only imagine the girls holding their hands together close to their chest and the boys leaning forward in anticipation. But I didn\u2019t bother to look, the answer of the woman in front of me was what was important right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWithout warning her right fist came around and smashed into my jaw. I took the blow, not even bothering to avoid or block it. I didn\u2019t even use magic to soften it since she hadn\u2019t used any either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow will you forgive me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard shrieks go up from the girls and even a few whistles from the boys as if I had just confessed to her and she had accepted my feelings. I simply shook my head slightly while Liz grinned, understanding the thoughts that were running through my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe gathered our things and left the room. Stopping only briefly at her locker before walking out the front doors together. As we turned down the street she finally spoke up, breaking our comfortable silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to break it you know. I was actually planning on apologizing to you as well but you beat me too it. I realized you hadn\u2019t meant anything harmful by what you did after I had time to think. You might not be able to tell but I\u2019m not all that great at friendships and personal relations either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? It seemed like you were friends with everybody in there. You got along so well I was jealous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHar. Har. Make fun of me if you will but I really would like to try to make this work if possible. I want to try to be a better friend this time then I was to someone else I once knew. Not make the same kinds of mistakes and have the same regrets. So bear with me ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as you bear with me. We can learn how to do this together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my fist, looking over at her with a grin. She returned the grin and made a fist of her own, lightly tapping it against mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued to walk towards town in a companionable silence for a bit before I spoke up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo\u2026 I really didn\u2019t have to destroy it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. You wasted a good heart crystal for nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe only other thing I could think of was to split the profit with you but I wasn\u2019t sure it would have worked. I went with the route I thought would have the highest probability of success.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI would have preferred the money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll remember that for the next time I do something stupid that gets you mad at me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not cheap just so you know, I won\u2019t settle for anything less than five thousand Reul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOuch. I\u2019ll try not to make you angry often then. My bank account couldn\u2019t take too many hits like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned a bit evilly at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d let you run up a tab. With a small interest fee of twenty five percent a day of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re not a Hunter, you\u2019re a crook!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a poor girl saving up for her future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGirl my backside. Such tactics are monstrous.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCareful, you are coming close to making me mad at you again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe both began laughing as we came into town. She turned left, waving farewell as I continued straight. I returned her wave still grinning like a fool. It seemed the principal was right, friendships weren\u2019t so easily broken. You just had to work at them like everything else. I had a feeling school wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tWell, that was fun wasn\u2019t it? Our young hero here went from being all sulky and angry at the start of the day to being a bit of a romantic by the end of it. Are you satisfied with the choices you made? The direction you took Riktal\u2019s life in? Did you take into consideration his personality in your decision making? Or did you simply decide how you would have handled the situation if you had been in his shoes? Did things turn out like you thought they would? Or was his actions a surprise to you? Would you have handled things differently or the exact same way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt\u2019s easy to look back and answer some of these questions. To judge what has been done and gone before. But it is not so easy to do so when the time for choice and action is upon you. You know not what the future holds until you take that leap of faith and make a choice. I hope this chance to become a god and decide someone else\u2019s fate has taught you something. Perhaps about yourself, or about the way you view the world you live in. Until next time when our paths cross again. And I assure you, they will again cross, I see it in your future.</span></div></div>",

How about I introduce you to him and we split the profit seventy- thirty with you getting the larger half for doing most of the work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes narrowed even as I could feel the rest of the class watching us, listening to everything like we were some TV drama. I ignored them, they weren\u2019t important. Right now Liz and her answer was important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEighty-twenty and I will call us square. It was partially my fault too for being so quick to judge. I\u2019m not much of a people person either. But if your offering, I won\u2019t pass up free money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal. You got time now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the two of us headed for the door one brave stupid soul stepped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey\u2026 Mind if I tag along too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the boy with a glare that could have made paper instantly combust. He withered into himself, taking a step back. I spun on my heel then without another word, leaving him to kick himself for his own assumptions that I was even interested in him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAren\u2019t we just two peas in a pod. I knew you hadn\u2019t meant to snub me like that after thinking it over for a bit. I just sort of acted without thinking as well. I was going to try to patch things up with you after school but you beat me to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo I didn\u2019t have to offer you so much of the profits?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. But I won\u2019t allow you to take it back now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA small price to pay for my own folly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we left the school with kids turning to stare at us she punched me lightly in my arm with a backhand swing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen. It\u2019s been a while since I had a friend as well. The last one I could call that moved away a few months ago before I started school here. She wasn\u2019t old blood like we are, she was first generation. I learned to loosen up a bit because of her. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m that much better at this whole friend thing either. To be honest, I don\u2019t think I was that good of a friend to her. Don\u2019t know why she liked me truth to tell. That\u2019s why I want to be a better friend this time around then I was last time. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll make some more mistakes and we will have falling outs again. So just bear with me ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as you bear with me. I feel like a fish out of water right now if we are being honest. The closest thing I had to a friend before now was my cousin but he is family so it was a bit different. I haven\u2019t seen him in a few years either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued to talk about small stuff, mostly things about ourselves and our families as we got to know each other a little better. Neither one of us really wanted to destroy this tenuous relationship we had going on. There was no romance involved, I couldn\u2019t feel any kind of spark of that nature either inside myself or in her words and actions. But I was glad of that fact. I didn\u2019t want there to be any romance between us. I wasn\u2019t ready for something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI opened the door to the Pasta Palace for Liz before entering behind her. A quick look around showed that Nerval wasn\u2019t sitting at his usual booth eating his usual meal. I beckoned the waitress he had a secret crush on over to me with a wave of the hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNerval\u2019s not here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe was, but he left early for a customer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh. Thanks Trinity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t mention it hon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led Liz back outside and right next door into Nerval\u2019s shop \u201cThe Broken Seal.\u201d Inside was brightly lit with an array of weapons showcased under glass windows. Everything from your basic sword and shields, to specialty weapons people had ordered that were being displayed to show off Nerval\u2019s skills as a craftsman until the owner came to pick it up.  Nerval came out the back pulling off a special glove with dozens of small screwdrivers and other tools attached to the fingers when the bell on the door jingled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! How you doing! Aint I the lucky one? First get a visit from your mother a few minutes ago and now you! Must be my day for Zelkov\u2019s!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy mother was here? What she want?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow you know I can\u2019t tell you that. Confidentiality and all that. You understand. Even if you are her son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah sorry, stupid question. Nerval, this is Liz Hawthrope. Liz this is Nerval. He might look like a crook but he is mostly honest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI only cheat those that deserve to be cheated. But it\u2019s against my policy to cheat a pretty lady so you don\u2019t have anything to fear. So Hawthrope huh? As in Wilson Hawthrope?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeard good things about him. Glad to meet you. If you\u2019ve gotten into Riktal\u2019s good graces and he is introducing us then you\u2019re ok in my book. I think you are the first person he has introduced me too since I\u2019ve known him. So what can I do for you today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out the heart crystal which he took in his meaty hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLike to get that appraised if we could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head as he pulled out a three stage magnifying monocle from a drawer behind the desk. While he went about inspecting every inch of it Liz began looking around the store. I saw her eyes widening in surprise at some of the fantastic weapon work. I had done the same thing the first time I had seen the store. Nerval was a true master of his art. Able to make weapons other smiths would claim was impossible to accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stopped in front of a full suit of armor, her eyes going dreamy over it. Enamored even. Nerval always kept one of those suits in the window, it was one of his best sellers. It was spelled so it fit on the wrist as a bracelet until it was needed. Then it could be activated and equipped in just a few seconds. With extra spells of protection and resistance against temperatures, any Hunter would love to get their hands on one. But the fifteen thousand Reul price tag was a bit steep for a beginning Hunter to afford.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou like the suit ma\u2019am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah my brother has one like it and he says it\u2019s great. My parent\u2019s won\u2019t buy me one, said I have to make the money on my own. But they won\u2019t let me work as a Hunter, so owning one is a bit out of my reach at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrade you that suit for this stone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s worth that much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, it\u2019s only worth ten thousand. But as an incentive to make you come back with more of your business I\u2019m willing to trade. Besides, Riktal here has done me a few good turns before and I haven\u2019t had much chance to pay him back. I\u2019ll pass along some of that to one of his friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m tempted but we decided to split the profit on that crystal so I\u2019d only have eight thousand technically. That\u2019s almost half the price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can have my two thousand if you want. I really don\u2019t mind. I don\u2019t need the money anyways.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nibbled on her lower lip, looking from the suit of armor to us and then back. Nerval saw her wavering so sweetened the deal a bit to sooth her pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell you what, a friend of mine has an Ooze infestation at her house. The Exterminators want three thousand to clear it out but she doesn\u2019t have that kind of money. Take the job for me and I\u2019ll add that three thousand on along with the crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat seemed to make up her mind as she agreed to the deal almost instantly. Nerval reached under the counter again, pulling out one of the spelled bracelets and handed it to her along with the address of his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell her I sent you and you shouldn\u2019t have any problems.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe thanked him and went out the door, presumably heading directly to the address to take care of the job at once. Once she was gone I looked at the shopkeeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat stone isn\u2019t worth ten thousand is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEight and a half tops. But I got a weak spot for pretty girls giving such starry eyes  like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour old enough to be her father.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAge, don\u2019t got nothing to do with it. Besides, what kind of guy do you take me for anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn old perverted one who thinks he is twenty years younger than he actually is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I am that! You got any other business Riktal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. Mainly came by to introduce you two and sell the stone. I\u2019ll be on my way now. Have a good one Nerval, and try not to chase too many skirts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou too Riktal. And try to chase at least one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe belted out a belly laugh as he put his glove back on and headed back into the back room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI had nothing better to do and I really didn\u2019t feel like going back to that empty house just yet. What would I do if I did anyway? Sit around and read a book? Turn on the television just to have some noise other then my echoing footsteps and breathing as company?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo I walked. I had no destination in mind. I simply slipped my arms into the straps of my bag, hoisting it up onto my back and walked. Some people recognized me either as a Zelkov or at the very least, a Hunter in training. They gave waves and nods in passing or sometimes even a cheery hello which I returned before moving on. As I wandered through town I let my mind think what it would as I watched the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw a pair of little boys in a toy store swinging foam swords and claws at each other, playing Hunter\u2019s and Monster\u2019s. A woman was talking on a communication spell, her soldier\u2019s uniform still crisp and pressed with that \u201cjust got it\u201d look.  A little girl was pointing excitedly at something in a bakery window and her mother was shaking her head no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll of these people from varying walks of life relied on Hunter\u2019s to let them keep this peaceful lifestyle. Even though they had magic just like everyone else, it was either too weak or for one reason or another they had decided not to train it effectively. We were champions of the people, heroes. With the abilities to protect them from big scary monsters that the regular military couldn\u2019t handle. Strip away titles, fame, fortune, and lineage, that was what we were at the core. A different kind of soldier who was part of this society and yet apart from it. Trusted almost instantly simply because we were what we were, Hunter\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven if we were to wear normal clothes like everyone else, they always seemed to just know who and what we were. We couldn\u2019t hide the fact that we were monster slayers anymore than you could deny that the sun came up in the morning. Perhaps it was just how we walked, how we held ourselves. Or perhaps it was just some strange magic that fingered us as different that we didn\u2019t recognize. Whatever the case, it made our job of protecting the people that much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned a corner I saw a little boy crying in front of a convenience store. A police officer was trying to calm him down but only seemed to be making the situation worse. I wasn\u2019t sure what made me gravitate towards the situation, this was the cops job after all. But before I knew it I was whispering in the officers ear that I would take care of the boy. He gave me a quick nod as I knelt on one knee in front of the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey waterworks. If you keep crying I might mistake you for a Warpa monster. You want to tell me what\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy cracked open red rimmed eyes, lowering his hands as he did so. He couldn\u2019t be more than five or six years old by the looks of him. He took one look at me before sniffing a bit, telling me he had lost his mother between sobs in his little voice. I felt the officers presence fade as he went to find the boys mother, leaving me alone with the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTimmy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Timmy, do you know who and what I am?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head as he wiped his the snot from his nose onto his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s right. And do you know what my specialty is?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKilling bad things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that\u2019s true, but one of my real specialties is monster tracking. I\u2019ve got a special nose for it you see. I can sniff out monsters in any form. So how about I track down your mother huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMomma\u2019s not a monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that. When my momma get\u2019s all angry she makes this really mean monster like face with her nose all scrunched up and showing all these teeth. She snorts and growls and smoke comes out of her ears and nose. If that\u2019s not a monster I don\u2019t know what is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe giggled a bit while rubbing his eyes and sniffing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMomma does that too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee, what did I tell you. She\u2019s a momma monster. So what do you say? Want me to track her down for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy nodded his head as I grinned at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell my Timmy, are you afraid of heights?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNu-uh. I love them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell that\u2019s good then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I stood up I grabbed him around the waist and lifted him up, seating him on my shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause any good tracker needs a good lookout. And any good lookout needs to have a high vantage point from which to look. It\u2019s just common scouting skill. You mind being my lookout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe giggled again before saying he didn\u2019t mind. So off we went in search of his mother. I didn\u2019t take him far of course, I was only occupying him until his mother  came back. If she was already looking for him it wouldn\u2019t do to have him wondering around. When I asked him where he lived he didn\u2019t know. Only saying he lived on a street with lots of houses, not very useful information. I put my hand up against my brow as I looked around dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I see a momma monster!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I felt the boy looking around over my head, I walked over to the blue postbox, knocking on it with a knuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry to bother you ma\u2019am, but are you this boys momma monster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI cocked my head to the side as the boy laughed at my antics. I nodded my head as if hearing some deep profound words before sighing and turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry Timmy. She says she isn\u2019t your momma monster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not momma or a monster! That\u2019s a mailbox!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat! Why aren\u2019t you doing your job! You are supposed to be my lookout so I don\u2019t make these kinds of mistakes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe continued to laugh as I wandered around the store parking lot and surrounding sidewalk. I kept saying I found his momma monster before heading off to have a deep conversation with a telephone pole, or a stop sign, or some other random object. I even had a deep meaningful conversation with a cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe was cracking up and had forgotten all about being lost, which was all I had been trying to accomplish. When I saw a woman hurrying towards us out of the corner of my eye I turned to her and the boy pointed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMomma!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put the boy back on the ground so he could run to his mother, walking over silently as she hugged him tightly. I got back on my knee in front of the boy as he grinned at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeems you ended up being a better tracker than me. You found the momma monster before I did. Good job lookout. Now you make sure not to lose her again ok? Make sure to hold her hand tightly so neither one of you get\u2019s lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was met by a very solemn nod from the child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI will. Thank you Mr. Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRuffling the boys head I got to my feet. The woman also thanked me and I made soothing words for a few minutes before turning to head home. In the end, this was what our job was about. Helping people and slaying monsters. Sometimes those monster\u2019s weren\u2019t big scary creatures you could see. Sometimes they were ones you couldn\u2019t see. Monsters called fear, anxiety and sadness. To normal people, those monsters were sometimes the scariest ones of all that they couldn\u2019t vanquish alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was a Hunter\u2019s task to take on the job of making people feel safe by slaying all the bad monsters he found. And sometimes that task was found without even going outside the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell, that was fun wasn\u2019t it? Our young hero here went from being all sulky and angry at the start of the day to being a bit of a romantic by the end of it. Are you satisfied with the choices you made? The direction you took Riktal\u2019s life in? Did you take into consideration his personality in your decision making? Or did you simply decide how you would have handled the situation if you had been in his shoes? Did things turn out like you thought they would? Or was his actions a surprise to you? Would you have handled things differently or the exact same way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt\u2019s easy to look back and answer some of these questions. To judge what has been done and gone before. But it is not so easy to do so when the time for choice and action is upon you. You know not what the future holds until you take that leap of faith and make a choice. I hope this chance to become a god and decide someone else\u2019s fate has taught you something. Perhaps about yourself, or about the way you view the world you live in. Until next time when our paths cross again. And I assure you, they will again cross, I see it in your future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tGoing home seemed like a good idea. I really didn\u2019t feel like eating out and there was nothing I really needed to do here in the city anyway. I wasn\u2019t interested in new music or fashion or anything else so I really had no business going places like the mall.  I briefly thought about going to the movies but decided against it. There probably wasn\u2019t anything good playing anyways that I hadn\u2019t already seen. So shoving my arms into the straps of the duffel bag I settled it on my back and began the jog home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took about five minutes at an easy sprint to make it to the bridge crossing the river that separated the main part of the city from the more residential area. From there it was a blink of the eye until I was in front of the fence surrounding our property. I opened the gate to our modest ten acres of land and three story house. Personally I saw no reason for ten acres or for three stories. Sure it had been useful to learn tracking and such, but we rarely used half the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs for three stories, it was all wasted when no one was ever home and we rarely had guests that stayed over. Sometimes a few foreign ambassadors or dignitaries but at least five or six rooms had never been used to my knowledge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaking the quick hand sign to unlock the front door I entered the main hallway, dropping my bag to the floor. My footsteps echoed through the house as I headed for the kitchen, the silence enshrouding me like it always did. I didn\u2019t feel like doing anything fancy for dinner so I just slapped some buttered bread into a skillet along with a few ham slices. While that cooked I grabbed a plate from the cabinet. Within a few moments I had three grilled ham and cheese sandwiches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took the plate to the table and sat down. Eating quietly, the silence my table companions just like it usually was. I turned on the TV in the corner just to hear something aside from the empty air. I really didn\u2019t pay attention though to the show that was playing. It was noise, that\u2019s all that mattered.  After that it took a few seconds to clean what I dirtied and turn the set off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the evening went by in a bit of a blur. I remembered trying to read a magazine, timing myself on how fast I could put various weapons together, and setting up the magical workout dummies in the back for a level four sparring match. The quiet was depressing just like it always was. Seeming to slowly keep closing in on me no matter what I did. But I was used to it. This was how things normally were. I yelled just to hear some noise, but the roar echoed back mockingly. I sighed a bit before taking a quick shower and heading to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I tried to get to sleep it eluded me. I kept tossing and turning, thinking about that silent little girl my mother had asked me to protect. Thinking about her made me think about Olia. Another little girl I had been unable to protect. With a sigh I slipped out of bed and opened my closet, dragging out an unremarkable tattered box. I shifted through the stuffed animals inside until I found a beat up old blue rabbit missing one eye. With my new companion in hand I got back into bed and closed my eyes while hugging it close to my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis time sleep came quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell how was your day as god? Did it make you feel powerful? Helpless? Were you rooting for our hero here? Or cursing him for his actions? Did he do what you thought he would do? What you would have done if the situations were reversed? Are you satisfied with the way things turned out? Did this teach you anything about yourself? There are so many questions without answers and answers without questions!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut is that not what life is? One series of question and answers after another? Tinged with regrets and self accusation. Ups and downs and funny twists of fate. Would you make different choices if you were given the opportunity I wonder. In a world of endless possibilities why would you not if you were a god? Until we meet again my dear friend. May you choose your own fate, lest others choose it for you.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI couldn't just wait for a teacher to get to the bottom of this. It could take days if not weeks and there was no guarantee I would get them back. The danger of having those weapons out there with someone untrained in their use wielding them was too great. So I quickly dialed up a communication spell as I moved to a corner for some privacy. Putting it only on audio I raised my hand to my ear to complete the connection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Yes what is it darling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother's voice came in loud and clear as if she was standing right next to me. I also heard someone shouting behind her something about taking care of the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Just a quick question mother. Do you remember if I packed my Lexington and my Roller Knuckles this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"That's a silly question. Of course you did. You were cleaning them both at the kitchen table. I remember telling you not to accidentally drop any cleaning oil into your breakfast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ok thanks. I was just making sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was about to hang up when my mother spoke up again quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Oh and just so you know, I set up another marriage meeting for you next week. I think you will like her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Mother--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I know, I know. Stop doing that. I don't want to marry someone you chose for me. That's what you are going to say right? But just give her a chance will you? I won't ask you to choose, but you have to at least put yourself out there more and get to know them. How do you know if they are right or not if you don't at least meet them? I won't let you run away from this one. I simply must put my foot down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Fine you know what? Whatever. I'll go. I have more important things to worry about here. I don't have time to stay on the spell arguing with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Ok loves and kisses darling! I'll see you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI disconnected the spell, turning to look at the room at large where all the boys in the class were still putting on their gear. Swiftly I walked into the middle of the room and raised my voice until it echoed back to me from the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"It has come to my attention that two very valuable weapons have been stolen from my bag. Dangerous weapons at that. I have just confirmed that they were indeed stolen and not forgotten at home. To my knowledge thievery of another student's weapons is a very grave and serious offence at this academy. Since a weapon is like an extension of the Hunter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Whoever in here stole them from me must be incredibly stupid and foolish. But as I do not want any trouble I will give you amnesty. I will leave my bag out and leave this room. If those weapons were to wind up back in my bag by the time this period is over, all well and good. I will not pursue this matter farther. But that time limit is the extent of my grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"If one or both of them are still missing by the time I retrieve my bag then whoever you are had best run. Because I will hunt you down without mercy and I will dismember you piece by piece. If you are lucky I might even let a Priest put you back together. I will not stop until I find you, nor will I listen to pleas. Even if you beg for forgiveness and return the weapons later, I will show no quarter. So decide what is more important to you. Keeping your shiny new toys, or keeping your lives. That is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and walked out the door then, not even bothering to look back. The arena master overseeing the boys locker room caught me out in the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You want me to let you know if anyone returns them and who they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"No. I will uphold my bargain of amnesty. The weapons will either be in there or not when I get back. I can track them down just fine on my own. Besides, if you are not involved then you can plead ignorance and punish me with a guiltless conscience for the damage I do to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI entered the combat arena then, leaving the teacher to return to the locker room. Slowly the arena began to fill with my new classmates one by one. I did pay attention to the order of the boys coming in, just in case I had to track down the thief or thieves. I would have a starting point by order of who was last. The boys all looked around suspiciously and some looked a bit jumpy even. I noted it all in the back of my mind but otherwise disregarded them all as unimportant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Today will be slightly different. We won't be having sparring practice as normal. Today is a practical application day. You will be split up into five groups of four or five, you will work as a team to take down some monsters. Utilizing what you have learned and the skills you have gathered in hand to hand and weapons combat. These monsters have been deemed a sufficient test of your skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hawthrope! Zelkov! Since you two are already past this point you will sit out for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI inclined my head to the arena master before climbing up into the bleachers around the large rectangular room. Liz was right behind me as a wall rose out of the floor to cut the room in half. Two of the chosen groups entered the rings as the remaining ones waited on the sidelines in excitement. The floor opened again and a Screecher Bird came into view. I shook my head as one of the boys ran yelling headlong at the bird with his sword raised. Just as quickly he was flying through the air to land on his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I see someone forgot the basics of Screecher's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Doesn't everybody forget the basics the first time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\" I couldn't. I was up against a Gorpal giant my first time. Forget the basics there and you become red jelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz whistled in appreciation of my feat but didn't say anything else. Simply watching the groups below as they switched off after finally killing their prey. After a moment she spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"My first time was against a Fabrooze. The thrill went to my head as I blew it up with an explosive potion. It pulled itself together after eating my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI chuckled while imagining her fighting the thing in her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're thinking something dirty aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Nope they are pristine white.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe backhanded me lightly on the arm before laughing along with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"They were blue at the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll keep that in mind for the next time I imagine it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe second group finally killed the three headed snake like creatures they had been pit against, vacating the ring for the last group to enter. This group had to be of a slightly higher caliber then the others because a Sengwen rose up out of the floor to meet them. The silver talon on the six hooves shone evilly under the light as the horse body shivered. The fur melded seamlessly with the human torso as its two arms pumped back and forth in anticipation. The large black eyes in the horse head glittered with its intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"I hope they don't do something stupid like use magic on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Want to make a bet? A hundred Reul says they do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Rules of gambling, never bet against the house, you are sure to lose. You know these people better then me, after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pointed out one of the boys who was flanking the creature on the left as a girl distracted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"See that guy? His name is Gregory. He is one of those hot shot hotheads. The ones that always try to one up everyone else. Prove that they are better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm a hot shot hothead sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But you got the skills to back it up at least. He doesn't. He might blast it with magic just to make it transform. With the thought in mind that it would be proof that he was skilled if he took it down and made a name for himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Take it he isn't that skilled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Not even close. You know as well as I a magically fed Sengwin is at least B class. These guys are all barely C class worthy as it is. It would rip through them like candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe watched them struggling against the creature, using basic hit and run tactics against it. With the standard meat shield in front, melee on the side and ranged in the back, they would have it down in another two or three minutes at this rate. Suddenly, right before the thing was about to die, the boy she had pointed out earlier brought his hand around like he was lobbing a softball. A blue orb of energy detached from his hand and hurtled towards the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz and I were already up and running towards the Sengwen as it absorbed the ball and completely recovered its health while at the same time going through its transformation. A second set of arms popped out right underneath the first set as the human like teeth that filled the mouth turned into blue coated fangs. It grew a set of blue spikes down its spine, making it look even nastier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe jumped into the arena as the beast gave a roar of challenge and swiped its now clawed hands. The shield bearer was able to get his shield up in time to absorb the blow but was lifted off his feet and flung through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll take out the feet if you get the head!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'll follow you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put on more speed, sending out magic into my arms to augment my strength. External magic might feed it but internal magic was fine. When I got close, I went into a baseball slide, throwing out my arms as I skidded under its stomach while grabbing the legs. I yanked as hard as I could as I sensed Liz jumping into the air to grab the head and pull it towards the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster smashed hard even as I let go and got back to my feet in one smooth motion. I pointed at the five people in the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Get out of here now! We will take care of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey ran as I took a position next to Liz, the monster slowly getting to its feet. We had a few precious seconds to plan our counterattack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You want to tank or spank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Up to you.\"</span></div></div>",

Double buckler class!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t'Twin sided glaive for me!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sengwen charged and we both rolled out of the way, Liz to the left and me to the right. As it tried halting its forward momentum, its talons hindered it slightly on the cement floor. Just as it was turning around, two racks came up out of the floor close to me. One holding two fan style bucklers and one holding the glaive. I yanked the glaive out and tossed it to Liz, managing to grab the two shields before the monster charged me and destroyed the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlipping my arms through the straps and making sure they were secure, I charged the beast as it began to turn for another attack. It swiped at me as I spread my legs and lifted my left arm. Taking the blow on the single piece of silver metal. As the second arm swung lower at my unprotected side I activated the shield, causing it to fan out into its more natural circular shape. The second claw bounced off the lower half of the shield as it finished fanning out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSpinning on my heels as I jumped, I activated the gold buckler on my right arm, smashing it into the side of its head with a magically augmented shield slam. Stepping on its back, I continued to spin around its neck while deactivating the silver shield and slicing open the flesh under its eye with the sharp edge of the now refolded buckler. The small cut healed instantly due to the magic but that wasn't the point. The point was to grab its attention and focus it on me. Until we burned the magic out of it, the thing was basically invincible and invulnerable. We could cut and hurt it, but not permanently. Meanwhile the magic had made it super strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy tactic worked. It turned towards me and attacked with fists and swipes, rearing up on its back four legs to strike at me with its front two. I simply absorbed the blows, manipulating the shields as I needed. Folding and unfolding them in rapid succession using them both for defense and offense while at the same time keeping my arms free to move around as I pleased. Which made blocking extremely easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile I kept its attention on me, Liz was going to town on its flanks and rear. She swung the glaive like a staff in a figure eight, the blades on either end making quick rapid cuts in the creatures flesh. Sometimes it would kick out at her or strike at her with its razor sharp whip like tail but she spun and dodged easily, almost effortlessly. Sometimes she would jump through the air while turning upside down over the creatures back, stabbing and slicing every chance she could. I had to admit, I was impressed. She was elegant and graceful, turning her weapon of war into a dance of beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIn less than three minutes we made it use up all its magic and then our attacks really did damage. It only took another minute before Liz swung the glaive over her head while I did a split. The weapon missed giving me a scalping but sliced deeply into the creatures neck, nearly severing its head. When it reared up in agony I activated both shields, creating a wall in front of me as I thrust upwards, catching it under the armpits of the first two horse legs and shoving it over onto its back. Liz completed the spin of her weapon, planting the end deep into the humanoid chest where the heart was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe creature broke apart and disappeared, leaving only a belt pouch behind. I picked it up and looked inside while the Arena Master and the class came running up congratulating us. Inside was two gold nuggets, both weighing a few ounces. I handed one to Liz who grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That's rare. At most you ever get one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Be grateful it dropped anything at all, they usually don't. But at least these will fetch us six or seven hundred Reul apiece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we both grinned to each other and slipped the bounty into our pockets, the boy named Gregory pointed at us in indignation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Hey! That's our reward! It was our monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore I could say anything in reply the Arena Master slapped him in the back of the head hard enough to make him stagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shut your trap you idiot. They earned that. First off, it was your fault it got to that point to begin with. You had it down just fine. One more hit would have killed it. But you had to go play the big shot. Second of all, as soon as it transformed it was no longer a C class monster, it was way above your skill level to handle. The only reason I gave your group that monster was because you all proved you were competent and I had believed none of you would do something so foolish. Obviously I was wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You should be grateful they both acted so quickly. I might be fast but from my position I wouldn't have made it without  at least one of you taking some major damage. I hope you all learned something from watching them. They had excellent teamwork and non-verbal communication skills. Sometimes in a real fight you don't have time to sit and plan the where, how, and why of positioning or attack patterns. You have to make split second decisions and convey as much as you can with every spoken word. Because each spoken word is a wasted breath you might need later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne of the boys came limping over holding his side. I knew he was the one who had been holding the shield even though he didn't have it with him. He was the only one who had bothered to wear his metal gauntlets, something that was sorely needed to cushion the impacts on the shield face. He stared at me with the wide-eyed wonder of hero worship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"That was amazing! I mean what you did with those shields I never thought you could attack with them like that! And the way you used the edges like swords! Would you teach me how to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"How's your wounds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Just a few bruises, nothing major.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then why aren't you healing yourself up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Don't got much magic. Actually, hardly got any at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Then why'd you chose to become a Hunter? And a shield bearer at that. That is probably the worst job of all for you because you need lots of of magic to keep yourself healed up and to strengthen your arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because I'm pretty stupid and clumsy. I really don't have much skill with any other weapons. Would probably stab myself before I stabbed a creature. So doing fancy flips and spins like what she did out there is out of the question. Intricate patterns are pretty complicated for me to remember and get down as well. So sword and board seemed like a good choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"As for why I became a Hunter, well I come from a pretty small town up north. We have one Hunter there but he is old and he won't live much longer probably. We don't get many monsters out that way so we manage to eek by somehow. I want to protect my home and my family. Take over the job when old Markus dies. It might not seem like much of a reason but it is important to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI reached over and laid my hand on his side, sending out a bit of magic and healing his bruises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Arena Master. Can you section off a small private arena for the two of us and get him two bucklers like mine please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master fiddled with a little box he pulled out of his pocket, using the specialized magic of his office to fulfill my request. The boy looked at me dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You're going to teach me! I mean I'm grateful but why? I really didn't expect you to say yes. I just sort of blurted it out without thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master handed him the two fan shields and he fumbled to put them on, unfamiliar about how they worked since they were different then the shield he was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Because you want to be a Hunter for all the right reasons. Our job isn't about fame and fortune or honor and glory. It is about protecting people who can't protect themselves. Everyday people who don't have the skills that we do. Or the kind of magic power that we do. You recognize your limits and you don't pretend to something you aren't. You chose the shield because you knew it was within your ability to master. That is why I'll teach you. I can respect that desire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"But he is just some hillbilly hick from a no name town! And a useless first generation Hunter at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pivoted on my heel as I made the buckler on my left arm expand, smashing it into the girls face without warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"And who decides if he is useless or not! You! At least he had the balls to stand his ground against that initial attack! If he hadn't taken that hit it could have been you who was paste on the floor! That doesn't sound so useless to me now does it! So what if he is a first generation! My family was a first generation at one time! Somebody still taught them! Your family was once a first generation, probably your mother or father. Should they have been denied teaching?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to look at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"What's your name and what's the name of your town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Jethic Yonic and my town is called Thorsbough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAngrily I turned back to the girl who was rolling around on the floor bleeding from her broken nose. I stepped on her stomach, forcing her to look up into my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"You hear that? He's not some hillbilly hick. He's Jethic Yonic. And his town has a name. Thorsbough. Remember them both because when I am done with him he will be saving your useless ass one day from becoming a useless corpse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I motioned to Jethic before heading off towards the small corner that had been set apart for us. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Liz plant her glaive on the floor before bending over the moaning girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I think you ticked him off. Just be glad he was in a good mood or he might have hurt you.\"</span></div></div>",

Extended they are still light but they weigh down the arm, which can tire you out quickly. What you want is not pure defense, but speed and stamina laced with accuracy. Now try it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI attacked slowly. Having already judged his skill and speed I simply adjusted my attacks accordingly. I made sure to go just fast enough that he would feel like he was getting his shield into place just in time. Which would make him feel slow and make him push himself to get just a tad bit faster. I would increase speed in this way so he would never notice just how good he was getting. It would take time, but I was willing to put in the effort. Because he wasn\u2019t like the rest of these people. From the little conversation we had and what I had learned while teaching him, he was dedicated to becoming a Hunter. Body, mind, and soul. I had to respond to that need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of the attack. You already know that since you chose the shield. That is the basics of using one. To stand your ground and take the brunt of the blow. But with this style it is especially important. When you are good enough sometimes that thin piece of metal on the back of your arm will be all the shield you have. Not a big round circle. Learn how many seconds it takes for the buckler to unfold and fold back up. The rate at which it does so. Those seconds are the difference between someone living and someone dying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI threw a kick out to the side and he automatically spread his legs while throwing up his right arm to block. He was doing what most tank types were taught to do without thinking, what was called entrenching. It was good for big shields like he was used to but not for bucklers. I halted my attack in mid strike, pivoting on the ball of my foot and reversing the spin while bending my knee. Turning my snap kick into a leg sweep. He fell over backwards, but had enough mind to break his fall like he had learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you before, bucklers are not like big templar style shields. They are designed to take quick rapid hits over big beefy ones. And with this style especially, it is more for deflection than full on assaults. You take the hit and you roll with it. You turn it to the side and then you strike back. How do you expect to strike if you are standing like a wall?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling the end of class. I offered him a hand up which he took while rubbing his backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are learning a whole new mindset. You weren\u2019t bad for your first day. But you need a lot more practice. So from now on I want you to come over to my place after school when you can for private lessons. You can have my old set of dual shields that I trained with. Keep up the practice at home and before you know it you will be well on your way to mastering the skills.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis eyes went big and round again as if I had just told him I would introduce him to The One God himself. I could understand his awe though, just about everybody here would want to take private lessons from me or be given some of my old training equipment. Once they found out, they would all be envious of him. Which was part of the reason I was doing it as well. To snub my nose at their disdain of someone trying his hardest to be a Hunter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we headed towards the locker room I glanced over at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the way, how\u2019s the arms?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA bit sore, but not like they usually are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s because you aren\u2019t taking the full blow. With little magic like you have it will help you tank longer without the need of healing yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for all your help. You have no idea how much I appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I know. But don\u2019t thank me just yet. You will find I\u2019m not an easy trainer. You will be cursing my name soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head to me as I opened the door and he split off to pack up his stuff. I headed straight for my duffle bag and found both of the weapons sitting on top of the rest inside. With a slight nod of approval I zipped up the duffle and headed out the door. Next would be History and then finally Monster Theory and Tactics. This day was almost over thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could already see the change in power going on in the classroom as some of the other boys and girls were already gathering around Jethic with his new sudden popularity from being associated with me. Perhaps I should warn him to be careful who he trusted. A moment of contemplation made me disregard that thought. Considering how he had been treated before he probably knew that already. And it was up to him to decide who he wanted to make alliances and connections with, not me. If they were bad ones then he would learn on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShortly after class started a short squat woman with blond hair and a patch over her right eye wearing a low cut yellow dress came into the room and whispered to the teacher. I was already grabbing up my bag and standing up before he even pointed at me to let me know my mother wanted to talk to me. Seconds later I was out the door walking side by side with the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Hilda, what does my mother want with me now? Must be important if she is calling me out of class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s really not my place but all I can say is she wants to offer you a job. I\u2019ll let her explain the details.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAn official Hunter\u2019s job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it comes to that, yes I believe so. Though I think she would prefer it be more\u2026 unofficial considering your unique position.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMeaning she is doing what she always does and treating me as a full fledged Monster Combat Hunter when it is convenient for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not for me to make judgments. I simply work for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour too good for her Hilda. You\u2019re the only one I know of that she hasn\u2019t fired yet. That means your good at your job, but that also means you could find better employment considering my mother\u2019s personality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right, I can. And I have even been offered better. But I owe your mother a debt, so I stay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHilda opened the door to the meeting room and motioned me inside. I thanked her with a small tip of the head and walked in. I was met by my mother who was sitting at a table with her hands folded in front of her and a small smile on her lips. Her eyes lit up when she saw me, making her jump out of her chair to wrap me in a hug and kiss my cheeks. I ignored her for the moment and studied the little girl with white hair and red eyes who sat like a statue staring straight ahead while clutching a teddy bear. She wore a light green dress that did not look good on her at all and I could see the tattered shape of her shoes peeking out under the table from where I stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Hilda says you have a job for me mother? I assume it has to do with this little girl, otherwise you would not have brought her with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat across the table from the two of them when she motioned for me to do so, putting on my Hunter\u2019s face even as my mother dropped down her work mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right. I want you to guard this girl for a few days. Me and your father got contracted for another job and taking her with us is out of the question. Her name is Asala and she is a monster summoner. Her powers are a bit unstable so she tends to summon monsters when her emotions run high from things like sudden frights. As you can see she has sort of shut down on us and no one can seem to pull her out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe were wondering what to do with her when you called me earlier. That\u2019s when I remembered how good you are with kids, even if you suck at dealing with people your own age. Her parents died three days ago and her power suddenly manifested because of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou couldn\u2019t think of anyone else? I mean I understand the options would be limited since not a lot of Hunter\u2019s can tolerate those with summoner blood, or any rare magic ability for that matter. But with all the people you know why chose me? I\u2019m not an official Hunter because you don\u2019t want me to be until I finish school. And honestly speaking, a job like this would require an official Hunter. Doing it under the table isn\u2019t exactly viable. Since I can foresee there being times when I need the protection of being on official Hunter business to keep her safe.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is one other person I could think of, but it was Pelei.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I can see why you wouldn\u2019t chose him first. He could do the job, and he is more experienced than me, but his personality would scare the poor girl worse than she already is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m willing to give you temporary Hunter status under my name if you do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut not under my own name huh? Still with the whole you have to finish school kick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I want you to continue to go to school while protecting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s asking quite a lot mother. Do you have any idea how much that will make me stand out? You are the one that told me not to make waves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got my reasons darling. And I feel it is important for you to stay in school even if you accept the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou always have your reasons mother. And they always work out to benefit you the most no matter who else they hurt. Or benefit the family name and image even if it destroys someone\u2019s life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked from my mother to the girl who didn\u2019t even seem to realize I existed. The only way to tell she was alive was by the small rise and fall of her chest. </span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t feel like being generous and giving you a family discount but I can\u2019t ask full price since I\u2019m not a licensed Hunter either. Regardless of your reasons and whether you are willing to tell them to me or not, I won\u2019t ruin this child\u2019s life because of it. It\u2019s not her fault that I have my problems with you and not her fault she has these abilities. Right now I think she needs someone who understands her more than she needs some crackpot Hunter with a penchant for dress up. I\u2019m putting the child\u2019s interest ahead of my own just like I am supposed to do as a Hunter. Perhaps you could take a page out of my book sometime. It might make you a better mother if not a better Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDarling your words cut me deeply!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. They were meant to. But I don\u2019t even know why I waste my breath, it won\u2019t affect you anyway. You will just continue to be you. But know this; one of these days it\u2019s going to come back and bite you in the backside. It\u2019s a sad day when it is your son who has to tell you this instead of it being the other way around. Now do you accept my offer or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with those sad eyes of hers but I wouldn\u2019t let them work on me this time. I had long ago learned to ignore this fake sad face. Finally she let out a sigh and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI accept. Hilda, if you could transfer the money over into his account for me please? I hope someday you come to understand Riktal. Things aren\u2019t always what they seem. It might not seem like it now, but I really do have your best interests at heart. You are my precious baby boy and I only want what\u2019s best for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah just like Olia was your precious baby girl. And I\u2019m sure you only had her best interests at heart as you dragged her kicking and screaming into the woods never to return again. I\u2019m tired of listening to your B.S. mother. Don\u2019t you have some job or other to do? Go bark and wag your tail for a foreign military or something. That\u2019s what you have always been good at anyways, dumping problems on me and running off to leave me alone for days or weeks until I somehow muddle through it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother opened her mouth to say something but closed it again without a word. With a slow nod of her head she got out of her chair and headed towards the door. I simply sat and watched her in silence until I heard the click of the slab of wood closing again. Hilda looked at the door and then back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say anything\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd yet you still will even if I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe loves you, you know. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t seem like it but she does. She talks about you all the time and how proud she is of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpare me Hilda. I know she loves me. That has never been a doubt in my mind. But I doubt she is proud of me. She is simply proud that I turned out to be a worthy successor to the Zelkov name. That seems to be all she is ever worried about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t really talk about your mother like that. It hurts her deeply, even if she does act like it doesn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe is barely my mother. She is the woman who never had much time for me. Half the time growing up I lived with a nanny. The other half the time my big sister raised me. You can\u2019t call a woman who is home maybe once a week if you are lucky a mother. You can\u2019t call a woman who would rather go out working to increase the family fortune when we have enough to fund a private army of our own a mother.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf she had a choice between spending a holiday or a birthday with her child or going overseas to do a job, she would pick the job. I know this for a fact because she does it every year. The last time I remember her being home for Christmas or my birthday was when I was five. The only time she has spent any significant amount of time with me is when she was teaching me the skills of being a Hunter. Even then she didn\u2019t treat me as her child, just another Hunter in training. So don\u2019t you dare say I shouldn\u2019t talk about my mother like that. You have no right to decide that for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with a sad eye similar to the one my mother gave me before bowing and telling me the money was in my account. Once that was done she turned and left the room as well. I rubbed my eyes a few times before glancing across the table at the little girl who was squeezing her bear a bit tighter, a small indication that she knew what was going on around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry you had to hear all that. You must think I have a pretty messed up family don\u2019t you? Well you are right, it is pretty dysfunctional. Even I am amazed at how we all manage to interact with each other most of the time. I bet you don\u2019t think much of me right now after hearing me berate my mother like that. I know I probably should just keep my mouth shut but somehow when I am around her I just can\u2019t. It\u2019s not like I really hate her, or I don\u2019t understand that sometimes there are circumstances beyond my control or understanding.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 when I see her all I can see is all the things I missed out on because I wasn\u2019t a normal person. Other families don\u2019t have to deal with what I do. I see normal kids with normal parents doing normal things all the time. Birthdays, holidays, normal gifts, school functions. When I was six years old my mother sent me a present for Christmas from wherever it was she was working at the time. The card didn\u2019t even have any words on it, just a bunch of X\u2019s and O\u2019s. Do you know what was inside? Armor and a sword.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot toy cars like other boys would get, or even some exotic candy from where she was. Not action figures or anything normal and mundane like that. No. Armor and a sword, along with an instruction book on basic stances and moves. Then she came home a month later and do you know what the first thing she did was? She attacked me. She came in the door swinging a sword at me to see if I had been practicing with the gift she had sent. Then afterwards she said I still needed to work on my form and left me alone. She was gone the next day on another job. Never once did she touch me in a caring way. No hugs and kisses or anything motherly like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that I am all grown up she thinks she can make up for all the time she wasn\u2019t a mother. As if kissing me and hugging me now will somehow make me forget just how crappy she was at parenting before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got up with a sigh and went around the table to sit next to the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry. I didn\u2019t mean to bog you down with my troubles or my life story. Especially when you have troubles of your own. At least I still have my mother and father, even if I rarely see either of them. I know how it feels to lose someone you care about. It\u2019s a pretty devastating feeling. Like a black hole in the middle of your chest that is sucking everything into it. A pain in your heart that it seems no amount of medicine or magic can get rid of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pointed to her head and her heart before continuing on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as you live and breath, you will remember your parents in those two places. You keep them close and they will never disappear. They might fade as you grow up but they won\u2019t disappear unless you want them to. It\u2019s going to be a long process, I won\u2019t lie to you. You will end up hating yourself, hating them, hating the world. Then you will feel horrible that you hate everything. But it is something you have to go through if you want to become stronger. Time moves on without us and we can\u2019t stay stuck in the past forever.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere will be a lot of crying and a lot of pain as you grieve and let it out. But there will also be good times too. It\u2019s not all sad. You will meet new people, make new friends, have new experiences. Find people you can consider as family or as close as family as to make no difference. You will laugh and get angry again one day. Smile and joke around. It\u2019s not a sin or a crime against those memories you hold. It\u2019s just part of growing up and moving on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut all of that is in the future. Just something you have to look forward to. Right now it is perfectly fine for you to feel the pain of their loss. I bet you haven\u2019t had a really good cry since it all happened did you? They just whisked you away and told you not to cry or there was no time for tears right now. Perhaps they were afraid of your power and thought if you cried you would summon a monster. I don\u2019t know how true any of that is of course, but going by what I know of most Hunter\u2019s and people in general I bet it isn\u2019t far from the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI reached out and pulled her in close, stroking her hair softly while she remained limp and unresponsive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I say you can cry all you want whenever you want. I won\u2019t stop you. And if some monster appears or someone tells you to stop, I will take care of it. No matter how big mean and scary it might be, I will protect you from it. I\u2019m not afraid of your power or of a scrawny little girl like you. You can believe me or not but that won\u2019t make anything I said any less true.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlowly as I continued to stroke her hair, her arms came up to grip me tightly around the waist. Her wails were muffled at first as if she was trying to stifle them but they grew in volume until she was going off in a full blown siren mode. Her tears and snot drenching my leather tunic as I made small calming sounds the same way my sister used to do for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to comfort her until she stopped bawling on her own and pushed herself away from me gently while sniffing and rubbing at her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFeel a little better now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a slow nod, that devoid blank stare long gone from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. If you ever feel like another good cry my chest is always open. Though I might have to find a green tunic so the snot stains aren\u2019t so noticeable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI raised an eyebrow at her before giving a dramatic sigh and looking down at my tunic with a woebegone expression on my face. I looked back up in time to see her lips twitching upwards in a grin and a small hiccup like chuckle escape her mouth.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cListen you probably aren\u2019t going to like this, but we need to go back to class. It was part of my agreement with my mother. I know, or at least I can assume, that you are pretty afraid of crowds and new places. All those eyes staring at you, watching you as if they know all about your ability. But do you think you could manage for like forty minutes if I am right there next to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shrunk back away from me shaking her head no. I refrained from letting out a sigh, nodding my head in understanding. I had hoped it would be that easy but I wasn\u2019t expecting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLook. I understand your reluctance, I really do. Given the choice I would rather never come back to this school ever again. Those eye are always watching me too. Wondering what they can get out of me. How they can use me. I have no doubt having you next to me will cause a commotion and they will converge on us afterwards like a flock of squawking vultures wanting to know everything. But I won\u2019t let them harm you. You have my word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched the girl as she squeezed the bear tighter but she didn\u2019t shake her head again either way. I suddenly got an idea that made me smile as I dug through my duffle bag, pulling out a small rectangular box. It only took a bit of work to pull the siding off after finding my small toolkit. Carefully I pulled out the fragment of heart crystal inside. It was a magical battery that powered artifacts. If I destroyed it while it was filled with energy like this I could take out a good chunk of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is a special stone filled with magic. More specifically it has protection magic in it. If you will trust me for just a moment I can put this inside your teddy bear. Then anytime you squeeze on him really hard, a magical field will surround you. If you had something like that do you think you would be willing to put up with going to class with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe searched my eyes to see if I was lying before finally nodding her head and holding out the bear. I gave her a reassuring smile before cutting a small slit in the animals back along a seam and pushing the crystal inside. It took a few moments to create magical connections and wrap it in my power so it didn\u2019t accidentally break but finally it was done. It wasn\u2019t as high grade an artifact as the box was but she was more comfortable with the bear. Pulling a sewing kit out of one of the side pockets I got to work repairing the damage I had done along the seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI used to be pretty bad at sewing you know. Always poking myself with the needle and my stitches were laughable. But I learned to get better because another little girl I once knew was always ripping her stuffed animals or her dresses. I learned how to brush and braid long hair because of her too, so if you ever feel like you want a little primping up let me know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was done sewing the bear up I handed it back to her. She inspected my sewing job and nodded like she was saying it was acceptable. I laughed a bit as I led her by the hand out the door and back to my last class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as we stepped inside all eyes turned towards us as the gears and the whispers began. Asala squeezed her bear tightly and a light purple shield came up around her. The only reason I could still hold her hand was because it was my magic powering the shield. The stone was only activating it. I could feel the energy slowly draining from me. If I had thought I could have gotten her to use the box I would have. Then the power would come from the stone instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly whispered with the teacher and he nodded his head as I led the little girl towards my desk, snagging an empty chair from nearby as I passed. I positioned her closer to the wall before sitting down. Now if anyone wanted to come at her they had to go through me first. The purple shield still surrounded her but I could feel the drain weakening as she slowly loosened her hold on the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cClass. It seems we will be having a special guest with us for the next few days. Mr. Zelkov has taken on a job of protecting the young lady with him and due to reasons of his own, he has decided to continue attending class. As such she will be joining us until this job is over. It seems she is very shy and he asks that nobody frighten her too much by converging on her or asking her a lot of questions. That is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe returned to his discussion on the Cawmacaw, transitioning over to the Cadaver Dog after a moment. I hoped his words would keep some of them away at least for a little bit but I doubted it would work for long. People were just too curious by nature. And some would do the exact opposite of what they were asked simply because they were told not to. I saw the heads constantly turning to look at us as the thoughts ran through their heads. I could see theories and reasons bursting into existence in their minds and knew rumors would be flying by tomorrow. This was one of the reasons I hadn\u2019t wanted to bring her to class with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally the day ended and I let out a small sigh of relief. Now I could focus on the girl so tomorrow wouldn\u2019t be so bad. If I could make her less afraid I wouldn\u2019t have the constant drain on my magic as she hugged that bear all the time. Even as I was standing up a few of the boys and girls made a beeline towards me. Couldn\u2019t they just take a hint and leave us alone? Hadn\u2019t I tried to be nice and ask them not to converge on us? But they were either dense, stupid, or their desire to be associated with me simply trumped all their common sense. At least most of the class went about their day even though I saw some of them looking as if they wanted to join the group converging on us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s amazing! Taking a job while still in school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s so cute! I\u2019ve never see anyone with red eyes before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs she like your little sister or something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the drain on my magic as she squeezed the bear tighter and hid behind my legs. I let my hand slip behind me to gently pat her side, trying to let her know it was going to be all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe is not my little sister. Could you all please go away? It would be best to take the teachers warning to heart. Just keep your distance for the next few days. She will be gone soon enough. Besides, can\u2019t you people see she is scared? Have a bit of common sense would you? Acting like a bunch of rabid wolves and ganging up on her like this is not going to make her feel safe. And it is not going to get you into my good graces either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy words seemed to have at least some impact on a few of them as they backed away unobtrusively. But the rest who were left couldn\u2019t seem to take the hint. Funnily enough it was mostly girls. They always did seem to be a bit more dense than other people in matters like this. It had to be something about babies and little children that they couldn\u2019t leave alone, even when told to go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat hair looks like it is made out of silk! Can I touch it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl didn\u2019t even wait for an ok before reaching out towards Asala. I felt the magic increase as she suddenly squeezed the animal tighter and was moving almost without thought. My right hand came up across my body, grabbing her wrist and twisting it behind her back while I pivoted. My left hand grabbed her by the hair and smashed her face into the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan I smash your face into the desk? First off it is rude to simply do something or attempt to do something without asking and getting consent first. I\u2019m sure if I had asked first you would have said no. Then why did you think it was all right to take the liberty of reaching out to touch her without her answer? I tried to be nice to all of you and get you to go away without any fuss. But it seems you are all too stupid or dense to get the picture.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t care for you coming near me or the girl for the next few days. Stay as far away from me and her as possible or I will rip your intestines out through your throat and hang you with them. Do I make myself clear\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl under my hands gave a choked yes as the other girls standing around also consented. I lifted the woman I had a hold of by her hair, letting her blood drip everywhere and shoved her down the aisle towards the door before glaring at the other four girls gathered around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen get the hell out of my sight before I get angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz cam over as they ran out the door. She gave me a nod before squatting on her heels and making eye contact with Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The names Liz. I think you got a good guy protecting you so you don't have to worry. even if he does have a stupid looking face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz chuckled a moment before digging into her pocket and pulling out a chocolate roll, holding it out to Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou like chocolate? It\u2019s my last one. It might be a bit warm and soft but still good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala looked at the candy and then at Liz. Her eyes going back and forth between the two for a few moments before she slowly reached out and accepted the candy with a nod of thanks. Liz stood back up, giving me a wave of farewell before heading towards the door. Once she was gone I turned to look at the girl who was sticking the piece of chocolate into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? That wasn\u2019t too bad now was it? I guarantee tomorrow with be a bit easier. So I guess the question now is are you hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA small quick bobbing of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then how about we find something to eat? Think you would be up to a small expedition into town since you have your bear and me with you? We can eat at a quiet restaurant, maybe do a bit of shopping. Find you a prettier dress at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe fear returned to her eyes as she squeezed the bear lightly. Not enough to activate the shield though. Finally after a few moments where her body was as stiff as a board she dipped her head slowly. So she was willing to go into town, but based on the reaction that might not be the best call quite yet. Perhaps I should leave well enough alone and not push things farther.</span></div></div>",

You probably aren\u2019t all that comfortable around crowds yet, even with your friend there. We can go out shopping tomorrow for some new clothes and such. I think I got a few oversized shirts that will fit you as a nightgown tonight while I wash those things for you. Plus I doubt you will get any tooth decay if you don\u2019t brush your teeth for one night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took her hand as I shouldered my bag, guiding her to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m told I make a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I mean, all little boys and girls like those don\u2019t they?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer head bobbed up and down like it was on a spring as her eyes lit up a bit. I grinned at her as I led her through the halls. She was a lot like Olia. Dealing with her wasn\u2019t all that hard if I thought of her that way. I wondered if she liked her crust pinched as well to keep in the jelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we left the front door I saw a group of three boys picking on another one by the front gates. That seemed to be universal everywhere whether it was a Hunter academy or not. There would always be bullies who found enjoyment in picking on other people. I thought it was funny how they almost always ran in packs, you rarely saw a bully by themselves. As I got closer I noticed the one they were picking on was Jethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic! You\u2019re a tank remember? Treat them like monsters and show them what I taught you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic looked back and saw me standing there, surprise written all over his face. One of the bullies pushed him and I simply cocked my eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell Jethic? Are you saying you didn\u2019t learn anything? They are weak. Why do you think they ganged up on you? You will never make it as a tank if you get taken down by weaklings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-but\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo buts\u2019! don\u2019t think, just do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw one of the other boys getting ready to push him from the side while he was looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSwipe from the left!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe raised his left hand automatically and shoved the push wide as he stepped inside the mans body while pivoting on his foot, bringing up his right forearm. He caught the bully square in the nose with the back of his armor covered hand, continuing the pivot to backhand another of the boys in the throat with his left arm. When a third boy threw a punch at the back of his head he dropped his knee while spinning. The blow flew over his head harmlessly seconds before he shoved upwards, ramming his gauntleted fist into his opponents chin. The boy was lifted off his feet and sent flying to land on his back in a daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a grin I stepped up next to Jethic who was blinking in amazement at what he had just done. I slapped him on the back good naturedly before laughing at the three boys that had been picking on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee Jethic? They are weak. Humans are just another form of monster. In fact sometimes we are the worse ones. We know what we are doing, the same can\u2019t be said for all monsters out in the wild. You said you want to protect your hometown, well sometimes that will mean protecting it from people and not creatures. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are from old families or from families that have other hunters in it. It doesn\u2019t matter if they have political power and influence or wealth.  They fall and they bleed just like everything else. No one has the right to dictate how you live your life or stop you from defending yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two boys had run to their friends side and was helping him to his feet. I pointed at all three of them with an evil grin on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure my friend here will be glad to show you the fruits of his training again if you need a reminder. I doubt he will be such an easy mark anymore so you need to find new prey. I can\u2019t guarantee he won\u2019t smack you around again though, after all he is a tank who takes protecting people seriously.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boys offered a few empty threats before scurrying away. I let out another belly laugh as I turned to Jethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope you learned something from this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah I think I did. I have no problem killing monsters, but when it comes to fighting people I hesitate. But when I thought about them as monsters like you said it was easy. Almost natural.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at the girl who was hiding behind my legs and smiled softly. He got down on one knee before speaking directly to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHello. As you probably figured out, my name is Jethic. I\u2019m training to become a tank. That is, someone who protects other people with a shield so they don\u2019t get hurt. I hope I didn\u2019t frighten you or anything. I got a little sister of my own back home. I haven\u2019t seen her for almost a year now. I haven\u2019t even heard from her in about half that time. I wonder how she is doing and I worry about her all the time. So I have an idea of how afraid you must be. I won\u2019t say not to be afraid, because that\u2019s probably impossible. But if anything ever happens, I will protect you no matter what. That\u2019s a promise from me to you. And my dad always told me a man must always keep his promises.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl stared at Jethic without saying anything for a long time. Slowly I felt the magic stop draining from me as she stopped squeezing the bear. She held out her hand and whispered in an almost inaudibly soft voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic shook her hand before standing up again. I knew then he would make a good Hunter. He was already way ahead of all these other students in more than one way. Any good Hunter knew how to deal with people. Most Hunters knew how but not many actually utilized that skill. I wasn\u2019t talking about normal everyday dealing with people. I was talking about how to put someone at ease or gain their trust quickly. We needed that to do our jobs effectively. Most times it was easy because the people already trusted us simply because we were Hunter\u2019s. But then you had cases like Asala\u2019s where they needed to trust the individual and not the title.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us began walking towards town at a leisurely pace. I gave Jethic a few more pointers on his form and made some hand motions as demonstration. Jethic told me a little bit about his family back home and how he lived with his aunt and uncle while he was going to school here. Asala was content to hold my hand and simply walk on the other side of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you really mean what you said back there? That I was your friend? Or were you just saying that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHonestly? I was just saying that to give you more importance in their minds then was really there. But I wouldn\u2019t mind making it the truth I guess. You aren\u2019t such a bad guy and you were able to get Asala to speak so that\u2019s something. I can get behind your motivations and I can actually stand being around you. Though I must warn you, I\u2019m not the easiest person to get along with. Today just happened to be one of my good days. There will probably be times you will wonder how you could ever be friends with me. But if you really want to try it then be my guest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic gave me a lopsided smile as he turned his head in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou seem to have a bit of a skewed outlook on friendship. My father said you don\u2019t always get to chose your friends. Sometimes friendships just happen whether you want them to or not. It\u2019s not like some contract the two of you sign.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah that proves you are from a newer Hunter family. When you come from old blood like me you can\u2019t be so loose with your friendships. It really is more about alliances than actual friendships. You have to worry about who you let get close to you, how close you let them get, and what benefits you can give each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad I\u2019m not you then. I don\u2019t think I would like to live like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s all I know. All I ever grew up knowing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right! Then I have decided! I am going to make you change your mind! I\u2019m going to show you that\u2019s not what it\u2019s always all about. I\u2019m going to make you call me your friend and mean it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood luck with that. You\u2019ve got about ten generations of conditioning to get past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA paltry number. If I can get over my fear of hitting someone else then tackling this will be nothing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou at least don\u2019t lack the confidence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen we got into town he gave me a wave, heading off to the right while I continued on ahead. Watching him go I oddly felt that he just might be able to pull it off. I liked his attitude at least. But if he was able to put up with me then he deserved the title of friend for that fact alone. I wrapped my arm around Asala\u2019s shoulder as I pulled her in a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on Asala, let\u2019s go home. There is a pinched crust PB and J sandwich with your name on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo are you satisfied with the choices you made and the path you led Riktal down? Were they all easy to make? Did you second guess yourself afterwards? Do you think in the end the choices didn\u2019t even really matter? Perhaps the day would have ended exactly like this no matter what choices you made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t Perhaps next time you come you will get a chance to find out. Make different decisions, open a new path, say different things. Untold possibilities and countless choices. What destiny awaits?</span></div></div>",

Unless you are hiding some extras in your pocket I don\u2019t know about. I\u2019ll be right here with you and you got your new shield so there is nothing to worry about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI put my arm around her as I guided her out the door and down the hall. Making small talk to try and draw a little more information from her. What she liked and disliked maybe. Mainly just trying to keep her in the here and now while making her feel more at ease around me. It didn\u2019t seem to have any affect at the moment, but this was a long term process. There was no real quick fix for grief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we came to the front doors I saw Jethic standing in the hall letting out a breath like he was preparing himself for something. Asala squeezed her bear hard enough to make a light shield come up as I approached him. But my arm on her shoulder and my closeness seemed to assure her a little bit which was a small start. As he started out the door I fell into step beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Jethic, hope you don\u2019t mind postponing our training for a few days. Right now this little girl here takes priority.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at me a bit surprised, as if he hadn\u2019t expected me to talk to him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cT-that\u2019s ok. I got a little sister back home and if she was in that girls shoes I would want someone making her a priority as well. I spent a lot of time with old Markus. He told me all these stories about what it takes to be a Hunter and how a job should always come first over everything else. He also said how sometimes it was a hard choice to make when it came into conflict with protecting the regular citizens. He taught me the basics of sword and shield and even gave me his old gear that I use in practice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we went through the school gates I saw three boys slinking in the shadows and Jethic giving them a nervous look. They didn\u2019t come any closer, just followed him with their eyes until we were out of sight. He let out a small sigh under his breath and I nodded knowingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBully trouble?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. nothing like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t lie. It\u2019s written all over your face.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk so they give me trouble all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen knock them out. You\u2019re a tank, you specialize in taking on multiple enemies at once. You\u2019re not half bad either. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you could put them all flat on their backs. Even if you can\u2019t they won\u2019t leave you alone if you continue to be a doormat they can step on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, but I sort of have this problem with people. I can handle monsters just fine, and I can spar with people no problem. But when I think of actually fighting them with the intent to hurt or kill I hesitate. I just can\u2019t seem to follow through with my attacks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll beat that out of you soon enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we continued to walk towards town a sudden urge overtook me. Perhaps it was inspiration from some half formed idea in the back of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Jethic. Me and Asala here are going to grab a bite to eat and do a bit of shopping before we head home. You want to come with us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cW-what? Why? Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy? Well if I have to give a reason I guess you could say it\u2019s for Asala\u2019s benefit. She is afraid of crowds and people in general. It would do her good to interact with someone else besides me a little bit. And I\u2019m sure she might feel safer knowing someone who specializes in tanking is around.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you\u2019re a better tank than me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s true. But I\u2019m an all around combat specialist. You have one job so to speak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen sure I guess! As long as you don\u2019t mind me stopping at my house on the way. I live with my aunt and uncle and they get worried when I don\u2019t come right home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic knelt on the ground in front of Asala who looked at him warily but not a lot of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI might not be the best tank Hunter out there. But my shield is yours if you need it. I will defend you with my last breath no matter what if it comes to that. You have my word on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic stood up and we continued walking, making a right at the first intersection. He led me to a small wood crafting store that sold hand made furniture. I was a bit surprised as he opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re related to old man Gabis?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know my uncle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSort of, I commissioned him to make something for me once.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe entered the shop as a bell jangled over our heads. The smell of sawdust and wood glue met my nostrils as the man behind the counter looked up from what he was carving. He wasn\u2019t really old, only around thirty five or so. But when I was here two years ago he said to call him old man Gabis because everyone did. He grinned at me as Jethic said hello before going through the back door. I heard the creaking of steps so I assumed their apartment was upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey your Mr. Zelkov! Haven\u2019t seen you for what is it, two years now? How\u2019s that locket I made for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou still remember what I ordered? That\u2019s impressive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCourse I remember. It\u2019s not everyday you get such a unique order. A locket made out of Doma wood and covered in gold. Had to get an advance to buy such rare wood. That must have been a pretty important spell you placed on it though. That\u2019s the only reason I could think you wanted such a special wood for. It holds magic so well nothing can nullify it. But it\u2019s so rare and expensive you don\u2019t usually see it used on something so small.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIndeed it was a very important spell that was cast on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope your lady friend liked it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe loved it. It was truly top class work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what are you here for? Have another job for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. Actually I\u2019m here with Jethic. I invited him out to eat and do a bit of shopping. This little girl here needs some new clothes and such and I thought it would do her good to have someone else along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was a pounding of feet as of someone running down the steps and a slightly pudgy woman rounded the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBern! You won\u2019t believe this! Jethic is going to get trained by a Zelkov!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman blinked as if suddenly realizing I was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t realize you had a customer. I\u2019m sorry sir, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt your business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat\u2019s all right ma\u2019am. Though I\u2019m not a customer right now. I\u2019m the Zelkov in question.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOld man Gabis burst out laughing as his wife\u2019s eyes turned into saucers and she held her hand up to her mouth. Her cheeks flushed red right before she ducked back into hiding. Jethic came out of the back then grinning at his aunt\u2019s reaction as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe always was a bit excitable, but that was one of the reasons I fell in love with her. As you can see she can also be easily embarrassed. So you\u2019re going to be teaching my nephew huh? Then I definitely know he will become a top class Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded with his head behind me and I turned around to see Asala running her fingers along the grain of a table and nodding her head absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think your girl must have a knack for woodworking. Not many people can spot the seam like she did. And it seems like she knows quality work too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe came back over to my side and gave the old man a thumbs up of approval. He tilted his head to the side in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad to see I got her seal of approval. So Mr. Zelkov, what do you think of these new communication artifacts they just invented. You know, the ones they call the telephone. Supposed to be able to let you talk to anyone anywhere in the world. You don\u2019t need to have strong magic or have the person imprint their magical id into your spell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think you should invest in them if you can. I\u2019m sure there will be a lot of bugs at first, but I can see it taking off. I\u2019m not sure how they plan to make it work exactly, probably amplifier crystals or something spaced out across the continent. But I can see them being in every home eventually.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh if I had that kind of money though. I wish I could invest in it, but I\u2019m barely scraping by as it is. Just not as much call for hand crafted stuff you know. But this is the only thing I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded in understanding but didn\u2019t say anything else. Taking Asala by the hand again, the three of us left the store.</span></div></div>",

She still hadn\u2019t said anything but she was definitely in a much better mood and more at ease with me. She was still a bit wary of Jethic but she wasn\u2019t squeezing her bear around him anymore either. I gave her head a small rub as I looked across the table at Jethic who was eating an expensive steak. He had been hesitant to order it at first but I had told him it was on me. Since he was coming out here on my whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo your family up north. You talk to them often?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really. I haven\u2019t mastered the communication spell yet so I can\u2019t call them whenever I want. And like my uncle said, we are poor so I can\u2019t even afford a low grade artifact. Mostly I write to them. I haven\u2019t seen them in almost a year now and the last time I talked to them was about six months ago. Sometimes when uncle Bern has a bit of extra money he buys a cheap throwaway communication spell for a few Reul I can use until it runs out. Mostly any money I make I give to them for room and board.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy parents nearly broke their bank accounts buying me the ticket here and enrolling me in the academy. They knew I wanted to be a Hunter but I hadn\u2019t planned on going to school for it because we were struggling to make it as it was. But a week before school started they handed me the ticket and told me to go. That my aunt and uncle were going to lodge me for the three years of academy. So I have to become a top class Hunter not only to protect them all but to prove to them that their sacrifices were worth it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe made a little more small talk as we finished our meal. Asala was even smiling a little and giggling at some of our jokes. I paid the bill and we left, finding a store and letting Asala try on clothes. Jethic was finally becoming comfortable around me as well. Having lost that hero worship anxiety. As the little girl came out of the changing room to showcase what she was wearing the two of us acted like silly girls going goo-goo over what she was wearing. Giving small whistles of appreciation or throwing our hands up to our faces and shrieking in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI\u2019m sure the saleswomen thought we were crazy but they refrained from pointing at us. Simply whispering behind their hands. There was even a point where I held up a dress to my chest and raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you think? Look good on me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic snapped his fingers and shook his head, walking up to me with one hand out to his side. He reached passed me and grabbed a pink dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNuh-uh Darling. That dress is simply so not you. Blue is sooo overrated. But pink is definitely your color! This will make you look Fa-bu-lous!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur antics finally elicited a belly laugh from Asala who held her stomach as she wiped tears from her eyes. The two of us shared a grin as we put the clothes back. I whispered my thanks for playing along and he gave me a wink, whispering back that he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe finally left the store ladened down with four bags of clothes, shoes, accessories, and some personal hygiene products. Enough to satisfy any little girl for a while. She walked happily between the two of us as I led us to our next destination. Jethic entered without thinking until he saw we were in a Hunter\u2019s general store. Different from the stores specializing in just weapons or artifacts or anything of that nature, these stores held stuff commonly used by both Hunters and regular people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe owner looked up from where he was reading a magazine, the scar running from cheek to cheek across his nose standing out starkly against his black skin. He saw me and grinned putting the magazine down and standing up to shake my hand over the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! How you doing man! So what kind of business you got for me today? Ivory tusks? Enchanted weapons you need appraising?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled the nugget from my pocket and slipped it across the counter towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGold. Sengwen kill after it went to phase two. Might have some trace magic on it but I don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe began pulling out scales and other tools of his trade to examine it closely. As he worked I held out my hand to Jethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the way, Terin, this is Jethic Yonic. Remember his name since I have a feeling he will end up having a bit of business with you in the future. Treat him good will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf he got your recommendation, then I have no choice but to treat him well. Otherwise I might lose your business.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced over at Jethic as he continued to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot that he would treat you bad to begin with mind you. But he might be willing to give you a few extra Reuls for an item or keep you in mind for jobs he might not otherwise tell you about. Just don\u2019t let him talk you into playing cards with him or you might lose some of those extra Reuls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe black man grinned but kept working, finally putting the nugget in front of me on the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeven hundred Reul. Its not quite pure but it\u2019s at least twenty karat. You were right, some traces of magic which will make it good artifact material.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal. Also got any quality communication artifacts here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic opened his mouth to say something but I held up my hand to keep him quiet. He did so as Terin went into the back room a moment and came back with a small box you could close your hand on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is from Carpa and it\u2019s high grade. Get\u2019s the best reception and the farthest range out of all the ones I have. Has a guaranteed three year battery life before the heart crystal needs to be recharged. Depending on use of course. Two hundred Reul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take it. Though it\u2019s not for me it\u2019s for my friend here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTerin motioned for Jethic to come closer and put his finger on the small green see through plate that popped up when he slid the bottom half to the side. Jethic seemed unsure but I gave him a little shove in the back until he finally reached out and imprinted his magical id onto it. The  box glowed light blue for a moment before giving a beep. Terin handed the box and a small booklet over with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s locked to you know kid. If you got any questions they are all answered in the booklet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPlucking the artifact out of Jethic\u2019s hands I put it back on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne last thing. Think you could send this up north to a town called Thorsbough? He has family up there but he can\u2019t go there himself. Get them to imprint onto it and then get it back to him? He lives with old man Gabis over on Rue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFor another three hundred I can. Payment for the runner and insurance on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTerin gave me another nod before opening his cash register and handing me two hundred Reul. I thanked him before heading back out onto the street. Once we were outside Jethic again tried to say something but I held up my hand to silence him a second time. Grabbing his arm I shoved the two hundred Reul into his limp fingers, curling them over the bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is payment for a job. You  came out here with me on the town when you didn\u2019t have to. You are helping me protect this little girl. You might not seem like you are doing anything, but this day probably would not have gone so well without you. Just shut up and accept the payment. You earned it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe opened and closed his mouth a few times before finally nodding his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks. You\u2019re right. I don\u2019t feel like I earned this at all. But I\u2019m a bit selfish. The thought of being able to talk to my family whenever I want is too tempting. And this money will really help out at home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we came to the corner a man in a ski mask came around the side of the building carrying a bank bag and waving a gun around. I saw a small red circle begin to grow on the ground but then Asala squeezed her bear tightly, causing a shield to pop up around her while she shut her eyes. The small red summoning circle disappeared even as Jethic slapped his right gauntlet with his left hand, causing his giant templar shield to expand out. The robber fired his gun, but the bullet bounced harmlessly off his shield as he stepped in front of me and Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDropping the bags in my hands, I planted them on his shoulders and shoved off from the ground. I flipped over his back and extended my leg to smash it into the masked man\u2019s head, dropping him to the pavement. Two policemen rounded the corner then and saw we had taken care of the robber for them. They thanked us both and cuffed the man as Jethic returned his shield to it\u2019s dormant state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNice reactions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t think. I just reacted like you told me to in practice earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you did your job and you protected us. I say you earned your artifact and Reul now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure you could have dealt with it without me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou're right I might have been able to. But Asala might have been shot. Your shield prevented that so don\u2019t sell yourself short. You're going to be a top class shield specialist remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour right. I earned my artifact and my Reul now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI patted him on the back as we returned to his house to drop him off and then me and Asala went home ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seems your time here today has ended. How do you feel about the choices you made and the route you took? Was it easy to play god? To choice the course of someone else\u2019s life? Would you have made the same choices if it had been you? Or did you not care what happened to young Riktal because it wasn\u2019t you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again my fair traveler and create a new destiny in this realm of infinite possibilities.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cYou know what? Let\u2019s skip out on the rest of school today. We need to get you settled in and make your transition into the class easier. You don\u2019t need all those eyes staring at you right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led her by the hand out the door and through the empty halls without saying a word. I had to be careful not to push her too much or make her feel I was being too nosey. Talking too much was just as harmful as talking too little sometimes. I had to give her time to digest what I said and come to her own conclusions, but not enough time to fully retreat back into her shell. It was an art any good Hunter had but few utilized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce we were out on the sidewalk and heading towards town I gave her hand a small squeeze which made her look up at me with eyes that had already filled with  a bit of trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you a chocolate bar that those ratty clothes are the only thing you have. If you told me they let you grab even one other dress before pulling you away from your old life I would be surprised. That bear is probably the only thing you were able to keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlowly she nodded her head as if afraid to admit I was telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen do you think you could tolerate going into town for a bit? At this time of day it shouldn\u2019t be too crowded and we can easily get you some new clothes and a bunch of other things to pretty you up. Make you look less like some white haired monster in that fugly dress I bet you got from some aunt or uncle because they thought it would look good on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer lip twitched as she self consciously ran her hand down her dress. Finally she nodded with just a hint of fear coming to her eyes as she squeezed my hand for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t doubt you are afraid of crowds since your power might activate and you could hurt them or they hurt you. Not to mention they probably scare you right now. But stay close to me and let me know if something scares you. I\u2019ll give it a stink eye and scare it away with my looks alone. I\u2019m so ugly I look at a black horse and it turns into a zebra.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain that twitch of a smile but this time I saw a few teeth. I was making progress. The most important thing was to get her to trust me. Make her feel safe as long as I was around. That way it was less likely she would be frightened into summoning a monster tomorrow while in class. It truly was stupid that my mother wouldn\u2019t let me skip a few days for this. I was half tempted to skip anyway, but attending class had been part of the job I had taken on. In essence it was part of my contract. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe stopped in a clothing store and I encouraged Asala to go wild. I let her try on anything and everything she wanted. Making some comedic comments and acting like a girl, imitating the ones I had seen in my last school. My careful manipulation of her mood got her to loosen up a bit more and even elicited a few more giggles at my expense. I could see some of the sales ladies whispering behind their hands but I ignored them. This was all part of the job in my eyes, nothing was too embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe left the store with four new dresses, some undergarments, socks and shoes and even a few pieces of jewelry. Not to mention a bag laden down with nothing but toiletries such as toothbrushes, deodorants and perfumes. When I asked her if she wanted to go see a movie and get something to eat she nodded her head with more confidence than she had before. I grinned in return, she was just like any other girl who liked shopping. That sadness for her parents was still written on her face, but I had managed to push it back for a little while. At this rate those emotions would come back later on tonight as the thrill of this day wore off and then she would have a good cry again. It was psychology 101. I felt a bit guilty that I was playing with her mind like this but in the end it was for her own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the way to the restaurant I ran into my father coming out of a weapon\u2019s shop. I was a bit surprised to see him since it had been three days since he had left on his last job. I hadn\u2019t expected him back for another day or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey son! What are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be in school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala hid herself behind my leg while clutching at my tunic. Quickly I told my father about my meeting and the new job I had been given. He nodded his head in understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh I knew vaguely about her situation. Your mother was contracted to clean out some caves over in Bornica. She couldn\u2019t handle it alone so she asked for my help. I got finished with that Sandworm infestation over in Cala early so I said yes. Looks like I won\u2019t be home for a while more. I was looking forward to having a game of chess with you too. Sorry to leave you alone a bit longer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m used to it. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been alone for a week or so at a time and it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how to take care of myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s true. Sometimes I think you could do a better job of running a house than we can.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged, refraining from pointing out that what he said was the truth. They were gone so often they didn\u2019t need to worry about taking care of bills or buying food or doing laundry. They had other people that did it for them and they simply threw money into an account and let the bills be taken out of that. Whereas I was given an allowance for living expenses and had to worry about grocery shopping and doing my own cleaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo from what you said shouldn\u2019t you and the girl still be in class? Or at least just getting out of school now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI made a tactical decision. Build rapport and make her more at ease before I thrust the girl into that kind of situation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I see. Makes sense. And it\u2019s a sound move. Your mother will be mad if she find\u2019s out though. Good thing I never saw you while I was out collecting supplies for our trip. Just stay away from Nerval\u2019s or you might accidentally run into her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for the heads up dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe grinned in response to the one I gave him. Shaking my hand before pulling me into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI promise when I get back it\u2019s going to be me and you time. Maybe go out slaying some monsters. No, strike that. Fishing. We haven\u2019t gone fishing for a while and it\u2019s good to get away from the normal monster hunting. And I want to see how strong you\u2019ve gotten so an arm wrestling match definitely.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds like fun. I\u2019ll make sure to grease your side of the table for an easy win.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe belted out a belly laugh as he turned to leave, calling over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you think I used to beat you before?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore he could get out of earshot I stopped him. He turned back around waiting expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait a few days and tell mom I\u2019m sorry. Say I called you on the spell or something. Tell her I said a bit too much and I shouldn\u2019t have. If you haven\u2019t heard about it yet I am sure you will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard a bit son. From what I have heard secondhand, I do agree with some of what you said to her. She does have a bad habit of using people and putting the family first. But she really is a good person deep down. I\u2019ll tell you another thing, I really didn\u2019t agree to her reasons for sending you off to that school. It was my opinion you should take the Exams. But in the end she got her way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen will you tell me what those reasons are at least?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe worried at his lower lip with his teeth for a moment before shaking his head sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI promised her I wouldn\u2019t say a word. But I will bend that promise this much, one of the reasons is that she thinks you are lacking something as a Hunter. And I do agree to an extent. Though it is something you can learn with experience on the job, she thought it would be best if you learned it at this school. But keep that a secret between us ok? She would get mad if she knew I told you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy lips are zipped and locked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe threw me another wave and headed off while I altered mine and Asala\u2019s course just slightly. I had been planning to eat at the Pasta Palace since we were so close, but since that was next door to Nerval\u2019s shop I would take her to The Pipe instead. I\u2019d continue to have a nice date with this little girl and build our relationship of trust. Tonight I would hold her while she cried and tomorrow she would hopefully be ready to face my classmates. Perhaps it would help if I introduced her to Mr. Snuggles as well. I would make sure this was the best day she ever had and nothing went wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIndeed the rest of the day went as smoothly as I had planned it. She cried her eyes out while holding onto me until she eventually cried herself to sleep with me stroking her hair. Only once I was sure she was asleep did I finally close my eyes and rest as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day for Riktal Zelkov. A day like and unlike any other. Where his tongue got the better of him and he regretted his hasty words. Going back to an empty house as he normally does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut is this truly a normal day for him? Would he have chosen this same route if you had not been there to choose it for him? Well yes he would have actually. At least one of the thousands upon thousands of Riktal\u2019s that live in the infinite possibilities. Could he have died today if you had chosen differently? Would he have handled the situations thrust upon him vastly differently as well? Again those are all possibilities that do not exist upon this timeline of his life but do still exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again anytime and try again to lead Riktal\u2019s life in a different direction. One that he has walked and has yet to walk at the same time.</span></div></div>",

I am willing to change my mind if you allow me to take the Hunter\u2019s Exams though and quit school. If you can\u2019t accept that then take her to Pelei and any monsters she summons because of the way he is will be on your head for not accepting my reasonable offer. This is a consequence of your choice to not let me become an official Hunter, so now live with it. I might be your son but I am not your tool to be used and discarded as you see fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little girl suddenly squeezed her stuffed animal. A small sign that she knew what was going on around her. I felt sorry for the girl, I really did. But I knew she would still be in good hands with Pelei even if he was eccentric. I was doing this for myself. Being the good guy all the time didn\u2019t get you anything except a few thanks and more people taking advantage of you. You had to put your foot down if you wanted to stop being a doormat. And my mother was a great user of people for her own gain even though she hid it behind kind words and a carefree attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI simply can\u2019t allow that Riktal. It is important that you stay in school and not take the Exams right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why exactly is that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can never say. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a no. You don\u2019t give me any compelling reason to understand why it is so important. Leaving it at just a glorified \u201cbecause I say so\u201d answer. That won\u2019t fly with me anymore mother. It never flew with me to begin with. You trained me from the day I could crawl to be a Hunter. You pushed me and made me master every aspect of everything you could think of. I\u2019m ten times better then anyone at this school and better then half the official Hunter\u2019s out there! I\u2019m supposed to be out there slaying monsters and doing my job. Not wasting my time in this school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up and gave my mother a small bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow if you excuse me I\u2019m late for Monster Theory and Tactics. I\u2019m sure I will find new insight into how to fight an Ooze or some other weak monster that I killed by the time I was twelve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shouldered my bag and walked out the door without looking back. A moment later the door opened again and Hilda stepped into the hall behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say anything, but I\u2019m sure your mother only wants what is best for you. I know she loves you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo offense Hilda, since you are one of the few aid\u2019s of my mothers I can stand and actually like, but you are wrong. I have no doubt she loves me. I\u2019ve never questioned that. But my mother only ever want\u2019s what\u2019s best for one person. My mother. I\u2019d be careful if I were you. One of these days what she want\u2019s is going to involve throwing you to the wolves and she will do it without hesitation or remorse.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think you don\u2019t understand your mother all that well Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI understand her well enough Hilda. If you know her reason\u2019s than why don\u2019t you tell me yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt never is. But you usually say it anyway. Which means even you think my mother\u2019s reasons are invalid and laughable. I should be an official Hunter and both of us know it. Good day and try to keep my mother out of trouble until I see her again. Whenever that will be.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed back towards the classroom as Hilda returned to my mother\u2019s side. I only took a few steps before I felt the presence around the corner. They hid it well but I still felt it. So when I got to where the hall split off in a different direction I wasn\u2019t startled to find the principal sitting there in her wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome walk with me for a bit Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m late for class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019m the principal. I think that trumps anything else don\u2019t you think? Besides I\u2019m sure you will be heartbroken if you miss some new insight into how to kill an Ooze.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and walked beside her as she pushed her wheelchair along down the new hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you always eavesdrop on private conversations?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do when it could put the school and all the kids here in jeopardy. Or when the meeting involves a Zelkov, let alone two of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe spun around expertly and pushed the door to the outside open in one smooth motion before completing the circle and continuing on. We walked around the outside of the building for a few moments in silence. The principal would sometimes stop to admire some flowers planted next to the building or look up at an old oak tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you know that I don\u2019t need my hands to control this chair? It is a magical artifact in it\u2019s own right and I can manipulate it with just a tiny bit of magic if I wanted to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you know why I don\u2019t?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cConservation. You never know when you will need your magic and using your arms keep them physically fit. You were once a Hunter. Losing the use of your legs didn\u2019t change that mentality.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s all true but that\u2019s not the main reason. I do it because I don\u2019t appreciate how hard other people have it if I just use magic. I take things for granted and I\u2019m more susceptible to narrowing my view of the world. When my arms ache or I can\u2019t manage a hill, or I can\u2019t get up the steps without using magic on my chair it makes me realize all over again how hard life must be for other people who can\u2019t walk that don\u2019t have the benefits I do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard you gave a student a private lesson today in the Arena. Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause he had the mindset of a Hunter. His desires were in the right place and he wasn\u2019t concerned about my family name or how he could use me if he became a friend or anything. He was interested in how I could help him become a better Hunter, nothing more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t deny you got a gift. You are good. There really isn\u2019t anything of a technical nature we can teach you here. In that much you were absolutely right. You should be a Hunter right now. This school is for those who are learning how to be one, not those who already are. But because you got a gift, you were able to teach that child how to be better than he thought he could be. It might seem a little thing to you. It might seem totally reasonable in your mind. But to him it was a godsend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot everyone in this school has come to the realization of just what it means to be a Hunter yet. They don\u2019t fully appreciate how it is they can change peoples lives. Remember even though they grew up knowing about Hunter\u2019s and seeing them in action, they were still on the whole normal people. Everyday people who we as Hunter\u2019s protect. They will come to that realization in time, at their own pace and in their own experiences. We as teachers at the school try to get that across to them. Stressing such important facts when they enter the academy, and while we teach them both the practical and the mental aspects.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour grandfather and I built this school. Oh I don\u2019t mean literally. It has been standing and training Hunter\u2019s for a long time before either of us was born. But we changed it. Before we took over, the mortality rate of students coming out of this place was almost eighty five percent. that\u2019s eight and a half fresh faced children out of ten that would die or be crippled within the first few years of active duty as Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI was one of the fortunate ones. Within the first three years of being a Hunter I lost the use of my legs. I would have lost my life if your grandfather hadn\u2019t been there. I was but a girl of twenty one and at the time I thought that my life as a Hunter was over. Your grandfather convinced me otherwise. He lit a fire under my backside. I mean that literally by the way. I was curled up moping in my own pity and he cast a fire spell on my bottom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen I yelped in pain he said, do you feel that? That means you are still alive. Just because you can\u2019t use your legs doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use your brain. If you don\u2019t want this to happen to some other pretty girl then use that brain to figure out how to change it. Prove you are more than just a pretty face and a sexy body. He was a lot like you Riktal, knowing how to make a person believe and boost their confidence even if he didn\u2019t know how to talk to them all that well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo I worked hard and became principal of this school at twenty five. Since then I have worked hard at reforming and changing everything. Now this schools mortality rate is right around thirty percent. Your grandfather was with me all the way. Lending his help whenever I needed it. And believe me those first few years I needed it a lot. He dumped large amounts of the Zelkov fortune into turning this school into what it is today. I offered to share the fame of this school with him but he always refused. Because of the accident that took my legs I was never able to have children. But this place that is my life\u2019s work is my child. The child that your grandfather could never give me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you are a Zelkov to?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Not officially anyway. Miktal had to marry for the family. For the Zelkov name. I was just a mistress. An open secret that your grandmother knew about and accepted. She had a few lovers of her own after all. Theirs was a marriage of convenience, not of love. I\u2019m the reason you are here in this school Riktal. I\u2019m still kicking and I want to make that mortality rate go down even farther if I can before I kick the bucket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I\u2019ve gone about as far as I can on my own, so I asked your parents for help. They knew I was Miktal\u2019s mistress. They don\u2019t talk about me much I bet, since I am a blemish on their line. But at the same time we are in the same business of protecting the people. Ours is a bit of a weird relationship I guess. In the end they sent you here to help me. Even I don\u2019t know how exactly you are supposed to do that but I am beginning to understand after hearing about your private lesson. I\u2019m sure they had other reasons, but I thought you would like to at least know that much.\u201d</span></div></div>",

You wouldn\u2019t have told me all of that if you didn\u2019t expect something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cExpect? Child, I don\u2019t expect anything of you. Just between you and me I don\u2019t agree with the way your parents just thrust you into this situation without so much as a hint of the reason why. Oh I have no doubt it was more your mother\u2019s idea than your father\u2019s. He always was the more sensible one of the two. I simply thought you deserved to know. I thought about keeping it from you but my conscience got the better of me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I would be happy if you were able to help in some way. Maybe hearing the same words we try to tell them coming from the mouth of someone their age will make them more open to listening. Or perhaps seeing someone as skilled as you and Miss Hawthrop working together will make them apply themselves more seriously. Perhaps nothing will change but perhaps it will save one more Hunter from meeting the same fate as I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut first and foremost you are a student at this school to me, not a means to an end. If you want to do nothing I won\u2019t try to change your mind. But you are much like your grandfather Miktal whether you know it or not. You make waves. You can\u2019t help it. Even when you do nothing at all, ripples just have a habit of spontaneously emanating from you in such a way that you change the world and the people those ripples touch.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMiktal was a touch hot tempered too you know. Getting angry over some of the smallest things and acting hastily. But somehow, even at it\u2019s worst, things just seemed to sort themselves out around him. Now run along to class. I have a few more things I need to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe tipped her chair up and spun it around in a quick one eighty before rolling back the way we had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey principal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe reversed a bit to look at me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you mind telling me more about my grandfather sometime? I really don\u2019t know much about him and my father never talked about him much either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued on her way, leaving me to turn the bend and walk back through the front doors. It didn\u2019t take long to get back to my class on the second floor and slip in quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026.. The Cadaver Dog is of the same family as your run of the mill undead. Having eaten the flesh of Zombies they have a symbiotic relationship with the Gloma worm that lives inside their intestines. It is because of this worm that they have the ability to reproduce without being risen from the grave and how they have low level magical abilities. As undead they are susceptible to healing or holy magic and fire. This includes magical artifacts with these properties as well. Healing magic is the most effective against them of those three types, but getting that close to use it on them is difficult due to their vicious nature. That is why splash damage potions are an effective strategy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe principals words from our recent conversation popped into my head and I found my hand rising up before I realized I had done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes Mr. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is a viable way to get close to a Cadaver Dog and kill it with without potions. It\u2019s a little known fact that their ears are as sensitive as a real dog\u2019s. But where as to a real dog high frequencies are an annoyance it can render a Cadaver Dog near comatose. So if you have something like a dog whistle or are able to produce a high frequency somehow, the undead dogs will simply stiffen up and fall over. After that it is a simple matter to walk up to it and kill it with minimal effort.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally. I did not know that. Thank you for that extra information Mr. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher tipped his head towards me before continuing on with his lesson. I just sat through it all as some of my classmates kept sneaking looks back at me, eyes filled with contemplation. Finally the bell rang signaling the end of class and I got up, moving before I could be caught by the surge of people trying to surround me. I headed straight for Jethic who was still putting his stuff away, I could feel the eyes of the class following me and listening intently to anything I might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou got time today for some lessons at my house? I doubt you know where I live so I can show you if you want. I can also introduce you to a weapon smith I know who can make you some nice shields at a reasonable price.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026 yeah sure. I live with my aunt and uncle, do you mind if I stop there first to let them know where I will be? They get worried easily.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t you just call them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you I was a bit stupid. I haven\u2019t mastered the communication spell yet and I don\u2019t have any money to buy an artifact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI pulled out the gold nugget I had got from the Sengwen and pushed it into his palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCash that in and get yourself a communication artifact. I can\u2019t be bothered to have you wasting your time walking home and eating into good training time. Or being unable to call and let me know if you will be late or not coming over period. And don\u2019t give me any lip about you can\u2019t accept it or some crap like that. Just say thank you and put it in your pocket.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cB-but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat did I say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe opened and closed his mouth like a fish a few times before finally thanking me and putting the small nugget away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. If you don\u2019t know anyone who will cash that for you or no one you won\u2019t think will rip you off, I can introduce you to someone. Now let\u2019s go. Time is wasting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe followed me out the door in a bit of a daze as I kept my face blank. Once we were out in the hall and out of earshot I began to burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh the bug eyed stare on all their faces was priceless! I\u2019ve got a feeling your standing is going to skyrocket by tomorrow morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy are you being so nice to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuspicious?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cN-no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell you should be. Don\u2019t be afraid to say it. I\u2019d be suspicious if I was in your shoes. But it\u2019s simple. Being nice to you is really only a byproduct. All of that was more about giving everyone in that class a giant middle finger. All of them want something from me. Mostly to just be associated with my name like it is some sort of trophy. I\u2019m sure you realize by just dropping the Zelkov name, any one of them could get more money for any job they did. A substantial amount at that. Any girl who was able to say I was her boyfriend would be treated like a goddess by everyone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I can already tell you\u2019re not interested in any of that. So by showering my attention on you, someone they think is a nobody, while completely ignoring them; I am basically saying I think less of them than I do you. I\u2019m basically using you for my own ends, I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you really don\u2019t want to teach me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen did I ever say that? Do you not want to be taught?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I do! I thought you were just pretending you wanted to because you said you were using me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou want to be a Hunter, that\u2019s all that matters to me. Yes I used you, and I will continue to use you in the future most likely. But I am always serious when it comes to being a Hunter and dealing with anyone who wants to be one too. Those people in there need to get serious about it like you are. Otherwise they will die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs we walked out of the school building and he led me towards his place I thought back on my day. It had been full of surprises and perhaps not all my choices had been the best, but the principal was right. I could make a difference here if I wanted to. I just wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to. I didn\u2019t like the feeling of being used as a tool by my mother, dumped here to help improve the place without being told. No idea what thoughts were in her mind that made her think this was a good idea. I didn\u2019t know what path I would walk down yet. But right now that didn\u2019t matter. I just had to take things one day at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor someone who is hotheaded and claims he is not that good with people he didn\u2019t seem to do too bad this first day. Seems like he ended up making two friends. Or at least one friend and an acquaintance. Were his decisions the correct ones to make though? At the time he thought so. But looking back, could he have done better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell seeing as you made all the decisions for him, I suppose I should be asking you that question should I not? How much did any one of those decisions alter the course of Riktal\u2019s destiny? Some decisions were of great importance, such as to accept the job of guarding the girl or not. While others might not have been so great. Would you chose differently if given the chance? Perhaps we shall find out the next time you come. And you will return. I see that in your possible future.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cI\u2019m not a tool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could feel a bit of the anger rising inside as I said that. Just the thought of how my mother had used me so carelessly made my blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMiktal used to say that all the time as well. But the sad truth is, yes you are. We all are. I\u2019m not talking about Hunter\u2019s, I\u2019m talking about everyone in the world. Life is about compromises both big and small. No one in the world has everything go exactly the way they want when they want. We don\u2019t always get to decide how we are used either. At the very basic level what is a Hunter but a glorified tool.  We might have made the decision to become Hunters or that decision was made for us, it doesn\u2019t matter. We protect normal people as a job. We dedicate time and effort into being forged into these tools that can do this job. We decided this is what we wanted and allowed ourselves to become tools to be used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSometimes we are used without our knowledge. Your great grandparents used me against Miktal and I never knew about it until much later. Miktal fought against his parents over the arranged marriage. He said it was archaic and needed to be done away with. He wanted to marry me even though I was just a first generation Hunter. In the end he had to compromise with them, accepting the arranged marriage in order to use the large amounts of the family fortune to help me build this school like he did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen they tried to get him to cast me aside as his mistress though he refused. He said that he had married your grandmother just like they had wanted, but that didn\u2019t mean he had to sleep with her. If they wanted a child to continue the line then he got to keep me. So in that sense he used your father before he was even born. Turning him into a tool that forced his parents to compromise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs I said, Mira knew all about me and she had no problem with Miktal having me as a mistress. Thought we weren\u2019t exactly best friends, we were still close. I was over often for dinner and the like. As long as we kept our relationship discreet all was well. When your father was born I used to baby-sit while the two of them went out doing Hunter duties. Or while Mira went to one of her own lovers for a while. Any time you have interactions with other people it is give and take. Sometimes its so small you don\u2019t notice it. But even the basic idea of a conversation is that compromise of talking and listening. If you want to keep friends you need to learn when to be a user and when to be used.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s hard to think like that I know. And it doesn\u2019t keep you from getting angry when you are used as a tool, but it\u2019s the truth. It\u2019s a hard road to travel, trying to figure out how much to allow yourself to be used before it is too much. More of a balancing act than anything else. But you are young and you got a good head on your shoulders. I\u2019m sure you will do just fine. Now run along, there are some things I still need to do. And thank you for chatting with an old lady like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe spun her wheelchair around with ease before heading off back the way we had come. I called out to her before she could get far and she spun partway around to look at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you mind if we talk again sometime? About my grandparents and what they were like? I really don\u2019t know much about them and I think I\u2019d like to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a small smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy doors always open. Just not during school hours unless it is really important. You are still a student after all. And students should be in class learning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave a small chuckle as she resumed her journey. I felt the small smile playing on my lips as I turned the corner and reentered through the front doors. It didn\u2019t take long  to make it back to my class on the second floor and slip into my seat. As the teacher droned on about Cadaver Dog\u2019s and how to handle them I looked around the classroom at the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTools huh? A series of compromises and a balance between using and being used. I had never really thought of it that way but it made sense. Most of these people wanted something from me, prestige by association, friendship, fame. They wanted to use me, but at the same time I had the choice of who I let use me or not in that way. I used the Zelkov name sometimes as well. Not exactly hiding behind it, but using it to make my life easier. I wouldn\u2019t know half the contacts in the Hunter world that I did if I hadn\u2019t been introduced to them by someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking back so far on the day I saw that I had used and been used at least a dozen times without me noticing it. In the end I really didn\u2019t mind any of that at all. It had just been natural. I was still angry at my mother for how she had used me and how she didn\u2019t seem to care about my feelings at all. But I couldn\u2019t fault her now either. I had to make sure to apologize to her next time I saw her. If she was on a job she would probably be gone for three or four days. More than enough time to cool off and be able to speak to her normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the bell rang I avoided getting caught up in the crowd of people converging on me for their own personal reasons. Shouldering my bag I made a beeline towards Jethic who was still putting his stuff away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou ready to go Jethic? If you have time I can show you where my house is since I doubt you know already. And perhaps we can get in a few hours of combat training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh\u2026 sure. If you don\u2019t mind stopping at my house first. I stay with my aunt and uncle who get worried when I don\u2019t let them know where I am.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy not just give them a call?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m a bit stupid remember. I haven\u2019t been able to master the spell yet. And my family is poor so I don\u2019t have the money to buy an artifact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled the gold nugget out of my pocket and shoved it into his hand, closing his fingers around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCash that in and buy yourself a good communication artifact. We will need to keep in touch if I am going to give you private lessons. Plus you should be able to get a hold of your family when you want to. I\u2019ll make sure mine is the first magical id you imprint on it as well. If you don\u2019t know a broker or think any one you do know won\u2019t give you top Reul for it let me know and I will introduce you to a few that I use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI motioned to Liz before she had a chance to leave. She walked over with her head cocked to the side waiting for me to say why I had stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you mind coming over too? It will do him good to have more than one person to spar against. Different speeds and fighting styles will help him improve much faster.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave an offhand shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSure I don\u2019t mind. I got nothing better to do. As long as I get at least one sparring match with you. I was impressed by how you kept agro on that monster. I want to see how well I stack up if I go all out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDeal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe three of us left the room together and managed to make it down the hall a ways before me and Liz broke out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThose looks were gold! It was worth coming with you just to see that bulging eyed, fish out of water reaction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know right!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm\u2026 excuse me. Why are you being so nice to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at Jethic and grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I want to and because it makes the other kids in class jealous. I\u2019m teaching them a little lesson I guess you could say. One that says I don\u2019t care who they are or who they think they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen does that mean you really don\u2019t want to teach me dual shields? You were just using me to tick them off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course I want to teach you dual shields. I never would have offered in the first place if I didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you want, I can help you master making healing potions. If your magic is so weak you can\u2019t heal yourself you will be going through a lot of them. I can show you a few tricks my father taught me and I am sure Riktal could to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic looked at Liz wide eyed, his jaw dropping until I thought it would drag the floor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeriously!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said anything if I wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne more thing. Once you get your communication device, if you let me borrow it for a few days, I can send a runner to Thorsbough and have your parents imprint their id on it as well so you can talk to them any time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cT-thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. After all, family is important. Even if you don\u2019t always see eye to eye with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor someone who is hotheaded and claims he is not that good with people he didn\u2019t seem to do too bad this first day. Seems like he ended up making two friends. Or at least one friend and an acquaintance. Were his decisions the correct ones to make though? At the time he thought so. But looking back, could he have done better?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell seeing as you made all the decisions for him, I suppose I should be asking you that question should I not? How much did any one of those decisions alter the course of Riktal\u2019s destiny? Some decisions were of great importance, such as to accept the job of guarding the girl or not. While others might not have been so great. Would you chose differently if given the chance? Perhaps we shall find out the next time you come. And you will return. I see that in your possible future.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cSpank! Arena master! Twin short swords! Stock variety!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStandard sword and board set up! Stock short sword for me too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe rolled in opposite directions as the Sengwen charged towards us. It\u2019s skittering talons on the floor as it tried to halt its progress and turn around letting us know just how close it was. The floor slid to the side next to me and two weapons racks came into view. I was already yanking off the sword and shield before the rack finished moving, tossing them in Liz\u2019s direction. She grabbed them from mid air, quickly slipping the shield on her left forearm as I pulled my swords from the rack before rolling away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Sengwen just missed ripping into my back with one of it\u2019s claws as it destroyed the stand the weapons had been on. It charged after me as I ran towards Liz who stepped forward as I passed, taking a knee while raising her shield and striking with all her might at the creatures legs as it ran by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf the creature hadn\u2019t been fed on magic that blow would have severed at least two of the limbs clean off. As it was the blow only made a small scratch which healed up immediately. Until we burned out the magic it had absorbed it was near invulnerable while being significantly stronger and faster. Luckily it didn\u2019t get much smarter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the creature began to turn around Liz ran off at an angle so she would be the first thing it saw when it was ready to charge again. When the creature saw her it gave a guttural whinny as she clanged her sword against the shield in challenge. It wasn\u2019t a full body shield, but it was bigger than your average buckler, covering about a third of her body. Your standard Aegis shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe beast charged again but this time she stood her ground. Bracing her legs and taking the full brunt of the attack, sliding backwards a few inches. She stabbed at it around the shield while blocking it\u2019s attacks in a classic tanking style. I simply waited a moment for her to grab enough agro on it before I went to work. She gave me a small nod to let me know she was ready as she turned it slightly farther away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a sword in each hand I ran at the beast. Long swords would have more power because of the length of the blade but I didn\u2019t need power here, I needed speed. Longer swords were also heavier. I could make up for length by using more power from my own body and rotation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlice, spin, slice, stab, twirl, stab. Never stop moving. Create quick shallow cuts the magic had to heal. Rapid succession of attacks to drain the magic quickly. When the creature swished his razor sharp tail at me like it was swatting a fly I sliced it off. and continued to attack. When it kicked out at me with it\u2019s hind legs I jumped onto its back and rapidly stabbed downwards with my swords over and over. Seven good hits before it bucked me off and I flipped through the air to land on my feet again. When it turned to face me Liz sliced it across the eyes before smashing it in the face with her shield. It gave a roar of anger before the magic healed it and he returned to attacking Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt only took two minutes to burn the magic away and our cuts didn\u2019t heal almost instantly anymore. I jumped onto its back again, slamming the sword in my right hand into the back of it\u2019s neck. As it roared in pain I swung off to the left while holding firmly onto the blade in my right, shoving my other sword down it\u2019s throat. Using gravity and the rotation of my body I yanked both blades in opposite directions, decapitating the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe body fell to the ground, beginning to dematerialize into dust. Within seconds it was gone, leaving behind two of it\u2019s pure silver claws. As the class and the Arena master came running up to congratulate us I tapped my sword against Liz\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNice tanking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot good enough, you pulled agro.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s my job. But you did your\u2019s and grabbed it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPicking up the two claws I handed one to Liz who slipped it into her pocket with a nod of thanks. The boy named Gregory pointed at us with indignation on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey those are our spoils!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glared at him a moment before saying anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFirst off: the Sengwen you fought had regular talons like a birds. Not real silver ones. Second off: it was your idiot move that transformed the beast into something you couldn\u2019t handle. And thirdly: if you really want it that badly I will be glad to fight you for it. I\u2019ll make sure to rip out your throat with it as well just like that Sengwen would have if we hadn\u2019t stepped in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not fair!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Areana Master swept the boys feet out from under him while grabbing his shirt and bearing him to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFair! Fair! Just what kind of game do you think this is you self indulgent little slug? What was fair about how you put the lives of your teammates in danger just to show off? What exactly isn\u2019t fair about them earning the spoils of war and saving an ungrateful pile of monster refuse like you? Being a Hunter isn\u2019t a game! It\u2019s not always fair and neither is this world. It never will be fair. Our job isn\u2019t to make this world fair! Our job is to make this world safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI gave your group that monster because I thought none of you would do something so stupid and foolhardy. You all showed competence and were a step above the rest in combat training. Obviously my judgment about you was flawed. I\u2019m watching you boy. One more screw up and I\u2019m throwing you back with the beginners.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can\u2019t put your hands on me like this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m the Arena Master and you are in the Arena. I can do whatever the hell I want. Besides, haven\u2019t you figured it out by now boy? This isn\u2019t some normal high school. This is a Monster Combat Hunter academy! If we get squeamish about not harming the students then you are all going to die. This is life, deal with it or quit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master let the boy go after giving him another good shake. He looked around at the rest of the class which had gone silent as they watched the proceedings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll of you better keep that in mind. We told you when you entered this school that it wasn\u2019t like other places. We are in the business of teaching you how to survive. Not teaching you how to take shortcuts and try to cheat the system. If you want an easy life where everything is handed to you, you picked the wrong profession. I hope you were all paying attention to how these two worked together. In the real world you won\u2019t always have time for planning. Sometimes you have a few precious seconds to convey everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you see how they used their body language to communicate? How Hawthrope positioned the monster to make it easier for Zelkov to attack? How Zelkov waited for her to catch the thing\u2019s attention? There were at least twenty different weapons he could have used. Do you know why he chose twin short swords? Why not long swords? Why not a pole weapon? Why didn\u2019t they both go sword and board? They both showed you some excellent fighting and first hand experience as to what it takes to be Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA boy came forward holding his side. I could tell it was the one who had taken the Sengwen\u2019s first blow on his shield and been sent flying. He was the only one in full plate mail, a near necessity for tanks just learning the ropes. He looked at Liz with a starry eyed expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks for rescuing us. That was amazing what you did. I wish I could tank half so well as you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLiz looked at the boy with a slight disinterest. At first I thought she wouldn\u2019t say anything then her faced softened just slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ll get there eventually. Apply yourself to the training and take it seriously and you will make it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right enough jabbering. We still have a lot of time before class is over. Reform into new groups..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master continued to point out who would be in what groups as me and Liz climbed back up into the bleacher\u2019s. As we sat down I pulled out the talon, twirling it in my fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know someone who would pay good money for this. Pure silver made through a magical transmutation and probably still holding traces of that magic. Perhaps get around a thousand Reul for it. You got anyone you can take yours to?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, a friend of the family. He deals in simple stuff like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk, cool. Just checking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pocketed the talon again and turned my attention to watching the groups continue their sparring with monsters. Paying special attention to the boy named Gregory.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe rest of Combat Class went by without incident. I was already able to pick out a few of the ones that had a knack for leading. I also got a feel for each of their respective skill levels compared to mine. There were a few stand-outs, such as the boy who had taken the Sengwen\u2019s blow. He was the best tank specialty Hunter out of all the other tank types I had seen in this class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMe an Liz chatted a bit more about small things here and there. Pointing out our thoughts on how they were handling the challenges set before them. When the bell finally rang it felt like we had known each other for a few months and not just a few hours. The first thing I did was check my duffle bag, finding only one of the weapons I had been missing had been returned. My Lexington double barrel was still nowhere to be found. I zipped up my bag and shouldered it, looking around the room at the other boys who were glancing my way out of the corner of their eyes. I headed for the door without a word, stopping to look back at all of them before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least one of you was smart enough to take me seriously. My amnesty ends now. I am still missing one weapon. I will entertain the thought that it was one of the girls, but I find this outcome unlikely. If any of you knows anything about the culprit, I will gladly pay a one thousand Reul reward leading to me finding him. You had your chance whoever you are. I have no shame in you knowing exactly how I will find you. Or how little your life is worth to me. You had best be able to run far and run fast. But know that I will still find you. Let the hunt begin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed straight for History class, settling down in my seat as the rest of the class filed in. The boys watched me speculatively, some of them probably wondering if they could cheat me out of that thousand Reul no doubt. Most of the girls also had speculative looks, but for an entirely different reason. They wanted to be seen as my girlfriend and were plotting on how to go about making that a reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI just had to get through this day. Tomorrow would be more normal academics such as the regular math and science type classes you would find at a regular school. Then the day after would be back to today\u2019s schedule. Even if this was a Hunter academy, they still had to teach at least basic courses. At least I had business economics to look forward to tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher had just started talking about how the Lindum Treaty had changed the balance of power in the world when a short stocky woman with an eye patch over her right eye came into the room. Her low cut yellow dress went well with her blond hair. The few streaks of gray almost unnoticeable unless you knew where to look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy bag was in my hands and I was halfway to the front of the class by the time Hilda finished whispering to the teacher and he turned to point at me. He blinked in surprise that I was already there even as I left the room with my mother\u2019s aide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what does my mother want with me this time? And before you say anything, I know it\u2019s not your place to say, but you will say it anyway because you\u2019re you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA job. An official job if it comes to that but she would like to keep it unofficial if possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo the usual. My mother being my mother huh? Treating me as a full fledged Hunter when it is convenient for her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s not my place to say either way. She has her reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe always does. Rarely does she deign to tell us mere mortals what they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal, I\u2019ve been one of your mother\u2019s aides for a long time. I\u2019ll be the first to admit she has her faults. I\u2019ll also admit sometimes she doesn\u2019t make the best decisions, but she does think about you and I can only assume she doesn\u2019t want to tell you the reasons why in order to protect you in some way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t need protecting. She didn\u2019t train me to become a Hunter just so I could be protected. Make sure you tell her I\u2019m coming to the end of my patience with the way she is. She never seems to listen to me when I say such things. Perhaps you can make her see sense. One of these day\u2019s I\u2019m just going to wash my hands of her completely. Her and the Zelkov name. All because she wants to play people like puppets as she sees fit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll tell her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat you are to polite to say is that it probably won\u2019t do any good. Sorry to drop this on you Hilda. I know it\u2019s not your fault. She just makes me so angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know hon. Just\u2026 try to be nice to her today ok? This job she was asked to do might be a bit much for her. She\u2019s getting old and her reaction times aren\u2019t what they used to be. You know how she has a hard time accepting things like that. She will be doing the job with your father, but even then this might be the last time you see her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe are Hunter\u2019s. Every job might be our last.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know that. But I also know that despite everything you say you still love her. Even if you sometimes can\u2019t stand to be in the same room with her. She\u2019s worried. She won\u2019t admit it or show it but she really is worried.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat bad huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood I hope it straightens her out. Maybe if she lost an arm or a leg or something it will teach her a lesson.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow is it you became so cold?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTry asking that after you grew up with my mother for seventeen years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally shook her head sadly before opening the door to the meeting room for me. My mother jumped out of her chair when I entered coming over to embrace me, kissing my cheeks quickly. Behind her at the table sat a red eyed white haired little girl around eleven or twelve years old. She wore a tattered green dress that had the same shade as vomit and some well used shoes that peeked out from under the table. In her hand\u2019s she held a teddy bear that was at least three shades of brown with frizzled curly fur. I could see the faint water marks where tears had probably soaked into the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling! It\u2019s so good to see you again! Please take a seat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a chair opposite my mother and the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgain? I saw you just this morning remember? Or has it been so long since you spent that much time with me you forgot that fact already? So what is it you want mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe ignored my comment as her Hunter face dropped into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got a small favor to ask of you. I want you to guard this girl. Her name is Asala and she just lost her parents three days ago in a tragic accident.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo? Let some other Hunter baby-sit. You know, like one that has a license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere are complications.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSuch as?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe is a monster summoner. You are really good with kids and you\u2019ve stated before how you don\u2019t mind people with that ability.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust tell her not to use her power then and things will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s just it. She can\u2019t control her power. When she has strong emotions they sort of activate. A monster summoner I know will come take her off your hands in a few days, but until then I need someone I can trust and I know can take care of anything she might summon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo it yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can\u2019t. I was hired to do a job over in Bornica with your father. That place would be way to dangerous for a little girl like her. Even if they didn\u2019t have that little war over the succession going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInteresting. So you get back from your last job last night. Stay home for less than eight hours and decided to accept another job up in the far north for another country when you don\u2019t need to actually do so. Probably accepting the job because you didn\u2019t want to deal with this kid just like you never wanted to deal with me as your son. Deciding to just push her off on me because it is convenient for you to treat me like a real Hunter instead of some guy you forbid from taking the Exams. I bet if I ask why me, you will say something like because you are family. As if that meant anything to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up shaking my head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry not happening. You\u2019re on your own mother. Just like I always am. Either take her with you, decline the job for Bornica and watch her yourself, or take your chances with some other sap who you can con into believing you actually care what happens to her. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what side of the fence you lean towards when it comes to monster summoner\u2019s. You might not want them dead on sight like most other Hunter\u2019s, but you wouldn\u2019t shed a tear if it happened. Probably hope she dies under my watch so you have a real reason to say I\u2019m not ready to be a Hunter yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI walked out the door, ignoring my mother\u2019s pleas for me to wait. I sensed the presence around the corner as I headed off down the hall so wasn\u2019t surprised to find the principal sitting there in her wheelchair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.

She didn\u2019t say anything until after she expertly swiveled around to open the door with her chair before backing out and going down the single step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou should take the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd you shouldn\u2019t eavesdrop on conversations that have nothing to do with you. Doesn\u2019t mean either one of us will listen. If I don\u2019t like it when my mother tries to manipulate me into doing things, why do you think you would have better success?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a lot like him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHim who?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. Just an old woman talking to herself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard about your declaration in the Combat Class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you mind rescinding it if I got your weapon back for you? There are enough problems going around in the world, I\u2019d really like to avoid something like this if I can help it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you can get the weapon back that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m not going back on my word. Thieves like that need to be taught a lesson. They will be lucky if I don\u2019t kill them. If it is a girl I will go easy. Not because they are a girl but because they did not hear my proclamation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you don\u2019t think it was a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy did you make such a statement at all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo let them know exactly what the consequences of their actions would be. Cause and effect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why did you go about it the way you did? There was plenty of different ways to handle the situation. Even different ways to phrase your words.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy all the questions?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHumor an old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause that\u2019s the kind of Hunter I was raised to be. To speak the truth and be fair in my dealings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what is a Hunter\u2019s job? At it\u2019s core I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo protect people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo do you think you were being fair to that little girl? I\u2019m not saying your mother is a saint. I\u2019ve gotten angry at her myself on more than one occasion. But is it fair of you to deny that girl your protection simply because of your anger towards your mother? True the way she goes about things can be a bit unfair. Underhanded at times even. But is that really a good enough excuse for you to not do your job as a Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \t\u201cYou might not have a license, but you are still looked upon as an official slayer. I\u2019m sure you have your own contacts. Brokers, business partners and acquaintances in the Hunter world. Some of them you got through your family name I\u2019m sure, but others you made yourself. I bet you\u2019ve already done some jobs for a few people. Maybe not big ones, but important ones to them. Even your mother recognizes you as one if she came seeking your help. She might not admit it but you would know better than I that she wouldn\u2019t have come asking your help if she didn\u2019t think you were as capable as any Hunter out there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd what are your thoughts on the girl being a monster summoner? What side of the fence are you on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll admit I am a bit biased. I can tolerate them but I don\u2019t really like them. I\u2019m not as kill crazy as some but I wouldn\u2019t be heartbroken if one died. But then again I grew up on stories about the old wars where summoners would send their tamed pets to terrorize and kill innocent people. It\u2019s only been in the last hundred years or so that summoners have tried to be more help then hindrance. But they have a lot of history to overcome. Perhaps that\u2019s a mindset you can understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe rounded the corner and came in sight of the front of the school. My mother, the little girl and Hilda were all just walking out the front door and heading towards the gates. The principal wheeled herself in front of me, looking up into my face with compassionate eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you really going to put your job as a Hunter to the side because of your anger? I don\u2019t know if she came to you first, last or what. But the fact is she came to you asking for help. If you really think some other Hunter could do a better job of understanding that little girl and helping her than you then just do nothing. But are you willing to feel as helpless as you did with Olia if things go wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust an old lady who has eyes and ears everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as my mother tugged on the little girls arm absentmindedly. Not even caring if she was hurting the girl or not. Just too concerned about getting to her next appointment or being someplace else like she always was. Yet I could still let them go. It wasn\u2019t my problem. Just two minutes and they would be out of my life.</span></div></div>",

I just think you are very much like someone I used to know in some respects. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to turn his back on that little girl. He would have hated himself if he did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd where is he now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDead just like most of the people I grew up with. But he died doing what he loved and for the person he loved. And never once did he regret that decision.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause he told me with his last breath.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clicked my tongue in a bit of disgust as I headed towards the little group. Damn that old woman. She was right about all of it. I just couldn\u2019t be stubborn with the girls life on the line. I would have regretted it if I had simply let them walk away. My mother saw me coming and turned to face me expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m taking the Hunter\u2019s Exam whether you like it or not as soon as this job is done. That\u2019s my payment for taking this job. Take it or leave it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHoney I told you before\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake it or leave it. You have ten seconds to make up your mind. After ten seconds I walk away. If you truly think me capable enough of a Hunter for this job then there should be no problems. If you are just trying to throw your problems at me and have me clean them up for you then walk away. Even if you still push her off on me and don\u2019t think me capable I still get my Hunter license. Either way I get what I want. So tell me, what\u2019s more important to you? Your undefined reasons for me coming to this school or doing your job as a Hunter and protecting the innocent? In this case this girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother looked at me a moment but didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTwo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t we talk this over?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThree.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat if I give you twenty thousand Reul instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued my steady count as she looked from me to the girl and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk you win. You can take the Exams if and only if you can get her to talk by the time she leaves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo deal. I stated my price. It is non negotiable. Whether she lives, dies, talks or destroys this entire town I am taking the test. Last chance. Nine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nibbled her lip a moment but didn\u2019t say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTen. Goodbye mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned to head out the front gates she called out to me. I smiled thinly to myself before clamping down on it and turning around with a bland expression on my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine you win. It\u2019s a deal. How can you be so unfair about all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I was more than fair. Fairer then you usually are with me. As you have told me time and again, life isn\u2019t fair. If you have a problem with how I do things as a Hunter then take it up with my mother and father. This is how they raised me. Now go away. Don\u2019t you have some civil war or something to fight? You don\u2019t need to be yanking on a girl you don\u2019t want any more than you have to do you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened and closed her mouth a few times but finally left me and the girl alone as my father pulled up in our car. He gave me a wave and I waved back, a bit surprised to actually see him since he wasn\u2019t supposed to be done with his last job for another day or two. He had promised to play some chess with me when he got back, but it seemed that would be put on hold even longer if he was doing a job with my mother. Just another normal week at the Zelkov house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce they drove off I knelt in front of the girl who hadn\u2019t reacted to any of what had been said over her head. She reminded me of a doll or a puppet that only moved when someone pulled her strings. She didn\u2019t respond to my light touch on her arm or have any kind of recognition of the world around her in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo your name is Asala huh? That\u2019s a pretty name. Ugly dress but pretty name. I want you to know that I really do care if you die or not. I just said all that to my mother as a bargaining tool. If you give her an inch she takes ten miles. I\u2019d like for you to trust me. Though I know my words and actions thus far really haven\u2019t lent themselves well to my cause.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you are probably scared out of your mind right now. Never did really understand that phrase. How can you be scared out of your mind when your mind is inside you? Unless we were to walk around turned inside out, but that would be kind of disgusting don\u2019t you think? I also bet you are pretty hungry. Never met a little girl or boy yet who wasn\u2019t always hungry. So We will go home. I\u2019ll make you something nice and hearty to eat and we can get to know each other. Maybe play a few games and settle you in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen tomorrow if you feel up to it we can go out shopping when there aren\u2019t a lot of people around. My guess you need some new clothes. Even if you don\u2019t my eyes are bleeding looking at that dress. It makes me want to bury it in the trash piles. I will be with you all the time and I will pay attention to only you. It\u2019s my job to worry about you and make sure you are happy. Well maybe not the job she wanted me to do exactly, but I am making it my personal job to make you happy. So how does all that sound to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNo reaction. Just that same blank stare that seemed to look through me. No I was wrong. There was a slight reaction. She squeezed her bear just a fraction. But it was a start. I gave her a reassuring smile before taking her by the hand and leading her away, making sure not to pull too hard and drag her. Simply slowing down my pace to walk next to her and guiding her with a hand on her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell wasn\u2019t that an interesting first day? Plots and choices and twists galore. How do you think his day went? Could it have been better? Could it have been worse? Did you make the right choices for him? Would you make them differently? What far reaching affects could the choices you made have on his life or on his interactions with others in the future? How much different is his life and his future now than if he had made a few different choices this day? Or would the day have turned out the same no matter what? Was it all simply predestined?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tConstants and variables. These two things rule the world. Even if your choices are always constant, the choices of those around you are variable. The environment is variable. Just a small change in any one of these things can alter the thoughts and the destiny of a single person. If both his weapons had appeared back in his bag, would he have approached the meeting with his mother differently? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps you can come again and find out. Alter his life and play god one more time. Though the possibilities as they say are endless. This possibility has finally ended. Until we meet again in another possibility.</span></div></div>",

He would have hated himself if he did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s where I am different. The girl will be fine. She might be uncomfortable being pulled around but if my mother or some other Hunter is taking care of her she will live. As long as you live you can change. Isn\u2019t that what they say? It\u2019s true I might regret not going to help her, but my mother needs to be taught a lesson. I\u2019m through jumping through her hoops. Let her deal with her own problems for once instead of pushing them off on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as my dad pulled up in one of our cars and the three of them got inside. They were gone a second later as I continued walking. I didn\u2019t even look back as I called out to the principal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not so easy to manipulate. A few soft words and a logical argument or two isn\u2019t always enough to sway me anymore. I\u2019ve grown up hearing enough for them from my mother I\u2019m a bit immune to them now. Figure out another way to get me to do what you want. Perhaps by just being honest with me instead of speaking in riddles. That\u2019s a novel idea don\u2019t you think principal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned out the gates and headed home. Not even bothering to go back to class until the end of the day. I was done for now. Finding the thief could wait one day. I had simply had enough of it all. The walk home went by in a blur. A part of me did regret but it was easy enough to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce home I made myself a quick ham sandwich, eating it while walking through the empty three floor mini mansion. It was always empty and quiet like this. Hardly ever any guests and when there were it was along the lines of foreign dignitaries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe walls were littered with photos. Not your normal family pictures though like in a non Hunter house. There was big sis with her prize for best knife thrower in seventh grade. There was the picture of my first kill. A few of mom and dad. But none with all of us together. The story of being a Zelkov. Never together but always around somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll except for one Zelkov. A little girl my mother wanted to pretend never existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped upstairs and dug out the old shoebox I had hidden in my closet. Pulling the top off I looked down into my little sister\u2019s smiling face as I gave her a piggyback ride. Hair the color of sunset, eyes as green as the ocean with little flecks of white like foam. Big and round as only a ten year olds could be. Missing two teeth on the top that had always made her whistle a bit when she talked. These were the only photos in the house where more than one Zelkov was together. It had taken a lot of work to protect them with my magic when they had been thrown in the fire. Deceiving my mother into believing they had all burned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slid another big box out and dug through it, pushing a bunch of stuffed animals to the side. Yet a few more mementos of Olia\u2019s. Finally I found her favorite blue tattered and beat up bunny that was missing an eye. I hugged it close to my chest as I stared down at the picture in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey sis. It\u2019s been a while hasn\u2019t it? You probably think your big brother is pretty despicable don\u2019t you? You are probably yelling at me right now from up there aren\u2019t you? Probably wondering how I turned out like this. I changed sis. Ever since you died I\u2019ve changed. your brother is a pretty heartless person. I had to grow up strong. So mother couldn\u2019t roll over me anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut your brother is going to become a Hunter. I\u2019ve made up my mind I\u2019m going to take the Exams whether mother likes it or not. Even if I have to give up the family name. It\u2019s not like I was that attached to it anyway. I\u2019m going to become a strong Hunter just like I promised. And then I\u2019m going to take you to see the world. We will visit all the places you dreamed of going. We will dance together at the winter feast in Kapala. We will see the rare Snow Lions of the far north and we will yell as loud as we can from the top of Mt. Piniak.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love mom and dad and big sis Ulicia don\u2019t get me wrong. As messed up as it all is and despite the way we were treated I still love them. But we aren\u2019t really a family. I can\u2019t even remember the last time all four of us were in this house together at the same time. Or even the last time someone went up to the third floor. Mom and dad were never around for us. First big sis took care of me and then she moved out. Then it was just me and you. Back then we only had each other. I had no clue what I was doing as a big brother but somehow I muddled through. I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t able to protect you. I should have stopped mother that day. But I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI rubbed the tears from my eyes as the first few drops fell onto the photo. It really had been a while since I had thought of Olia. She had been dead three years but sometimes like now it still felt like yesterday. I had learned to go on. Life waited for no one. I brought the rabbit up to my face and inhaled deeply. If I closed my eyes I could almost imagine smelling the light perfume she liked to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI jerked my eyes open suddenly. I must have fallen asleep. I wanted to go back to sleep. To see Olia again. But I was hungry. And I was wide awake. Sleep wouldn\u2019t come back so easily. So I levered myself to my feet and went downstairs to make another sandwich. The clock said it was eight o\u2019clock but time really meant nothing to me. I went into the living room and flicked on the TV, turning over to the news channel to see if anything interesting had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t<i>\u201c\u2026..Earlier today a Pit Lord ravaged downtown Efenbis City. Two thousand citizens and almost all the buildings in a two block radius were caught in it\u2019s destructive rampage. Thanks to the combined efforts of Monster Combat Hunter\u2019s all across the city, the damage was kept to a minimum. If it hadn\u2019t been for the fact that two members of the Zelkov family were on the scene to contain it as long as they did, it\u2019s possible the entire city could have been destroyed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnfortunately the heroic efforts of  Marian and Ramone Zelkov were their last. They both died moments before help arrived. Authorities believe the Pit Lord was the work of a monster summoner but as of yet have found no clues as to where such a powerful summoner has hidden himself. Of the few survivors there was a little girl whom was found unconscious under the body of Marian Zelkov. It is believed  Mrs. Zelkov protected her with her dying breath. She is currently in Janseen Hospital where doctors are anxiously awaiting her recovery so she might shed some light on how this travesty transpired.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe half eaten sandwich dropped from my fingers as the full impact of the news hit me. They were dead? Sure I had my problems with them but I didn\u2019t want them dead. It was the girl. She had summoned the Pit Lord. How or why I didn\u2019t know but she was the culprit. She had killed my parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs if of its own accord my body stood up and walked towards the door, hitting the code on the safe in the hallway wall I pulled out a six shooter and attached a silencer onto it before shoving it into my belt and covering it with my tunic. Opening the door outside I grabbed the keys to the other car. It only took ten minutes to drive to the hospital and another three to find her room. At first the police guarding her door and the nurses wouldn\u2019t give me any information but when I told them I was a Zelkov they let me through without any hassle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened her eyes when I walked in and stood over the bed. She still had the blank stare of unseeing she had earlier today. It was her way of escaping from reality I guess. I pulled the gun out and placed it against her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou killed them both. I had my problems with them but they were still my family. I didn\u2019t hate them that much. You\u2019re dangerous. If you are strong enough to summon a Pit Lord you are too much of a threat both to this town and this world with your unstable ability. I can\u2019t let you harm any more innocent people.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I hope you get to see your family again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pulled the trigger, hearing the small pfft sound as the bullet shot through her head. There was a moment when the world just stood still and then the white pillow beneath her began to turn crimson. Her dead eyed stare of earlier was now truly lifeless. The monitoring machines beeped loudly and the police ran in followed by the nurses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCalmly I stuck my weapon back into my belt while jerking my head towards the girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI killed your monster summoner for you. Saved you the trouble before she could summon another one. I doubt my mother was trying to save her when she died. She was probably trying to kill her but failed. I just finished the job. Now if you will excuse me I need to go grieve for my parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pushed past the two nurses and two cops, heading off down the hall still in a bit of a daze. They were all  dead. Olia was dead. Asala was dead. The only family I had left was big sis Ulicia. I wondered if she would even bother to come home when she heard the news. Or if she would just finish her job like the good Hunter she had been raised as.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRight now it didn\u2019t matter. I\u2019d just go back to the house that was always silent and always empty. Though mother and father would never show up again now. It was just another day in the Zelkov household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAlmost. But never again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA true tragedy this ending. Was there anything he could have done to prevent it? If he had accepted the job, would it have been him being mourned instead of his parents? From what point on this timeline did things go wrong? Was it not accepting the job? Or did this cascade of events begin all the way back at the beginning when you refused to have him give his last name? Was this outcome inevitable? What would have happened if you hadn\u2019t pulled the trigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tYou can always play god once more and find out. Alter the timeline greatly or just a bit as you see fit. Endless possibilities await.</span></div></div>",

And I am angry enough right now to kill you. But I already made enough bad choices today. The biggest one was not accepting the job of protecting you. Even though I know you summoned that Pit Lord, I also know it wasn\u2019t your fault. I don\u2019t know what the circumstances were or why it happened but it happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs long as you live there is the possibility to change. And as long as you live you will be burdened with the knowledge that your power killed my parents who died protecting you like true Hunter\u2019s. As well as thousands of innocent people. I think that is a worse punishment than a simple bullet to the brain. If you don\u2019t want this to happen again then change it yourself. Quit hiding inside your mind and work to control your powers instead of letting them control you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI snagged a nearby chair and pulled it over to sit next to her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt seems I\u2019ve got no family now. Well I have my big sister, but I doubt she will grieve long. This won\u2019t affect her much at all. It didn\u2019t affect her much when my little sister died. She went back to business as usual after less than a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight now it looks like I am in need of a family and you are in need of one too. I might not be the best big brother but I have some experience. I\u2019ll stay with you from now on. Even when mother\u2019s summoner acquaintance comes to pick you up, I\u2019ll go with you. I\u2019ve really got nothing left tying me here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI won\u2019t lie. I\u2019m probably going to hate you for a bit because of what you took from me. But it won\u2019t stop me from protecting and caring for you as best I can. Being there for you like I wished there had been someone there for me. I wanted to be a Hunter so badly that I let that blind me to what our job is really all about. That stubbornness of mine is also to blame for what happened. So I\u2019ll put that on hold for now while I take care of you. Losing sight of such a simple fact so easily tells me I\u2019m not ready for my license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI promise to protect you and help you control your powers. But you need to promise me you will try to control them. You will confide in me and cry on my shoulder if you need it. You\u2019ve got to let me coddle you and make you feel embarrassed. You\u2019ve got to laugh at some of my bad jokes even if they aren\u2019t funny. You\u2019ve got to put up with me hugging you and telling you to pursue your dreams. Maybe even me kissing your cheeks or messing up your hair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019ve also got to accept random gifts from me for no reason. This includes but is not limited to clothes, stuffed animals, dolls, and accessories. Oh and you have to call me big brother. That one is a must. Even if you balk at some of the other ones, that point isn\u2019t negotiable. And when you grow up and learn to control your power we will tour the world together. We will go places you want to go and see sights you want to see. Find the rare Snow Lion in the far northern wastes. Dance together at the winter festival in Kapala and yell our lungs out at the top of Mt. Piniak. Can you agree to all that if I let you live?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFor a while she didn\u2019t move or blink until she finally nodded her head slowly and her eyes began to water. She rolled over to the side as I pulled her into an embrace and let her cry, feeling the tears streaming down my face too. After what seemed like forever but was only five minutes on the clock she pulled away and laid back down. I held her hand as she stared at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLet me  tell you about my little sister Olia. She was a lot like you. Always used to cry a lot. I really loved her. More than anyone else in my family. She had all these grand dreams for when she grew up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to tell her about Olia as both our eyes continued to water. As long as you live you can change. And as long as you live you can forgive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell that is a bit of a twist. Did you know that was going to happen? Or are you just a softie at heart? This was one serious roller coaster ride for young Riktal. But it seems though he has lost much, he has gained more. Perhaps this was destiny from the beginning. Things would always turn out this way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThough would it if you had not intervened? What path would he have chosen for himself I wonder. If he had the power to do so that is. Are you satisfied with your choices? Do you regret some of them now that you look back? What would you do different.?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps next time you will show me exactly what you would do differently. What new paths lie in store for you?</span></div></div>",

After all, my mother wanted me to come here so I shouldn\u2019t disappoint her by skipping classes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI heard about your declaration in the Combat Class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t worry I will make sure they are off school property before I wreck them. Even if I have to drag them off myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t hurt them at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began walking off down the hall giving her my parting comment without looking back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I\u2019d rather be taking the Hunter\u2019s Exams right now instead of wasting my time in this school. Seems neither one of us will get what we want.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped into last period as quietly as I could, setting my bag down next to me and studying the class while tuning out the lesson. One of these people was the culprit. There was one who kept glancing back at me nervously. And a few that looked speculative. By the time the bell rang I had narrowed it down from the twelve boys in the room to only five. Though of those five I was about ready to cross of two of them simply because one had the starry eyed hero worship look when he glanced at me. The other I remembered as the first boy to come into the gym from the locker room which put him low on the list to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I got up to leave the first boy I had noted who had been constantly glancing at me came up and stopped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUh- can I speak with you privately for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOf course. We can wait a few moments for the room to clear or we can go somewhere else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHere is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere were a few lingerer\u2019s, probably hoping to hear our conversation or maybe to find an opportunity to talk to me for their own personal reasons. A hard glare made them change their mind and leave the two of us alone. The boy checked outside the door to make sure no one was eavesdropping before going back over to his desk a moment. He returned with my Lexinton in his hand shaking a little nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould you be willing to extend that amnesty just a little bit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aren\u2019t the one who stole it are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I-I took it from the person who did. I don\u2019t want them to get hurt for being stupid or stubborn or anything like that,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. If you are going to lie to my face at least do a more convincing job. Don\u2019t stutter, make eye contact, don\u2019t try to shrink into yourself and avert your face. Those are all your bodies way of rejecting your words and saying they are false. my guess is whoever had this gun put you up to this. He was too chicken to do it himself so he sent you in his place. Set you up to take the fall if things go south.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy didn\u2019t say anything, simply turned his head to the side, proving my words accurate. He finally tried to deny it but the words died on his lips. With a grunt of displeasure I plucked the weapon from his hands and shoved it into my bag after making sure the safety was on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take my gun back but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I am going to give him a beating he will never forget. You should choose your friends more carefully if they are so quick to throw you to the wolves to save their own skin. But I do thank you. Not just for giving me my weapon back, but also for making it so much easier to find him. He didn\u2019t think about the fact that I could use a tracer spell to follow his magical essence did he? He handled this gun so his magic is imprinted on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began heading towards the door but the boy stopped me. I looked back expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-if your going to hurt him then hurt me too. I\u2019m the one who took the knuckles. It was stupid and I didn\u2019t want to but he talked me into it. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that I still took them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy knuckles aren\u2019t missing boy. They were never taken in the first place. I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. Though if someone is able to talk you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do originally, then I suggest growing a backbone. We are the creators of our own destiny, not someone else. In the end we decide to make the choices in our life. Even the act of doing nothing is a choice. To listen and to give in to someone else\u2019s urgings is a choice. As a Hunter you need to ask yourself what your choices say about you. Do they uphold your personal values? Are they flexible to suit your needs? Do they help you become a better Hunter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the boy standing there as I cast the spell on the weapon. Three string like lines of magic became visible to my sight emanating from it. The purple one was mine, the green one led back into the classroom so I could strike it off the list as well. The light blue one headed towards the front doors and that was the one I followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt led me off school grounds and into town. It wandered around a bit but still headed straight for one of the middle class residential districts. I had to be just a few steps behind him, but I didn\u2019t run. I had no need to run. There was nowhere he could escape to fast enough with the range I had on my tracer spell. It finally lead me to a small house with a little wooden fence around it. Without hesitation I knocked on the door. There was a moment of footsteps before the door opened and a middle aged woman answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes can I help you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. Sorry to intrude ma\u2019am but I came to see your son. I\u2019m a friend of his from school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally! Hold on. Gregory just came back. Let me call him. Please come inside.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waited in the hall while she called up the stairs. Of course it would be Gregory. He had been high on my list already. Even though he had not been one of the last ones into the Arena, he had proven he had the showboating personality who\u2019s ego would be stroked by something like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n`\t\u201cYeah what is it mom?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe came pounding down the steps while not really paying attention to his surroundings. By the time he noticed me I was already running up the steps towards him. His eyes widened as he tried to turn and run but I was already on him. Grabbing him by his shirt collar I threw him the rest of the way down the steps. As he tumbled to the floor I jumped from my position to land next to him, administering a sharp kick to his stomach that lifted him from his feet and sent him flying a few inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ignored his mother\u2019s exclamations for me to stop, backhanding her absently across the face when she tried to pull me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSteal from me! Did you think I wouldn\u2019t find you! Did you think sending someone else in your place would earn you any favors! I gave you a chance and you blew it! I said I would show no quarter and no mercy. Did you forget about tracer spells!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stomped down hard on his left elbow joint, grabbing his hand and pulling upwards. He shrieked in agony as the bone popped out of place and I kicked him again in his mouth. His father came out of one of the side rooms then pointing a gun at me. I simply lifted his son up and used him as a shield. He hesitated, lowering the weapon a fraction and that\u2019s when I struck. I shot out my right hand by Gregory\u2019s side, slamming a purple energy ball into his father\u2019s chest. I shoved the boy into the wall before dashing over to his parents and using a stasis spell on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy beef is not with you two, though I will hurt you if you get in my way. Thank your son for the predicament you are in now. In fact lets have him tell you why he is getting the snot kicked out of him while you sit here immobilized.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI went back over and picked Gregory up by the hair, bringing my leg up and then dropping the heel back down quickly on top of his kneecap. There was a sickening pop as his leg buckled and he gave another howl of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how about it Gregory? Why don\u2019t you tell your parent\u2019s exactly what kind of lowlife Hunter you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe continued to howl until I brought my fist up into his gut again, causing him to spit out a bit of vomit and saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps phrasing it as a question was too much for you. Then let me make it simple. I will continue to beat on you until you tell your parent\u2019s everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved my knee up into his kidney while pulling his body into the blow before letting him fall to the floor clutching himself with his good right arm. He coughed up a bit of blood before finally telling them everything. I had to administer a few more kicks and dislocate a shoulder before I could convince him to finish his story but he was willing to cooperate with me without too much hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen he was finally done I released his parent\u2019s from my spell, picking up my duffle bag where I had dropped it in the hall and opening the front door. I looked over my shoulder at where his parents were trying to help him heal with their magic as best they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNext time you steal from me I will kill you. This was the only warning you will get. If you want to be a worthy Hunter then do worthy things. If you straighten your act out you could be a good Hunter. Grow up a bit and lose that ego trip of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I left them alone, heading back out onto the street and taking a breath of fresh air. It was almost five o\u2019clock by the bells that rang in the distance. I could go home or go into town for a bit. Neither choice was too appealing to me right now, but I didn\u2019t mind either one at the moment either.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps some mindless walking around would help me cool my head and resist the urge to go back inside so I could continue to beat the crap out of Gregory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I walked, I noted the carefree way children played in their yards or on the sidewalks. How people talked happily together as if the threat of some monster suddenly coming into town and destroying things never entered their minds. It was because they felt safe. They knew that if anything happened a Hunter or Hunter\u2019s would protect them. It wasn\u2019t that they weren\u2019t afraid, but they didn\u2019t let that fear rule them. They took what precautions they could but they didn\u2019t let themselves be paralyzed by their fear. That was one of the many powers of the animal called human, their resilience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI spent a little time at one of the many restaurants scattered around the city, simply observing the people on the street and ignoring the waitresses who were unobtrusively pointing at me and whispering behind their hands. I had gotten used to such things over the years. It was hard not to when almost everyone knew you were a Zelkov on sight. Or at least from an old family because of all those small tells such as bearing and that invisible aura of surety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAcross the street some alarm bells began going off in the bank. I watched as a robber in a ski mask came rushing out of the building shooting his weapon back inside as he made his escape. He turned right to get away just as my mother rounded the corner dragging the girl Asala along behind her. Nearly pulling her over as she roughly yanked on her arm in vexation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already jumping to my feet as my mother turned her head towards the masked man. The robber leveled his weapon and fired. My mother threw out a quick ball of purple energy just as the girl screamed and a red circle began to appear on the ground. The bullet and the energy collided over the circle and exploded, causing the summoning portal to ripple and warp. There was a shift in the very fabric of the air around me, as if the world had just cracked in half even as I ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA hand shot out of the circle, one so massive it almost defied logic. The robber was snagged up completely and crushed into bloody pulp in seconds. Not even a hint of his head or feet showing around the edges, meaning the palm was at least seven or eight feet wide. By the time I was crossing the street at a dead run, most of the rest of the body had pulled itself through the circle. Standing at least seven stories tall the Pit Lord\u2019s eyes burned with pure malevolence. The orbs were literally burning as it let out a roar that shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother grabbed up the girl and jumped backwards as it swung its left fist down at them. The punch struck the ground and made a two foot crater, the shockwaves bringing down the two buildings next to it and cutting off the screams coming from inside. My father came dashing out of a weapons shop slightly farther down the road and ran towards the beast. I used a touch of magic to amplify my voice as I unzipped my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMom! Dad! I\u2019ll take top!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThrowing the bag out wide I expanded a field of magic around myself to catch and hold the weapons as they flew from the duffle. The swords, shields and guns all floated round me as my mother shot an emergency call to arms into the air to gather all Hunter\u2019s as fast as possible. Even as I pulled my full set of armor onto my body and grabbed two swords from the air, my parents snagged a  gun and a pair of gauntlets as well; using a thread of magic to pluck them from the air and bring it towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLinking the hilts with a thread of magic I threw one of the swords at the things  leg, impaling it near the kneecap. It let out a roar as I jumped and swung in an arc, throwing my other sword at the small of its back while yanking the other blade out with a flick of the wrist. This was no time to hold back or play it safe. Not against a Pit Lord. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to swing around it, throwing my blades one after the other and climbing its massive bulk. My father was right behind me, my gauntlets of Ogre might covering his arms up to the shoulders. He had activated phase two of the weapons from the start, a smart move. When the monster tried to attack me with a punch or a swipe my father was there to block the blow with his fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was up to his elbow now, one more swing around would bring me to the face where I could do real damage. The monster swung at me with his other arm but my father wouldn\u2019t make it in time. I prepared to yank out my blade and drop when the sound of a gunshot went off and the fist went wide while blood sprayed across my face. I spared a glance down as I thrust a blade into the back of it\u2019s neck and saw my mother dancing out of the way of a crushing stomp carrying the girl. She gave me a quick salute with my Lexington before jumping behind a car to send it hurtling towards the Pit lord with a magic imbued spinning kick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick glance around showed that the entire block was in shambles. The only building still standing was the weapons shop and that was because of the protective shields around it. But even that wouldn\u2019t last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I came around the face again the Pit Lord roared. I threw one of my blades down its throat and shot a high voltage electrical charge down the connection even as I swung out of the way to land on his left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! Lord of the summer sky!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head to my father who grinned. I saw my mother giving us a thumbs up as she used a massive amount of magic to heave the road up like a giant carpet. As  the creature fell backwards I yanked out my blade and jumped even higher into the sky, leapfrogging off my father\u2019s shoulders to get more height. He smashed his fist together as he yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSoul of the boundless Ogre! Rage and thunder! Clash and smite! Lend me now your monstrous might!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe gauntlets broke apart as the energy surrounded him. A pair of horns grew from his head as tusks sprouted from his upper and lower lips. He grabbed the handle of the sword as I tossed it down to him, yanking on it hard and throwing him even higher into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMistress of the lightning dance. Of Sword and blade and rabid chance! Split and sunder! Curl and maim! Become like the heavens! Create a bloody rain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I fell I released the power of the heart crystals inside all my weapons. Imagining how I wanted the released energy to react. The six swords split once, then twice then three times until the sky was filled with forty eight swords in all. Pulling the two shields into me I released their stones as well, encasing myself from head to toe in temporarily unbreakable armor. I smashed into the things throat seconds before the swords plunged up to the hilt in its flesh. I felt the buzz over my body as my mother turned my blades  and my armor into lightning rods, conducting thousands upon thousands of volts into the thing. As it roared again my father finally came to earth, slamming into the back of my armor and crushing the things throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis all could be considered overkill if this had been a normal monster. But this was no normal monster, this was a Pit Lord. It would take at least seven more Hunter\u2019s to take it down. The three of us, no mater how skilled, could only keep it busy and minimize the damage it did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a roar it flailed it\u2019s arms, shoving them through the rubble of the buildings both next to it and across the street like they were water. With a heave it bucked us off and my invulnerable armor exploded apart as the magic was used up. I saw it kick out it\u2019s leg and my mother took the full brunt of that blow on her shield. The blow threw her backwards, causing the girl to be flung from her arms to land a small distance away. Both of them seemed to be unconscious and my father had been flung into the debris of a fallen building. He was dazed and unmoving even as the beast stood up and lifted both fists high into the air. I could see it preparing to smash them down onto my mother and the girl and I was the only one able to do anything. But they were too far away, I couldn\u2019t save both.</span></div></div>",

Taking off at a dead run I dove forward, grabbing her up and rolling while throwing out one hand and thrusting out a wall of wind towards the girl. The fist came down mere milliseconds after I vacated the spot. The shockwave hit my back as I turned, my spine bouncing on the road before I skidded to a halt. I could feel the burn of skin scrapped raw but I ignored it. Rolling over I thrust my hands into the ground, turning the tar of the street into the consistency of water. When I pulled them back up they were coated with the stuff. It wasn\u2019t the greatest weapon but it was better than my bare hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I rose to my feet, Hunter\u2019s were pouring out of everywhere. Flying over destroyed buildings. Riding motorcycles down the street, dropping off of hang gliders from the sky. First it was only ten, then twenty, soon over thirty Hunter\u2019s were attacking the beast in a mad dance of life and death. One of the Hunter\u2019s was backhanded by the Pit Lord, flying towards the ground. He cushioned his fall with a mattress of magic, but I could see the blood coating his face. That blood flowed backwards back into the wound seconds before it sealed itself up. A look around showed a small army of priests and priestesses coming out of hiding to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe servants of The One God split up into groups to form a backline defense. Healing injuries almost as soon as they happened. Sending out their power to cure cuts in mid air. A Priest came up to examine me but I waved him off, saying my injuries were minor and to take care of my mother. Letting the stolen tar drop from my hands I headed over to a priestess across the street who I assumed was taking care of the little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy back burned and my left leg limped a little bit but I ignored it as I stared down at the girl. The priestess looked up at me and shook her head slowly before using two fingers to close the eyes. Even if she hadn\u2019t said anything I would have known the girl was dead. Her blood and brain matter was splashed across the building rubble. It looked like her head had slammed into the sharp edge of one of the stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI saw what you did. Your initial wall of wind saved her. She was so light she was easily pushed out from under the fist. But because she was so light the aftershock picked her up like a leaf on the wind and tossed her. The force would have been so great she would never have felt anything even if she had been awake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stood up and put her hands on me. I tried brushing her off, telling her to go heal someone else but she shook her head no. The soothing warmth of her divine power flowed through me. the aches in my leg and the burning in my back subsided and she let her hands drop away. She gave me a small bow before heading off to the main battle where the monster was on it\u2019s last leg. With forty five Hunter\u2019s going to town on it now, it stood no chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knelt there in front of the girl lifting her hand in mine gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry little one. I made a split second decision and it ended with you losing your life. I didn\u2019t wish any harm to come to you. Perhaps if I hadn\u2019t been so stubborn and accepted the job of protecting you to begin with, none of this would have happened. I let my anger blind me from doing what a Hunter truly stands for. Protecting the innocent and those who can\u2019t protect themselves. I hope you are in a better place now. Where you are with your family and happy. Rest in peace Asala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI closed my eyes and said a small prayer for the little girl. I didn\u2019t know if there really was someplace greater that we went to or not, but I liked to believe there was. Wild cheering went up behind me as the Pit Lord gave a final roar of defiance before dying. I ignored the celebration as the little hand in mine slowly cooled off. I heard footsteps but didn\u2019t bother to turn and look as my mother and father came up on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy did you save me and not her?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs that an accusation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m just curious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was silent a moment, giving the hand a final squeeze before standing up and turning to face them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause when it comes down to it, you are family. We might not agree on much of anything and we always argue. I can\u2019t help but get angry when I am around you for more than a few moments sometimes. But you are still family. You are still my mother and nothing will change that fact. Even if I change my name. Even if I lose my memory, that fact remains. You are the person who gave birth to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy dad limped over and put his hand on my shoulder, his brown hair matted with blood and eyes the same color stared at me. He sported a new scar running down the entire left side of his face and onto his neck. He smiled as he gave my shoulder a squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good son. It was a hard decision to make. Especially in the heat of the moment like that. No one can fault you for the choice you made.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved his hand off and walked past them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. I fault myself for the choices I make. That\u2019s the meaning of regret. To look back and wonder what you could have done differently. To wonder if what you did was the right thing or not. If the outcome would be different. I\u2019m not ready to be a Hunter yet. That\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving. I\u2019m packing up my bags and I\u2019m going to leave. I don\u2019t know where I will go or how I will get there but that doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m missing something as a Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shook my head as I stared at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. That\u2019s not quite right. It\u2019s more like I forgot something as a human being. I\u2019m going to go find it. I guess in the end I\u2019m following the Zelkov tradition eh? Go running off and not coming back until who knows when. Maybe come back once a month if I feel like it. The truth is there was never anything really tying me to this place, to that house. Just a sense of duty to the family name. but it\u2019s not enough anymore. It can all rot away for all I care. I don\u2019t need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe will be waiting for you to come back son.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t make promises you can\u2019t keep. In a day or two you will both be gone again on some important job or other. Just like you always are. You never had time for your son before, or for being a family. Why should you start now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the two of them standing there by Asala\u2019s corpse. I had barely known the girl but I somehow felt more for her right now than I did for either of my parents. I loved them. But love wasn\u2019t enough to keep me here anymore. It had barely kept me here to begin with. I just hadn\u2019t realized any of this until now. I didn\u2019t know what the future held for me, but whatever was in store I would be alone to experience it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust like I had always been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t What is the price of a life? A single moment of hesitation? A bond of family or friendship? What life was worth more? The life of a girl he barely knew and had not yet begun to live? Or a mother he loved and hated who was barely a mother to him to begin with? Were they equally valuable? It is not so easy to make such choices is it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs he said, regret is wondering at the choices you didn\u2019t make. Tell me, do you regret? Would you unravel the skein of fate and reweave it anew? Riktal does not have this luxury, but in this realm of the infinitely possible you do. Please join me again sometime and create a new web of choice and consequence.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI sprinted and dove, wrapping my arms around the girl as I rolled, throwing out a wall of wind in an attempt to push my mother out of the way. The fist came down right where I had been a second before and the shockwave lifted me off the ground and threw me across the street. I rolled over the girl so my back slammed into the broken building before she did. I felt something snap as the metallic taste of blood flowed up my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I righted myself, a group of ten Hunter\u2019s came out of the woodwork around town to attack the Pit Lord. Even as I sat there with my legs completely useless and my arms wrapped around the girl protectively, even more came. Hunter\u2019s of all shapes and sizes and all specialties. Within moments there were thirty Hunter\u2019s stabbing, jumping, blocking, spinning and ultimately killing the monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPriests and priestesses came out of nowhere as well, healing them as soon as they got hurt like a well oiled machine. One of the priest came over to my side saying he would take care of me. I told him to check out the girl first which he did. Letting me know she was just unconscious with a few minor scratches but otherwise unhurt. He then bent over my legs as his hands glowed white. I could feel the holy power fixing whatever was broken inside of me, the power soothing and warm. The power eventually faded, leaving a slight desire to feel it again like it always did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did what I could. You can walk, but you are going to live with a limp for the rest of your life. I\u2019m just glad I was able to make it in time. A few moments longer and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to save your legs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLess talk. Go help the others. I\u2019m fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe nodded his head before hurrying away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGetting to my feet was hard. My legs were a bit stiff and didn\u2019t want to bend properly. But I finally managed to do so through sheer willpower. Clutching the girl tightly to my chest I shambled over to the last place I had seen my mother. My right leg dragging along behind me like a bit of dead weight. It would take weeks, if not months of physical therapy to get it working more normally. But that was a worry for another day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA priestess was kneeling over my mother, her hands and body glowing with that divine light. When I got close enough I saw her right arm was gone up to the shoulder. The flesh still attached was mangled and pulped. Even as I watched the Priestess cut the dead flesh off before sealing up the wound into a stump. When she was done she looked up at me and smiled thinly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did what I could. I saw you shove her out of the way with that blast of wind. That saved her life. If you hadn\u2019t done that the blow would have crushed her head no question. She has some minor cuts and bruises but I healed the internal bleeding as best I could. She will probably wake up in a day or two.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her from here. Go join the others. They will need your help more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe left then to join the fight, the Pit lord was beginning to fall. with almost forty five Hunters and a squad of ten healer\u2019s behind them, the beast stood no chance. It slowly fell to it\u2019s knees even as it continued to fight to it\u2019s last breath. My father came limping over holding his shoulder, sporting a fresh scar running down the entire left side of his face and onto his neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did good son. That was some quick thinking and quicker moves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked down at my mother and her missing arm and his eyes softened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s going to be mad at you when she wakes up you know. Saying she would rather die than live having lost one arm. She won\u2019t mean it of course. It\u2019s just her way of coming to grips with the facts. You know how she is about these kind of things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I don\u2019t. Neither one of you are ever around long enough for me to know anything about you besides the fact that you are Hunter\u2019s. I don\u2019t know anything aside from your birthday\u2019s really. I don\u2019t even know how old either one of you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. I think it\u2019s time we changed that. Your mother\u2026 your mother was never really good with kids. Said she just didn\u2019t understand them. She said she could deal with them once they were fifteen and older but before that she just felt uncomfortable being around them in a non Hunter capacity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe and your mother haven\u2019t always seen eye to eye on a lot of things. And I will admit it, both of us put our jobs first. That lead to a lot of hardships for you I guess. I suppose I wasn\u2019t that great a father either. I didn\u2019t know much about how to deal with children just like your mother. But one thing I did know was that you were ready to be a Hunter. It was your mother who didn\u2019t want you taking the Exams. But after this, she should have no reason to deny you anymore. If you want to take the Exams I\u2019ll support you and make sure it happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father picked up my mother as the Pit Lord gave one final bellowing death rattle. Wild cheers broke out among the Hunter\u2019s as they began to congratulate each other. Absently I reached down to rub my right leg where a dull aching throb began and shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. Don\u2019t bother. I\u2019ve just made up new plans for my life. I\u2019m going to protect this girl for the next two or three days just like mother wanted. And then I am going to leave with her when she goes. She needs stability for her powers and training will give her some but not all of that. She needs family. It seems to me I have some experience as an older brother under my belt. And honestly, you two don\u2019t need me. You never really did. That\u2019s why you were never home. I\u2019ll just be following the Zelkov tradition of going off and coming back once in a blue moon. So until she doesn\u2019t need me as a big brother I\u2019m going to hold off on taking the Hunter\u2019s Exams.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe will miss you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t lie. It doesn\u2019t suit you. Nether one of you have ever missed me. At least not enough to make you put me before your jobs. Can you tell me the last time you were home for Christmas? When the last time you gave me a gift that had nothing to do with being a Hunter? Can you tell me the last time you talked to me about non Hunter things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t I shook my head as I squeezed the little girl a bit tighter. Her arms snaked out to wrap around me as she buried her head into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou both raised me as a Hunter and nothing else. Not a regular boy. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t understand children. You never tried to understand them. That\u2019s where I differ from you and mother. I can understand them because normal children had everything I didn\u2019t but wanted. I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019ve used up my anger for the day. Besides, it just doesn\u2019t seem worth it to get angry over these facts anymore. I\u2019ll make sure to send you something for your birthday\u2019s though. If I remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and walked away, carrying the little girl in my arms. I made sure to keep my back straight even while my leg dragged behind me. I ignored the cheers and the words of thanks from the Hunter\u2019s and citizen\u2019s for delaying the monster. Ignored the people offering to take the girl off my hands for me. But mostly I ignored the pair of sad eyes I could feel staring at my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt\u2019s funny how a random series of events can end in such weird ways is it not? It all started out so simple. A boy a bit angry at being transferred to a new school. With a desire to become a Monster Combat Hunter. He ends his day without anger and giving up that desire for a little girl he had originally wanted nothing to do with. What number of possibilities had to come together for this outcome? One? Two? Or perhaps as they say: it all started at hello.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWould this outcome have happened if the choices made had been different? If it were the same, would it be exactly the same? What would make him choose to save the girl over his own mother in the end? Oh I know you made the choice for him, but if it had not been your hand guiding his actions, what would be his reasoning? For even though you made the choices, this outcome has always been a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoin me again will you not? My curiosity is satisfied for now but I am not completely sated. I wish to continue to observe you and the choices you make. For it is indeed enlightening. Until we meet again.</span></div></div>",

Expecting me to act this or that way. Trying to pull my strings and make me dance to their tune. If I went into town I had a feeling there would be more of that. Besides the only people I really knew in town were people who dealt with Hunter\u2019s. Broker\u2019s, other Hunter\u2019s and the like. No one I really needed to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe walk home was quit and uneventful. I decided to skirt the outside of the city to go from Gregory\u2019s house to mine instead of going the faster way through town. As I walked I saw normal families living their everyday lives. Glimpses of what normal was through open windows and inside fenced yards. Normal for everyone but me that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tNormal for me was lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI made it home finally, unlocking the spell on the front door absently. Letting my bag drop to the floor I headed for the kitchen. The old house creaked and shifted a little but I rarely heard it anymore except for the rare occasion like this. I clicked on the TV set into the wall by the kitchen table just to hear some noise while I made myself something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI really didn\u2019t feel like making anything special. There really was no need since it was just me. No point in dirtying a bunch of pots and pans for one person. So a peanut butter and jelly sandwich did just fine. As I took a bite and left the kitchen I noticed I had pinched the edges to keep the jelly in without thinking. I smiled a bit at that but kept walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I went into the living room I turned that TV on as well before turning and walking away. Going to the calendar out in the hall I put a red X in the corner of today\u2019s date before placing a blue and green one next to it. Now that the month was almost over I looked back and saw a single circle of each color interspersed among the days. The most recent being a red one around yesterdays date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy little way of keeping track of when my family came home and spent the night. Red for my mother, blue for my father and green for big sis Ulicia. Circles for when they were here and X\u2019s for when they weren\u2019t. A simple thing but a telling one. Looking back over the last six months proved all four of us hadn\u2019t been together in this house at the same time. Father\u2019s circles appeared more often then mother\u2019s or big sis\u2019. Though big sis had moved out so that was understandable. Sadly big sis\u2019 appeared slightly more often than mother\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis calendar was more than just a record of when they were here or not. It was a record of our family. A record of my normal. Filled with broken promises, missed holidays, and lies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLetting the pages drop back down I went upstairs and took a quick shower. Once I was done I hunted through my closet until I found an old blue stuffed rabbit. Clutching it to my chest like the little girl had held her teddy bear, I lay on the bed and closed my eyes. Let tomorrow come sooner, and let my dreams be filled with a little girl that had never left me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWell are you satisfied? Good. Bad. Easy. Hard. Do any of these describe the decisions you made? Did you simply do what you would have done in the situation? Or did you go against your gut instincts? Did you take what you knew of young Riktal into account as well? Or did you disregard him as unimportant? A mere character in some story and not a living person. Do you regret the choices? Do you wonder what might have been?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOur time grows short but I shall see you again. Of this I am certain and have no question. When we return we shall find out again, what kind of god you are and what destiny you will choose.</span></div></div>",

I kicked up my legs, intending to catch her in the stomach and throw her over my head but she dropped her arms and planted her palms on the soles of my boots. With a deft twist and contortion she controlled her movements to spin in a circle upside down while flying over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued my backwards roll into a handstand, so I saw how she landed on her hands and feet in a crouch. Her stance reminded me of a frog with one foot upraised as it got ready to hop. Indeed she did hop. She launched herself at me, thrusting with legs I knew could dent cement if she wanted and speed to match. I was already bending my elbows in a vertical pushup, pushing off the ground and sailing over her head upside down like she had sailed over mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\tI saw her hand reach down to her waist while her other one planted itself on the floor and shifted my center of gravity without thinking, turning in a half circle while still in mid flip. I noticed she had thrown an empty vial too late as it passed my sight. I tried to shift my center again but was unable to before big sis managed to twist her body at the waist, kicking me in the small of my back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I flew through the air to slam into the wall I was throwing out a wall of air to push her back. That gave me enough time to slide to the floor and spin back to my feet in a fighters crouch. She stood pouting at me a few feet away where my wind had pushed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiki! How dare you do that to your big sister! I need my tiki tank filled up! I must have it filled up! I will die without my dose of tiki! It\u2019s been so long since I filled up my tank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stamped her foot as she talked, throwing a little temper tantrum and acting like a four year old instead of a twenty four year old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t \u201cThat\u2019s it! I will get my fix!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe swung her hand out, snagging a potion and tossing it to the floor in front of me. As the green smoke shot up into the air, she launched herself out of the teleportation spell almost right on top of me. I grabbed her outstretched arm and spun, throwing her over my shoulder into the wall. She broke up into green smoke and wafted away just as I felt the back of my shirt become damp and my body stiffened up from the paralysis potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBig sis Ulicia spun me around, grabbing me up in a hug and swinging me around like a rag doll. She showered my cheeks and forehead with kisses in between rubbing her cheeks all over my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you like my new potion Riki tiki! It took three years to figure out how to make it and I only have one of those fifteen second ones and a thirty second version. I call it potion of magical body double. It creates a perfect replica of the person who imbues their magic into it. So perfect even master Hunter\u2019s can\u2019 tell the difference. I\u2019ll teach you how to make it next time I have some time at home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally set me back down with a sigh and threw the antidote on me. The liquid inside turned into gas on contact with the air that I inhaled before it drifted away. As my body loosened up again she grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTiki tank fully recharged! I will be able to go on for a bit longer! Now on to class! Sit down Riki tiki. It\u2019s impolite to keep the class waiting like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll get you back for this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe put one hand on her cheek while rubbing at her eyes with the other one and faking tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat a horrible brother you are! Threatening your big sister like that. Don\u2019t you know I love you so much!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah. I could do with a little less love from you. Now hurry up and get to teaching this class before you make a bigger scene then you already have.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kept my face a blank mask of indifference as I returned to my desk and sat down again. I could see the grins on some faces and hear the snickering behind hands. This was what I had to put up with every time big sis came home. They all thought being from an old family was easy. They could gladly take my place if they wanted, I was sure one day with my family would be enough to make them change their mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI listened with only one ear as my sister went over some of the basics of Alchemy and potion making. Having instantly switched from the four year old mentality back into her work mentality like flipping a switch. It was an art all Hunter\u2019s eventually picked up. When the rest of the kids in the class pulled out their mini chemistry labs to begin making an actual potion I ended up borrowing one of the ones sitting along the back wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSis walked around the room, stopping at desks and pointing out tips on how to improve their form or to comment on how they had their desk set up for ease of access. While everyone else made health potions I set about making my own things. I didn\u2019t need to wait and be told when to add this item or that item. Nor how many times to stir the brew. I didn\u2019t need to be told when to combine the blue and the yellow mixtures. Big sis had taught that all to me long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo by the time class was over and big sis finally came over to me again I handed her a vial of paralysis potion and the antidote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSave you the trouble of making them yourself. I didn\u2019t have the right grade of ingredients for the third tier versions or the time to let them seep but I was able to make the second tier at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes went as round as saucers as they wavered and wobbled like she would cry. She wrapped her arms around my neck and rubbed her face against mine again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a good brother! I don\u2019t know why mamma and papa sent you here! I thought for sure they would let you take the Exams! I\u2019ve got a job to do so I won\u2019t be home for a week or so. But when I come back I\u2019ll tell you all about what I\u2019ve been up to! I got to run now Riki tiki! Give mom my love when you see her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe dropped a potion on the floor and a wall of green smoke shot into the air. This one really was a transportation spell since she stepped into it with a final wave. The smoke folded in on itself before poofing out of existence, not even leaving a trace of broken glass behind. Ignoring the stares of the few people still in the room I put my borrowed chemistry lab away, grabbed up my bag and headed for the next class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThis would be Combat training. Something I could actually get into. Even if none of these people were up to my skill level I could always practice on my own. I was sure the Arena Master would have a few monsters I could battle against in my own private floor. A Hunter could never think he was good enough, doing so was just asking to get the crap knocked out of you. Sis was able to beat me because she had more experience. Sometimes no matter how good you were, experience trumped all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was one of the last ones to make it to the locker rooms but I didn\u2019t mind. Unlike all the rest of them I had no real need to gear up. While they were strapping on plate armor and specialized padding for their respective weapons of choice, all I needed was my fists and maybe a bit of leg protection. Dropping my duffle on a bench I unzipped it before looking inside for my leg armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy hands stilled for a moment then began pushing weapons and items out of the way with more haste. Where was my Lexington double barrel and my Roller Knuckles? I know I had packed them this morning. Hadn\u2019t I? Were they still in my room or something? No, I would never have been so careless as to not pack them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked around the room at the other boys who were putting on their gear. Could one of them have taken it? It was possible. I had left my bag unattended during lunch. It hadn\u2019t been long but it had been more than enough time for someone to dig through the bag and take what they wanted. It could have been one of the girls as well, but this was more along the lines of something a guy would do. Women I had found were less likely to snoop in other peoples things without good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey were dangerous weapons in the wrong hands. Someone untrained in how to use them could get seriously hurt or hurt someone else unintentionally. I needed to get them back but I didn\u2019t even know for sure someone in here had stolen them. Or indeed if I had even brought them. I could inform the teacher. I wouldn\u2019t get them back right away, but that route would at least keep me from doing anything rash and breaking even more rules, if not heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat is if I even got them back with that route. It wasn\u2019t that they were incompetent, but in some things the teachers just didn\u2019t have a lot of pull. If the thief managed to get it home that might be the last I saw of them. The other option was to handle it myself. I had a higher chance of getting my stuff back, but also a greater chance of possible killing someone in my anger. It might not come to that point, but that was a worse case scenario.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tA few quick whispered words to the Arena master in charge of the locker room before locking up my duffle bag and I was out the door. After that scene with big sis I would rather keep a low profile for a bit longer. No sense making enemies I didn\u2019t need to. Even if I didn\u2019t think much of anyone here right now, I might have to work with them in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I waited in the Arena I watched everyone coming in closely for any hints that they might be the culprit. I wasn\u2019t even sure what I was looking for exactly, since I didn\u2019t know any of them well enough to know how they normal acted. But any little thing might be a clue as long as I paid attention to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cClass! Today we are doing something a bit different. We will not be having sparring lessons as usual. Today will be an application day to test the knowledge of what you have learned the last two weeks. When I call your name you will pair up into groups of four or five as I see fit. You will work together to combat and kill various monsters. I have judged your skill levels and will pit you against monsters within that skill range. They will not be weak, but they will not be too hard either. You may use any weapons you wish.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe fiddled with a small box that fit in the palm of his hand and a row of weapon racks holding various weapons from shields to guns slid out of the floor behind him. Another manipulation of his magical box caused a wall to go up down the middle of the rectangular arena floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cZelkov! Hawthrope! You two can sit out for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged as he began separating the class into groups before heading up into the bleachers. I made sure to sit right where the wall split it in half so I could watch what was going on below. Liz climbed the bleachers and sat next to me, also watching the groups below quietly for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re a Zelkov huh? That actually explains a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd yet I wish it didn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know what you mean. It can be a pain being a Hawthrope. It\u2019s like as soon as they find out the name they know, or at least think they know, all these things about you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe first two groups stepped into the arena to each face off against a three headed five foot tall snake creatures called Overloks. So they were around D class Hunter\u2019s right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI really hope your name isn\u2019t Riki tiki or I might not be able to keep a straight face anytime I talk to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s Riktal. Only my sister can get away with calling me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause she is stronger than you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause she is my sister. And so you know my win ratio against her is about fifty-fifty. What\u2019s your angle anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo angle. It\u2019s just refreshing to have someone else to talk to about Hunter stuff. My dad forced me to attend this school and quite frankly I am bored to tears. All the girls seem to only think and want to talk about boys and the latest fashion. All the boys seem to want to talk about girls and, well, girls. They don\u2019t seem to have an interest in strategy, or favorite weapons or the different ways you can use a weapon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you simply want to alleviate your boredom huh? Well I guess that\u2019s a valid angle as well. I don\u2019t mind I guess.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhile we had been talking the second groups that had both gone against a Slumbog, a giant slug like worm that stood six feet tall, finally killed their prey. They were definitely of a lower class than me. It would have taken me a minute or less to dispatch such an easy creature. Though these hands-on battles were making the natural leaders and thinkers stand out. I had to admit they also had some decent teamwork. They were sloppy in places and could definitely use some work but it was passable for this level of creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs the fifth and last group walked into the ring the floor slid to the side and a Cluuk rose into view inside a cage. The creature looked like a giant red chicken with glowing green eyes. The wattle under its beak was spiked and poison tipped. I nodded at the five of them with my chin absently as the cage fell away back into the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess these are the cream of the crop in this class. That\u2019s a low C monster easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAye. They all have level heads and this shouldn\u2019t be a problem for them. Well mostly. Gregory there has a bit of an ego. Seems to think the world revolves around him and likes to show off. Quick to blame other people for his mistakes if he can and always feeling entitled to more than he should have. He is a good gunner though I will give him credit. And his magic casting isn\u2019t bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pointed at the one in full plate armor with a full body shield and a short sword who stood like a wall against the Cluuk\u2019s first charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic there is the best of this group though. A team is nothing without a good tank. And he is one of the best in this class. Though he is treated like dirt because he comes from a small country town and is a first generation Hunter. Hardly any magic to speak of, just this side of being a Void. Probably another reason no one likes him. But on a one-on-one basis and stacked against everyone else in the class he\u2019d rank somewhere around fourth or fifth. That\u2019s not including us of course. I\u2019m confident he could take on a high level C ranked monster or even a low level B depending on the creature.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDaniel is a strong hand-to hand combat brawler. Magic is sub-par and passable with other weapons. Lilian might be a bit absentminded but she is a really good healer with strong divine magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait there is a priestess in our class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah a bit surprising isn\u2019t it? Her parents are priests as well so there is no surprise she got the healing touch. But seems she decided on her own she wanted to become a Hunter. I\u2019m not sure why exactly but she was adamant about it. I guess when her parents tried to dissuade her and get her to take the binding rituals of their faith she simply walked out the doors and came to this school saying she wanted to enroll.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as  the one named Jethic smashed his shield into the monster\u2019s side, getting it back into position to defend just in time. The others beat on it like a well oiled machine. It would go down soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell as long as they don\u2019t try killing it with magic or use fire they got this in the bag. Though I\u2019m surprised you know so much about your classmates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly their combat ability. I like to know what I might be up against or who has my back if things go bad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I turned my head back towards the rings I saw the one named Gregory throw one of his guns into the air and swing his now empty right hand behind his back. My Lexington double barrel came into view as he swung it around and fired it sideways. I didn\u2019t have time to even shout a warning as the bullet left the barrel, being coated in magic from the second tube even as it left the gun. The kickback from the shot lifted the boy off his feet and sent him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was already vaulting onto the wall splitting the Arena floor and running even as the Lexington flew out of his hands and into the air. Time seemed to move in slow motion as I watched everything unfold. The Cluuk took the bullet in the side of the head and fell to the ground even as it\u2019s feathers changed to black. It\u2019s blood and brains flew everywhere as the group began to cheer. I leapt off the wall and grabbed my Lexington before sliding into a landing in front of the group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTank! Shields up! Healer back line! switch target to Cluuk! You\u2019re main caster now! You with the staff! Switch to magical support! Defensive magic is the priority! Assist the tank and healer!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey looked at me confused even as I hit the button that locked the magic from leaving the barrel. As Liz dropped into the arena I pointed at Gregory with my gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGet him the hell out of here before I shoot him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head and slung the boy over her shoulder even as the blood and brains from the fallen Cluuk pulled back into it\u2019s body like time had rewound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTank I hear you\u2019re good enough to take on a B class. I hope Liz was right. Because this one\u2019s your first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe looked at the chicken a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA Kloo, if you kill a Cluuk with magic it turns into a Zombie. Most magic is pretty useless against it now except for holy. We can dismember it all we want but it will pull itself back together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do we beat it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned at the brawler named Daniel\u2019s question as my blood got to pumping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust follow my instructions and you\u2019ll do fine. Now brace for first impact!  You with the staff, cast a blinding flash on my signal. When I give the signal everyone else close their eyes. Daniel get your fist\u2019s ready because blunt is the next best thing on an undead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe monster charged and Jethic planted his shield on the ground while putting his shoulder against it. Right before the beast hit I began the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBlind it!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Get the protects going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI have a name! its Marsa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t care right now! Get the protect shields up! Daniel focus on the legs!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as Jethic shoved upwards I jumped forward, ramming my knee into its neck hard enough to snap it. Our combined efforts toppled it backwards even as I saw the ball of holy energy hurtling my way. I twisted and kicked the thing in its back, lifting it up with my augmented blow. The smite smashed into the creature, making it squawk in pain. It\u2019s head snapped back into place as it repaired itself and got back to it\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDaniel started punching and kicking it in the nearest foot, his fist glowing a rich green color. Within seconds that leg had turned to dust, crushed under the blows. Throwing out my arm I caught it\u2019s neck in my elbow and spun across it\u2019s back, twisting the head right off and chucking it to the farthest reaches of the arena. Another rain of holy missiles shot into the creature as Daniel went to work on the other leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Kloo spread it\u2019s wings and shot poison tipped feathers in all directions. Marsa grabbed Daniel with her magic and yanked him behind Jethic who stood in front of the barrage. Most of them hit his shield harmlessly but a few flew over his head.  He reached out his hand and waved it quickly, taking the hits on his own personal armor instead of letting even one get past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic! You know how to do a hot and heavy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know the principals but never actually done it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood enough. Marsa! Cast a fire enhancement spell on Jethic\u2019s shield. Lilia cast a nova blast on Jethic when I give the signal. Daniel, you got a special hand to hand move of your own?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne that my grandpa taught me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Once the nova goes off lay into this bird!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the shield glowing red as I tucked my gun into my belt for the moment in case I needed to assist Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLilia you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReady!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen Jethic it\u2019s on you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a yell he smashed his sword into his shield a few times until the sword turned into another full body shield. Toting the two metal titan\u2019s like toys he rushed the creature laying into it with both of them, smashing them over and over in lightning quick strikes. The flame enhanced slabs of metal burned a hole through the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLilia now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe nova went off in a circle around Jethic who was beginning to smoke as his armor heated up. The nova cooled him down while invading the Kloo\u2019s insides and melting them with holy fire. It\u2019s outside might be protected from damage and magic but the insides were still very weak to such things. Holy magic was one of the few effective magic\u2019s that could pierce its skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJethic back off! Daniel! You\u2019re up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis feet and fist became surrounded by his green aura up to the elbows and knees as he rushed forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDance of the midnight devil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis arms and legs became a blur that even I had a hard time following. Moving like jackhammer strikes I could see the dents the blows were putting into the beast. And a dance it was. He spun and flipped from one position to the next striking with fist, elbow, feet, and knee until finally he struck the body with an open palm. There was a moment of stillness before the entire creature exploded. But so did Daniel\u2019s left hand. From the palm he had struck it with all the way up to the elbow the skin flayed apart as bone fragments ripped through the skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI ignored his cry of pain as I searched the dismembered parts. Even as they began to start pulling themselves back together. I finally found what I was searching for, yanking out my Lexington and firing a bullet into the hardened shriveled heart of the zombie bird. The pieces stopped moving for a moment and then the body broke up into dust in the wind, leaving behind a pile of black feathers. Lilia went over to Daniel and laid her hands on his, putting his arm back to working order. As the rest of the class came running up with cheers on their lips I picked up the pile from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDividing up the twelve feathers into groups of three I handed them out to the four who had helped me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood work you guys. You did well for a B class creature. Good holy magic Lilia, and nice support Marsa. Top notch tanking Jethic, and Daniel that was a great combat ability as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah, well as you can see, I haven\u2019t really perfected it yet. It puts a huge strain on the body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut it worked. Sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself to win against a monster. Those black feathers are your reward. You earned them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey\u2019re pretty but what are they? I feel some faint magic from them but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just my imagination or what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI smiled at Lilia as I plucked one from her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThese are Kloo feathers obviously. One of the few types of undead that can use or hold magic. Since magic is how they are created.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glared at Gregory as I said that and he shrunk back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy Lexington coats bullets in magic, that magic got soaked into these feathers. Now these feathers can be used for one of three purposes. The first, they can grant luck. Place one of these feathers in your hat, hair or clothes after sprinkling it with a bit of blessed water and you will find you will be extremely lucky for a day. Accidents just seem to always miss hitting you, you find the item you thought you lost last week, you guess every answer on a test correctly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSecond, they are valuable materials for alchemic potions. They can make some of the rarest, most sought after elixirs. If you have all the rare ingredients that is. And third, you could sell them to any good materials store for no less than a thousand Reul. If someone tries to offer you less go someplace else. Depending on the amount of magic in it they can fetch upwards of fifteen or sixteen hundred Reul.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf it is so rare then why did it drop so many feathers? I would think people would be hunting these things all the time for that much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI handed the feather back to Lilia as I answered Marsa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause we killed it on the first dismemberment for one. A skilled Hunter can take one down alone, but it will usually pull itself back together at least three times before he can either find and kill it\u2019s core or simply beat the magic animating it out. The other part was luck. I was expecting at least eight, but luck plays a factor in any monster drop, so you got twelve.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you want any?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. You guys did all the work. All I did was tell you what to do and shot a bullet into it\u2019s core. Put a little more effort into becoming Hunter\u2019s and you\u2019ll do fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned and narrowed my eyes at Gregory who was trying to hide behind the rest of the class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs for you, you little thief. You best count yourself lucky. If I could get away with it I would put a bullet right between your eyes right now. How dare you steal from me! But seeing as I can\u2019t get away with it, I leave your punishment up to the Arena Master and this school. But know this. If you ever come near me for whatever reason I will show you no mercy. If any of my things come up missing again, I will come after you. Even if you didn\u2019t take it, I will still extract payment from your hide. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stayed long enough to see him nod his head before asking to be excused to put my weapon away. The Arena Master nodded his assent as he turned to focus on Gregory. I went to the locker room and sat on a bench, pulling off my glasses and rubbing my eyes. I had been so close to killing him. The rage was still there inside. I had really wanted to come here to cool my temper off before I did something I would regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the door open moments before Jethic and Daniel walked in. They went to their bags and put away their feathers, giving me a nod and a small smile. They left again and the door creaked closed with its slight booming sound. A second later I looked up to find Daniel peeking around the corner before coming over to me a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cC-can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI really wasn\u2019t in the mood to talk right now. If what he said made me even madder I might take it out on him without meaning to. But he seemed to think it was important or he wouldn\u2019t have approached me.</span></div></div>",

If it was something important to him that I could help alleviate without much hassle then why not listen to him. He had earned that much from me at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith his head lowered he went back over to his locker, opened it up for a moment and came back with my Roller Knuckles gripped tightly in his hands. His arms were shaking so much as he held them out to me I thought they would shake right off his body. I looked up at him but didn\u2019t take them at first, simply narrowing my eyes until he finally looked up to lock gazes with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI-I know it was wrong to take them. I-I didn\u2019t want to! But Gregory talked me into it! He said a whole bunch of things like I deserved to have a good pair of fist weapons since I\u2019m a fist specialist. And then I was holding them when Lilia came into the room and I hid them from her and I just sort of kept them. I\u2019m sorry!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy tell me this now? I\u2019m sure you realize that I am very angry at the moment. Angry enough to kill. So why didn\u2019t you wait until later when I might not be so angry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I was in the wrong. It doesn\u2019t matter how things happened. What matters is I went through your bag without permission and I stole them. Even though my parent\u2019s aren\u2019t Hunter\u2019s, my grandfather was. He told me sometimes a man can only say what he truly wants to say through using his fists. He also said the true worth of a person can sometimes only be found by fighting next to them and not with them. He taught me a lot of other stuff too, like owning up to your mistakes and accepting the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never really understood what he meant about a lot of stuff. I still don\u2019t. But fighting next to you I think I see what he meant about that much. The way you had this presence that made me believe I could win even though my knees were knocking so hard I thought they would shatter. I didn\u2019t listen to you because you are a Zelkov, I listened because of that presence. And I thought, I wanted to be like that. I thought if I ever wanted to be like that I had to fess up and give them back no matter what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took the gloves from his hands then, looking down at them as I hefted them a few times. To say I wasn\u2019t angry about it would be a lie. I wanted to knock his head off, but I didn\u2019t. He had at least confessed of his own accord. Finally I looked up at the boy who was still shaking while waiting for my judgment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere is a place called the Iron Buckler down by the river. The man who runs the place is called Valoric. Make sure you speak to him and not one of his assistance. Tell him I sent you. He deals not only in weapons but also in monster spoils. Trade your three feathers in to him for a good pair of gloves without question. Even if you lose out on the deal a bit. Tell him I said to give you ones with some protection augmentations on them at least. These ones are way out of your league at your current skill level. If you were to try to use them they would eat you up and spit you out. Doing to your body what your dance did to your arm. The choice to do so is up to you of course, but if you really want a pair of good gloves then you might want to think about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour not angry at me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I\u2019m angry. Really angry. But everyone does things they regret later. Even me. My anger makes me do a lot of things I wish I hadn\u2019t done once I cool off. But your grandfather was right, sometimes you only get a sense of the worth of a person by fighting next to them. The sense I got from you is that you aren\u2019t all that bad a person. You might be a bit foolish and do some stupid things but you aren\u2019t a bad person. You at least had the guts to confront me with your mistake and didn\u2019t try to foolishly use these weapons like Gregory did. If you decide to get the gloves from Valoric, I\u2019m willing to teach you a few tricks I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cT-thanks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waved him off and he ran, his eyes still full of bewilderment. Rubbing my eyes again I began a few breathing exercises to calm down. Once I was ready I shoved the gloves back into my bag and headed out the door. Back in the arena I headed up into the bleachers to sit next to Liz. Scanning the ground below I didn\u2019t see a sign of Gregory. Liz noticed my gaze and nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe Arena Master banned him from the floor for a month before sending him to the principal. I\u2019ve no doubt she will make him clean equipment after school everyday for that timeframe or some other dull task. He\u2019s lucky to get off so easy I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe\u2019s lucky I was in a good mood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? That was a good mood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t hit him did I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chuckled but didn\u2019t say anything else. We continued to watch the groups below facing off against different creatures, sometimes being put into different groups. I could see the quality of their movements had changed. They worked together as a team better, the instructions were clear and commanding. Instead of them being formed into a question of could you or would you, they were direct \u201cdo this\u201d phrases instead. Reaction times were better and so was the timing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re the reason they all got better you know. After watching you they are trying to emulate what you did. The leaders and strategists are trying to have that same air of command you gave off, while the rest are more confident because of how you led the group against the Kloo. Seeing a bunch of C class Hunter\u2019s in training take down a B class monster was a big boost to their morale.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. I simply did my job as a Hunter. They are the ones that put more meaning behind it then I did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrue. But isn\u2019t that also part of our job as Hunter\u2019s? To make people better and give them confidence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe trick is they have to want to get better and want to gain confidence themselves. I can\u2019t just give it to them like handing out a piece of candy. So in the end I did nothing at all. They did it all themselves.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I suppose. I\u2019ll admit I was impressed though. At first I was tempted to jump back in and help but then I decided to see what you could do. Get a feel for your combat ability. I didn\u2019t think you would have much trouble, but if you needed a hand because the rest of the group couldn\u2019t handle it I was ready to help. Honestly I thought for sure you would need at least one dismemberment and reconstruction phase before taking it down with those guys. I guess that shows the difference in skill between us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOr it just shows that those four were better then you thought they were to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps you\u2019re right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe lapsed into another bout of silence as we continued to watch the action below. Finally the bell rang and we went our separate ways. Next period would be History, and then Monster Tactics. Once that was done with, this day would finally be over. I couldn\u2019t wait, I was really ready to go home. Or at least to get out of here.</span></div></div>",

That is the power of Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang, signaling the end of class and the teacher told everyone to study the chapter before leaving. Even before he was completely out the door, seven kids were converging on me. I closed my eyes for a moment as I mentally prepared myself. I had been expecting this ever since my sister had showed up. I hoped I didn\u2019t have to be too rude to get them to go away, but I had a feeling I might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm, I\u2019d like to thank you. The way you led your group against that Kloo made me more confident in myself and showed me how to be a better leader.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at the girl in surprise as she blushed a bit and gave me a small bow of her head. I hadn\u2019t been expecting that. I thought for sure the first thing out of anyone\u2019s lips would be empty words of some kind as they tried to get in my good graces. But I could tell she was being sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you are the leader, or at least the one belting out the orders, the biggest thing to keep in mind is everyone is depending on you. Whether you know what you are doing or not, you have to make them believe you know what you are doing. Using weak commands like could you cast this spell or would you be able to do this, makes them unsure. It makes you look ineffectual. You tell them to do what you want, even if you don\u2019t know if they can do it or not. And those you are leading will rise to that challenge instinctively.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere will be times as Hunter\u2019s where you will have to lead common everyday people. Perhaps to fight against some low level monsters like gremlins because you are the only one there. They don\u2019t have the training or the skill you do. They may never have fought even the weakest of monsters before. They will be scared and rightfully so. If you are unsure of yourself in that situation, how do you think they will feel? You issue orders with confidence and take command of the situation. Do that and you will minimize the number of lives that are lost.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head while getting a thoughtful look on her face even as the rest of the group began saying how amazing I had been and saying things more in line with what I had been expecting. Fortunately the teacher came in before I got too annoyed and ready to blow up at them. It took a few moments to do roll call before he began his lesson on the Cawmacaw. He didn\u2019t get very far into the lesson though when the door opened and a woman in a blue business suite walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer black hair glistened slightly under the light and was done up in a tidy ponytail. I noticed she wore a subtle pink lipstick and wore a pair of dark blue high heels that complimented her suit. She whispered a few words to the teacher and he nodded his head, pointing in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! Your mother wants to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let out a sigh as I picked up my bag and slung it on my shoulder. What could she want with me this time? What could be so important she had come to school with one of her aides? It could just be one of her whims, something so unimportant as to be negligible. Like what color dress she should wear. More than likely though it was to tell me she was going off on another job. She had come home last night and she had been here at least eight hours. It was time for her to leave again after all. Rarely did she seem to spend more than ten or twelve hours at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Inga by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I just started working for your mother yesterday.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell no offense but start looking for another job now. That way when she fires you for whatever stupid reason you won\u2019t be floundering around. Aside from Hilda, the longest I\u2019ve seen her keep an aide is about two months. Their hair isn\u2019t the right color, their teeth don\u2019t sparkle when they smile, they don\u2019t wear the right brand of perfume. It\u2019s always some small reason like that and you never know until she fires you. Just a bit of friendly advice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind but you\u2019re just a child. You don\u2019t understand how business works. I don\u2019t think she will do that to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s what the last four said as well. And yet you stand here before me and not them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me one of those patronizing smiles as if I was some unenlightened boy that didn\u2018t know how the world worked. Saying without words that I would understand when I grew up. Well I had tried to warn her. It wouldn\u2019t be my fault when my mother cast her aside and left her sitting in the middle of a battlefield half the world away with no way to get home. She opened the door for me and I slipped inside, dropping my bag next to the table before going to stare out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe room itself was unremarkable. Probably used for student council meetings or something like that. Just a single rectangular table with six chairs around it. A few bookcases with reference material along the walls and a single window across from the door. It was on the first floor and the window looked out over the track and field area where even now there were kids working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA moment later the door opened again, admitting my mother and a petite little girl who couldn\u2019t be more than four and a half feet tall. She had a vacant look in her scarlet colored eyes as my mother pulled the girl into the room after her. A tattered teddy bear pressed against her chest seemed to be in slightly better shape then her tattered green dress. Her shoes were also worn and dirty, just this side of being worn out while looking slightly too small for her feet. Even her pure white hair was a bit dirty and tangled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen my mother dropped the girls hand to come over to me I noted how the girl just stopped in her tracks and stood staring at nothing. As if she were some machine who\u2019s batteries had died.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tRiktal darling! How are you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother embraced me, kissing both my cheeks before letting me go. I simply put up with it, waiting for her to get to the reason she wanted me. Guiding the child to a chair at the table she motioned for me to sit as well. I ignored the invitation, leaning against the wall next to the window with my arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you want mother? Can\u2019t decide what hair ornament looks prettier on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo, no. Nothing like that. Do you really think I would call you here for such a trifling thing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wound me darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken here. Can\u2019t you see the tears? So if it\u2019s not a trifling thing then what is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI need your help. I have to go away again on a job and I need you to protect this little girl. Your father finished his other job early and will be coming with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you want me to take on this job as a Hunter, even though you won\u2019t let me take the exams to get my license as one is that it? How very typical of you. Why did you think I would be interested in a job like this at all? Unless the payment is you letting me take the tests then I\u2019m not interested. Find someone else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t Pushing myself away from the wall I picked up my bag and headed towards the door, ignoring my mother's plea\u2019s for me to wait. Before I left I looked over at Inga who was trying to blend into the wall like a good aide should. I felt I had to try one last time to warn her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRemember this Inga. This is just the way my mother is. She uses people and discards them as she sees fit. Trying to mold everyone and everything to her liking. If she is willing to treat her own son in such a fashion what makes you think you are any safer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the slight worry in the woman\u2019s eyes as I opened the door and left. Good, perhaps I could save one person from my mother\u2019s uncaring whims. I turned right and walked down the hall, stopping at the corner where it shot off in another direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you like what you heard?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe? I heard nothing. I\u2019m just an old woman who happened to get tired of pushing herself around and rested a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRight. I\u2019ll let you think I believed that. I\u2019m not in the mood to play games right now. Good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHold on Riktal. Would you mind walking with me for a bit? Keep an old woman company and listen to her ramble on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked over at the principal sitting there in her wheelchair smiling at me. It was a genuine smile, one that reached her eyes. I looked back at the room where my mother still was and then down the hall towards the stairwell back up to my classroom before returning my gaze to her. I had no doubt she would try to guilt me into taking the job. I also didn't doubt she could probably pull it off where my mother couldn't.</span></div></div>",

You are going to try and guilt me into accepting the job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf that\u2019s what you think then why did you decide to walk with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe I want to be guilted into taking the job so I can feel better about myself knowing it wasn\u2019t my mother I caved into this time. Or perhaps it\u2019s because you asked politely and I had no real reason to refuse you. Then again it could also be because I didn\u2019t feel like going back to class. Take your pick. I won\u2019t guarantee any of those are the truth though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe old lady chuckled as she pushed the door open and we went outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat sounds like something Marian would say. But I would like you to listen to a story about a guy I once knew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be one of those stories that is actually about you that you simply changed the gender and the name of is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. though I am in the story. This happened a very long time ago. Back when I was still a student at this school. In fact I was around the age you are now. I was quite popular with the boys. They all vied for my attention not because I came from an old family, though I did have a bit of wealth to my name. but because I was quite the looker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAmong those trying to win me over was a boy named Ivan. He was a shy boy with a bit of a stutter. Always blushing when he talked to me. I actually thought it was kind of cute and was secretly fond of him because of his personality. But the other boys picked on him because he was a first generation from a small town with little money to his name. And because of his timid demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI could have stopped it. A few words from me and they would have all listened because they didn\u2019t want to lose my favor. But I didn\u2019t. Not because I thought he deserved to be picked on or anything like that. No it was a very selfish reason. It was because I liked the attention. I liked having the boys fighting over me. Seeing them all get jealous when one of them looked like they were getting ahead. If I had put a stop to their bullying, I would have lost a few of those admirers and some of that infighting between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne day he came into class slightly late. He opened the door and began firing a gun into the room. He killed ten of my classmates, most of them innocent girls that had never bullied him at all, though he killed a few of the boys as well. He continued to rampage until he was finally taken down. In the end he shot himself instead of having to endure living anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTo this day I wonder if he would have ended up that way if I had said just a few simple words instead of letting my vanity get the best of me. What kind of Hunter would he have become? How many people would he have saved? How much of this world could he have changed if I had stepped in and helped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRegrets are what eat away at the soul. Could have, should have, would have. People spend their lives regretting. Sometimes those regrets consume them. Keeping them from moving forward, or causing them to make yet more bad choices in an attempt to fix the mistakes they made. It can become an endless inward spiral that ends in self destruction if you let it. That\u2019s why as humans we try to live each day without regrets. But as Hunter\u2019s that\u2018s even more true. Because those things we end up regretting can end up destroying lives and even cities. As Hunter\u2019s we have the power and ability to topple nations with both our good and bad choices. The only difference is the outcome of those actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou led a group against a Kloo earlier did you not? That was a choice you made. The consequence of that is everyone in the class became better Hunter\u2019s. I\u2019m sure you do not regret that choice. But if you had not acted as you did when you did? The Arena Master would have stepped in, but some of them would have been seriously hurt or killed. If that had happened I\u2019m sure you would have regretted your inaction. Feeling you were not worthy of being a Hunter since you simply stood on the sidelines when innocent people were in danger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou seem to have eyes and ears everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA cat came out of nowhere and jumped into her lap. It settled down and began to purr as she petted it absently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m the principal, It\u2019s my job to know everything that goes on in this school. From the porn magazines the boys sneak in and trade with each other to the cigarettes the girls smoke in the bathroom. The trick is to figure out what\u2019s the most important out of all the information I know and acting on it to make this school better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really aren\u2019t doing a very good job of convincing me to take this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never said I was going to. That was just what you assumed. If you take it or not is up to you, not me. You just have to ask yourself if you can live with the consequences of your choice. It doesn\u2019t matter the reason you make that choice, just if you can live with it. Good day Riktal. Thank you for chatting with an old woman.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe spun around and wheeled herself off in the opposite direction, leaving me standing there watching her depart. Finally I turned and headed around the corner of the building just in time to see my mother, Inga and the little girl walking out the front doors. I glanced back at the bit of schoolyard behind me where the principal was out of sight before grinning and shaking my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had been played and played masterfully. I hadn\u2019t even realized I had been played until it was too late. I had even been on the alert for her guilt tripping. In the end I had tripped up myself. Looking at that little girl now there was no way I could turn my back on her. Even to simply spite my mother. I would regret not taking the job. With the grin still on my face I hurried to catch my mother before she could leave. Even without a license I was still a Hunter. And Hunter\u2019s protected the weak and the innocent above all else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo we come to the end of the day it seems. How would he treat the girl? How would the day have gone if he had taken a different course? Those are answers to be found and decided on a different day, a different path. Perhaps though such answer\u2019s aren\u2019t the full truth. For they are not the same as this moment, just as this moment is not the same as the next. Words of happiness and words of sorrow. Sometimes they are the same words, simply uttered from different lips or in a different tone. Love and hate as they say are sometimes as different as the opposite sides of a piece of paper. So why too cannot the possibilities of the choices we make?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoin me again traveler of the realms of in-between. We shall again delve into the depths of young Riktal\u2019s mind and see what fate awaits him by your hand.</span></div></div>",

I have a good idea what you are about and I have no intention of accepting that job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfraid I\u2019ll talk you into doing something you don\u2019t want to do?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know better than that. A Hunter makes his or her own choices. No one talks them into doing anything they aren\u2019t inclined to do already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen what are you afraid of?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll make taking that job seem reasonable and right. So the only choice I feel I have is to take it. You\u2019ve got quite a few years on me after all and I am sure you are much better at this kind of guilt tripping thing than my mother is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWouldn\u2019t you say that would be the same thing as talking you into it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps. It\u2019s all a matter of perspective. At least right now I feel I have a choice. If I go with you  that choice to say no will make me feel so horrible about myself that it becomes no choice at all. Now good day principal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left her there, heading towards the stairs without looking back. Perhaps I was making a mistake. Perhaps I was letting  my feelings for my mother color the choices I was making. But I was tired of playing her games. Tired of being jerked around by her whims. She had never had time for me as a son, so why should I find time to act like one? I had already had to put up with big sis being all over me today, I didn\u2019t need to deal with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlipping back into the classroom I settled myself in my chair and listened with only half an ear until the class was over. It was nothing new to me, but it was mind numbing at least. That\u2019s all I wanted was dull and monotonous to push the thoughts from my mind. As people began to converge on me again I picked up my bag, slipping both arms through the straps and hiking it onto my back. Without a word I pushed through the crowd and headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was so stupid. Why did I even have to come to this school? There was nothing for me here really. I should be out killing monsters, not playing schoolboy with a bunch of boys and girls that still thought they were in a regular high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLost in my own thoughts I ran into a boy with blue dyed hair on my way out the school gates. He stopped me with a hand on my arm saying I should apologize. I did so absently as I pulled my arm out of his grip and kept walking. Apparently this only seemed to egg him on even more as him and two of his cronies surrounded me. So he was looking for trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think you really meant that. Say it again with more feeling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked into his eyes and smiled before bringing  my fist up into his gut. As he doubled over I jumped, grabbing his neck between my legs and flipping forwards over his back. Lifting him off his feet and throwing him end over end onto the sidewalk in front of me a good three feet. He bounced a few times and I saw his head smack the pavement as he laid still. I finished my front flip on my feet, walking over to him where he was laying dizzily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I walked passed him and kept going. It seems you found bullies everywhere, And they were always stupid it seemed. I was more than happy to put them all in their places though. They were supposed to be Hunter\u2019s, people who protected the weak. Not ones that picked on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough I came to the crossroads. If I went right I could go home. If I went left I could go into the main part of the city. There was nothing at home for me right now except silence and the sounds of an old house. I would have to make my own dinner again too. The city didn\u2019t have much for me either. I could eat out at a diner, maybe go to a bookstore or something. But otherwise I\u2019d just walk around.</span></div></div>",

What was the use of going into town and trying to pretend to enjoy myself? Who would I be pretending for anyway? I had been brought up to be a Hunter. That was the only thing I knew. I hadn\u2019t been brought up to be normal like everyone else. To find pleasure in doing extravagant things like hang out with friends or play video games at the arcade. The only books I read dealt with aspects of hunting and monster slaying, not comics and silly fantasies.  So there was no point in trying to learn to have fun now. That opportunity passed me by years ago. Just like any chance to be normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t take long to walk home and unlock the spell on the front door. Absently I made three marks on the calendar like I did every day before heading to the kitchen to make myself a snack. I threw a bowl of instant noodles in the microwave before going through the house turning on the TV\u2019s and the radios just to hear something other then the silence. After sitting down and eating my meal I headed to the living room and put on some random sitcom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wasn\u2019t really interested in the show of course, but it was something to do. Who knows, maybe one of these days I would get interested in one of them and actually start following it. The words and the fake canned laughter began to blend together as my eyes slowly became heavy. I let out a yawn as I closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood night.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs always, the only one that answered me back was the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCause and affect. Choice and consequence. So ends Riktal\u2019s first day. What choices influenced his thinking for each decision he made? Perhaps there was no one specific thing. Perhaps it was simply the collection of all the random happenings he experienced. How much differently would things have turned out if even one of those random series of events had fallen into place just a fraction differently? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat if he had fought the monster alone? Or with Liz? Would that have changed how he approached the meeting with his mother? Or are the two events completely unrelated?  Did you enjoy being a god? Would you choose differently if given the chance? We shall see the next time we meet shall we not? Until then, may you find the choices you make are the choices you truly wish for.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tScrew it, let\u2019s go to town. If it came down to a choice between being alone at home doing nothing and being alone in town doing nothing, might as well choose the town. At least there I might potentially find something interesting. Even if I had no desire to go to the arcade or do anything normal kids might do, there was still more things to do in town than sitting at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo I walked. Ambling along watching the cars driving by and the kids from the regular high school chatting with friends and joking with them. They all acted so unconcerned about monster attacks. I knew they were actually worried about such things, but they didn\u2019t let that stop them form enjoying themselves. They all had a sure belief that the Hunter\u2019s of the city would protect them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I came around the corner by the river I saw the plaque sitting next to a small stretch of wall that connected to nothing. I had read the little metal sign before. It told how that piece of wall used to be the outer section of the city a long time ago. Back before spells had been invented and perfected that were able to keep monsters out. Before the invention of the automobile and people walked everyplace. Towns had been protected by walls and were much smaller than they were today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut time passed and like all things the city grew. The walls were torn down to expand outwards past the previously safe zones. Technology advanced and humans found it too much trouble to erect yet more walls just to tear them down again later. The spells around the outskirts did their job most of the time, though on the whole it only kept the really strong monsters away. The weaker ones seemed to slip through the cracks. But humans adapted to that as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe secret though to this was the town or city could only grow as big as the Hunter\u2019s who lived their. The spells were powered by those Hunter\u2019s, so the more in a town the stronger the barriers. This made it harder for smaller towns and cities with only one or two Hunter\u2019s to survive. Unless those Hunter\u2019s were extremely strong. Though if that was the case they would most likely move to the bigger cities where there was more work for them. It wasn\u2019t a perfect system, no system was. But it worked and so we maintained it until we found a new more efficient system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I passed a store I saw a teddy bear hair comb in the window that reminded me of that little girl from earlier. I don\u2019t know what made me go inside and buy it exactly, perhaps it was just a whim because it reminded me of her. I stuck it in my bag and continued on, entering a family restaurant called Hearty\u2019s. I placed my order and set my bag down at the table, placing a small spell on it to deter thieves before going to the bathroom. I had learned my lesson from earlier. After washing my hands and exiting into the small hallway separating the toilets from the main part of the diner I heard a familiar voice from up ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201c\u2026.He wouldn\u2019t even listen to me would you believe that honey? He simply walked out of the room without letting me explain anything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell can you really blame him? Your explanations usually end up making him angry at you. I\u2019ve told you before keeping him in the dark about everything was going to come back to bite you. You toss him in that school without any explanation. You tell him he can\u2019t take the Exams without a reason. And if we are honest, we haven\u2019t been very good parents. Always leaving within hours of coming home. We know the reasons why but he doesn\u2019t. He simply thinks we are putting our jobs ahead of him. And in one respect he is right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHurry up and start eating already Asala. You won\u2019t get anything later if you get hungry. Damn that Pelei for not taking her anyway. Now what am I going to do? I can\u2019t take her with us. And there is no other Hunter\u2019s I can trust because of what she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps if you actually leveled with Riktal and told him some of the why\u2019s of things he might be willing to take her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh yes that would go over well. Riktal darling, I sent you to that school because Val asked for help. I also sent you there because we raised you to be nothing but a Hunter. I want you to be more like a regular boy. I thought sending you there to interact with people your own age would show you there is more to life than being a Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOr how about, Riktal honey, the reason I don\u2019t want you taking the Hunter\u2019s exams is because the union has become corrupted. Forcing all new Hunter\u2019s to serve the military for at least a year if they want their license. Your sister became a Hunter so she could work from the inside trying to purge the corruption. Me and your father keep leaving lately because we are having secret meetings with other countries and making deals to overthrow the current union so you don\u2019t have to deal with it later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t forget that you worry about him and are overprotective of him since Olia died. Or the fact that it makes you feel secure knowing he is there when you come home after being away for weeks at a time. Or the fact that you don\u2019t want him to grow up because you are regretful that you weren\u2019t a mother to him before so are trying to make up for it now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s just my own personal desires. We taught him to be logical about his decisions. That personal desires have no place in being a Hunter. He would just wave his hand and call it useless information. If he even believed anything I said that is. You know I was never really good with kids. All that crying and clinging. I just didn\u2019t understand them. And why is she not eating. Just between you and me she kind of gives me the creeps the way she is always staring blankly and doesn\u2019t move or react on her own. I don\u2019t even think she can hear us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal always was better at this kind of thing then you were dear. I might have been around a little more than you were but not by much. But when I was, you should have seen the way he treated Olia. He had a real knack for it. Though for the life of me I don\u2019t know how since neither one of us were good role models.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe sad thing is growing up I told myself I would be nothing like my mother. Now look at me, I\u2019m almost a carbon copy. Leaving my children to run of to this or that place. Letting other people raise and deal with them and then trying to get back into their lives after they are all grown up. Lying and scheming and manipulating even my own children because I think its for the best. I really am a terrible mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really should sit down and tell Riktal all of this. He would probably get mad at first but I am sure he would understand. He is a Hunter and a Zelkov after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to me anymore. It\u2019s too late for any of that. I think I finally pushed him too far today. Just like my mother eventually pushed me too far.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left my hiding spot then and came to stand next to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how well I could take the truth mother. You\u2019d also be surprised at how much leeway I\u2019m willing to grant when I get it. As you said. You raised me to be a Hunter. So why shouldn\u2019t I be able to think logically about the reasons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother and father both looked up at me with a bit of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you doing here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI came in to eat after school. I didn\u2019t feel like going back to that empty house quite yet. I just used the restroom and happened to overhear your conversation on my way out. I\u2018m actually surprised I didn\u2018t see you on the way past.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked down at the girl who sat like a statue staring straight ahead, a plate of untouched food in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are quite horrible with children though. Have you even tried to get to know her? Maybe she doesn\u2019t like this food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did but she doesn\u2019t talk. She doesn\u2019t do anything. Just stares off into the distance all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s because she is scared. Think about it. Something happened to her. I don\u2019t know what but she wouldn\u2019t have run away into her head without a good reason. I bet she\u2019s been yanked around from place to place without a by-your-leave or a care for how she is feeling. Going to places she probably has never seen before and meeting who knows how many strangers. The reason you don\u2019t understand children mother is because you never tried to understand them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knelt on the floor next to the girl, picking up her right hand in mine as I tuned out the world around me. Ignored my mother and father sitting inches away. Ignored the waitresses and the few other customers. I focused all my attention on the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHello. So your name is Asala is that right? I know you must be pretty scared, I\u2019d be scared too if I was in your shoes. I bet it doesn\u2019t help that my mother was yanking you all around and talking about you over your head like you can\u2019t here her. Well maybe you can\u2019t. But I think you can. You might not react to it and it might be part of the reason you are shutting yourself down, but I still think you can hear every word I am saying. Do you want to know why I think that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI reached out and gently grabbed a hold of the bear, beginning to pull it away. Her grip tightened on it as I smiled and let it go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you are holding onto that bear like it is a lifeline. You\u2019ve been carrying it around with you all this time. That takes muscle control. If you had really shut down it would have fallen long ago. You recognized my hand trying to take it away so you naturally tightened your grip on it. If you can do that I\u2019d also wager a chunk of chocolate you can hear me. So why don\u2019t we start off with something small. Just a yes or no shake of the head. Do you like bears?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe just sat there for the longest time before her head dipped down and back up slowly. I patted her arm gently as I stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait right here a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped over to my bag and pulled out the comb I had just bought.</span></div></div>",

Perhaps it was destiny telling me that I was going to see you again. But you want to know something? I really don\u2019t think it would look good in my hair. I mean could you imagine this thing sticking out of this red head of mine. I think it would just look silly. But I think this ivory color would fit your hair quite nicely. Maybe even help you get the tangles out of it huh? I bet that bear is the only thing you have to your name aside from the dress.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked both ways before leaning in conspiratorially. Just between you and me, I think it is pretty fugly. I bet if you vomited all over it that would actually make it look better. So how about I make you a deal. You chose something from the menu, anything at all. You don\u2019t have to say a word, just pointing will be fine. You eat it while wearing this comb and then afterwards I\u2019ll take you out to do a bit of shopping. Get you a few nice dresses, some new shoes, a few frivolous items that might catch your fancy. Because I tell you true, I never met a girl yet that didn\u2019t like a bit of shopping and making herself look pretty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI raised my right eyebrow while narrowing my left eye, puckering my lips and looking at her sideways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aint one of those screamers are you? You know the ones. They put their hands up to their faces and go eeek! And say things like \u201csoooo cute!\u201d Over every little thing. Because you look like your are a talkative one. You look like it might be hard to shut you up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her lips twitch and knew I was making progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait I said I\u2019d make you a deal. That\u2019s about exchange isn\u2019t it? You do something and I get something in return. So what should I ask of you for all of that huh? For me spending all that money and time on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI rubbed my chin while looking upwards as if deep in thought. I let my eyes go wide as a grin spread from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAha! I know. I want you to have some fun. I want you to enjoy the food and the clothes that I buy for you and use them. Because you see. it\u2019s ok to be sad or afraid or angry or whatever you feel like being. But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t enjoy stuff to. Between you and me, I enjoy a good massage every now and again, though don\u2019t tell my parents. I think they think I\u2019m too stuffy and don\u2019t know how to have a good time and I don\u2019t want to disabuse them of that notion. So do you think we can make that deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held out my hand in front of her. She slowly blinked at me a few times before finally shaking it. I gave her another lopsided grin before sticking the comb in her long hair over her ear. She reached up and touched it hesitantly as I nodded my head and asked the waitress for a menu. Soon enough she had pointed out what she wanted and I had it ordered, returning to my table for only a moment to grab my bag and return to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer food came along with mine and she began to eat, slowly at first and then with a bit more zest as I slid into the booth next to my father and stared at my mother while cutting into my steak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou just have to know how to talk to them. You don\u2019t need to talk down to them or act like they are complete idiots, simply explain things to them so they can understand. Let them know that you know where they are coming from. Even if you might not know what they are feeling personally you can identify with it. That\u2019s the biggest thing they need most of the time. So what might I need to know about this girls background so I can avoid any major pitfalls. I don\u2019t want to say something that will send her back into her little world again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI took a bite of my food as my mother stared at me like I had grown a second head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t believe it. Your father always told me you were good with kids but I never really believed. You are the first person to get her to show any signs of life or intelligence in the last three days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. Anyone can do it if they had simply taken some time out of running around worrying about their own problems and their own lives to worry about hers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy dad chuckled, clapping me on the shoulder before looking at my mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you Marian, Riktal might surprise you if you just level with him a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy dad leaned over closer to me and said in a whisper loud enough for the two across from us to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBy the way your secrets out. I like a good massage myself sometimes. Though I go to a special parlor that gives a few special treatments if you know what I mean. Just don\u2019t tell your mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I stuck some mashed potatoes in my moth as he gave another chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThough nothing like you are thinking. Just a few extra techniques and a bit of eye candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI began to chuckle too as the girls eyes looked from my father to me in puzzlement and my mother glared at the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps you can show me this parlor sometime dad.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRomone, don\u2019t you dare!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two of us began to laugh a bit louder as my father made some calming gestures with his hands. My mother gave him another stink eye before harrumphing and crossing her arms. The moment she looked away he gave me a quick wink an mouthed the word later. As I continued to eat my mother finally filled me in on what she knew of the girl. By the time I was finished the girl was smiling a bit at the random jokes I made and at the funny faces I shot her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you ready to go Asala? I know a few good clothing stores that won\u2019t be crowded at this time of day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head a bit enthusiastically, getting up when I did. I paid the bill and offered her my hand after picking up my bag, she took it without hesitation. Before I turned to leave though I looked between my mother and father, making sure I had their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI only have one requirement for taking this job. Both of you have to stay home tonight. I want to have a long chat with you before you leave in private.. Plus, just like you feel better knowing you have someone waiting for you at home after a long job, I get tired of being alone in that house all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think we can manage that son. We will just have to catch an early flight in the morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head to both of them before leading Asala out of the diner. For the first time in a while I had the feeling I might just be able to have something resembling a normal life like other kids had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhat a twisted web of fate. Lives come together and part again. Touching and changing with every little interaction. A million and one ways this could have all played out and a million and one directions he could have gone.  What choices decided this course? Was it the very first choice you made this day? Did it start from listening to the boy in the locker room? Perhaps neither of these incidents had any affect on how this all turned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome see me again if you wish to play god. To create a destiny and to deny the other possibilities this life could have taken.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cCan this wait until later? I\u2019m really not in the mood to deal with anything right now. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s important but if it\u2019s bad news or you just trying to get close to me for your own personal reasons I don\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook a little anxiously but finally nodded his head and left the room, leaving me to do a few breathing exercises to calm down. I had at least gotten the Lexington back. Now I just had to worry about the Roller Knuckles. I hoped whoever had stolen them wasn\u2019t stupid enough to use them. It took a certain level of skill in regulating the flow of energy through the body and into the weapons to keep them from destroying the person wearing them. At the skill level these guys were at it could vibrate bones into spontaneously breaking or even turning to dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAnyone of a B class or higher would have no problems with them, Gregory had been lucky he had only taken and tried to use the Lexington. The only dangerous part about it was that kickback if you didn\u2019t have the proper stance or locked your arm while firing. They just had to take the two most dangerous weapons in my arsenal didn\u2019t they? Any of the other weapons would have been well within their skill level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith another sigh I rubbed my eyes again before running my fingers through my orange hair. No use worrying about what had already happened. I needed to get back to class, perhaps I could find some clue as to who had taken my Knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting back down next to Liz we watched the action below in silence. I noted how everyone had tightened up their fighting style while their teamwork and reaction times had also improved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLiz, you know anyone down there that might take a dangerous weapon from someone else\u2019s bag aside from Gregory? Maybe some of his friends?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMissing something else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. Some fist weapons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell just about a third of the people down there are fist oriented fighters among other things. Only Daniel and a few others are specialized in that area. I\u2019d say any one of them is capable of thievery under the right circumstances. Well maybe not Lilia because she is a priestess. Probably not Jethic either since he has a pretty high moral code. Even though Daniel is a fist specialist I doubt it would be him because he\u2019d be afraid of retribution from anyone he stole from. He has a pretty good code of ethics as well on top of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs for friends, I really don\u2019t pay that much attention to the alliances and relationships going on. From what I\u2019ve seen he has one of those smooth tongues that lets him fit in with almost everybody. You know the type, friendly with all but being friends with none. Gregory is only out for Gregory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlancing down at the floor as a group took on a Screecher I nodded my head. I knew the type well. My mother was that type.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSpeaking of the little thief, where is he?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master banned him for a month before sending him to the principal for punishment. He might have been ahead of everyone else but when he comes back he will be playing catch up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe pointed at the groups below with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou did all that. Made them better I mean. They are all trying to emulate what you and your group did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything. They wanted to change themselves. I just did what a Hunter does. They are the ones that took something from it, I didn\u2019t say or do anything special.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was silent a moment, staring off at the arena floor but not really seeing anything. Finally she spoke without looking at me, her hands clasped in front of her and her voice a touch softer than normal<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m ashamed to say you are a better Hunter than me. I don\u2019t just mean combat wise. I don\u2019t know how well I\u2019d stack up against you in a head to head honestly. But in how you reacted. If it was me alone I wouldn\u2019t have done anything. I would have simply sat and let the Arena Master take care of it. The only reason I jumped up and did anything was because you leapt into action. I just sort of followed you without thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe way you handled the situation impressed me. You were able to pull them together into a combat team to take on something way out of their league normally with only minimal help from you. I don\u2019t think I could have done that either. Not because I didn\u2019t know what to do, but because I can\u2019t give off that same level of confidence and command you did. Plus I think my prior standing in the class might have harmed my credibility.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn all honesty watching you out there was admittedly kind of hot. Sexy even. It got my blood boiling with a desire to fight you myself. To want to raise my own game up to those standards. So you had better watch out. I don\u2019t plan on sitting on the sidelines and letting you take all the glory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked over and gave me a lopsided grin then which I returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA rival huh? I haven\u2019t had one of those for a while. I think I might like the challenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued to watch the action below, pointing out flaws or gaps in their strategy and movements until the bell rang. Picking up my bag from the locker I headed to the classroom. Next was History, and then Monster Tactics. After that school would be over for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched as my classmates filed into the room. I had been the first one in which didn\u2019t seem so surprising. They all gave me speculative glances. Some of them with a bit of starry eyed hero worship tinting their gaze. Others with the hungry look of starving wolves. I could already see some of the girls whispering to each other as they looked my way before letting out little giggles. So now the power struggles and the alliance making as they all tried to get close to me would really begin. I had shown them some of what I could do and they all wanted to be a part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tClass dragged on as I only paid it half a mind. Nothing being taught was new to me or even very interesting. I simply let my mind wander where it would. Before I knew it the bell was ringing to signal the end of class. It actually caught me slightly unaware so I didn\u2019t notice the four girls and four boys converging until they were all standing in front of me. I glanced over at Liz who simply grinned and stuck out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI really didn\u2019t feel like being very sociable, but I couldn\u2019t completely alienate them either. Even if I thought little of them now, they were future contacts and potential business partners. Should I just bite the bullet and interact with them or should I deflect until another day?</span></div></div>",

It was good manners to let potential business partners and contacts know you recognize them as an individual and not just as part of the mob. It was a small thing but it went a long way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for the compliment. Perhaps if I feel like it I can show you a thing or two but no promises. If you pay attention in class you will learn all you need to know. No I am not seeing anyone and I am not interested in seeing anyone. My favorite weapon of choice would have to be whatever I can get my hands on. I was trained to be proficient with everything so I have no particular favorite weapon, nor do I have a set fighting style like a specialized fighter. I\u2019m just an all rounder who uses foundations from everything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOne girl came up hesitantly, fidgeting a bit with her hands clasped together in front of her. She pushed her way through the crowd while blushing slightly and looking down. I could see the look of veiled disgust and jealousy on the other girls faces as I turned my attention to her. As if she had somehow stolen the spotlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm Mr. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCall me Riktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUm, Riktal. I  wanted to thank you for showing me how to be a better leader. I\u2019m a gunner but I\u2019m not really good at giving orders. But watching you out there today was really amazing. The way you seemed so confident and how you just told them what to do so naturally. I- I want to be able to do that too. So I hope you will lead some of us again so I can learn some more.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was surprised. She was being sincere. There was a subtle difference between her words and the words of praise the other ones were giving me. Anyone good at reading body language could tell the difference in the inflection among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cV-Victoria Raz.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell let me tell you something Victoria. Mind if I call you Victoria by the way? The secret to being a good party leader is always acting like you know what you are doing and what is going on. Don\u2019t be wishy-washy with your commands period. And if you aren\u2019t the one calling the orders out, don\u2019t be afraid to speak up and countermand bad orders if you know they are wrong. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to know running headlong at an Ooze type monster with a sword isn\u2019t the best idea. Tell you what. I\u2019ll see if I can work something out with the Arena Master to help you get some experience at leading. Maybe a group of me, you, and one or two others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cT-thank you! I\u2019d like that a lot!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBefore anyone else could get anything out the teacher came in and did role call. Before he got too far into his lesson though a woman in a smart looking blue business suit, black hair and slightly heavy on the deep blue eyeliner came into the room and whispered with the teacher. Moment\u2019s later I was following her out the door with my bag of weapons to go see my mother who had summoned me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy name is Inga by the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grunted. Not really caring what her name was. This would probably be the last time I saw her anyway. I had used up most of my sociability on the kids in my class, I didn\u2019t need to be nice to this woman. She was of no consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe led me downstairs to a drab meeting room with a single table, a few shelves with books on them and a window. Nothing to mark it as different or special from any of a hundred schools. Sitting at the table I clasped my hands in front of me while I waited. Just what did she want? It had better be important because I wasn\u2019t in the mood for her games.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe came waltzing into the room as if she didn\u2019t have a care in the world, pulling a pretty silver haired child with eyes to match my hair behind her. I suffered through her greeting while studying the kid. Noting the teddy bear she clutched and the ragged state of her clothes. My first impression was of a marionette doll. A four and a half foot puppet that only moved when someone pulled the strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk now that you are here you can get to the point mother. I\u2019m sure you want to go running off to some other important place that is anywhere but here. I\u2019ll even make it quick for you too. My guess is you want me to take care of that girl for you because you are horrible with kids. That\u2019s the only reason you would have her with you. No doubt you even had some sob story prepared. You came to me because you always seem to come to me when you want something done for free or for cheap. You know I am a strong Hunter and you think I will do it because I am family. Does that about cover it in a nutshell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wish you weren\u2019t so hostile towards me but yes that about covers it. So you\u2019ll do it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never said that. I was just verifying the facts I had assumed. I\u2019ll give you two guesses as to what my answer will be and one of them isn\u2019t yes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother looked at me at a loss for words, her mouth opening and closing and a smiled thinly because I had gotten one over on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI bet you have no idea why that\u2019s my answer either. And that mother, is the problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up then, picking my weapons back up as I headed towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m done being your tool mother. I\u2019m done catering to your whims like you treating me as a licensed Hunter one moment and denying me the ability to get that license the next. I\u2019ve come to a revelation just now thanks to you. As if everything just became crystal clear on seeing your revolting face in front of me. I\u2019m quitting this school. I\u2019m taking the Exams. And then I am moving out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m getting rid of the family name and washing my hands of you and father and even big sis. I\u2019ll be a no name person from a no name family. Simply Riktal and nothing else. I will move far, far away and never look back. I\u2019ll make my own fortune and my own name without riding on your coat-tails. No more arranged marriage meetings, no more getting the short end of the stick. No more listening to a big old house creek and groan all night long while I am the only one in it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I don\u2019t need you or any of it. I haven\u2019t for a very long time. Almost as long as it\u2019s been since I really thought of you as a mother and not more than just a word I pay lip service to. Normally I can\u2019t help but get angry at you every time I see you. You make me rage and my blood boil. But not this time. It\u2019s not worth it. You\u2019ve never been worth it. So goodbye. This will most likely be the last time we see each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I opened the door her soft words reached my ears. There was something in their tone that made me stop and turn to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hated you too. I hated that you were everything I wasn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know how to be a mother. I was never good with kids from the start. All the crying and the need for constant attention. I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. So I threw myself into being a Hunter. I treated you like a fully grown Hunter all the time because that\u2019s the only way I knew how to deal with you. I felt awkward holding you or pretending your drawings made sense to me. Awkward at hearing those random I love you\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen when I was home I saw how you and Olia were together and I admit I was jealous. I didn\u2019t know how you were able to treat her the way I couldn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know where you had learned it from. I felt like she had somehow been stolen from me. And so I grew to hate you for being able to accomplish what I couldn\u2019t. But I have also never been so proud of you either. Because despite my failings both as a mother and as a person, you turned out as well as you did. You were able to surpass me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow you are older and it\u2019s too late for me to change the past. I\u2019m stuck in this rut where I only know one way to deal with you still. I want to change that. I try to change that. But I still feel fake. And I see how you don\u2019t believe me or trust me. How you scrutinize every word and tear it into little pieces. You\u2019re no longer of the age where you will accept what I say as truth or are satisfied if I don\u2019t give you every detail of my reasons. Yet at the same time I can\u2019t give you all those reasons because I am afraid it will make you hate me more. I know things must have been hard on you. Living alone in that house for so long day after day. But I really do appreciate being able to come home and someone is there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe clasped her hands on the table and looked down at them. I saw a drop of water fall on her skin from her covered eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t walk out on me like this. I know I\u2019m a terrible mother. But I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sounded sincere. But she was also a great actress when she needed to be in order to get what she wanted. Hadn\u2019t seventeen years of dealing with her proved she was a user and abuser? Only out for herself and willing to do anything to make things go her way?</span></div></div>",

Seventeen years have proved you won\u2019t or can\u2019t change. A duck will always be a duck no matter how hard it honks like a goose.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI slipped out into the quiet hallway and turned towards the front door. I didn\u2019t care about going back to class and being a good little boy. This place and everyone in it could all go screw themselves. I only got a few feet when I noticed the presence behind me but I kept walking. I really didn\u2019t feel like dealing with her right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe principal ignored my words as she wheeled herself up next to me with only a small creaking of her wheelchair shifting under her weight. I let out a grunt of disgust but otherwise ignored her. Maybe if I didn\u2019t talk to her she would leave me alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t say anything, simply kept walking. She let out a small sigh but continued on as if I had answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I told Marian she was playing with fire but she wouldn\u2019t listen. She always was a stubborn one, a bit like you wouldn\u2019t you say? I knew it would either be this or some massive blowup eventually. I\u2019m not saying you are in the wrong or that she doesn\u2019t deserve a little repayment for the way she is, but is this really what you want? People can change you know, and what she said was the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps if I answered her she would be satisfied and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps they can change, but not my mother. So what if it was the truth, she only said it to try and control me. The truth is as set in stone as using an eraser on pencil markings to my mother. Besides, what business is it of yours? This is Zelkov business and you are not a Zelkov. You should be happy to be getting rid of a troublemaker. Though do you always eavesdrop on conversations that don\u2019t concern you? Seems to me that\u2019s quite rude.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt deals with the safety of my school and one of my students so of course it concerns me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell not anymore, from now on I\u2019m not a student, so go away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you want to know who took your weapons?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I don\u2019t care anymore. They can keep them. I won\u2019t need them if I am getting rid of  everything that links me to being a Zelkov. I might have earned them with my own money, but I got the job from a contact I got through the family. The only family I had died three years ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you are saying you don\u2019t love them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never said that. The truth is I do love them despite everything. But that\u2019s not enough to keep me here. Or enough to stop me from turning my back on them all just like it didn\u2019t stop them from turning their back on me year after year.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen how are you any different from them?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m simply the product of my environment like everyone else. This is just the natural outcome of their actions. But I do know that if I ever want to stop being like them I need to leave. I need to sever everything and create myself afresh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you said, ducks are still ducks no matter how hard they honk like a goose. You won\u2019t be able to change that easily. You are still you wherever you go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I have two things going for me. The first is I desire to change. The second will be that I won\u2019t have other ducks dragging me down and trying to keep me from honking. Now good day principal, I grow tired of talking with you. Go annoy someone who wants to listen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shoved my way out the front doors and headed down the street. There wasn\u2019t much at home I needed. Just a few sets of clothes until I could burn them and buy new ones. A couple weapons that I had earned on my own through my own contacts, and the collection of photos of Olia I had hidden away. Of the stuffed animals I had saved of hers, I would only bring Mr. Snuggles. Clean out my bank accounts and then go see Ginger about getting away from here. By this time tomorrow I would be lost among the crowd of some far away place and no one would ever find me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t feel any guilt over my decision and I didn\u2019t regret it one bit. I could finally be free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA tiny difference here, a tweak of conscience there. One thought floats to the top of the mind instead of another. A single word or a small nudge from any number of sources both noticed and unnoticed. All of these affect the choices we are given and the choices we make. Would he have done the same if he had taken a deeper breath? Would he have been able to deal with his mother better if he had not tried to be sociable with his classmates? Or perhaps it started to go wrong before that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf he had smiled and acted as if nothing was wrong, would that seem out of character for him? Would it make this scenario any less valid? If so, then which is the true Riktal? Out of all the infinite possibilities and divergent paths that could come about, which one of them is the true Riktal? All of them? None of them? Who can say for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWere you satisfied with the decisions you made? Is this the outcome you sought? Did you take his personality and his past into consideration? Or did you temper your choices on the things you wished? Believing the best, or the worst, of people and acting accordingly. Our time grows short and this window closes for now. Join me again and I will be glad to lend you the power of choice. To alter a destiny, perhaps even relive this very day, simply making a different path. Because remember, time has no meaning here. Past, present, future. They all happen at once, over and over. Just be careful you don\u2019t catch yourself coming or going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tUntil next we meet traveler.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tSlowly I sat back down across from her, letting my weapons hit the floor with a dull thump. Clasping my hands in front of me like she was, I watched her. It was true she was a liar and a manipulator. But maybe just this once she wouldn\u2019t lie to me. Maybe just this once she would tell me at least some of what I wanted to know. I didn\u2019t feel any anger or resentment at this moment, just that sense of crystal clear serenity of mind. If she lied to me again right now, or I figured out she was trying to play me I would walk out that door and never come back. When I opened my mouth I was surprised at how soft and compassionate my words were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTell me why. That is the only condition I will set for taking this job. I want to know why I can\u2019t take the Exams and why I was sent to this school. The whys of everything else can come later. But I really want to know the answer to those two things.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw her clenching her clasped hands together hard enough to turn her knuckles white. I didn\u2019t say anything else, nor did I let my gaze waver. I\u2019m sure she could feel my eyes on the top of her head but finally she looked up at me an answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause the system is breaking down. It has been for years. It started the year before your sister took the Exam\u2019s. The different governments had been bribing the Hunter\u2019s union for years, Having us take on jobs we otherwise might not take. Using us against other countries. It wasn\u2019t too bad at first, but slowly the president and his cabinet wormed their way deeper and deeper into the union corrupting and infecting more and more high ranking members.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt all came to a head when the union instituted a mandate that anyone who wanted to get their license had to serve the military for a minimum of one year and sign a disclosure statement that would take their license from them if they talked. Your sister decided to try to change it all from the inside. At the time we didn\u2019t realize just how deep the corruption went so we didn\u2019t say anything against it. But it has been almost ten years now and it\u2019s only getting worse. We kept it from you because we knew you would try doing something reckless or end up getting yourself killed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe might not have been the best parents but we still didn\u2019t want you to die. Or get banned from ever being a Hunter or worse. You know the union has connections everywhere and has a finger in everything. We might be autonomous and not belong to any one land or government, but we have ties all around the world so we can work unhindered wherever we go. Me and your father have been working for the last ten years with your sister making closed door arrangements with rebels and political activist who want to overthrow the corrupt governments and militaries working with the union and put a new system in place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeople like Asala\u2019s parents. That was the real reason I was in Liccia, to meet with her parents. I simply used the cover of doing a job as an excuse so as to not arouse suspicion. That\u2019s also where all the money we\u2019ve made as Hunter\u2019s has gone over the last ten years, into funding this massive overthrow of not only the union but at least seven major governments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd then you started pushing to become a Hunter and we didn\u2019t know what to do. No, I should say I didn\u2019t know what to do. Your father and Val and a bunch of others said to just tell you. Your father wasn\u2019t against you taking the Exams, He said you could endure a year and then we could have two people on the inside so to speak. But I didn\u2019t want you enmeshed in all of this. I wanted you to be able to become a Hunter after the new system was in place. So you wouldn\u2019t have to worry about any of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat was when Val came to me asking for help. She\u2019s been a friend of the family for a very long time. She asked for our help in making this school better. She has spent her life lowering the mortality rate here and  putting out quality Hunter\u2019s but she wanted to drop that percent lower if she could as a final mission I guess you could say. That\u2019s why I sent you here. I thought you could lead them all by example. It would keep you out of the way for a while until the new system was in place and secure while at the same time helping out Val.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf I\u2019m honest, I was also hoping going to school here might help teach you what I wasn\u2019t able to. That being a Hunter isn\u2019t everything. We need to be rational and logical to make decisions and to lead people, but that doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s all there is to it. Because I was so bad at being a mother you were denied a lot growing up. The biggest of it was that human aspect of our jobs and personalities. You had no friends, no hobbies or interests aside from Hunter stuff, so I was hoping being here would help you gain some of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I knew what you would say and how you would react if I told you that. So I forced it on you. I did it for my own personal reasons, even if I thought it was going to help you. I didn\u2019t always think like that of course. But after Olia died I really started to wonder. You probably think I killed her on purpose. In a sense I think you are right, I let her die. I was distracted and so caught up in this whole corruption and overthrowing the union thing, I didn\u2019t have time to pay attention to anything else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t taken that call back then, I would have been able to stop that attack. I was so caught up in her being a strong Hunter that could protect herself in this violent world, I didn\u2019t see how unsuited she was for this lifestyle. But afterwards, afterwards I had a lot of time to think. To second guess and to regret. To beat myself up over all of it. Seeing her pictures was unbearable because I saw condemnation for what a terrible person I was in them. That\u2019s why I got rid of all her things. Every photo, every stuffed animal, every stitch of fabric. I thought if I burned them all I could burn away my guilt. Burn away the old me and start fresh. Become the mother I wanted to be but wasn\u2019t. Now though, I want to see her face again but I can\u2018t. In my blind grief I destroyed it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of bad choices in my life. A lot of bad choices in how I raised you. You\u2019re right when you say I usually do what benefits me most of the time. I use people and discard them when I am done with them. I don\u2019t like that about myself but I recognize it. I do good for a while, fighting those urges. Then it\u2019s like a switch gets flipped in my head and I revert to my old ways for a while. But I guess you never really saw that part of me because I was never around for you to see. I know after everything I have done to you I don\u2019t deserve to ask you to stay. You have every right to walk out and wash your hands of us. Of me. But is it too much to be selfish one more time and ask you to stay? Ask you not to give up on me the way I feel I gave up being a mother to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stared at me so earnestly, her face more open then I had ever seen it before. I noticed her hands trembling slightly and the little girl had turned her head to watch me with that slightly vacant gaze as if waiting my answer as well. I wanted to believe. But seventeen years of conditioning and proof said otherwise.</span></div></div>",

After she died I promised myself I wouldn\u2019t let this fail. We are so close. Just another few months and we will be ready. The Hunter\u2019s on our side, and there are quite a few, are going to battle against the ones running the union. They might be the strongest of the strong, but even those ten can\u2019t stand against a few hundred Hunters almost as strong and experienced as they are. At the same time there will be open rebellion in every capital of every country that supported this corruption, big or small. We\u2019ve taken steps to take control of the major defensive fortifications so they can\u2019t retaliate with missiles or anything like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere will be massive bloodshed and thousands of lives will be lost. Some of them innocent ones as well. But that is the price of revolutions. Our system of Monster Combat Hunter\u2019s is still a good one, it is just the human element that makes it fallible. Val has been working with us for many years now, and just about every Hunter that has come out of this school in the last seven years is working with us. We stand as shields for the innocent and the weak. I\u2019ve never forgotten that. Sometimes we have to play politics to do that job. If the union were to be completely destroyed and the system broke down, their lives would be in danger in the long run.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you have my word. I will make this world a better one for you to live in. Her death will not be in vain, I promise you that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched her closely, looking for any signs of falseness. My desire to believe her struggling with seventeen years of being let down and toyed around by her. Finally I let out a long drown out sigh while rubbing my eyes. Just one more time. I would believe her this once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take the job. Thank you for telling me all of this. Now it makes more sense to me. Perhaps I can even be more effective here now that I know the why of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got up and went around the table, kneeling in front of the girl who turned her head to watch me. Her eyes only held a slight bit of intelligence in them, but at least they weren\u2019t as vacant as when she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo give me the details of this girls background.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo my mother told me what I wanted to know. How her parents had been assassinated three days ago and how she was a monster summoner that couldn\u2019t control her powers. I nodded my head in understanding as I gave her tiny hands a squeeze reassuringly. After a moment I felt a small squeeze back as if she understood even though her face gave no indication that she was aware of the world around her. When my mother was finally done talking I looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI want you to do one more thing for me mother. It\u2019s not a requirement for me taking this job or anything. You don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to, but I want you to hold off on running off to wherever you are going after this. Spend a day here at home and with me as I interact with this little girl. If you really want to learn how to interact with and deal with kids then watch how I treat her. You\u2019ll see it isn\u2019t that hard. Perhaps it will help keep you from making the same mistakes in the future.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that. Your father is in town right now picking up some supplies but he will be around with the car shortly. We can take an early flight in the morning to get to Bornica.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling the end of school as I nodded my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that too. It really does get lonely in that house.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tStanding up I pulled the girl to her feet and headed towards the door as my mother picked up my bag of weapons for me. As we left I didn\u2019t try to tug on her arm like my mother had, instead I slowed down my pace to walk next to her. Ignoring the looks and the whispers of the other kids we passed I led the way out of the building, stopping by the front gates to wait for my father. I saw three kids who looked like they were looking for trouble lounging nearby. There was a distinctive look to bullies that let you spot them from a mile away. Jethic passed me and I gave him a small wave. He seemed a bit surprised but smiled hesitantly and waved back before heading off down the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala, tell me, in all the time you\u2019ve been dragged around has anyone stopped to ask how you are feeling? Did they let you pack any spare clothes besides that god awful looking vomit dress? I\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t get sick wearing that thing. Have they fed you properly? Or did they just pull you around all the time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen my mother began to speak I held up my hand and she quieted down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLesson one mother, children like to know they matter just like anyone else. Talking like they aren\u2019t there or acting like they are idiots won\u2019t win you any points with them. Even if  I can easily get the answer from somewhere or someone else, since she is right here I would like to hear it from her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLesson two, take their feelings into consideration. Right now she is grieving over the loss of her parents. The shock of that, her powers manifesting, and being pulled away from everything she ever knew to meet complete strangers in places she has never even heard of means she is also probably scared out of her mind. That\u2019s why I am not going to push her. I\u2019ll ask simple questions, only requiring a shake of the head. If she wants to talk then she can, if not that\u2019s fine too. The main thing I want to accomplish is making her feel secure. And believing she can trust me, not as a Hunter, but as a person.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI repeated my questions again as I knelt on the ground next to her. Asking them one by one and waiting for her reply. At first she was slow to respond but with patience and a comforting squeeze or smile she slowly nodded her head just a fraction of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you think you would be up to going into town? We can get a good meal, some new clothes and a few other things you might like. You might only be here a few days but no reason you can\u2019t own anything is there? It\u2019s ok to grieve. It\u2019s a natural thing to do when you lose someone or something precious to you. I bet you are afraid of your power going out of control and hurting people as well. I\u2019m here to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen. Even if it goes out of control and hurts someone I won\u2019t hold it against you. You didn\u2019t ask for this power or this life. You are Asala. Not some monster summoner. Just a little girl who lost her family. So what do you say? Up for a bit of shopping?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe squeezed her bear tightly for a moment before finally nodding her head up and down. I put my hand on her head as I smiled gently at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are a brave little girl. I\u2019ll make sure not to disappoint you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then my father drove up in the car. He seemed a bit surprised to see me but gave me one of his usual jovial greetings. It didn\u2019t take long for my mother to fill him in as we all got into the vehicle. I could see Asala was a bit nervous sitting between me and Inga so I switched places with her and that seemed to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then, where to son? It seems you\u2019re the boss right now. Whatever orders you give we will follow. I never thought your mother would tell you until this was all over. But then again I never thought she would agree to something like this either. If it helps her learn something I\u2019m all for it.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201c Go down to Weaver\u2019s district. Because it definitely has to be shopping first. At least enough to get her out of this fugly dress. I\u2019m ashamed to be seen with this thing next to me. It looks like a dog vomited and somebody turned it into fabric. I feel dirty just sitting next to it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave the girl a lopsided grin and a wink to let her know I was joking just in case she couldn\u2019t tell. I saw her lip twitch for just a fraction of a second before my dad nodded and headed off down the road. I made small talk with the girl, joking and making funny faces at her while slowly learning small things about her she didn\u2019t realize she was revealing. Things like her favorite color, and the types of movies she liked. It was a basic skill that had been honed for politics, but worked just as well for many other things. Anyone could learn and use them if they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother seemed surprised that I was using this tactic on the girl, as if the thought had never crossed her mind and I believed it. I had found people overlooked the simplest things sometimes. Or maybe it was because I tended to turn molehills into mountains that I saw all those simple things people took for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time we finished the five minute drive I had her giggling at a few of my jokes. Even some of the purposefully bad ones. I felt it also had a bit to do with the funny faces I made, though Inga seemed to disapprove of my behavior the way she sat ramrod straight and looked down her nose at my antics. I gave her the benefit of the doubt though, perhaps she just wasn\u2019t accustomed to dealing with this kind of thing just like my mother. But if she was going to be a downer like this the entire time I needed to get rid of her because Asala would eventually pick up on it and be brought down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter entering one of the clothing stores I swept my arm out, telling the little girl to go to town, to try on anything and everything she wanted. She was hesitant at first but my constant cajoling finally convinced her. At first she picked out a cheap drab and plain dress, as if not sure how much she could spend. I quickly dispelled that thought for her as I asked the sales woman which was the prettiest most expensive one in the store. Once I had it I forced her to try it on. After that it seemed like the dam had broken and Asala began to get into the shopping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she didn\u2019t say a word, I could tell she was happy and kept seeking my approval for each new dress. Some things were universal to all girls it seemed because Olia had acted the same way. I could see the disapproving looks from Inga as if she was counting up the money for all this extravagance in her head. I waited until Asala had gone back into a changing room to try on another outfit before hitching my weapons on my back a bit more and walking over to the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cQuit glaring like that. If you disapprove then tough cookies on you. You seem to be one of those penny pinching accountant types. I see the way you are adding up the costs like the fate of the world rested on each Reul. Don\u2019t worry your head, I\u2019m paying for all of this not you or my mother. If you can\u2019t unbend enough to simply enjoy yourself then go away. I don\u2019t need you ruining this for that little girl. She might look more stable and normal to you but right now she is hanging on by a thread to sanity. Aside from that bear, she feels like I am her only lifeline of hope. If she starts picking up your disapproval she will think you disapprove of her in some way and she will retreat inside herself again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is the only warning I will give you. I don\u2019t care if you are my mother\u2019s aide or the aide to The One God himself. I will destroy you if I have to. Protecting that little girl to me does not mean simply protecting her from monsters, but from people of all types. That includes unseen and unspoken threats that might harm her return to sanity and feeling normal again. You have been warned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI quickly plastered a smile on my face as I turned to admire and make appreciative noises at the dress Asala came out wearing. By the time I had a chance to turn my attention away from the girl I found Inga was gone. I caught my mother\u2019s eyes and she gave me a nod, letting me know she had sent her away without any words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe came out of the store a few hours later with a few bags filled with new clothes and other assorted items she would need. She looked down at the new light blue dress she was wearing that had some white lace running along the edges and a faint blue flower pattern embroidered on it. Her fingers stroked it lightly as a smiled played across her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you like it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cY-yes. Thank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI was a bit surprised that she had spoken in that small soft voice. I hadn\u2019t thought I would get her to talk until tomorrow at least. She blushed a bit after saying those few words and hid her face in the stuffed animal. I put my hand on her head, giving it a small pat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou have a beautiful voice, just like your name. thank you for sharing it with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head while still hiding her face but didn\u2019t say anything else. But that was fine, this was about her not about me. Her stomach grumbled then and I let out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell then I think it\u2019s time we found something to eat don\u2019t you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAgain a nod. I held out my hand and she took it trustingly. When I took her to a place not far away called The Pipe, she settled in next to me only long enough to point out her order before miming that she had to use the restroom. Since the door was in sight I told her to go and she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPart of dealing with her in this case is being close enough to let her know I am there but not so close as to smother her. I want her to feel she can be alone if she wants and she has some freedom while at the same time I am a few steps away. I hope you are taking notes mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI am darling. You really are good with kids. Your father told me so but I really didn\u2019t believe it until now. I thought it was just Olia you were good with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI just treat them the way I wish someone had treated me. Though I admit, after they reach to be around fourteen, I just don\u2019t understand them anymore. At that age it\u2019s like they go through some alien change when they hit puberty that I can\u2019t comprehend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little girl came back and I saw the redness around her eyes where she had been crying but I refrained from mentioning it to her, shaking my head at my parents to make sure they didn\u2019t say anything either. I didn\u2019t think they would since they had just observed this whole time but I couldn\u2019t be too careful. I also noted the wet stain on the bears head where the tears had soaked through and smiled. Olia had liked to smother her crying with a stuffed animal as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSoon enough the food came and she dug in without hesitation. Seeming to have forgotten all about her grief and returning to the normal girl she had probably been a few days ago. I knew that wasn\u2019t true of course, but everyone had to grieve in their own way and their own time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother spent the meal asking me questions about how to deal with children. I was surprised she was taking this so seriously. It made me believe she really did want to change. I answered as best I could and tried my best to keep my old feelings and resentments out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSon, your mother and I have been thinking. Do you think we could start over? Put the past behind us and try to make this work? After this is all over, we want to take a break from being Hunter\u2019s. Simply staying at home and relaxing. We\u2019d both like it if we could become a real family. I\u2019m sure there will be pitfalls and troubles and misunderstandings. But we really do want to try. Neither one of us were the best parents, we all know that. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t learn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stared at them both as I nibbled on my lower lip. Could I believe them? Or would I end up disappointed again? I wanted to believe though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala tugged on my shirt and when I looked down at her she smiled up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo it. Be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI smiled back at her as her eyes began to well up and I pulled her in close to me. She began crying on my chest as I hugged her and stroked her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s ok. Let it all out. I\u2019m sure you miss them both. It\u2019s not a shame or a crime to be sad over that fact. It proves that you loved them and they loved you. It\u2019s also not a crime to feel happy right now either. I bet you thought you were dishonoring their memory because you were having fun today. But that\u2019s not true. It doesn\u2019t mean you love them any less. That\u2019s how life is sometimes. Bad things happen but you find good things to make up for it. Sometimes those good things are the only thing that keep you going when you think the emptiness inside is about to crush you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure it is hard for you to accept this right now, but you need to go through this pain to move on. Times will be tough but slowly it will heal like any wound. But it will leave a scar. One that is always there and sometimes when you stretch in just the wrong way you feel it again. It\u2019s scary I know. Thinking that one day it won\u2019t hurt so much, as if that too is a crime. Or it becomes hard to remember their voices or their faces. Never forget this moment Asala, or this pain. But don\u2019t let it keep you from growing stronger because of it and moving forward.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally cried herself out and pushed away from me, rubbing her eyes with the back of her hand before hugging the bear to her chest with both arms. She tried eating a few more bites of food but finally pushed the plate away. I stroked her hair a few more times before looking back at my parents who had kept quiet through all of that. I saw a few tears in both of their eyes as if what I had said had made them remember Olia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou heard the girl. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot. I\u2019ve wanted to be a real family for a very long time. It\u2019s one of the few things I wanted aside from being a Hunter.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tIt was a little after seven o\u2019clock, the sun was setting, my father and mother were carrying my duffle bag and the shopping bags and Asala was draped on my back with her arms around my neck half asleep. For the first time in a long time I felt happy. Really and truly happy without some distrust or anger or anything else tinting it. I felt like a big brother again. Glancing down at the teddy bear in my hand that Asala had named Mr. Cuddles I smiled to myself. She really was a lot like Olia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen we got home I slipped upstairs to put the girl to rest in my bed, that being the only room not filled with dust. Tucking the animal under the covers with her she mumbled a bit before snuggling deeper into slumber. With a grin I lightly kissed her forehead and told her good night in a whisper before slipping out of the room, making sure to leave the door open a crack and the hallway light on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGoing downstairs I fell into the couch with a small sigh. My father came in and offered me a soda which I accepted before he sat down on the other end of the sofa. My mother came in a moment later with a tray of cookies which she sat down on the coffee table before sitting in a nearby chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you found where I stash the sweets huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wouldn\u2019t call chocolate chip cookies on a plate wrapped up and placed in the refrigerator a stash. I didn\u2019t know you knew how to bake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things you don\u2019t know about me. I had to learn how to cook and clean for myself  remember. Besides it\u2019s not hard if you just follow the instructions. Though I should be grateful you didn\u2019t find the whiskey I have hidden.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou better not be drinking while underage!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd if I was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll give you a good thumping that\u2019s what. I don\u2019t need to be a mother to give you a beating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRelax. The only time I drink is when I go over to Ginger\u2019s place and then I make sure to take a nullifier pill so I don\u2019t get drunk. Sometimes I can get away with not getting sucked into her parties, but not always.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd why would you go over there at all? I\u2018m not sure if I approve of that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs if you have any right to judge. I go over there because for one, Sierra and I were close before she died so naturally I got close to her mom as well. For two, I do what any good Hunter does, I make connections. True, the ones that go to her parties might be from the seedier side of the tracks, but even Hunter\u2019s need those kinds of connections. I might not have a license but there are still jobs I can do under the table. Isn\u2019t that one of the reasons you sought me out today after all? You wanted an under the table job done?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father laughed a bit at the look of disapproval my mother gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive it up Marian. Riktal\u2019s right. We are in no position to judge what he does. We left him alone for all these years so we should just be glad he turned out like he did. Don\u2019t try to smother the boy with your newfound desire to be a mother all at once. It doesn\u2019t suit you. In case you haven\u2019t realized, he\u2019s grown up to be a man without us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy father took a sip of his drink, setting it down on the table before looking at me with a slightly thoughtful expression. He glanced at my mother who gave him a slight nod before he focused on me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSon, me and your mother were talking. We\u2019ve been discussing this for a while now but I think today really brought it home to both of us. How would you feel about being an older brother again? I said before we want to stay home after this is over and done with. We have money to live off of for a longtime to come. Your mother has wanted another child for a while now, and I think seeing you at work today showed her what she\u2019s been missing out on. But we\u2019d need your help. Because neither one of us are very good with kids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHonestly, I learned a lot today as well. Like your mother, I want a chance to be a better father. I can\u2019t return the time I failed to be one to you or Olia or Ulicia, but I still want to try. I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t get it right all at once, but we both agree we are willing to apply ourselves. If you are willing to bear with us and help us be better parents. I know it sounds weird, but you are a better parent then either of us are right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I\u2019d like that. But only on one condition. Mother stops setting up these stupid arranged marriage meetings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut darling! That\u2019s just the way things are done!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTimes are changing. Do it another way. Only the old generation families still cling to that outdated way of doing things. Dump it along with the old corrupted union you are overthrowing. I\u2019m not interested and I don\u2019t like having these girls shoved down my throat and expected to somehow fall for them. I have no interest in a relationship right now and when I do it will be on my own terms and with someone I actually care about.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t you at least go to the one for next week? It\u2019s already been arranged and it would be an affront to the family to just cancel\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. affront the family. I refuse to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let out a sigh as my gaze never shifted from her and finally nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right. But I hear she is a really nice girl that you would get along with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe answer is still no.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe ate a few cookies in silence before my father spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo out of curiosity, is there a girl you like right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo one you are even slightly interested in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNope. The closest I could come to being slightly interested in is a girl named Liz Hawthrope. But that is more along a friend basis, nothing romantic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother began to laugh and I shot her a sharp glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat\u2019s so funny?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing. Nothing at all darling.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe chatted a little longer about random things until my mother mentioned how my words to Asala had reminder her of Olia and how I had been right when I said it was hard to remember her face and voice. The look of sorrow in her eyes made up my mind as I told them to wait right there. Slipping upstairs into my room I pulled out two boxes, one big and one small as quietly as I could. Bringing them back downstairs I sat them down and told them to open them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother burst into tears as she pulled the lid off the shoebox, pulling out a handful of photos, each of them of Olia. I could see the wetness in my father\u2019s eyes as he pulled out a stuffed octopus and gripped it tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou thought you destroyed them all but I used all my magic to save this little bit from the flames. I\u2019ve kept them secret in my closet until now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI searched through the box until I found a tattered blue rabbit holding it to my face and smelling it as I closed my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Mr. Snuggles. It was her favorite of all her animals. Tell me, have either one of you heard of Imprinter\u2019s?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they shook their heads I smiled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey are like Monster summoners in that they have what people believe is a cursed ability. An ability that they are hunted and killed over. The followers of The One God call it sacrilegious, an affront to the power of the deity. What they do is take something a person has held for a long period of time like a photo or a stuffed animal. And they pull out the essence that person left behind, or imprinted onto it. The more they know about the person the more realistic they can make the specter they create\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a bit hard to explain, but they don\u2019t actually bring the soul back from the dead or anything. It\u2019s just like a glorified video that acts, reacts, talks and responds like the real thing. You can have conversations with them and their words change based on the question or the context or their mood just like you or me. The really powerful ones can make this imprinted essence show itself like a holographic image right in front of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut I\u2019m not that strong. I can only make them come alive in your dreams. You simply hold onto the item that was imprinted and think of them as you fall asleep and you enter into this realistic dream with them. Imprinter\u2019s have another ability though. If they have something already imprinted with an essence, they can copy that over to another item as long as it has been touched by the imprinted person. Mr. Snuggles here has everything I know of Olia inside of him. Up until the day she died. I\u2019ve spent weeks and weeks pouring that into him. But it will only take minutes to copy if you want. Just choose a photo or an animal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey both stared at me as if I had grown another head until my mother hesitantly searched through the pictures until she found a photo of Olia where it looked like she was about to jump right out of the picture to hug you. I smiled as I remembered taking this picture. Holding the rabbit in one hand and the picture in the other, I closed my eyes and coated them both in magic. Activating the unique twist of the mind needed to transfer it all over. Even then I could feel the blood beginning to drip down my nose from the massive amount of magical data I was transferring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally I opened my eyes, handing the picture back before wiping the blood away. I felt a bit dizzy, but nothing like when I did a full imprinting. She clutched the picture to her chest before flinging herself around my neck and bawling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you darling! How did you find out you had this power and learn about it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI might tell you about it later. For now have some pleasant dreams..\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I went upstairs, leaving the two of them alone with Olia\u2019s things. I slipped into the bed with the girl who cuddled closer to me and I held on tightly to the rabbit still in my hand as I wrapped my arms around her and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAction, reaction and even inaction. All choices and all valid. Was this the ending you desired? Any choices you regret? How else could this day have gone? Will you join me again sometime to find out? Until next we meet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cWell take us down to Gozen street and we will have a bite to eat. If I have learned anything about little girls and boys, it\u2019s that they are always hungry. And this one looks like she could do with a little meat on her bones. Any monster she summoned would probably die of laughter because of how skinny she is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy dad nodded before heading off down the road. My mother looked back at me a bit worried. When she opened her mouth to say something I shook my head and motioned for her to keep quiet. With a sigh she turned back around while I turned my attention back to the little girl. I knew what she was going to say, wasn\u2019t it unwise to talk about her power like that? But she was afraid of her power, if I showed her I wasn\u2019t afraid of it, if indeed I mocked it like it was nothing, she would feel more secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala. We are going to have a little game. The rules are simple. I say a word or a food type and you shake your head yes or no whether you like it or not. I know, doesn\u2019t sound like much of a game does it? More like an interrogation. But then, you never played this game with me before. So let\u2019s see\u2026 you look like you like eggs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head slightly. I named off a few more fruits and vegetables before I looked at her sideways with an eyebrow raised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou aint one of those vegetarians are you. The ones that are like: eating animals is like eating people! Because I like me a big slab of  meat on my plate. Why I might die if I didn\u2019t have a nice slab of ham or a link of sausage on my plate in the morning. So do you like meats like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled slightly before nodding her head that she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear. But you aint one of those freaky meat eaters are you? You know, the ones that think zombie brains are a delicacy. Or cow tongue or any number of those off the wall meats.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shook her head back and forth while smiling broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. Because between you and me I think that might be how zombies are really born. Someone ate a piece and said to themselves that\u2019s tasty! Then that night he got out of bed and began shuffling around moaning for brains.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI mimicked a shuffling zombie with a slack face moaning with my hands in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe didn\u2019t really want brains, he was probably just trying to find the bathroom because of what he ate. True story. I just made it up myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe laughed again as I continued to probe her for information, not just about what she liked to eat, but also about what colors she liked, the kind of books she read and anything else I could get out of her while making her think it was all just a game and me joking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time my father parked the car and we entered a small diner I had a good idea of what she would order. The waitress recognized me and gave me a smile as she came up to the five of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Riktal! Good to see you again! Nice to see you not eating alone this time. Boss said you eat on the house from now on after you helped her out last week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCareful, I might put her out of business with an offer like that. By the way how\u2019s your son Reva?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe got better thanks to that medicine you gave me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad to hear it. Mind scrounging up a picture menu for the little girl here? Just make sure not to give her one with zombie brains as an option.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe little girl began to giggle as Reva looked at me strangely but she took our order of drinks and left to get a picture menu anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou make it look so easy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt is easy mother. Just takes a little practice. But like everything there is trial and error and you mess up. I\u2019m just fortunate I had Olia to practice on. She was a very forgiving girl when I messed up. Unfortunately I am the opposite of you. I just can\u2019t deal with people my own age very well. Once they hit like fourteen or fifteen they are like aliens to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued to chat a little bit as we waited on our meal. I was surprised that my mother seemed to be taking this very seriously, asking questions and listening to my answers. I wondered if we could have somehow done this a long time ago if things had worked out differently. It really wasn\u2019t so bad, being able to talk to them like this. It made me feel like we were really a family for the first time that I could remember. Inga sat like a log the entire time. Saying nothing, but with her back as stiff as a board. She was becoming a real downer for this little group. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Inga, you can loosen up a bit you know. If you\u2019re going to be a stiff collar you can just go back for the day. I\u2019m sure with three Zelkov\u2019s here there won\u2019t be a problem. Besides, it won\u2019t help the girl if you\u2019re like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thank you for the concern but I feel most comfortable like this. You seem to be doing just fine with the girl on your own. I am sure you can deal with any problems that might arise.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInga darling, Riktal\u2019s right. You really are being a downer. Why don\u2019t you take the car and go home for the day? We don\u2019t live that far and it\u2019s not like we are strangers to walking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAs you wish Mrs. Zelkov.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she started to get up my mother waved her back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go right this second. Finish your meal at least. There is no reason you can\u2019t enjoy food that\u2019s already been served.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe woman nodded her head in thanks and continued eating. There was something about her that seemed off or strange. But then again, I could say the same about any number of people or they could say the same about me. Everyone had a different personality. I leaned over towards the girl sitting next to me and whispered in her ear, causing her to grin. When my mother asked what I had said me and the girl looked at each other before holding our fingers up to our lips and laughing at our private joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter the meal I grabbed my bag from the trunk of the car and the four of us began walking after Inga left. I took the scenic route around town, pointing out highlights of the city to the girl and buying a few snacks for her to munch on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLesson three. People have second stomachs for sweet things. This is especially true for little kids. A small bit of candy can go a long way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy this time the girl was actively reaching for my hand as we walked along, sticking close to my side the same way she held her bear close. We went into a clothing store and I told her to go wild. At first she was unsure until I told her we weren\u2019t leaving until she had at least three dresses and they all had to be pretty. Once she realized I wasn\u2019t playing around with her she began trying on clothes and primping herself in the mirror. While she was occupied I whispered so only my mother and father could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHer power is unstable.  I have a feeling some of that comes from her life being in upheaval since all this started. She feels all alone in this world. I\u2019m showing her she isn\u2019t. At the same time I am keeping in mind that she is still hurting inside. Right now I\u2019ve managed to make her forget, but later on when this day winds down she will begin to remember again. Because these happy moments will remind her of what she lost. This is all intentional. It\u2019s part of accepting the losses in a meaningful and constructive way while showing her there can still be good times.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd if as you said was true and her power is influenced by her emotions, if she were to summon a monster now it will either be weak, or of a more helpful nature because she is happy. Something that would be drawn to the positive emotions. I hope you are taking notes mother because when she does break down or if she does summon something I don\u2019t want you reacting in any way. Just let me do my thing. If she sees you reacting negatively to her crying or to any monster she summons, it will reinforce this thought that she is being bad in some way and make her want to return to her shell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left their side and continued to shower praise and whistles on the girl while my parents whispered to each other. They weren\u2019t my concern though, this little girl was. Finally after about three or four hours of hopping from store to store we had five bags filled with an assortment of clothes, undergarments, shoes, nick-knacks, accessories, personal hygiene items and even a few snacks. She still hadn\u2019t said a word, but she was now much more animated, gesturing with her hands as I deciphered what she was saying. Soon she would begin to talk simply because she would feel it was taking too long for me to figure things out. Or because she wanted to say something more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAll the while my mother and father followed a few steps behind us, fading into the back of the mind while they sometimes whispered under their breath. My mother\u2019s eyes never seemed to leave either me or the girl and a thin smile seemed to be perpetually on her face. In this way we began our walk home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI was giving Asala a piggyback ride while crossing the river when a red circle suddenly appeared in front of us. The little girl whimpered a bit and lost some of the carefree attitude she had. She hadn\u2019t realized yet the monster had already come out but I had seen it and I wasn\u2019t worried. As I told her to back up a moment I took a step forward and let out a quick whistle while holding out my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment a small little blue and green bird landed on my palm and I brought it over to Asala, kneeling so she could see it better. She was nervous at first of course, but when the bird did nothing more aggressive than look at her sideways in that quick jerky movement of bird kind she lost her fear and looked at it with interest. I ran my finger under it\u2019s green chin and down it\u2019s blue stomach. It chirped happily before ruffling it\u2019s feathers, causing the green and blue pattern on it\u2019s back to glow in the dying light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is actually a monster. It\u2019s called a Puli-puli bird. It is a lot like any other bird you might find in the wild and eats all the same things too, like worms and seeds. But it\u2019s different from other birds, not only because it\u2019s feather\u2019s light up as you can see but also because it is very intelligent. Almost as intelligent as a human. It also understand human speech, isn\u2019t that right little guy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird looked up at me, it\u2019s head turning almost completely upside down in a comical fashion as it chirped an affirmative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey have an innate sense of good and bad people. Almost like a sixth sense. They avoid people they perceive as bad and they are smart enough to blend in with other birds since they can actually change their plumage to imitate them. Do you mind showing the young lady little bird? Say a robin?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird chirped again before ruffling his feathers and puffing out to almost twice his actual size. When his feathers settled he looked exactly like a robin with the red chest and dark back. Asala stared in wonder as the bird let out a small chortle at her look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey can also be quite vain and mischievous, can\u2019t you little guy? They are a rare sight to see because they aren\u2019t native to this area. You find them much farther south most of the time because of the abundance of fruit and seeds for them to thrive on. Plus the jungles help hide them. Your summoning power doesn\u2019t always have to summon big bad scary monsters. Not all monsters are bad to begin with. In time you are going to learn how to control this power of yours and when you do you will be able to summon useful monster\u2019s like this guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnfortunately right now you don\u2019t have the ability to send him back where he came from. But you will eventually. So if this little guy is willing, do you think you could take care of him until that time comes? There is this big scary world out there and he knows he can\u2019t survive here on his own. And when you leave I\u2019m not going to be able to go with you so perhaps he could keep you company. But you would have to treat him right, or he will go away. Do you think you would be able to do that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAsala kept staring at the bird in wonderment. Finally her head went up and down as if she was afraid the thing would fly away. The bird cocked an eye at her one way and then the other before flying off. Asala gave out a small gasp and inadvertently reached towards the sky as if to catch it. But the Puli-puli only circled once before landing on her shoulder and rubbing it\u2019s head against the side of her face. Her hand came up and gently rubbed it under the neck, eliciting a coo of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think he is in agreement as well. Though you might want to think of a good name for him. One that he likes as well. You can\u2019t just keep calling him Puli-puli.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she idly scratched the monster her eyes went deep in thought finally she smiled while looking sideways at the creature, her small soft voice uttering a single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe creature chortled it\u2019s agreement and the girl grinned even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think that\u2019s a good name. Now I can be with you wherever you go right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m honored to share my name with your new friend. Now, how about we get home and get you settled in huh? As I recall you got a new pair of pajamas to break in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe agreed with another bob of the head and took my hand again. As we continued to walk she kept absently reaching up to rub the monster as if she were in some sort of dream. In time she would learn a few of the other benefits of the Puli-puli, such as chasing away nightmares. But I would let her find those out for herself. They would be pleasant surprises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce in the house I showed her the bathroom and left her to get cleaned up, going back downstairs to conference with my parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t think you were right back at the clothing store, but it seems you knew what you were talking about. I would have never thought of using the monster she summoned like that. I would have just let it fly away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s what happens when you think of someone besides yourself mother. This way she will never feel alone because she knows she has a constant companion. Even when she leaves she won\u2019t be as scared of the next new place because she has somebody going with her. That\u2019s lesson four. Nobody likes being alone all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mother and father looked at each other, sharing a quick nod before my father turned his attention on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cListen son, me and your mom were talking today while we were watching you. How would you feel about being a big brother again? Your mother said she wants to do it right this time. And she\u2019d like to know if you could help her do that. After this whole mess with the union is over, we both want to take a nice long break from being Hunter\u2019s. From running of to the ends of the earth for untold weeks at a time and leaving you alone. We have enough money to last us for years without putting a dent in our coffers, so we don\u2018t need to go slaying anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that. I\u2019m willing to give it a shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI watched my mother\u2019s eyes beam and the grin on her face stretch from ear to ear as she let out a short sob. I struggled with myself for a moment, wondering if I could trust them with my secret before finally deciding if I wanted to put it all behind me I needed to make the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMom, did you really mean it earlier when you said you wanted to see Olia again? That you regret throwing everything that reminded you of her out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. I\u2019m so sorry darling. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have thought of you more, I know that now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waved her apology away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe will talk after I put Asala to bed. That will probably be when she finally lets it all out. You can watch through the door if you want, just don\u2019t interrupt or let her know you are there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter that  I heard the water turn off and headed upstairs to show her to my room, making sure her teeth were brushed beforehand. She yawned sleepily as I tucked her in and the Puli-puli settled on the headboard. Before I could leave she grabbed a hold of my tunic as her eyes began to water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be here until you go to sleep ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat seemed to put her over the edge as she began to bawl. I pulled her into my chest and rocked her gently, telling her it would be all right. Stroking her hair as she let it all out. She finally fell asleep like that and I laid her back down, making sure her bear was tucked in tightly with her. When I was sure she wouldn\u2019t wake up and the monster chirped as if to say he would watch over her, I opened my closet and pulled out a big tattered box and an old shoebox, carrying them downstairs with me as my mother and father followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI set them down and invited them to open the items. They did so with a small question in their eyes. My mother broke down as she began pulling photos of Olia from the shoebox. Even my father had tears in his eyes as he pulled out stuffed animals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt took a lot of magic to make you think these were all burned up, but I managed to save some of her things. I hid them because I thought you never wanted to see any of it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through the big box I finally found the old blue rabbit that was Olia\u2019s favorite. Missing eye and badly sewn on ear and all. I handed it to my mother who took it like it was the most precious thing in the world, and it was in more ways than she knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHave you ever heard of an Imprinter?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen they both shook their heads no I continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s a rare magic just like monster summoning. And just like summoners, people call it a cursed magic and hate it without cause. An Imprinter has the ability to  recreate a person through the essence of things they held, or imprinted on if you will. It\u2019s not like calling the soul back form the dead or anything, but the more of their essence and the more the Imprinter knows about the person, the more real the imprint becomes. They talk, act and react just like they would if they were really alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStrong Imprinter\u2019s can make the essence manifest itself while awake, but most can only make their work come alive while you sleep. That rabbit is imprinted with Olia. She carried it around everywhere. She cried into it, she slept with it, even bathed with it at times. If you go to sleep while thinking about her and holding onto it, she will appear in your dreams. If you want to see her again take it. You can have it when you leave too as long as you promise to bring her back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how did you find one of these Imprinters if they are so rare honey? I mean wouldn\u2019t they be afraid of being killed if anyone found out?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI laid my hand on the rabbit a moment before walking past my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was simple, I looked in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed out the door and back up to my room where I slipped under the covers with the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur time grows short this night. Come again and play god. Alter a destiny.</span></div></div>",

Even if everything you said was the truth, it\u2019s not the whole truth. I just can\u2019t accept anything you say as believable. Perhaps that\u2019s my failing as a Hunter, being unable to put aside the seventeen years of history I have with you. But you won\u2019t suck me in again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up as the bell rang and headed towards the door with my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGoodbye Marian Zelkov. May we never meet again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let the door close on the three without looking back. I would go home and pack my things. I had enough money to live off of for a few months. By that time I could set myself up in a secure place somewhere far away. Perhaps Ginger could help me lose myself with a few of her contacts. I felt a few tears running down the side of my face and wiped them away quickly. I had really wanted to believe her. I had wanted so much for everything she had said to be the truth. But I just couldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI just couldn\u2019t.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA twist of fate. An errant thought that floats to the top of the head over another. Such small things can lead to vastly different outcomes. Does it make every other outcome any less valid? Does it make the way young Riktal handled the situations presented to him untruths? If he gets angry on one timeline does that mean the compassion he shows on another is him being fake? Or are both timelines equally true? Equally showcasing a part of who he is. Another side of him that you would not have seen if not for that small errant little thought if you will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow much of his interactions with the world around him affected how he viewed the events placed before him? He became angry at Gregory for his thievery, does that mean if things had played out differently he would still have that view of the boy? Would his weapons always be stolen by Gregory if such events were to fall out differently? Those errant thoughts that are as small as a pebble being dropped into a river can still alter the course of the river given time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again and witness the flow of time with me. Throw the pebbles into the river and see just how much you can change the course it takes with your own hands and eyes.</span></div></div>",

Well that was more avoidance than deflection, but it worked. I quickly slipped into the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror, pushing my glasses back up a little higher after throwing a bit of water on my face. The day was almost over Riktal, remember that. They really don\u2019t mean all that much harm. They are still adjusting to being Hunter\u2019s. Give them some leeway. It\u2019s only natural that they want to know more about you. They need to make connections for the future just like you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven telling myself all that I could only half believe it. I was a Zelkov, it was like the core of our beings to not trust anybody, not even our own family. With as much political power and influence as we had, not to mention acquaintances in high places, we had to mistrust and look for deeper plots in everything. I wasn\u2019t as mistrusting as my parent\u2019s yet, but in time I would be. Even if I vowed it wouldn\u2019t happen to me, I knew such a thought was folly. I had been brought up to be rational about the choices I made, because a Hunter needed to set aside personal desires and thoughts for the good of all. Letting personal emotions hinder me from taking a job or position that would save or protect lives was not the kind of Hunter I wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinally I felt I could hold myself together for the next hour, leaving the bathroom to head back to class. I hadn\u2019t gone far when I was met by a black haired woman dressed smartly in a business suit. She strode over to me and stood at attention, looking me up and down as if inspecting some strange specimen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal Zelkov correct?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat would be me. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cInga Ice. I\u2019m one of your mother\u2019s personal aide\u2019s. She wishes to speak with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what does she want to speak to me about this time?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to discuss her business. It is for her to explain it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI shrugged and motioned for her to lead the way, following after her. Judging by first impressions I wasn\u2019t feeling all that charitable in telling her to look for a new job. My mother would tire of her soon enough and find someone else. Firing her without warning and leaving her high and dry. Let her cry and fret when it happened because I wouldn\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tInga led me to a small meeting room on the first floor that looked like a generic TV club room or maybe where the student council of the school met. Once her job of escorting me was done she ignored me to stand against one of the walls, trying to blend in like a good yes man should. Shaking my head slightly I went over to the window to look out at the group running around the track. Tomorrow would be the alternate classes for our group that were more along the lines of what you found in a regular school. This might be an academy for Monster Combat Hunter\u2019s in training, but it was also an accredited high school that had to teach at least  the minimum of academic knowledge. How were the kids here supposed to become good Alchemist if they didn\u2019t know the basic periodic table or the reasons of how molecules bonded together. Or if they couldn\u2019t do some entry level Algebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe door finally opened again and I turned to see my mother leading a little girl with snow white hair and scarlet colored eyes into the room by the hand. Though it looked more like she was tugging her by the arm than leading her. The girl had a blank gaze that stared off at nothing, moving more from reaction than from her own will. Her ugly green dress was a bit frayed around the edges and looked like she had worn it for at least three or four days. The only thing that seemed out of place was the brown stuffed bear she clutched to her chest with her left forearm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe offered me a seat with her hand after giving me a quick embrace but I refused, preferring to lean against the wall with my arms folded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what is it this time mother that you felt it was so urgent to call me here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, I\u2019d like you to meet Asala. She is going to be your new bride.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t even bother to reply to that, simply pushed off the wall and headed towards the door. My mother hurriedly jumped up and held out her hand to stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait! Wait! I was only joking darling. I thought to lighten the mood a little that\u2019s all. I know how you can get sometimes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wonder why.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leaned back against the wall while saying that, letting a mask drop over my face as I narrowed my eyes at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo then why are you really here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis little girl needs you. She lost her home and her parents three days ago and needs protecting. I have someone coming to pick her up but I can\u2019t watch her. I have important business in Bornica and your father will be going with me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSounds more like you need me and not her. As for your important business, when don\u2019t you have important business? At least important to you if no one else. So why me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you are a top notch Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t have a license remember? Somebody denied me that right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou still have the skills. You don\u2019t need a license for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd yet here I am stuck in this school wasting those skills for the next three years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s why I am offering you this job, to put those skills to use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t think my mother would approve. After all, she didn\u2019t want me taking the Exams so she wouldn\u2019t want me taking Hunter jobs as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI think I could talk her into it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you can, tell her I won\u2019t settle for anything less than being able to take the Exams after it is over and dropping out of this stupid school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI doubt she will go for that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen I doubt I will take the job. Find someone else. Maybe Pelei or Jo-Jo. They like little kids and she might enjoy being dressed up by Pelei all the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t you think you are being a little unfair here? Won\u2019t you at least listen to the full story?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHow was it she knew how to push just the right buttons. I felt my teeth clamping together as the anger slowly boiled up inside me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI just couldn\u2019t let it go this time. I had held my tongue before but not anymore. She had just pushed my buttons one too many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFair! That\u2019s not a word that deserves to come out of your lips mother. You taint that word by uttering it! Fair to you is whatever gets you what you want! What is it you told me when I was six years old? Oh yes! Life is unfair so grow up and get over it! How exactly am I being unfair? You don\u2019t want me to be a Hunter, so I\u2019m not taking a Hunter level job. Seems fair to me! What\u2019s unfair is being told I can\u2019t take the Exams. Unfair is being thrown into this dump of a school to waste my time learning things I already know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUnfair is seeing my big sister take the Exams at fifteen, two years younger than I am right now might I add, without any complaints from you or father. Unfair is being left alone in that empty house day after day while you go off slaying monsters for weeks at a time. Not even a quick call to say hey how you doing! Unfair is knowing how to take care of a house and kids better than you. Unfair is not having any childhood to speak of or seeing a mother more than maybe once a month.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen was the last time you were there for my birthday huh? Or a holiday? Doesn\u2019t matter what holiday, pick one and I can tell you where you weren\u2019t! Until Olia died she was the only one I spent my days with! No let\u2019s call it how it is shall we? Until you murdered her. Because obviously you didn\u2019t care about fair then either! Shoving the whole \u201cyou are a Zelkov so you have to be a Monster Hunter\u201d mentality down her throat when she was as unsuited for it as man is to live on the sun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFair for you has always been what\u2019s best for you! That\u2019s why you thought it was fair to destroy everything that reminded you of Olia. Because it was too painful for you to look at it! Not because you loved her! But because she tarnished the Zelkov name! Never mind the fact that when she died it was like a part of my soul was ripped from me! I was more of a parent to her than you were. Just like big sis was more of a parent to me then you! Do you want me to go on or are you satisfied that what I am doing is fair?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI headed towards the door with my fist clenched so tight I would probably break the skin soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk to your mother like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI swung around, throwing out a cord of magic to wrap around Inga\u2019s neck, pulling her towards me as I leapt forward in a spinning kick, smashing my boot into the side of her face and sending her flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou stay the hell out of this you insignificant piece of trash! My mother will get tired of you soon enough and discard you like all the others! And she will do it with a smile on her face and call it fair the entire time. Because that\u2019s just who she is! If you are lucky she will strand you someplace safe! Where was it you left your last power hungry whore mother? Oh yes I remember! In the middle of a city halfway around the world while it was in the middle of a civil war where women were treated like property! I hear they also thrived on the sex slave trade. I bet you don\u2019t even regret your actions do you? Never thought twice about dumping the excess baggage.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl squeezed her bear as I yelled at my mother, and a red circle appearing under my feet. Skipping out of the way I avoided the large hand that burst up from the pit trying to grab me. Quick as lightning I jumped forward again, thrusting downward and punching the giant with all my might in the eye. My fist went through the orb and into the brain where I released an aura of magic that caused it to turn to mush. As I pulled my fist out of the dead creatures head I looked back up at my mother and the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow it makes more sense. She\u2019s a summoner. And we all know where you stand on that score don\u2019t we? You knew I have nothing against them so you thought I would be willing to baby-sit. Yes that totally seems fair. You know what seems even more fair? I just kill her. Or perhaps you kill her. Then she no longer becomes a threat to thousands of people. You\u2019d have no problems doing that would you? After all you barely tolerate them to begin with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal that\u2019s enough!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnough? Enough! No! It\u2019s never enough with you mother! Always pushing! Always demanding! Always expecting! Well I\u2019m tired of it all! Never getting answers! Never knowing why! And you never listening! So how about you make a choice right now! Kill me, kill the girl or let a few thousand students die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI created a whip of magic attached to each hand, smashing one down on the table in front of the girl and cutting it in half. The other one I snapped forward to cut her cheek. Flailing around I cut through the walls, taking out the support beams one by one and causing the building to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m tired of being the good little boy mother! Tired of all your crap! Of the Zelkov name! If I can\u2019t be a Hunter then I will just be a villain! I\u2019ll make that girl summon a giant monster to help me rain destruction down on this damn school and take everyone and everything with me if I can! So kill her or kill me! That\u2019s the only way I\u2019m going to stop! That\u2019s the only fair thing isn\u2019t it! Can\u2019t decide! Then just do what\u2019s best for Marian Zelkov like you always do and screw everyone else!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard the door open just as a part of the ceiling fell where my mother was standing. She grabbed the girl and jumped back even as a red circle began to appear on the ground. I turned quickly just as my mother chopped the girl on the neck to knock her unconscious and stop the summoning. The principal leveled a shotgun at my chest and fired. I blocked it with a protective shield as I threw my whips in her direction. Her wheelchair tipped back on it\u2019s own as my whips passed through the door and wall above her in an X pattern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFlipping back up she fired two more shots, both of which I blocked but ended up losing a few inches. As I turned the whip in my left hand into a large ball of energy to throw at her I felt the blow to the back of my neck and my body froze up. I fell to the ground fighting back the darkness, using healing magic to burn it all away as fast as I could. I wouldn\u2019t be taken down here. I would kill my mother first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry about this Val. I\u2019ll pay for the damages.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI told you this was going to happen one of these days Marian if you kept this up, but you wouldn\u2019t listen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe thing I told you to do from the beginning, sit him down and tell him the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI guess I\u2019m going to have to. That is if he will even listen to me after this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHe is so much like Miktal. Once he calms down, he will listen and think rationally.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got to my knees and pushed off from the ground with my hands. I wasn\u2019t done yet. I would destroy everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cKill\u2026 you\u2026 all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boot came into my field of view seconds before it connected with my face and blackness descended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends another day for Riktal. Is it his last? Perhaps, perhaps not. What is this truth of which they speak? Did you think it would end up like this from the simple act of not telling your last name this morning? Such is the way of things. Each choice creates a new path, a new opportunity missed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again and chose a destiny for this young man ad see where else his day might end up if he had taken another route in life.</span></div></div>",

Give me the whole story. Though since it is you telling it I doubt it will actually be the whole truth. Just a mixture of truth and half truth to fit your needs as you attempt to convince me you aren\u2019t lying or try and guilt trip me into accepting this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy would you say that!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth. And so you know I won\u2019t be blindly fooled by your manipulating ways anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with slightly sad eyes. Eyes that on another person might make me believe they were on the verge of telling me a big secret or clear up some misunderstanding. But on my mother they were just another form of control. To make the person she was talking to more sympathetic and willing to do what she wanted. Finally she let out a small breath before starting her story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know how my last job was in Liccia right? Well Asala\u2019s parents were very big political activists and quite outspoken against the kingdom and the dictatorship of the queen. It made them a lot of enemies as I am sure you could believe. But they also had a large following which made it hard to actually do anything to them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhile I was there I was contracted by the queen to assassinate them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd I am sure you took the job like the good little dog you are because it was for the good of the people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour wrong. I knew and had worked with her parents in secret before that so I knew what it was they were trying to achieve and agreed with it. After declining the job, work kept me from going and telling them about the plans to assassinate them. Now I wish I had, since someone had actually succeeded by the time I got back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFrom the reports that I got and from the private investigations I made I concluded the assassin was another Hunter. He had managed to kill them both before a monster mysteriously appeared out of nowhere and killed him in turn.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glanced away from my mother to look at the little girl before resuming my stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen she is fortunate that you found her. Not many people like monster summoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t find her. Someone else took her away after the initial confusion. One of her parents supporters. But I doubt they fully realized what she was until after I took her into my custody and protection. It seems her power manifested when she saw her parents murdered in front of her. As such, her powers are a bit unstable and seem to respond to intense emotions the most. Though she could unwittingly summon something at any time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo now after two days you\u2019ve grown tired of dealing with her and decided to dump her on someone else while you go flitting off to some other job until you get bored of that too. Then again I suppose that\u2019s simply the story of your life isn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThink whatever you want of me. Maybe I deserve some of that resentment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMaybe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe ignored my derisive snort and single word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut this girl really needs your help. I need your help here. Not many people would accept her because of her ability. They would prefer to kill her on sight. We\u2019re family aren\u2019t we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019ll do it because she needs my help. And I already know you are useless when it comes to these kinds of things. She would probably starve to death if left with you. Get out of here and go do your job. That\u2019s always been what\u2019s most important to you anyway. You got what you came for. But know this. I\u2019m taking the Exams after this is over whether you like it or not. That\u2019s my payment. If you can do whatever you feel like doing and screw what anyone else wants then I might as well too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnough! Go before I change my mind. There will be no negotiations here. Go save a village or something for money you don\u2019t need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe finally left me and the girl alone after another one of those soulful looks like she was going to reveal a great secret. Sliding my chair back I took a seat next to the girl, holding her hand in mine while her left hugged the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry you had to hear that. I know you are probably thinking I should be nicer to my mother aren\u2019t you. I bet you had a really good life with your parents. They were always around and told you what a good job you were doing. You probably ate together and played games together. Maybe you didn\u2019t, but you look like the kind of normal person I wanted to be. That\u2019s the kind of life I imagine most normal people have anyways. The complete opposite of how my life really is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how about we take it slow huh? By the way, I think Asala is a pretty name. Do you have a nickname or a pet name? I hope it isn\u2019t Asa or something like that. Because that sounds like a bad punch line to a joke. Though I guess my nickname isn\u2019t much better. My sister calls me Riki tiki and rubs her face all over mine. She says I have some secret energy that I give off that fills up her tiki tank to keep her going like she is some sort of robot. Makes me wonder, if she ever runs out will her face melt off to reveal the cogs and gears beneath or something? Wouldn\u2019t that be a funny sight to see?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI elongated my face and widened my eyes while moving my jaw up and down mechanically. I moved my head from side to side jerkily like a machine as well while talking like a robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTiki reserves on empty. Unable to refuel. Casting away outer shell to conserve energy. We are the robo warriors. We have come to suck all tiki\u2019s dry. May the power of the tiki compel you! Neener-neener.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe let a small smile spread across her lips as she elicited a little giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t really know if a robot would go neener-neener or not, but it would have to have catchphrase of some kind right? And something like clank-clank would just be silly. But make no mistake robots aren\u2019t silly at all. Well maybe the ones that wear pink maid outfits and do the disco. Those ones are probably silly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy that time she was cracking up, unable to keep that blank stare any longer. I offered her my hand as the bell rang and she took it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI figured you weren\u2019t completely in your own little world. But no one bothered to stop and try to make you feel at ease did they? I know my mother didn\u2019t. You were probably afraid of her weren\u2019t you? But just so you know, I don\u2019t care if you are a summoner or not. I don\u2019t blame you for having that power, you didn\u2019t ask for it. You are just another scared little girl to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI pinched my nose with my fingers as a wrinkled my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA little girl with an awful smell coming from her. I think its because that dress is so ugly even the air is rejecting it. First thing we have to do is get you a few new clothes. And something good to eat since I bet you are hungry. Just stick close to me and everything will be all right.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head as she stepped closer to me and clutched my tunic. I led her into the hall and back to the classroom so I could pick up my duffle bag. The room was deserted which was a small blessing in and of itself. When I walked own the aisle to get my stuff I noticed my Roller Knuckles were sitting on top of the bag with a note saying I\u2019m sorry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI decided not to pursue the matter any farther as I stuffed the weapon into the duffle and hoisted it onto my back. I had gotten them back, no one had been hurt with them, and I had bigger things to worry about in the form of this little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the way out of the school a few kids stared at me and the little girl but I ignored them. I took her shopping for a few hours and out to eat. Though she was scared she still enjoyed herself from what I could see. All it had taken was someone to pay attention to her. I could still see the fear and the sorrow but she felt more secure which is what she needed the most right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn the way home she tugged on my shirt, making me stop. We were on the bridge crossing the river with the sun setting on the horizon, turning the clear water into a mirror. She motioned for me to kneel down and I did. Once I did so she wrapped her arms around my neck and rubbed her face all over mine with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiki tiki! Tiki tank charged! Clank-clank!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI laughed along with her as I gave her a hug back moments before she began crying. Picking her up I walked the rest of the way home with her that way as she kept saying Riki tiki over and over in between sobs. I knew she was somehow coping with the death of her parents in this way. I might not know what was going on in her mind but I didn\u2019t need to know. All I needed to know was she thought needed to do this to grieve right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDropping the stuff on the floor after getting into the house I sat on the couch and held her. Her breathing finally evened out as she fell asleep like that. As gently as I could I laid her on the end of the sofa before finding a cover to lay over her. The bear dropped out of her hand as it hung over the side of the couch so I picked it up and tucked it in with her. She smiled and mumbled as she snuggled it closer to herself and I couldn\u2019t help but grin crookedly as well. Sitting on the end she didn\u2019t fill I leaned my head back and let sleep come over me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestiny, chance, free will. Are these things illusion? Or do they somehow weave a web of confusion? Do all three exist in some symbiotic harmony? Or are they always at war with each other in a battle so vast the human mind cannot comprehend it. How free is free will exactly? Do we only believe it free? Is destiny or fate simply another word for the convergence of free will from many people coming together and interacting on this grand scale? They say fate is what is \u201cmeant to be.\u201d if so then was this always meant to be? Was this day always meant to end up like this? Even with the multitude of infinite variations and permutations that could have happened this day? Did it not matter the choices made or the free will of everyone in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps you will join me again and we shall delve into answering this question. We shall follow young Riktal\u2019s life from the very beginning of this day and see if there is truth to everything they say. Though I give you this chance to choose and say you may return of your own free will, I see the future and know that returning is your destiny.</span></div></div>",

Trying to use the whole family line screwed you over. You might be the woman that gave birth to me, but you\u2019re not my mother. We are family in name only. I feel no responsibility towards helping you. Just like you felt no responsibility in raising me. Go find someone else. I\u2019m sure Pelei might do it. He tolerates summoners and she is cute enough for his tastes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stood up and gave her a small bow before leaving the room. The bell rang signaling the end of school and I began walking towards the front doors before realizing I had left my bag in the classroom. With a sigh I turned and headed back up to the second floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I got to the classroom it was already emptied out which was a relief. I didn\u2019t feel like trying to deal with any more bull crap than I had too right now. When I got closer to my bag I noticed my Roller Knuckles were sitting on top with a note that simply said I\u2019m sorry. A quick look through my duffle satisfied me that nothing else had been taken. Hefting the fist weapons in my hand I contemplated doing a trace spell on them and finding out who took them to begin with. After a moment I simply stuffed them in my bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI got them back, that was all that mattered right now. No use going to look for trouble. Dealing with my mother had drained all that anger away. That always seemed to be the case when I dealt with her, I just ended up feeling empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHitching my bag onto my shoulder I left the school and walked home alone. That seemed to be the theme with me, alone. Silence and alone seemed to just surround me like some invisible cloak, following me wherever I went. But perhaps that could change with Liz around. She was the first person in two years to break through that bubble around me. I came to the front door faster then I thought I would, being lost in my own thoughts as I was. A quick wave of the hand unlocked the door and let me inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m home.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOf course no one answered. There was no one here too answer. There rarely ever was. Dropping my bag on the floor I went through the house turning on the radio and the TV\u2019s just like I always did. If I didn\u2019t focus too hard I could almost believe there were other people here. Throwing a microwave dinner in to heat up for a light meal I went into the hall again to mark a red, blue and green X on the calendar next to today\u2019s date. Looking back through the month I saw one of each colored circle, that was about right. My mother, father, and sister all came home about once a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter eating the meal and cleaning off the single fork I had used I lounged around on the couch while watching some mindless sitcom I had no interest in. It was simply noise to fill the silence. I felt my eyes close and let them. It might be early but there was nothing else to do except sleep whenever I felt like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI awoke with a start as I heard the front door opening. Slipping my hand under the couch to grab the sword I kept stashed there I pulled it out and dashed towards the hallway, swinging it as I came around the corner. My father bent backwards as the blade swung harmlessly over his head and he put up his hands in surrender. Behind him my mother and the little girl came through the front door as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGlad to see you too son. Though I just had a haircut, I don\u2019t need another.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you two doing here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell last I checked we still lived here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut mother said you two had some job over in Bornica\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe did and we do. But your mother couldn\u2019t find anyone to take care of the girl since you refused her and we can\u2019t take her with us. So here we are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala go get a bath and then we can find you a bed ok?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl didn\u2019t budge from where she stood. Her feet having stopped moving as soon as my mother had let go of her arm. My mother let out an exasperated sigh as she stared at the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally! Isn\u2019t it about time you give up this whole acting like a statue thing! I\u2019m getting tired of pulling you around all the time! Don\u2019t you want to get cleaned up? Do you expect me to do every little thing for you? Your old enough to take care of yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah great talk mother. I\u2019m sure she feels more at ease around you now. At least I know you are just as good at taking care of kids as you always were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, your good with kids right? Can\u2019t you help me out here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot my problem. She is your responsibility. It will do you good to learn how to deal with kids. It will be a first for you. I suggest you treat her like a doll if you don\u2019t want to actually deal with her like a little girl. Wash her yourself, dress her yourself, feed her yourself, instead of expecting her to do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI returned to the living room to slip the sword back under the couch while my mother continued to rant at the little girl to snap out of it. My father followed me in and sat down on the other end of the sofa after I settled myself in again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCan\u2019t you give your mother a break? She is trying you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI did give her a break. The whole first seventeen years of my life I gave her a break. She\u2019s used them all up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s trying really hard you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t lie. It doesn\u2019t suit you. She only tries really hard when she wants to and when she can come out ahead from it. She does her job as a Hunter, but dealing with people outside of that is a laugh. I\u2019d give my left leg if you told me one instance where she did something for someone else with no benefit to herself whatsoever. Heck even an instance where she did something for someone else that benefited them more than her would do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s not true and you know it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo I? Tell me, when has she ever been around long enough for me to know anything about her personally? All I have to go on is my dealings with her as a Hunter, nothing else. The same is almost true for you. You\u2019ve been around a little more than mother has but not much. I know you like chess and fishing, and I know you don\u2019t like tomatoes. But other then a few random facts here and there what do I know about either one of you when you tell me nothing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJust then their was an ear shattering scream from the hallway as the house shook slightly. Both of us dashed out into the hall just in time to see a red circle appearing on the floor. Even as a large meaty hand began to emerge I slipped forward and chopped down hard on the back of the girls neck. The summoning portal closed, slicing off the arm and leaving it laying in front of us. Blood began to pool on the wood a moment before it all turned to dust and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what did you do to set her off mother?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNothing! I just took the bear away from her so I could wash it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou truly are an idiot mother. Even I figured out almost instantly that bear was her safety net. That\u2019s the only reason she would carry it around with her through all of this. It was proof that she had some connection to this world. Probably quite a bit of  connection to her old life as well. A reminder of her parents maybe. Taking that away from her was like ripping the floor out from under her feet and dropping her into a bottomless abyss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI yanked the bear out of my mothers grasp and slipped it back into the girls arms as I supported her in my own. Even unconscious her hand felt the fur and squeezed down on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take care of her tonight. If I leave her with you I might end up with a case of the dead by morning. I knew you were bad with kids, but I didn\u2019t think you were this useless.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlipping my arm under her legs I picked her up and headed up the steps. Since no other room was cleaned up and ready for a guest I simply took her to mine. Pulling back the covers I laid her to rest and moved to turn away after tucking her in. Her free hand shot out and grabbed mine in her sleep and gripped it tightly. With a sigh I sat cross legged on the floor and held her hand until my head dropped into my chest and I fell asleep as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDestiny, chance, free will. Are these things illusion? Or do they somehow weave a web of confusion? Do all three exist in some symbiotic harmony? Or are they always at war with each other in a battle so vast the human mind cannot comprehend it. How free is free will exactly? Do we only believe it free? Is destiny or fate simply another word for the convergence of free will from many people coming together and interacting on this grand scale? They say fate is what is \u201cmeant to be.\u201d if so then was this always meant to be? Was this day always meant to end up like this? Even with the multitude of infinite variations and permutations that could have happened this day? Did it not matter the choices made or the free will of everyone in the world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps you will join me again and we shall delve into answering this question. We shall follow young Riktal\u2019s life from the very beginning of this day and see if there is truth to everything they say. Though I give you this chance to choose and say you may return of your own free will, I see the future and know that returning is your destiny.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThe weapons were too dangerous. I had no choice but to press the issue myself, whether it caused a commotion or made me enemies. If I let this go, who knows how many innocent lives would be hurt by them in the wrong hands. If I couldn\u2019t get them back by the end of the day, whoever took them would take them out of this school, never to be seen again until whoever stole the weapons tried to use them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSlipping to a quiet corner of the room I quickly pulled up my mother\u2019s magical fingerprint on the spell, setting it to audio only and holding my thumb and pinky up to my face. Her voice came over the spell as if she was right next to me, but so did the background noise. I heard something about a girl and someone talking about Hunter\u2019s that might take her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t take long to confirm with my mother that I had in fact brought the weapons to school with me. Once that was confirmed I said my goodbyes and shut down the spell as fast as I could. Dealing with my mother, even from a distance, could make me angry. And I didn\u2019t need to be any angrier than I already was. Stepping out into the middle of the room I looked around at all the boys who had stopped gearing up as if they somehow knew I was going to say something by the way they all stared at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make this short and sweet. Two weapons were stolen from me. I know I brought them to school. I also know it is possible one of the girls in the class took them but I find that highly unlikely. These weapons are dangerous and way above any of your current skill levels. If you try using them you may find yourself losing your life instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf anyone in here did take those weapons, I suggest you give them back immediately. I will leave my bag out in the open. If they were to appear inside my bag by the time I come back at the end of the period I will not pursue the matter farther. I will forget such ever happened. But if these items are not back in my bag within that time frame all bets are off. I will hunt you down and I will extract vengeance upon you. Run and hide, even fight back if you wish. I will enjoy crushing you. You will be lucky if I let you keep your life. So consider carefully what is more important to you. That is all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the locker room then amid hushed whispers and everyone glancing at the other suspiciously. They all knew what a serious crime it was to steal another Hunter\u2019s weapons. It was a crime to steal period, but for a Hunter, their weapons were an extension of themselves. Sometimes being passed down from generation to generation as heirlooms. Stealing a Hunter\u2019s weapon could be paramount to signing your own death warrant both literally and figuratively. Even if the person wasn\u2019t killed, potential contacts and alliances would be broken as other Hunter\u2019s distanced themselves from the person. They could find it hard to continue being a Hunter. At this stage of their life they might end up dropping out of the academy in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI noted the order in which the boys came out of the locker room, many of them came in groups so as not to be thought of as being the thief. They kept eyeing me and the others as we all began to stretch before the Arena Master called everyone to attention. He said we would be splitting into groups to fight captured monsters to test our skills instead of sparring against each other. Well the rest of the class was doing that, me and Liz were told to sit this class out since we were so far advanced. So we headed into the bleachers and sat close together, watching as the groups were set up and a wall raised down the middle to split the floor into two smaller arenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo a Zelkov huh? That explains a lot. Though I hope your name really isn\u2019t Riki tiki.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s Riktal. Only my sister is allowed to call me that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell my brother used to call me Lizzy Lili when I used to live with him in Nefrot City so don\u2019t feel too bad. I personally think its some kind of conspiracy of the older sibling league in it\u2019s ongoing mission to embarrass their younger siblings as much as they can whenever they can. Strange nicknames are just a small part of their master plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you\u2019re not from around here huh? Why\u2019d you decide to move here then? Nefrot has a bunch of good Monster Hunter academies as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026. complicated. But it wasn\u2019t my whole family that moved, just me. Let\u2019s just say I am taking a bit of a break from them right now. But in order to do that I had to come here to this academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah story of every old generation family like ours I guess, complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLapsing into silence the two of us watched the groups below fighting some D class creatures. It took them at least five minutes to deal with them, showing how weak they were compared to me. They would get stronger eventually and be at my level, I was just at a higher skill right now.  The last group stepped into the arena and a caged Cluuk rose out of the floor. I pointed at the group with my chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey must be the strongest out of everyone in the class.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAside from you and me you mean? Yeah. Marsa, the one with the staff. is pretty good with magic but she has this aversion to bladed weapons. Daniel\u2019s magic is mediocre at best but he is the best hand-to hand specialist out of everyone else. He\u2019s the one pounding his fist together now. Gregory is an all around combat type. He\u2019s a good party leader and he has a diverse skill set of magic. His gunning skills aren\u2019t bad either. But he is a bit of a hothead and goes on a lot of ego trips. Always thinking he has more skill than he actually does, then blames it on other people when he screws up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh, I know the type well. They want what is best for one person and that person is the one they see in the mirror every morning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cExactly. Jethic, the tank, I\u2019ll admit he has impressed me. He\u2019s the best out of everyone here when it comes to Hunter mentality and straight up tanking skill. Given the right circumstances he could take on a B class monster right now. Almost no magic to speak of though, barely enough to not be considered a Void. And Lilia is a really good healer. She decided not to take the bonds of servitude to become a priestess of The One God and came here to be a Hunter instead. Don\u2019t know why, but she isn\u2019t half bad with holy magic. Though she does tend to get a bit absentminded at times. When you are around her you get this feeling that she isn\u2019t really \u201chere\u201d if you know what I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s surprising. Don\u2019t usually see any of the servants of The One God not tied to the church in some way. I actually think this is the first time I have seen one training to become a Hunter, though I have heard of a few other cases like that. You would think all priest and priestesses would want to learn how to use their power offensively instead of purely for healing and defense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know right? Never did understand that whole do no harm mentality of theirs.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe watched the group fighting below for a bit, pointing out ways they could tighten their teamwork and other options they could use while fighting the thing, such as better positions and better orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI give it another minute. They got their heads on straight at least. They didn\u2019t do anything foolish like casting fire on it, so as long as they avoid using magic as the killing blow they will be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as I aid that the one named Gregory whipped out his hand in an underhanded arc while rolling out of the way of some flying feather darts. The magic orb swirled through the air, igniting into a ball of flames right before it smashed into the creatures face.  The giant chicken looking bird let out a squawk of anger as it\u2019s feathers ignited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bird wasn\u2019t burning alive though, it was transforming. It grew a third leg and an extra set of wings while the poisonous comb under it\u2019s beak split in two. The feathers took on a slightly metallic sheen as they stiffened up into razor sharp blades. It\u2019s eyes took on a bottomless pit color of black as it threw out it\u2019s four wings and showered the area with flaming razor edged dart feathers.<br>\r\nI was halfway along the top of the wall down the middle by the time the feather\u2019s were flying. So I wasn\u2019t able to stop the attack. Three of them impaled Gregory along his left side, hitting him in shoulder, lung and leg. The one named Jethic was able to  deflect most of the dart\u2019s as the other three hid behind him. A few of the feathers still sliced through cheeks and arms around the edges though, where he couldn\u2019t protect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs it opened it\u2019s mouth I jumped off the wall, summoning the power within me as I flew over it\u2019s head. As I landed in front of the small group I threw out my left hand palm forward, shooting a blast of ice and wind to stop the flames it shot out of its mouth. The force of it\u2019s attack still made me slide backwards since I hadn\u2019t been able to brace myself. While stopping the attack I busied myself making small ice pellets with my free right hand, throwing them at the bird when it finally closed it\u2019s beak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe pellets hit the ground around the monster seconds before I snapped my fingers, causing them to explode upwards in spikes of ice. The beast became encased but I knew it was only temporary. Such a quick attack wouldn\u2019t stop a B class monster for long. I pointed at Gregory who was laying on the ground gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLiz get the idiot to safety now! Make sure he doesn\u2019t die!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head before yanking the quills out of the boy and grabbing him up like he weighted nothing, running towards the side of the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarsa! Priority on fire protection magic! Jethic! Focus on defending the healer above all else! Lilia! Keep on top of heals and be on the lookout for poisons! Daniel! Focus on speed not power right now! Follow my lead and you will all make it out alive. Welcome to your first B class monster kids!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Fluuk shattered my ice prison by heating up it\u2019s body and charged at us.</span></div></div>",

Daniel flank left! Use ice or wind magic to protect yourself!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt the slight warmth as Marsa\u2019s flame protection spell washed over me. Seconds later I saw Daniel glow a light red as well. He veered to the left as I coated my fists in ice and veered right. He dashed forward, jumping into the air and coming around in a spinning kick. I could see the wind around his legs but he made the mistake of casting the wind outwards when he connected. On any other mob that would be fine but it just served to make the flames grow higher. I saw him fall with the leather burned away and his skin bubbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarsa! Pull him back! Lilia get him back up! Daniel! Protect yourself only I said! Be glad you had fire protection!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEyes on me bird brain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic let out a commanding roar with what little magic he had that made the chicken monster focus on him again. I let the ice on my fists slide down my arm until I had blades of it coming out of my elbows. A quick slap to my knees grew another pair of ice swords from those joints as well. I jumped towards it\u2019s right flank with my arms crossed in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDance of a thousand thorns!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLeft, right, left, knee, spin, twirl, flip, jump, bend, cross slash, strike. Using wind to augment my movement speed I tore into the creature like a mini hurricane. It shot another flamethrower out of it\u2019s mouth but Marsa pulled it\u2019s head towards Jethic at the last second who did his job and took the brunt of the blow. As I flipped away Daniel came in from the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDance of the midnight devil!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHis dance was a sight to see, he used magical aura around his elbows instead of ice and spun in circles more than flipped and twisted like I had but it had style. He finally ended by hitting it in the side with an open palm, shoving it bodily across the floor towards me but his arm shattered. Bits of bone tore through his skin up to the elbow even as Lilia was throwing out her power to heal him from where she stood a short distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI continued to pound on the creature while Jethic smashed his shield in its face and body, using his little magic to keep the monster\u2019s eyes focused on him. Lilia stayed on top of the healing as Marsa began casting protect spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDaniel! Do your dance one more time on my signal! Jethic! Send it airborne as soon as Daniel\u2019s done! Marsa! Get your biggest ice spell ready and use it as soon as I finish attacking! Understand!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI heard quick assent as I told Daniel to go to town. As his palm finally smashed into the Fluuk, Jethic gave a mighty roar as he braced his legs and heaved upwards under the monsters breastbone in a giant uppercut using his shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWind and ice! Earth and thunder! Become my blade and rip asunder! Beat rush!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI uppercut the bird, sending it farther into the sky as my arms and legs were encased in the primal elemental magic. This was nothing fancy, just a straight beat down. Pummeling the underside as I took it higher and higher I finally grabbed its feathers and shoved it back to the ground while flipping over its side to begin stomping it in the back like jackhammer blows until it hit the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMarsa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI saw the ice hurtling towards the chicken\u2019s head. It began to take in a breath to blow out more fire but I slammed a wall of wind into the back of its neck just as the ice smashed into its face. There was a moment of stillness before the head exploded into tiny bits and the body dropped to the ground. Even as the blood began to pool it turned to dust and wafted away into nothingness, leaving behind three glowing red razor feathers and two black marbles. After picking them up carefully I walked over to the group who were congratulating each other. I gave them each a nod as everyone else came running up, Gregory limping slightly and holding his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou all did excellent jobs. Jethic, that was excellent tanking. You do your shield proud. Marsa, nice speed on the spells, you had a good mind for who to use them on first and what to use next without having to be told. Lilia great healing. Daniel, nice moves. Next time don\u2018t attack with the wind unless I say so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was all thanks to your orders. I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t sell yourself short Jethic. Or any of you for that matter. Taking down a B class like that can be difficult for anyone. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill it so quickly by myself and I am an A class. But I was able to go all out without worry because all of you did your jobs. Just because I told you what to do doesn\u2019t negate the fact that you still performed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey all grinned at me and my compliments even as the Arena Master nodded his head to support what I was saying. The rest of the class began complimenting me and the others as well even as Gregory limped forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you going to do about the spoils?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned towards him, about to give him a tongue lashing when Daniel stepped forward and gave him a right hook to the face that sent him sprawling on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re a god damn idiot you know that! We all knew what not to do against that thing! We knew if it transformed into either a Fluuk or a Kloo it would be out of our league. The Arena Master even warned us! But you had to go acting all big and bad! I\u2019m tired of it man! You always wind up getting me in trouble! We are done you hear me! I could have died this time! Don\u2019t talk to me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tDaniel  turned and bowed his head to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy grandfather told me to own up to my mistakes no matter the consequences. He said if I wanted to be a worthy Hunter I needed to be worthy of that title. So I\u2019m telling you now, I stole your Roller Knuckles and Gregory took your gun. I put them back because I knew it was wrong, but I don\u2019t feel right not telling you. Not after fighting next to you like this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clapped him on the shoulder and he hunched up like I was going to hit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDidn\u2019t I say if they appeared in my bags before the class was over I would forget all about it? We are square now, since they are back and class isn\u2018t over. But I thank you for telling me. That was a nice dance by the way, but it looks like it might be slightly above your skill level.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah it is. But my grandfather taught it to me before he died. It\u2019s the only one I know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGive me your hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe held it out hesitantly and I laid one of the black marbles in his palm, closing his fingers over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is an augmentation gem. It\u2019s only a level one and not high quality, but you can have a weapon maker put that in your favorite fist weapons as a protection augmentation. Then you should be able to do that dance of yours without hurting yourself. Your grandfather was right. You need to do worthy things to be a worthy Hunter. And confessing was definitely worthy to my eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI handed the other black marble to Jethic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hear you have very little magic. It must make it hard for you to tank without relying on many signature tanking spells. That was an impressive commanding shout by the way. Use this to augment your shield with a power surge ability. That should at least triple the amount of magic you can use by decreasing how much it takes out of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI handed the two girls one of the feathers each which they took almost reverently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou probably haven\u2019t heard much about Fluuk drops, just about the transformations. But these feathers are like magical tanks. As casters that is invaluable. Keep it on you and when you cast your spells it will absorb some of the excess magic that bleeds off. If you touch it the feather will give you back that magic it has stored up. It will pulse when it is full but you can siphon off the magic anytime. They will eventually wear out after many uses but until then they will be very helpful. Especially to lower level casters like you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked at all four of them again as they stared at their spoils and smiled thinly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNeedless to say each of those items are valuable in their own right. You could always sell them for the Reul if you want. I\u2019m sure they will fetch a nice price. Jethic, Daniel, if you don\u2019t know any weapon makers I will introduce you to one that specializes in augmentations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTh-thank you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waved away the thanks as I turned to leave the floor but Gregory was back on his feet and standing in my way, his eyes full of greed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo that last feather is mine right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy gaze narrowed as I saw Liz slap her forehead and shake it back and forth. I also saw the disgust on many of my classmates faces as well. They knew as well as I he didn\u2019t deserve it. Perhaps they were beginning to realize just how slimy he was. I was sure those last words had just ruined his reputation as a Hunter for life. Or at least with these people and anyone they ended up telling. Perhaps I should give him the feather simply out of pity. It might be the last spoils he ever got as a Hunter or a Hunter in training. I had a feeling his days at this academy were numbered.</span></div></div>",

The sharp tip imbedded in the cement as the other end quivered with a slight twang sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cEnjoy your spoils while you can. I have a feeling they may be your last. I don\u2019t give this to you because you earned it. I give this to you out of pity. But know this, your greed and your ego will be the death of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I shoved passed him I put my hand on his shoulder, leaning my lips close to his ear so only he could hear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust a friendly reminder, I better have my Lexington back by the time this class is over. If I don\u2019t you won\u2019t be waking up to see a sunrise ever again. And no one will ever find your body or know who did it. I\u2019m a Zelkov, I can make that happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPushing him away from me I headed back up into the bleachers to take my seat again, staring down at the floor where the Arena Master was giving a small speech about what had just happened. Telling the class he hoped they had learned something from watching us. Liz came up a moment later shaking her head to sit down beside me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIdiot. A truly greedy idiot. Even I didn\u2019t expect him to be that stupid. He just numbered his days here at the school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe glanced sideways at me before going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat is if he wakes up for school tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeard my last comment huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSins of being able to read lips. Will you really kill him if your weapon doesn\u2018t show up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head and went silent again as the groups below were rearranged and sent out to do battle again. I could see they had learned something from my fight; their movements were more confident and they worked as a team better than before. I could see how they rose up to the challenge of emulating what I had done while at the same time knowing their limits. They didn\u2019t try any crazy moves that might get them hurt and the ones issuing the orders seemed to have a good grasp of the other members capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI noticed Gregory slipping out of the arena as soon as he could and I grinned wolfishly. So the little thief wanted to live did he? Well as long as it was back I would honor my words of amnesty. He came back in a few moments later, glancing nervously up at where I was sitting. I made sure to blow him a kiss before letting the smile spread even further across my face. That caused him to turn and run away at a speed walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou are an evil man you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI kind of like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what\u2019s your angle anyway?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked up at the sky as if searching the ceiling for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHmm, about thirty five degrees North North-East at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat jokes almost as bad as some of mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I said that my lips twitched upwards anyway and she laughed back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeriously though, no angle. I just find you interesting. And I understand you like you understand me. I can\u2019t get into the talk the girls have about boys and make-up and fashion. It all seems so alien to me. I grew up to be a Hunter, that\u2019s all I really know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that I can understand and get behind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stared at the arena for a moment before talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were really impressive back there. I\u2019ll admit, you are stronger than me if you really are an A class like you said. When I took the mock Exams I came in at a solid B. That would have been a tough creature for me alone. I could have handled it if it had changed into a Kloo, but sadly my ice and wind magic is slightly lacking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell we have time, I\u2019ve got no problem working with you to make you better. I\u2019m sure the Arena Master will give us our own little area to spar in whenever we ask. That way we don\u2019t interrupt their training.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe chatted a bit more until the bell rang and I left to pick up my bag. A quick check proved that both weapons were indeed inside. With a last look around I returned to the classroom, finding my seat before anyone else even came in. As the class filed in I could already see the shunning starting. Those who sat around Gregory by at least one desk in any direction moved farther away from him. The first three were lucky and took the three empty desks around the room instead of moving their own. No one looked at or acknowledged him even when he tried to make eye contact. They weren\u2019t doing it because they wanted to get closer to me, they were doing it because of who he was and what he had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in and noted the change in the group dynamics almost instantly, not commenting on it but giving it a raised eyebrow. He went through roll call and one of the girls raised her hand when he called out for Gregory Weiss<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMr. Ghelis, there is no Gregory Weiss in this class. It seems he stole a Hunter\u2019s weapons from him and also almost got his group killed in Combat Training Class. On top of that he\u2019s a slimy conniving little weasel so you should strike his name from the records.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher looked around the room at all the heads nodding in agreement before giving the girl a bow of the head. He made a show of picking up his pen and running it through the name in his book. As he handed out papers he too shunned the boy, passing him up as he went up and down the aisles. As he returned to the blackboard to begin the History lesson an older lady with her blond hair done up in a bun that highlighted the few grey ones came into the room. The black patch over her right eye was a souvenir from a fight with her ex-husband she had won. She wore a low cut yellow dress to match her hair and I grinned as I stood up and went forward with my bag in hand before she could even whisper to the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry for the interruption sir, but Hilda is here for me. My mother probably want\u2019s me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe waved me off and I followed Hilda out into the hall<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what does my mother want with me now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s really not my place to say but a job. A protection job to be exact.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWould it by chance have anything to do with a little girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow\u2019d you know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHeard it in the background when I called earlier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAh. Your mother can give you more of the details, I really don\u2019t know all that much. I do know the child is eleven years old and lost her parents three days ago so be gentle on her ok? Even if you don\u2019t accept the job, I\u2019m sure you remember how losing someone precious to you feels.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do. And for you Hilda, I\u2019ll hold my temper in check. You\u2019ve been kind to me and treated me well. You are the only aide my mother hasn\u2019t gotten rid of after a few months and truth be told you\u2019ve grown on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThanks Riktal. You\u2019re a good boy, no matter what anyone else says. But you are too much like your mother in some things. Both of you just don\u2019t know how to interact very well on a personal level with most people for very long.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you know anything else about this girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry not really. I was actually going to be sent off elsewhere when I got the call to assist her. Which told me this was contract worthy. I was half tempted to send the new girl Inga, but I didn\u2019t think you would warm to her with her personality. Well that and she only has a day under her belt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe led me to a room that looked like your average meeting room for a council of some sort where my mother burst out of her chair to hug me around the neck and kiss my cheeks. I pushed her away before sitting down across the table and  looking from my mother to the white haired girl with scarlet eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHilda filled me in on some of it mother, but not all of it. I assume she is special, political emissaries daughter maybe? I\u2019d also like to know why me and not some licensed Hunter. There are tons as good as I am or better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf Hilda filled you in this makes it easier. She\u2019s a Monster summoner. You know how most Hunter\u2019s are on that subject. You\u2019re good with kids, you are Hunter level even if I won\u2019t allow you to take the Exams, despite our differences I trust you, and the only other person I can think of is Pelei. With his personality, he might make the situation worse even though he is a more experienced Hunter. Will you do it?\u201d</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s true I\u2019m not a licensed Hunter, so I can\u2019t ask full price a protection job like this would normally run, but I\u2019m not going to give you a full family discount either. I assume someone will be coming to take her in a day or two? Someone who can train her powers I mean.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re right darling. A friend of mine will come by in two or three days to pick Asala up. Though I should warn you she doesn\u2019t say anything and you have to pull her around everywhere. As you can see she just stares blankly at nothing holding that teddy bear. She won\u2019t eat so we have taken to sustaining her with magic, though that won\u2019t work forever, the body needs real food. Her power is a bit unstable as well, she can\u2019t control it and it seems to be affected by her emotions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut there is one other thing I want. I want you to continue to go to school even while you are protecting her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour joking right? What if she summons a monster here in the school? I might be good, but if I have an entire school full of trainees out for blood, even I will have a tough time of it. Not to mention it will be hard to effectively protect her as it is. These kids will be all over her like vultures with their constant questions and squealing of cute and adorable.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m not joking. I know it will probably be difficult but I would really appreciate it. Think of it as some specialized training for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI assume I will have proxy Hunter status on this? If things go FUBAR I don\u2019t want to be left high and dry here. There are things I can get away with if it\u2019s Hunter business I might not otherwise be able to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou already have a lot of pull being a Zelkov so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI waved those words away like they were an annoying fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to hide behind the family name if things go bad. We shouldn\u2019t be seen as special just because we are an old family and be given special treatment because of it. If I mess up that\u2019s on me, I don\u2019t want a free pass because I\u2019m a Zelkov. That\u2019s why I want proxy Hunter status.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. I\u2019ll grant it to you under my status as a Hunter, Hilda can make up the paperwork.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven as she finished saying that Hilda placed a sheet of paper in front of her with a grin and a wink at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI might be your mother\u2019s aide, but I know you well enough as well young man. I prepared it before we left just in case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother put her magical seal on it and handed it to me as I smiled back at the old woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHilda, if you were thirty years younger I\u2019d marry you on the spot. You\u2019re too good for my mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOh I know it and she knows it too. I\u2019ll settle for a peck on the cheek though. Haven\u2019t been kissed by a good looking young man in longer than I care to remember.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe chortled as I got up and kissed her cheek, throwing my arms around her neck for good measure before returning to my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve got enough saved up and left over from my living allowance to take care of her for now, but I would appreciate it if the money was in my account as soon as possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHilda was already pulling up a see through screen with a keyboard on it and typing a mile a minute with her fingers. A moment later she set her little clipboard down in front of my mother saying the money was ready to transfer, she just had to approve it. My mother put her finger on the screen and it beeped in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really are a wonder Hilda darling. I don\u2019t know what I would do without you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWither away and die I don\u2019t doubt. Or be buried under piles of paperwork and suffocate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHilda\u2019s words were met with a grin by both me and my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t happen to have the contract made up already would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHilda sighed at me dramatically with a forlorn look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m still working on it. I\u2019ll send you out the paperwork later though. Is it ok if I forge your signature to speed up the process?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d only let you because you\u2019re the only one I trust to do so. Plus your forgeries are the closest to mine anyway. Just\u2026 don\u2019t dot my i with a heart this time will you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe grinned but promised she wouldn\u2019t as my mother stood up and headed for the door. She turned to look at me with a bit of sadness in her eyes that was probably fake so I ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll be in Bornica for the next week and your father is coming with me so hold down the fort here and stay out of trouble.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t I always hold down the fort? As for trouble, I can\u2019t make promises I probably can\u2019t keep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a blown kiss she left the room with Hilda close on her heels. Once she was gone I moved around the table to sit next to the girl who stared at me blankly. Her clothes and hair were dirty as well as frayed around the edges. She had probably been sleeping in them the last few days and she didn\u2019t have any others. Looking both ways as if to make sure no one else was in the room even though we were obviously alone I finally focused on the girl, speaking in a whisper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou can quit pretending you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on now. I know you can hear me at least. You might have had my mother and everyone else fooled but not me. You\u2019ve been squeezing that bear this whole time and that takes a conscious effort. Your fingers keep twitching ever so slightly too when we were talking about you. As if you were afraid. I\u2019m not going to hurt you. In fact I am probably the best person for you to know right now. I\u2019ve got experience as a big brother you see and I\u2019m pretty good at it if I do say so myself. I won\u2019t force anything on you, like making you talk or anything but I would like it if I saw a bit of life in your beautiful eyes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe squeezed the bear slightly but finally blinked and looked at me, a bit of intelligence in her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere, that wasn\u2019t so hard now was it? So how about we get to know each other a little before the next class starts huh? I\u2019ll ask some simple yes or no answers. You can either shake your head or simply do nothing if you don\u2019t want to answer. Is that ok with you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t A small head nod. Good I was getting somewhere. It wasn\u2019t that hard to deal with kids, you just had to let them know you recognized them as an individual and made them feel important. Anyone could do it, but I found adults tended to get caught up in their own little worlds, always wanting to make everything go by quickly or wanted everything done right that second. Little kids picked up on that fast, which was probably part of the reason she had shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI spent the next twenty minutes until the bell rang talking with the little girl, though she never actually said a word. I had her giggling at my funny faces and antics a few times as I helped her relieve some of her stress and grief she was holding in. I made it my personal mission to help her with that grief while she was with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTaking her by the hand I led her to the final class of the day. She was slightly nervous but she at least trusted me enough now to believe me when I said it would be ok. I managed to catch the teacher out in the hall before he went into the room, giving him a brief rundown of what was going on. He nodded his head as he looked down at the girl and then up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDo you want to introduce her or would you rather I take care of it for you?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Squeezing the girls hand and whispering it would be all right I led her through the door with my weapons slung on my right shoulder. The class eyed us with shock and no little interest as I stood in front of the room. The girl clutched my hand, half hiding behind my leg as I heard some of the girls whispering about how cute she was. Leave it to a female to go crazy over kids and cute things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis is Asala. Due to some circumstances, I have taken on the job of protecting her for the next few days. It is around the clock protection meaning she will be joining me for classes until she leaves. She is very shy and at the moment afraid of people and crowds in general. It\u2019s taken me some time to get her to trust me and to act a bit more normal, but I ask that you all respect my wishes to stay away from both her and me. She has some unstable powers that might harm someone if she gets frightened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf circumstances change and she so desires, I will allow you to come nearer. But until such a time you will do more harm than good by ignoring my request. Right now she is my top priority over everything else. That includes what little I might care about my reputation or my relationship with any one of you. Doubt me at your peril but I will not hesitate to apply force if need be on you. Just act like she isn\u2019t here, she will be gone in two or three days anyways. Thank you for your time and for ceding to my wishes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI led Asala down the aisle to my desk, setting her up closer to the wall before snagging an empty chair for myself. I saw the teacher give me a nod and added a few words of his own about the importance of taking a job and how such things can be conducted. It wasn\u2019t exactly about Monster Tactics, but I supposed this was a good practical lesson in action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the glances looking back at us, mostly from the girls, but there were a few from the guys as well. While the lesson went on I whispered to Asala and played a few games to keep her occupied, all the while learning more about her even without any words being spoken. I got her to communicate with me a bit using writing, though her words were misspelled at times and her handwriting a bit shaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI drew funny pictures and made funny faces all in a calculated plan to make her forget her grief for the moment. It would eventually spill out of course, and this was designed to instigate that event as well. It sounded cruel, but if she held it all inside, it would consume her. I was sure a part of her didn\u2019t want anyone else seeing her give in to her tears, since my mother and whoever else had handled her had probably said things like \u201cdon\u2019t cry\u201d and \u201cget over it already.\u201d People seemed to think it was some sort of sin to grieve for too long, as if those feelings magically went away. Well they could go away suddenly with drugs and such, but there was nothing magical about those items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf I could get her to cry in front of me that was all well and good, I\u2019d be able to comfort her and help that process along even more. But if she decided to hide in the bathroom or somewhere else alone to cry, that would also work. As long as she let it all out instead of holding it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPlus, knowing from experience with special abilities like monster summoning, part of the instability of that power came from instability in her environment. That whole mess of emotions inside that were conflicting with each other was definitely a factor, but so too was her thoughts that she kept getting moved around, she had no family or anyone she could trust, and no one caring about her. Add in the fact that the only thing she owned was what she had on her right now and you had a recipe for instability. It would be hard for anyone to cope with, let alone a skinny four and a half foot tall eleven year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell finally rang as I grinned over at Asala.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee told you it would be fine, All you had to do was trust me. Now how about we go downtown to get you some new threads. Because that dress definitely has to get burned. It\u2019s an affront to all of humanity. After that we will get a bite to eat and I\u2019ll treat you to some of the best banana sundae you have ever tasted. By the time we get home you\u2019ll feel like a million Reul. Will you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head with a bit of enthusiasm, the prospect of sweets and shopping appealing to her like it always had with Olia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe can come too if you want. I\u2019m sure she will be glad to have another girl there. Plus it will make buying certain things easier on you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI glared at the two girls lingering by the front of the class listening to my conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStay out of our personal matters please. I didn\u2019t ask you to come and I don\u2019t need your help. Do you think I am not perfectly capable of taking a girl out shopping? Even if I didn\u2019t have some sense of taste, she knows what she likes just fine. And if you were obliquely referring to things like undergarments and personal hygiene items then I still don\u2019t need you. I\u2019m capable of helping her get those as well without acting like a complete retard or blushing like it was the first time I saw a naked body of the opposite sex. Now is there any other opinions I don\u2019t need from you that you wish to give?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe two girls blushed and hurried out of the room as I glanced over at Asala with a raised eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid I saw something wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe giggled a little bit before shaking her head with a grin spreading across her face. Leading her by the hand towards the door I was reminded of the way I used to walk like this with Olia. Softly, without looking at the little girl I let a few words escape my lips without meaning to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you Asala. For making me feel like a big brother again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe hugged me in the side as we walked as if to say I was welcomed and I ruffled her hair. My stride broke for just a second as I looked down at the little girl who looked back up at me with those large trusting eyes. I thought for sure she had said something but it had been so soft as to barely register in my ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDid you say something?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe blinked at me but offered no comment or headshake. Finally she cocked her head to the side as if to ask what was wrong, her eyebrows furrowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSorry, I must have imagined it. Pay me no mind, it\u2019s been a long day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head in agreement as we left through the front gates and down the road towards town. Still I couldn\u2019t get that tiny soft ghost voice out of my mind. Or the single word it had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFamily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends this day for Riktal. Or at least this window of his life. Truly these windows are a fickle thing. They close and open again whenever they wish. Perhaps next time it will stay open until the sun sets, perhaps it will close after he utters only a single word. Even I who am lord of this place cannot predict the fickle nature of these windows. Perhaps it has something to do with the choices made that brought this fate to pass. Or perhaps there is a grand designer over even me who is looking down and controlling the windows at his or her whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again travel and choose the fates and the destiny of our young Hunter friend. Or perhaps next time a new window will have opened for you to gaze through. A new tale for you to see and new choices for you to make for another unknowing person. Until then, choose wisely the route you wish your life to take.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tI really didn\u2019t feel like dealing with the hassle so asked the teacher to let the class know, simply asking him to point out I would like them to stay away if they could. He gave me an affirmative nod before entering the room shortly before me. The girl stuck close to me as I escorted her to the back of the room, sitting her down before going and grabbing an extra chair for myself. The teacher gave the class the short introduction and relayed my message to stay away if they could before turning to his lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe girl kept her head down, holding the bear up to her face while holding onto my tunic. From the looks I kept getting I figured that might be the best bet. I kept whispering to her that it would be fine, even resorting to playing simple games of pen and paper to keep her occupied. I didn\u2019t really pay attention to the class though, more interested in keeping her from accidentally summoning a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI let a part of my mind go over the meeting with my mother wondering what I might have been able to do differently. I hadn\u2019t been lying when I said she had caught me in a good mood, a fact I was  bit surprised about. Looking back on the day it hadn\u2019t been so bad. Putting aside some of the minor annoyances and negative things that had happened, I was feeling good. My mother hadn\u2019t even got my blood boiling like she usually did and that was a feat in and of itself. Perhaps it was because Hilda was there. Or perhaps because my mother hadn\u2019t been here long or talked too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMaybe it had to do with meeting Liz and the way talking with her put me at ease as a kindred spirit. Whatever the case, it felt refreshing to not end up arguing with my mother after only a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlancing over at the girl who was quietly drawing on a piece of paper I smiled to myself. It also felt good to act like a big brother again. Olia had liked to draw as well, though she had never been as good as Asala. By the looks of her picture, the girl had an affinity for straight edges and less on the curves. I thought she might make a good engineer or architect drawer since she had an eye for proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though she still refused to speak I did get her to communicate with me through writing. Her spelling wasn\u2019t all that great and her letters were still a little shaky in places but it was passable. So we wrote back and forth throughout the class even making her grin at the funny faces I drew for her. I asked if she wanted to go into town to buy new clothes and she said yes. At which point I drew a distorted man wearing a pair of panties on his head while pointing at a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat elicited a giggle which caused heads to turn. When she noticed the stares she shrunk into herself again. I put my arm around her shoulder and gave everyone a raised eyebrow of defiance, causing them all to return to their studies. My constant reassurance that nothing would happen and the way I mocked her ability put her at ease and let her get through this first class. From tomorrow onward it would be much easier going. It was simply the first step that was always the hardest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs soon as the bell rang a few girls converged on us. The boys at least had accepted my request to be left alone for whatever reasons, but there was something about children, babies, and cute things that girls just couldn\u2019t leave alone. It was doubly worse since Asala was a cute kid with a small  frame. A frame she tried hiding behind my legs as they came towards us while stuffing her bear to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI held up my hand before any of them could get a word out, making two of them close their mouths on the words that never made it to their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI asked for you all to respect my wishes and stay away for the next day or two. The girl is shy and afraid of people on the whole. She doesn\u2019t need people hovering around making her feel more scared than she already is. Right now I am on a job and my client is the most important thing to me. I don\u2019t care if you want to get to know her better or butter up to me or anything else, just please turn and walk away. I\u2019m in a good mood right now and don\u2019t want any trouble. If she feels up to being around people tomorrow then that is a different matter. As it stands just drop it for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey blinked at me as the girl continued to clutch at the back of my legs with her eyes squeezed shut. Finally they all just turned and left, not a word of agreement or anything which I was grateful for. Kneeling down, I stroked the girl\u2019s hair gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSee? I told you I wouldn\u2019t let anything bad happen. I\u2019ll protect you from all the scary things, even if they are alien girl monsters like that. No one will take me away from your side for any reason. Like I told them, right now you are the most important thing to me. That includes my own personal relationships and reputation. What\u2019s important is you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI poked her in the nose as I finished talking, giving her a sly wink along with the lopsided smile that crept onto my face. Finally she smiled back and nodded that she understood before I stood back up and offered her my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cCome on, lets go get you some spiffy new clothes and get you out of that thing. It\u2019s making my lips pucker just looking at it. Then I know a nice quite restaurant you will love. It has this home made chocolate banana sundae that will make you think you\u2019ve just gone to heaven. I\u2019ll buy it for you if you promise to eat some real food. Is it a deal?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer eyes lit up at the mention of sweets as I knew they would, no child seemed to be able to resist sweets. At least, Olia never could. She took my hand with an energetic bob of her head and I led her out of the room, hiking my weapons farther up onto my left shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI had a feeling everything would turn out just fine. I had no real proof to base that on, just a gut instinct. But right now I didn\u2019t worry too much about anything like that. I felt like I had a family again, that was all that mattered. I looked down at the girl who was staring up at me with those big round eyes of hers. When she saw me looking she showed me a mouth full of teeth. I imagined she felt the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt seems this window is closing traveler. Do you approve of the fate our young friend ended up with by your hands? Were the decisions easy or hard to make? Did you learn something about yourself while living through his eyes? Were your choices solely your own or did you chose how you felt Riktal would have chosen? In the end did your choices actually make a difference? Would fate have ended this way no matter what you did?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOr perhaps you really had no true choice at all? Perhaps the web of destiny influenced your decisions on a subconscious level to create the path you did. Creating scenarios and choosing words to pull at your heartstrings or bias you in one direction or another making it so you felt there was only one real answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJoin me again traveler, and chose a new fate for our young hero. That is, if you can.</span></div></div>",

I could almost feel her eyes burning into the top of my head as I looked at the tabletop deep in thought. If my hair wasn\u2019t already the color of fire that gaze would have dyed my hair for me. Finally I replaced the frames on my face and shook my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t. I feel for the girl, I really do. But this is where you wanted me. Though I don\u2019t know your reasons, and trust me I really wish I did, you decided to send me here. As much as I might love to take this job, being a Hunter is all about trust. If I can\u2019t be trusted to stick to this course then how can I expect others to trust me. This is a job for a licensed professional, not an under the table deal of convenience. I can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t bend that for even you mother. Isn\u2019t that what you and father taught me after all?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWon\u2019t you reconsider darling? Please? Just this once?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. if I bend just this once, what will be the next thing I bend my morals on? I\u2019ve made enough bad choices and my temper has gotten me into enough trouble everywhere I go. I decided to make a fresh start at this school. Even if I don\u2019t want to be here, I am working with what I have been given, another thing you taught me. I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve bent my morals to suite my desires before, but not this time. If I am starting fresh I need to renew my morals as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI dug into my bag and pulled out a small box with a button on the side, hefting it in my hand a moment as a stared at it in thought. Finally I nodded before clenching it in my hand. Setting it  down gently I returned my eyes to both my mother and the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut there is one thing I will do for you though before you take her to Pelei that might make your life easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGoing around the table, I knelt in front of the girl, taking one of her limp hands and giving it a squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a secret Asala. One just between me and you. If you believe I am telling the truth then hand me your bear for just a little bit ok? If you don\u2019t believe me you don\u2019t have to do anything at all. So really there\u2019s no downside in it for you. In the end you will still have your bear. Now for the secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI leaned close to her ear, cupping my hands so no one else could hear me. I told her I knew she could tell what was going on and if she gave me her bear I would make it magical and able to protect her from all harm. So if she accidentally summoned a monster it couldn\u2019t hurt her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOnce I was done I sat back on my haunches and waited. For a full minute nothing happened but then she finally held the bear out to me as her eyes filled with  bit of worry. I took the stuffed animal like it was made of gold back around the table and sat down in my chair again. As I pulled a pair of scissors out of a side pocket to cut along the side seam I began to talk to the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know I used to be really bad at sewing. And I mean really bad. The first time I sewed something up my little sister laughed herself to tears. But you know what? I got really good at it until you couldn\u2019t tell my stitches from a professionals.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLaying the bear on it\u2019s side while she began to reach for it because of what I was doing, I pulled out a micro tool kit and began tearing the box apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy little sister was always ripping her clothes or her stuffed animals. And she would always bring them to me to be fixed up. That\u2019s how I got to be so good. That little girl who had laughed at my sewing wanted me to fix her ripped items.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPulling out the shard of heart crystal and the mess of wires carefully I began inserting it into the bear, ending up taking it\u2019s eyes off for a moment. This would be a better job then if I only had a few moments. This would be no jury rigged artifact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat I am putting in here is a crystal matrix. You find them in just about every artifact. These wires are made of spun gold and silver specially treated for conducting magic. This small shard is like a big old battery that holds a massive amount of magic to power the spell set into the matrix. This spell has one job only, to make a protection barrier around a single person or area.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time alone, so I\u2019ve ended up going into town and learning a bit about all the different types of jobs out there. From weapon making to artifact appraising to augmentations. Now I\u2019m no master crafter, but I\u2019m pretty passable if I do say so myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI went silent as I stuck my tongue out of the side of my mouth and focused on connecting the ends of the matrix to the skin of the bear in such a way that it would activate the way I wanted it to. Once I was done I began sewing the eyes back on until you couldn\u2019t even tell they had been taken off before starting on the seam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause I know how Pelei is, and I know how lonely it can be not having someone to talk to I\u2019m going to cast an extra special magic on this bear that I once cast for my little sister. It won\u2019t last forever though but I think you will like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tFinishing up my sewing job I reached into my bag for a bit of spare gold wiring I kept there. Unwinding a little of it I snipped off four pieces the size of my fingernail, closing my eyes and sending my power into them until they glowed with their own light. Once I was sure they were filled to the brim with my energy I set each sliver on one of the paws until the gold sunk into the fur and disappeared. Looking at the bear and then the girl I reached across the table and mimed plucking something invisible from her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind but I just borrowed your mom and dad\u2019s voices for a bit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPretending to hold the struggling voices in my hand I pressed it against the bears lips, covering it with my other hand and whispering into the cupped area like I had whispered to her while the bear glowed a faint purple color. Letting out a tired sigh as I sat back I grinned at her before handing the animal back. She took it with a question in her eyes and my grin grew even wider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGo ahead and squeeze it around the middle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen she did, a dull orange shield rose around her body, pushing the table and even my mother away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOnly things you want to come inside with you will be able to, all you have to do is think it and the spell will do the rest. But you are probably wondering what magic I put on it of my own aren\u2019t you? Well try squeezing each of his paws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid sweetie\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m here with you honey\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI love you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEach of those small phrases seemed to echo in the air, the voices decidedly not mine. They were her parents voices. Her eyes welled up a bit as she kept pressing them over and over, the voice saying the line alternating between the male and the female.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow your parents will help protect you so you don\u2019t have to be so scared anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother gasped at the bear and then at me. Her bulging eyes and the way her mouth opened and closed made me think of a drowning fish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cH-how did you do that! The shield thing I understand but I\u2019ve never seen anything like that kind of spell before! That\u2019s her parent\u2019s voices!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I got up, throwing my sewing kit and everything else back in my bag before hefting it to my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s magic.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tOn my way out the door Hilda stopped me with a hand on my shoulder, whispering into my ear so only I could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you for not blowing up on your mother and doing what you did. You kept your promise to be nice even if you declined. You\u2019ve grown into a fine young man and are worthy of the title of Hunter, even if you don\u2019t have a license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much but I did what I could.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo Riktal, it was more than you think. I\u2019m an old woman, I know the value of grieving, and that little girl can now do it properly thanks to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI kissed her on the cheek before giving her my parting words, letting them barely pass my lips as I uttered them next to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake care of my mother Hilda. You know me better than anyone else so you know I do still love her even if she makes me so angry all the time. I might not admit it because of our differences, but I\u2019ve never wished her dead or anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I left the room, turning right to head towards the stairs up to my next class. I only made it a few steps when the door burst open. I turned around in time for the girls tiny frame to run headlong into me as she wrapped her arms around my waist and wouldn\u2019t let go. My mother came out a second later, coming forward to grab the girls arm. An orange shield suddenly appeared around the two of us and my mother was pushed back, her grip being torn off by the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother looked at the two of us and grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell it seems the decision has been made for you, whether you like it or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProbably shouldn\u2019t have done that bit with the bear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tReaching down to stroke the girls hair I smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019d do it a thousand times more if I had to. That is one decision I\u2019ll never once regret making.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTake care of her darling, someone will be around in a few days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI considered trying to make a deal to get some money or something out of this but decided not to, I really had no footing so to speak, this girl would probably stick to me like glue regardless so I had no strong bargaining chips. As my mother was about to turn around she gave me her final parting words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI still expect you to go to classes like normal. With your desire for a fresh start, if you can\u2019t bend them for me I\u2019m sure you would never forgive bending them for your own personal ease.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re evil mother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Try to act as if she isn\u2019t here if you can. I\u2019ll do my best to minimize the amount of trouble she causes everyone. But I do also ask you not get to close if you can help it, she has a few personal issues about who she trusts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI gave the class I slight bow as Asala squeezed the right paw again to hear her mother\u2019s voice softly say \u201cI\u2019m here with you honey\u201d with a distant smile on her face. I led the girl to my desk in the back, snagging an empty chair and getting us both comfortable. The girl didn\u2019t seem to hear the girls in the class whispering about how cute she was but I did. I also ignored those whispers since they were irrelevant. Even though Asala was cute with her big crimson eyes, silver hair, and petite frame. It didn\u2019t change how I would do my job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe sat there hugging her bear lightly with her eyes closed. Not enough to activate the shield but enough to give her comfort. She had already found the activation point needed for her squeezes within less than five minutes of having the artifact installed. She was a very smart little girl. She kept pressing the left paw over and over to hear her parents saying \u201cI love you\u201d with that same far off look of bliss. I knew it probably made it difficult for the class to concentrate, even after I cast a small wind wall to muffle the noise a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI wasn\u2019t going to stop her though, she was dealing with her grief. At least a part of it. When she touched the left foot and heard her father say don\u2019t be afraid, she finally broke. I had been watching her closely, knowing this was going to happen if she kept that up. So when she began crying I quickly cast the spell I had been setting up, melting the floor and walls around us to form a bubble. Encasing us in our own private little world away from the eyes that were beginning to turn and look. Illuminating the area I took her into my arms and stroked her hair. I couldn\u2019t block out the fact that everyone could hear us but this little girl needed my help. I couldn\u2019t worry about what was going on outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know, I know, it hurts doesn\u2019t it? Losing your parents so suddenly, being pulled every which way by stranger after stranger. Thrown into places you don\u2019t know and never even heard of while being told to do this and do that. You\u2019ve got nothing left of your old life except what you\u2019re wearing and that single teddy bear. It\u2019s not easy, in fact it\u2019s really hard. Every little thing seems to make it hurt worse and you think you are supposed to be strong, supposed to keep it all in.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut you know what? That\u2019s not true. Some people deal with grief better than others. And they think that everyone should deal with it the same way they do. But grief is the bodies way of telling you what you should be doing. It becomes a struggle sometimes sweetie. Some days are worse than others, and it never really goes away. But it does get easier to bear, easier to face each day. But sometimes\u2026 sometimes that pain comes back even years later. Some face reminds you of the one you lost, some action you did together, a song, a joke. It could be any little thing and that pain comes back. So remember this feeling, because this feeling is proof that they were alive. Proof that you loved them enough to be so sad that they are gone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut don\u2019t let it consume you. Find something to live for each and every day, no matter how small or insignificant. Because life moves on regardless of our feelings. We can\u2019t halt the flow of time, we can\u2019t turn back the clocks, but what we can do is live. Live and do their memories proud. Live and prove that they lived. You will laugh again and smile again without feeling like you are somehow dishonoring their memory. And that thought too is going to hurt. But that pain, that pain you feel will make you grow stronger. It will make those happy moments all the better.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sure all that time you spent with them wasn\u2019t filled with nothing but sadness. I\u2019m sure there was joy and other good times. Remember those times and not how they died. Because that\u2019s proving how they lived. The fact that they are dead does not negate those facts. That\u2019s why you remember everything. The good and the bad, because they are all precious memories that no one can ever take away from you. They are all proof that they existed and they loved you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe continued to bawl as I knelt there on both knees holding her close and rocking her back and forth. Bawled until she began to do the hiccup cry. Bawled until it almost sounded like she was going to choke for lack of air. But my soothing words of comfort and my soft touch finally calmed her down as she cried herself out. Gently I pushed her away from me and looked her up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere? Feel a bit better now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head while wiping her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood, but it looks like I need a new tunic, this one is as green as that dress of yours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThat elicited a small hiccupping chuckle from her as I gave her a wink while pulling a handkerchief out of my pouch. I created a bit of water to soak it in and began cleaning up her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI learned long ago never leave home without one of these things. They come in useful for any number of emergencies. But really, we need to do something about those clothes. I think after school we go shopping. A few new dresses that look better on you, some new shoes, a few accessories and you will feel right at home. Oh and can\u2019t forget food. A big hearty meal with some ice cream for desert. You look like a chocolate and strawberry kind of girl to me am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick head nod as I grinned even wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI thought so. I\u2019m partial to the spearmint twist myself. So, you think you are ready to face the world again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAt her nod I sent my power out into the dome, causing it to melt back into it\u2019s former shapes as I stood up from the cramped space. I looked around the room at everyone who was staring at me, giving them all a raised eyebrow as if daring them to say something negative. I saw a few wet eyes and a few dreamy looks of adoration from many of the girls. I was half expecting some of them to sigh and swoon any moment. Or maybe let out a scream with words like so romantic or some other such nonsense on their lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe guys for their part were more composed, but I saw a few of them holding back tears as well. I had a feeling I had just become Mr. Popular in the room. The one the guys wanted to emulate while at the same time feeling jealous of and the one the girls all suddenly thought would make the perfect father and boyfriend. Little did they know the real me. Liz grinned evilly at me since she knew exactly what was going on in everyone\u2019s minds as well. Probably better than I did. I faced the entire room and gave a small bow before directing another one at the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI apologize for the sudden outburst or if it startled anyone. As I said before, she is a bit unstable. Part of my job is giving her some of that stability back. I did not mean to cause such an interruption to the class and I will try not to let it happen again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI sat back in my chair where Asala promptly leaned her head on my side and began to play with her bear. I might understand her mind for the most part but some of the things she did or thought was still a mystery.\tAfter a few moments of staring at the two of us and me looking straight ahead, the class finally resumed a more normal pace. It took the teacher only a few seconds to get back into his teaching. He was a Hunter, this was nothing new to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe rest of the class went smoothly and Asala didn\u2019t have another outburst. I could see the sorrow still haunting her eyes but for right now the largest portion of the grief had been dealt with. When the bell rang almost all of the girls converged on me saying how wonderful, moving and amazing I had been. As they began crowding closer Asala wrapped her hands around my waist while activating the shield. If the spell hadn\u2019t pushed them all back I was sure the glare and the pinched lips she directed at them would have. Resting my hand gently on her head I grinned at the group outside the protective barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt seems Asala has spoken. She considers me her own personal property and she seems to be telling you all quite clearly to keep your hands off. I\u2019d listen if I were you, no clue what she might do if she got angry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey tried telling the little girl they weren\u2019t trying to take me from her but she continued to glare and not drop the shield until they all went away. If the grin on my face got any wider I was sure the ends would touch behind my head. I ruffled her hair again as she finally lowered her shield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou didn\u2019t believe them either huh? Able to tell they wanted to sink their claws into me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head in affirmation even as I picked up my bag and headed towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI pity the man you marry someday little girl. He\u2019s going to have a hard time keeping up with you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs she took my hand out in the hall she pointed at me and then herself. I wasn\u2019t sure if she meant she was going to marry me or something else entirely. And I wasn\u2019t sure I wanted to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSometimes our destinies are beyond our control. Entwined and linked in unseen ways. Brought about by a slip of the tongue, or one thought drifting to the top of the mind over another. How easily could young Riktal have focused on the few negative aspects of his day? How differently would that change the outcome of everything? Even emotions and thoughts can be a choice, just as action and inaction. Even if they are automatic thoughts or instant emotional outbursts, they are still at their core, choices. <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n    Come again fair traveler and make new choices to see where they lead. Perhaps those choices will tell you something about yourself you never knew before.</span></div></div>",

He didn\u2019t even deserve what little pity I might have for him. Someone who would put his comrades in jeopardy like that even after being warned wasn\u2019t worth any kindness in my eyes. It was best not to feed such egos even a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cArena Master. You know the skills of the people in this class better then me. In your opinion who here could most benefit from and is worthy of this item?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou don\u2019t want it yourself? You more than earned it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ve already got augmentations and other items that are of a higher grade than this and I don\u2019t need the money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master thought for a moment, pulling out his little black control box and bringing up a list of stats that only he could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAmir. He\u2019s a sword and pistol heavy attacker but his magic levels are slightly lower then the others. But he still manages to hold his own against a caster heavy opponent.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe boy in question looked surprised that he had been the one chosen. I had left the decision up to the teacher so their would be no dissension among the class or whispers of such petty things like favoritism or some power play. Everyone knew the Master of the arena was as impartial as they came. And the hardest of all the Hunter\u2019s teaching at this school. It was his job to turn them all into fighting machines. He sent them out to ultimately live or die. If he went easy on anyone that could be the difference between them avoiding the killing blow or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWalking over to the boy I handed the item to him quill first and told him to use it well. After he thanked me with only a slight stutter I returned to my seat in the bleachers. Though not before gripping Gregory\u2019s shoulder and whispering into his ear so only he could hear that I would kill him if my Lexington wasn\u2019t in my bag by the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe Arena Master talked a bit about what everyone had seen and heard. Stressing the importance of the Hunter\u2019s codes, both the written and the unwritten ones. Pointing out the way I had handled the situation and also why I had chosen the way I had. It was true there were a few other ways I could have handled the situation, but that one had been the one with the lowest amount of risk to life and limb. After he was done talking he rearranged the groups and sent them back out onto the field where I could already tell they were more confident and better organized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt was around that time Liz sat back down next to me after finishing up helping the three with the feather\u2019s attach them to weapons or shirts so they wouldn\u2019t get hurt. Quickly showing them how to pull out the power when they needed to. Gregory ran out of the room as soon as he could, I assumed to return my weapon before the bell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo you would kill him and use your name to cover it all up huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLip reading?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLip reading.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll make a note of that for later. But yes I would. Better if he dies than he hurt some innocent people with my weapon. Besides, he\u2019s a parasite that should be purged. The world has enough troubles without the likes of him in our ranks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI agree. It might sound counter productive to our code as Hunter\u2019s but we have to look out for the good of the people, not just the good of the Hunter union. I mean look at the state the union is in now because we forgot that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know, all the corruption and the secret deals the union has with about half the world governments.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFirst I heard of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? I thought for sure you knew all about it since your family is neck deep in overthrowing it. Thought that was part of the reason you were here, because you didn\u2019t want to join the union just yet until the new system was in place. Or perhaps weren\u2018t allowed to like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow do you know all this?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy parents and brother are all in on it too. They work closely with yours a lot. It\u2019s part of the reason I\u2019m living alone here in Efenbis. They forbid me from taking the Exam and working from the inside. And then after the assassination attempt they thought to send me away into obscurity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell this is all news to me. It makes a few things clear to me now, but it\u2019s a shame my mother and father couldn\u2019t trust me enough with this information. Thank you for telling me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo problem. I really don\u2019t get why they would keep you in the dark but personally I don\u2019t agree. You\u2019ve got a right to know the kind of world you live in. That knowledge might save your life one day. Or alter the decisions you make.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe continued to chat a bit more after that, pointing out flaws and strengths in our classmates below. Describing what could be done differently and ways they could improve even more. At the same time we got to know each other a little better, learning small things about the other such as likes and dislikes. She also continued to fill me in on bits and pieces of what she knew about the secret war going on in the Hunter\u2019s union.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWhen the bell finally rang we went our separate ways with a quick wave. Everyone was looking at me as I walked into the room and went over to my bag. There was a hushed expectation in the air as I looked inside before zipping it up and throwing it on my shoulder. Glancing around the room I met Gregory\u2019s eyes, feeling my lip curl in a sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re lucky this time you little thief. But next time anything comes up missing, even a half-chewed pencil, I\u2019m gunning for you. I don\u2019t care if you weren\u2019t even at school on the day it happened. I will assume you set it up and retaliate. So you had best hope there is no one here that you have really ticked off lately that is out for your blood. Or you might find them taking from me just so I can pummel you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI left the room then, feeling the bloodthirsty smile contorting my lips. It had been a small bit of revenge, implanting the idea into their heads as a way for them to get to the boy. He would try valiantly to forge alliances but would ultimately fail once word of his actions spread through the school. Everyone would enact Lapiiree on him, an absolute form of shunning that would ruin his name, reputation and basically any chance of becoming a Hunter for him or any future generation of his family for a long time to come. Women that were interested in him as a potential boyfriend or husband would break all ties, even if they weren\u2019t Hunter\u2019s themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf he had enough connections and a glib enough tongue he could stop that from happening, but I doubted he had the money or the connections for such a feat. That was the way of things in our little society of heroes. Even if everyone else thought it might be nothing more than a stupid little prank done by a snot nosed kid, the Hunter world didn\u2019t tolerate it. Not when we were supposed to be the role models for the rest of the world. Such small thoughtless stupid pranks now would grow into thoughtless big blunders when the fate of thousands were on the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I passed the bathroom I felt the urges of my bladder. It wasn\u2019t that insistent and I knew from experience it was only because I was so worked up over not only what Gregory had done but the revelations Liz had told me that my mother and father had kept secret. I just needed a few moments to calm down and I would be fine.</span></div></div>",

What I needed to do was calm down. Wasn\u2019t that how you usually got into trouble Riktal? You got angry for whatever reason, then you hit or yelled at people and things, then you regret your actions afterwards. You can control it this time. This is a fresh start remember. You control your own destiny and your own actions Riktal Zelkov.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBy the time I had calmed myself down while standing in the hall and gotten back to class, the shunning of Gregory was already underway. There was a noticeable space cleared around him as everyone who could had changed seats or simply shoved their desks farther away. People refused eye contact with him and even went out of their way to avoid him. Going the long way around his desk to get to friends instead of simply going straight through like they normally would. He even tried saying a few words but the other kids talked over him or ignored him completely. I gave it a week at most before he dropped out of the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher came in and began role call after having noted the new balance of power in the room. One of the girls shot up her hand as he called out the boys name and Gregory answered he was here. When he called on her she let a small look of sadness cross her face. She quickly told the teacher there was no Gregory Weiss in this class and there never had been, giving a brief explanation of why. Looking around the room Mr. Ghelis nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThank you Emeline for letting me know. I will make sure to inform the other teachers of this fact. Wouldn\u2019t want to be making fools of ourselves now would we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith great care he picked up his pen and ran a line through his book before continuing the role call. I could see Gregory getting nervous now, talking loudly to try and get the teachers attention. When the teacher continued to ignore him the boy even went so far as to get out of his seat and grab the teacher by the shirt. The teacher didn\u2019t even blink or react, simply began his lesson an the Cawmacaw bird over the boys pleas. He wouldn\u2019t even bend so far as to remove his hands. As far as he was concerned right now the boy was a ghost. Such was the way of the Lapiiree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe only time this shunning would be unbent enough to give even an inkling that he existed was if he became a danger to the safety of innocent people or anyone in the class. If he decided to try and kill the teacher, he would be stopped, but that would be the only time the teacher or anyone would recognize him. He would be given one or two chances if he took that route though, otherwise he would be killed as little more than an afterthought. This level of treatment had been known to make even the strongest men go insane. It was one of the reasons why so many Hunter\u2019s and those in training to become one kept to the codes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe teacher had barely begun his lesson though when my mother\u2019s aide Hilda came into the room. Her blond and gray hair done up in a tidy bun and the light yellow dress almost matching it perfectly. The low cut cleavage proved that while she might be getting on in years, age had been kind to her slightly plump figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPicking up my weapons I headed for the door with a slight smile for the old woman before she had a chance to whisper anything to the teacher. I let him know the woman was here for me, knowing it was actually my mother who wanted me and not her. But that was fine, I had a few things to discuss with my mother as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood to see you Hilda.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou too Riktal, it\u2019s been a while. You\u2019ve grown since I last saw you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re imagining things, you\u2019ve just gotten shorter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave a small chuckle as a twinkle came to her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps I have. I always have fought a losing battle with gravity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo how many aides has she gone through since Selka was it? Wait no, Selka was on the Gitsune job, last time I saw you was on the Jallabin mission. So Haddy I think her name was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was Harsa, and only two. The new ones are Henry and Inga. Though honestly I can\u2019t see either of them staying long either before she gets tired of them. They are good at their job, don\u2019t get me wrong, just\u2026 too uptight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThey were all good at their jobs. I was even impressed by a few of them. Like that George fellow. He had an amazing head for analyzing things and I could actually get along with him. I thought for sure he would be more permanent after he managed to last four months longer than anyone else. Not to mention he was an ex-Hunter so he knew the job well. But then my mother got one of those flights of fancy and fired him for no reason.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes. He was such a good looking man too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI looked sideways at the old woman with a raised eyebrow and she returned the stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat? When you get to be my age you appreciate what you can get. Even if it\u2019s just a bit of eye candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI chuckled a bit as we came to the meeting room door. Before I could open it though she stopped me with a hand on my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal, you hide it well but I see you\u2019re angry at your mother over something. Please, for my sake don\u2019t go in their half cocked. At least try to listen to her will you? I\u2019ve known you since before Olia died and you are like family to me. I more than anyone understand you and I know how you end up regretting the choices you make when you are like this. You might not believe it, but she really isn\u2019t trying to purposefully anger you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI laid my hand on top of hers with a soft curve of the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHilda, You are one of the few people that can put up with my mother and I have no clue how you manage to keep her from firing you like everyone else. But the best I can do is say I will try. I can\u2019t make promises I\u2019m not sure I can keep. But know that if she ever does fire you, I wouldn\u2019t mind if you became my aide when I become a Hunter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I slipped her hand off my arm and entered the room to face my mother who jumped up to shower me with hugs and kisses in her usual way. I stood rigidly waiting for her to get done, waiting patiently for the right time to knock her down a notch. I didn\u2019t even bother with the usual veiled hostility and banter, simply sat across the table and clasped my hands. She resumed her seat next to a thin girl with red irises and silver locks holding a tattered teddy bear to an equally tattered green dress that didn\u2019t compliment her at all. Her blank stare and expressionless face reminding me of a lifeless doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother seemed to sense I simply wanted to get down to business so she dropped her work face into place as she imitated my clasped hand pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, I want you to do a job for me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat kind of job?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cProtecting Asala here for a few days until someone can come pick her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOfficial Hunter job I take it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d prefer it be under the table if possible.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo is that why you didn\u2019t want me taking the Exams? This way I could do under the table jobs for you instead of working for a corrupt system over the table for you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about dear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI found out mother. Maybe not all of it, but I know about the backroom deals, the corrupt union and how you, father, and big sis are all trying to take it down. So is that it huh? I\u2019m not good enough to help you but I\u2019m still good enough to be used by you whenever it\u2019s convenient? How is an under the table job like this any different than the corrupt way the union does things? Is that the new system you want to put into place? Just replacing one dirty system with one you control?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI clamped my mouth shut on what I was going to say next. Calm Riktal. Keep calm. If you lose your cool too much you lose the upper hand. You told Hilda you would try didn\u2019t you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow did you find out! Val wouldn\u2019t have told you and I was sure no one here would know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least you didn\u2019t have the bad taste to keep denying it. There is a girl named Liz Hawthrope here mother. Does that last name sound at all familiar? I\u2019m told it should since you work with her family quite often she says. And her parents unlike you, actually talk to her and trust her with the truth. Even if they do fight over it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou mean the girl you are supposed to have a marriage meeting with next week? I didn\u2019t know she went to this school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJoin the club on not knowing mother. I\u2019ve had enough of that feeling. But now that I know about the stupid meeting you set up I can break it off without any worry. I\u2019ll simply let her know not to expect me after telling her about it. Then again perhaps that\u2019s why she has been getting close to me today, to feel me out before the actual meeting. I knew it was too good to be true that she would have no motive. And I was beginning to think of her as a friend too. Did you think to cement some dark alliance between the conspirators so no one would oppose your new system?\t\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShoving my chair away from the table I stood up quickly, planting my hands down in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell I want no part of it and no part of this protection job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I grabbed my bag from the floor next to the chair and turned to leave she held out her hand to stop me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWait it isn\u2019t like that at all! Can\u2019t you let me explain even just a little?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tThis wasn\u2019t what I wanted. Hadn\u2019t I said I wanted to change the way I was? Hadn\u2019t I told myself how much I ended up regretting the choices I made while in the heat of anger? So despite every fiber of my being wanting to walk out the door at this moment I sat back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTalk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe opened and closed her mouth a few times. As if she had only stopped me reflexively and now she didn\u2019t know what to say. Finally she looked down at her clasped hands, picking at one thumbnail with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI didn\u2019t want to get you involved in any of this. It started around ten years ago. We got word of the union accepting bribes from different governments for secret missions. Now that\u2019s really nothing too new, since the union is all about politics. Even though we are heroes to the people, we still have to grease a few palms here and there. But even then the union was all about bettering people as a whole. These bribes and secret deals were different. They were for personal gain and advancement of a select few that not only bent the morals of Hunter\u2019s but also would tarnish our reputation if it got out. Such things as assassinating a good ruler for the right price, or using Hunter\u2019s as weapons of war against weaker nations to absorb them into a bigger one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen we first heard about this your sister was all fired up to become a Hunter, begging and pleading for us to let her become one. We didn\u2019t realize how deep the corruption went so we agreed without qualms. We knew she could handle herself, and she was going in mainly as a spy. To find out how deep it all went and take it down if she could. We thought if it was only one or two that were involved we could do a quiet assassination and be done with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cLittle did we know just how all encompassing it was. How many nations were already part of this big conspiracy and just how many powerful Hunter\u2019s as well. I\u2019m not talking just strong of arm, I\u2019m talking about strong political connections. Zarimin Kefner is the head of the union. He is a fourteenth generation Hunter and a member of one of the few families with more influence than us Zelkov\u2019s. Of the generation families at least sixth generation or higher we found at least ten of the fifteen families are in on it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were just ten when we first began our campaign against this corruption. Me and your father decided it was best not to tell you. We hoped to have it all cleaned up by the time you were ready to take the test. Unfortunately it kept dragging on and proved more difficult then we first anticipated. Kefner is a powerful and cunning man. We would have assassinated him long ago if we could. If we had managed that the rest would be much easier. Even now if we could kill him we could be done with this at least six months sooner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen you grew older and began talking about taking the test we continued to keep you in the dark because we knew how hot blooded you could be. We wanted you to become a Hunter without worrying about being forced into military service or have a gag order put on you, or any number of other things I won\u2019t mention. So we put you off time and again. Then Val asked for our help and we sent you to this school. I purposefully forced this on you, knowing you would hate me for it but that was better I thought than the alternatives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWe don\u2019t want to put another corrupt system in place that we control behind the scenes. We simply want to return the system to the way it was before. The system itself wasn\u2019t bad, only the people running it were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what will the repercussions of this be? Once you tear it down I mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAt least eight nations breaking into civil war and having their old governments overthrown. Fifteen or sixteen old houses being destroyed, or at least their reputation. Distrust of the other old families that had no involvement in the corruption, even ours. A couple trillion in damages that will bankrupt most of the old families involved and a minimum loss of innocent lives if we can help it. That\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg that we could think of. We have no idea what else might happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my head as I searched her face. I didn\u2019t sense any lies coming from her for a change. And oddly I felt no hostility towards her at the moment. I nodded at the girl with my chin quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd her? What\u2019s her part in all of this? I doubt she is just an innocent bystander caught up in it all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cActually she really is. Her parents were activist helping us but she didn\u2019t know anything about it until a Hunter stole into their house and killed them in front of her. That caused her latent monster summoning powers to activate. She summoned a creature that killed the Hunter in his surprise before running amok and destroying a large chunk of the city until it was put down. The only one who knows about her abilities besides those of us in this room is one of her parents supporters. They had thought she could be used as a weapon, but even I balked against that idea. That\u2019s when I took her into my custody and left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that supporter will talk? Spread the news to everyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s welcome to talk if she can rise from the dead and reattach her head to her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI nodded my agreement to how she had handled the situation. It was the smartest move in a revolution like this. Now that I knew, things began to make a little more sense. The less people knew of a plan, the less likely it was to fail or be foiled in some way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll take the job. Just give me around five thousand Reul for some expenses so I don\u2019t dig too deeply into my living allowance. I\u2019ll even do it under the table. If I become a Hunter by proxy, it will increase the chances of the union finding out about the girl if things go wrong and I try to cover it up. I\u2019ll deal with it if it happens without that insurance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIt didn\u2019t take long for Hilda to get the money transferred over to my account and all the business was settled. My mother filled me in on a few other details as well so I had a better idea of how to handle the girl. When my mother got up to leave I asked her to wait a moment, a smile on my face so as not to worry the girl. I knew she could hear me and what had been discussed and that was probably part of the reason she had shut down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHilda, can you take the girl out into the hall for a little bit please? I\u2019d like to speak with my mother alone for just a moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked between the two of us and my mother gave her a small nod before the woman came and took Asala by the hand to lead her out. As soon as they were gone I looked back at my mother, leaning forward over the table and lowering my voice a bit.<br>\r\n\t</span></div></div>",

You aren\u2019t good enough to take him on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI didn\u2019t ask that. If it were possible, how much would you pay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cUp to a million Reul. I\u2019d even pay it out of the family coffers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI grinned as I activated my communication spell, setting it to both audio and visual before placing it on the table. A moment later a one armed woman in a highly revealing dress popped up. She looked and saw it was me and her face split into a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal honey! Ready to make the bed squeak with me? Is that why you called out of the blue?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot a chance Ginger. Could you go to your wine room. Not the one you entertain visitors in, but the one with your special drinks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me sideways a moment and then turned her head to see my mother sitting across from me. She gave me a wink and told me to hold on. Even though I could see her walking and bits and pieces of her house, I couldn\u2019t make out anything discernable. The party going on in the background grew louder and louder until it suddenly cut off, leaving only a heavy silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk I\u2019m secure honey. No ones going to hear a peep. So what kind of secret business you got for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know for a fact a man named Zarimin Kefner frequents your parties. You can deny it if you want but I know it\u2019s true. He calls himself Zedric and dyes his hair but I know who he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah so what of it? I get a lot of people who want to hide their identity coming around for various reasons.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll give you five hundred thousand Reul to kill him. No questions asked. Should be easy to slip something in his drink or lace some of his Boda weed or something like that. I\u2019ve seen how he\u2019s all over you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeven hundred thousand if it\u2019s no questions asked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDone. I\u2019ll get half to you within a day or so on good faith and the other half when it\u2019s done. Just take down two of those god awful pictures for a while as a cover-up. They are easily worth three hundred to four hundred thousand. I\u2019ll make sure the contracts to launder the money reflect that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI like my artwork! You just don\u2019t have good taste! But fine. I know just the two to sell to you. It will be done within a week. He will probably be coming over for my party in two days. Lots of high rankers will be there and he loves to wheel and deal with them. I\u2019ll just\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStop. I don\u2019t want to hear it. The less I know the better. No questions asked remember? That goes for me too. I know you will succeed and it will look like natural causes, that\u2018s what your good at.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI cut off the spell after a few more exchanges and a quick farewell before looking at my mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou heard her. One week, seven hundred thousand in two payments for artwork. Think you can handle it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut how did you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease mother, the union isn\u2019t the only ones that are corrupt. I\u2019ve been dealing with the shady side of things for a long time now. Since I was at least thirteen or fourteen. I learned how to play the game since I had so much free time on my hands. Even the best Hunter has to get his hands dirty like this sometimes. Now go on and leave. I\u2019ve got a little girl to take care of.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that I went to the door, taking the little girl off Hilda\u2019s hands and sitting her down to work on getting her to trust me while my mother left me alone. I had a feeling our relationship was going to be a lot different from now on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking at the little girl I was reminded of Olia and smiled. I had no doubt in my mind I could help this little girl. Just like I had no doubt everything would work out in the end. After all, I was good with kids and I had experience as a big brother. Taking her hand, I knelt in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala, my name is Riktal and until you leave I\u2019m going to be like your big brother. I\u2019m not going to leave you alone either and I\u2019m not one bit afraid of your power. So throw the biggest meanest most scariest thing you can at me and I will make it cry uncle while wearing a pink tutu. I\u2019m not going to yell at you or tell you not to cry for your parents. But if you do cry in front of me you better believe I\u2019m going to wrap my arms around you and stroke your hair until you make my shirt as ugly as your dress with your snot. Now let me tell you a little story about my little sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAs I settled in more comfortably on my heals I saw a small bit of intelligence come back to her eyes and smiled even wider. Yes, I had no doubt I could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe window closes, the day for now draws to an end. What kind of tale could be told of their time together? Is it a happy one? A tragic one? Perhaps a mixture of the two. With each new answer comes a new question. With each new question a new mystery. Round and round this cycle goes, never to completely end their dance. Each one intricately linked to the choices made and the path of destiny you guided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again fair adventurer of this strange world where time is meaningless. Come again to begin this day anew. Make different choices, perhaps better ones. See how just a tiny little thought can alter an outcome greatly. For such is the gift, and the curse of choice.</span></div></div>",

Oddly I wasn\u2019t as angry as I knew I could have been. I wasn\u2019t sure why exactly, perhaps I was just so tired of fighting with her all the time. I had grown used to her callous ways and the way she treated me.

It\u2019s not like I will miss learning something important if I don\u2019t go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned and wheeled herself down the hall, staring off into space a bit as I fell into step beside her. Finally she began to speak as she pushed herself out through a side door and into the yard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPeople sometimes do things with the best of intentions but end up with the worst results. Now hear me out before you say anything. I\u2019m not just talking about your mother here, I\u2019m talking about people in general. There is such a thing as being too nice or too concerned. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve learned this already or at least heard such things. It ties in with doing things with the best of intentions. Hiding facts for fear of hurting another like your mother did, or only wanting a person to experience the best in life without having to go through any hardships. It all comes down to one thing, caring.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHa! Then you really don\u2019t understand my mother. Or she has you fooled like everyone else. She cares about one person, herself. It only slightly beats out her care for the family name and image.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why do you think she hid this information from you? If she really didn\u2019t care about you at all she wouldn\u2019t have bothered. She did it because she cared. She didn\u2019t want you embroiled in that mess. But I think she cared too much. She might not know how to show it, and she is definitely abysmal with kids, but I think this whole thing got blown out of proportion because of her desire to protect you. Because protection is an act of caring. That made her fall into the latter category of people who don\u2019t want someone to live life with any hardships. In the end the reverse became true. You lived a life of mostly nothing but hardships and little else.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe went quiet as we rounded the building and came on the track and field area. A big black crow that was sitting on top of one of the fence posts winged it\u2019s way over to alight on her wheelchair. Digging into a little side pouch she pulled out some breadcrumbs and offered them absently to the bird. The crow didn\u2019t even hesitate to gently peck the offering from her palm even as we continued to move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you know about your grandparents on your mothers side?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot much actually. It never seemed important to my training and no one ever talked about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that odd. They were eighth generation Hunters, that\u2019s all I really need to know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYes they were renowned Hunters. Very good at their jobs too. But your grandmother had one very big flaw, she couldn\u2019t bear children. The line was going to die out with her. That is until your grandfather admitted that he had a child to someone else. A girl who had been born to a poor woman that had been smitten by your grandfather. That woman wasn\u2019t even a Hunter, just a city girl barely out of high school herself and not ready for motherhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYour grandparents came in and whisked the baby away, claiming it as their own and paying the woman off with a large sum of money to keep quiet and never contact the girl in the future. A bribe the woman accepted quickly, the prospect of an easy life too good to pass up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo they trained your mother from the day she could crawl to take over the family business and keep the line alive. But would you believe she really wasn\u2019t suited to be a Hunter at first? She was a crybaby and always fumbling with her weapons or her magic. On top of that your grandmother Eli never could quite forgive her for being another woman\u2019s child. Calling her a half-blood in private. So her mother pushed her harder and harder, showing very little care for the girl. Only putting up with her because she had to for the family.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOne day she found out Eli wasn\u2019t her true mother and so she went out searching for her real one. She was I think eleven or twelve years old then. By that time she had learned at least a minimum of competence in her training if through sheer repetition if nothing else. She ran away from home and was gone for almost three months, searching until she finally found her. She was living in luxury off the bribe money with another man and a three year old son. When Marian told the woman who she was, do you know what she replied with?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI never had a daughter. She then slammed the door in your mother\u2019s face and refused to open it again. That changed Marian. She became more cold and uncaring than those around her. Throwing herself into her training like never before and becoming the woman she is today. She was lost for a long time. I don\u2019t mean physically of course, but lost inside her own head while her body went on autopilot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer parents forced the arranged marriage with your father on her. Not even giving her a choice of any other men. Simply saying this was who she would marry. Romone was basically told the same thing. And so, both of them were married within months of that announcement. Your father seventeen and your mother sixteen. Not even completely out of school yet. Your mother had already passed her Hunter Exams the year before but back then, education was mandatory even if you already had a license.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe ended up dropping out her senior year to have Ulicia. But at that time your grandfather was killed on a job. Your mother basically severed the last of her ties with her step-mother and said if the woman interfered with her family she would kill her. Indeed, not two months later your grandmother\u2019s corpse was found with a slit throat and multiple other wounds. But no proof that it was Marian who had done it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt was fortunate that your parents actually ended up falling in love because it helped her become a little more normal. She vowed she would never be like her mother to her own kids. But through a combination of her being bad with children to begin with and being overprotective of all of you, she ended up being like her anyways. Maybe not completely, but close enough.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou brought me to tears over here. So what? It doesn\u2019t change anything, she is still a crappy mother. Still going to do her own thing and do what\u2019s best for herself. If she hasn\u2019t changed by now she\u2019s not going to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe had stopped walking sometime during the story, I didn\u2019t even realize when exactly. One of the academic groups was running around the track and the crow was content to sit next to her face being scratched under the chin. She pointed to a window on the other side of the chair which showed my mother crying her eyes out as Hilda tried to comfort her when I looked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThe point is, even crappy people have feelings. And they have reasons of their own why they are the way they are, they make bad choices and they regret just like everyone else. They try to live as best they can and hope their life doesn\u2019t fall apart on them sometimes. The same way you are a hot head that can act and speak without thinking, regretting what you did once you calm down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt\u2019s easy to judge people based on only what you know of them, since rarely do you have the full picture. That imperfect knowledge and those judgments make it easy to hate. But as Hunter\u2019s we seek out the best possible solution to protect the most innocent people. Sometimes those we condemn or feel disgust for are saved as well because of that. Being able to accept a persons failures and shortcomings and being able to forgive them for the choices they made. That is what separates the truly great Hunter\u2019s from the rest of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI stared through the window in silence as my mother pulled the girl into her chest in her grief. I could read her lips saying she was sorry over and over. Asking the girl to bear with her for just a little bit. In between her tears she kept mumbling that her son hated her and she had never been able to hold him like this before. So she was sorry she was using the girl as a substitute. For a while the girl didn\u2019t react at all. But finally her hands came up and began patting my mother\u2019s back in comfort before she began to cry too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust who are you and what relationship do you have with my family that you know so much?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMe? I\u2019m just an old lady that has seen a lot in her years. Who has eyes and ears everywhere and who knows the regrets and folly of youth. It\u2019s my job to teach people how to be better Hunter\u2019s. But in the end it comes down to if they want to learn or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe spun on her wheels quickly, causing the crow to flap its wings before settling down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo I guess my question to you is, are you a Hunter? Or are you a truly great one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe left me there alone with my thoughts for a while as my mother continued to bawl with no signs of stopping. Finally I turned and headed towards the front of the building around the next bend. It only took a few moments to find myself back outside the meeting room door feeling more anxious than I had ever felt before. Not even facing my first monster had I been half this anxious. Taking a deep breath I opened the door and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother saw me come in and tried to halt her tears without much success even as I went over and wrapped my arms around her. Telling her it would be all right just like I would if she was a child that I actually knew how to handle. I felt extremely awkward as I made soothing noises and she began to break down again while grabbing me tightly. Telling me she was sorry over and over while not making a whole lot of sense otherwise. With a free hand I pulled the crying little girl into our little circle and let the two of them hold onto me like a life preserver. As anxious as I was and as awkward as I felt at the moment, I really didn\u2019t mind the position I was in right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGlancing over her shoulder at the window, I saw a crow with beady black eyes sitting on the ledge looking in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe time grows short now traveler. The window has decided to close on this day. Come again and alter his destiny once more and see where he ends up. Perhaps the window will be kinder and allow you a longer view into his life and his psyche.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\t\u201cSorry, I\u2019m just not in the mood to listen to someone who is probably in on my mothers grand conspiracy right now. I need to get back to class and pretend to learn something new.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I kept walking she rolled after me anyways. I ignored her, she had a right to go wherever she wanted and say whatever she wanted. I just didn\u2019t have to listen or acknowledge her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI knew about the corruption. Well maybe not all of it but I knew some of it. That\u2019s one of the reasons your mother and me formed our alliance. I watch each student closely, and when it comes time to graduate I offer them a chance to join our cause and help us against the union. Your mother has formed a sort of pseudo licensing center along with many other families. It\u2019s illegal of course, but the licenses are still valid and usable. It\u2019s a complicated network of spies, insider manipulation and more that I can\u2019t even begin to comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI know one of the reasons she sent you here was to help groom future Hunter\u2019s. I asked for her help in making this school better. In lowering the death rates of students. You were what I got.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBit of a letdown for you isn\u2019t it? Getting someone even my mother doesn\u2019t think is worthy of being a professional.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo letdown at all. I heard about what happened in the arena. You showed them the value of the knowledge we teach. You led a group against a monster much stronger than them and made it look easy. You gave them confidence in themselves and a desire to become better. To emulate what you did and live up to those expectations. Higher quality of Hunter\u2019s means it is easier to protect the cities we have built. And makes new settlements possible because they have Hunter\u2019s to protect them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe came to the stairs and I started up them without hesitation. I had no doubt she had a way to get up here but I hoped she would just leave me alone. Instead she hit a switch on one of the arms as she spun sideways. The entire chair lifted up, attaching itself to the handrail along the wall, letting her slide upwards after me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThere\u2019s a reason I made sure all the railings and handrails were metal. Makes using this magnet so much easier. You won\u2019t get rid of me that easily. Now where was I? Oh yes. I\u2019m not going to try and defend your mother or her actions. And I\u2019m not going to say I even rightly know all her reasons for everything she does. I only know a few things as they pertain to me and this school. Plus maybe a little extra here and there that\u2019s incomplete knowledge at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBut keep in mind that she is human just like everyone else. As such she is fallible and capable of making bad decisions. When we do our jobs, we make decisions on what is most beneficial to the most innocent people. Sometimes bad people we would otherwise kill or simply ignore are saved as well. And though we might not always like to admit it, the same is true about innocent people. While our actions might save a thousand lives, we can\u2019t always save all of them. What happens to the hundred we have to sacrifice to save those thousands? They can\u2019t all be bad people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSometimes we have to use our families for the greater good. I can only assume that was one of the thoughts in your mothers head for not telling you. She\u2019s had a hard life too you know. Don\u2019t get conceited or anything thinking you are the only one with troubles. If you ask me your whole family is messed up, with skewed notions about things and has been for a very long time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo what do you expect? That I will suddenly gain some enlightenment and go running back down the stairs begging my mother for forgiveness? Begging her to continue to use me as she wishes and keep me in the dark all she wants? Sorry not happening. She can sort this out on her own. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve always had to do since no one was ever there I could rely on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot even Olia?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot even Olia. I was her big brother. I was the one she relied on, I couldn\u2019t shake her faith in me. And that is the last time you can use her name. I don\u2019t know who you think you are but you have no right to talk like you even knew her. I thrust a sword through the last principal\u2019s lung, don\u2019t think I won\u2019t hesitate to do so again. Only next time I will aim for the throat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe came on the door to the classroom so I stopped and gave the principal a small bow of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s been nice chatting with you but I\u2019d hate to lie to your face like that. Go do whatever it is you do all day and leave me alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe smiled sadly as she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine I\u2019ll go for now. But remember, whether you want it to be so or not, your classmates have already found a healthy respect for you because of your actions today. Not because you are a tenth generation Hunter, or because you are a Zelkov. But because you are yourself. You have the power to make them all better then they are right now if you so desire. If you don\u2019t want to do so then that\u2019s your decision and I will respect it. But know that I\u2019m glad your mother sent you here even if it was against your will.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang signaling the end of class as she wheeled herself off. With a sigh I reentered the room and sat at my desk, losing myself in thought as the four minute break ended and the Monster Tactics teacher came in. Once he started in on his lesson I tuned him out to focus on sorting out my thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI understood what the principal had been trying to say. Even though I had been sent here against my will, that didn\u2019t mean I couldn\u2019t do some good here. And just because it had been against my will didn\u2019t mean it had been the wrong choice. After careful consideration of the facts that I knew, I could only concede that not telling me the reasons why I was sent here as wrong. The actual actions of sending me here had been the right choice. Now the question remained, did I want to actively help or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey would learn and get better on their own. I would make them better just by being me, meaning I didn\u2019t have to actually do anything. But interacting with them and actively doing something was not something I was very good at. I had a short temper and I was easily annoyed by them. I wasn\u2019t good at the interpersonal relationships thing either. I understood children age thirteen and younger, and I could deal with people on a purely business level. I had a few people I could consider myself close to, but they were all in the Hunter business as well so my interactions with them tended towards the business aspect of things. I didn\u2019t really understand things like friendships and talking about non-Hunter things like girls or sports or magazines or any number of other topics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf I tried to actively involve myself with these people there was a good chance I would make everything worse. I would do more harm to my purpose for being here than help it. If they learned more about me and saw how inept I was outside of being a Hunter their desire to be like me would most likely die out as they became disillusioned. Honestly, I didn\u2019t want to actively involve myself with them. Precisely because I knew my own failings and personality. Though I did have to admit actively dealing with and helping them would make them better faster than doing nothing. Even if the risks were greater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe bell rang letting everyone know it was the end of the school day. Gregory hurried out of the room but no one seemed to notice or care, even when he bumped into one of the girls. A small group of two boys and three girls came towards me as I stood up.</span></div></div>",

Actively trying to help them was too great a risk. I wouldn\u2019t end up making bad choices like my mother had. Even if she had made them with the best of intentions as the principal had said. The fact still remained that she had ruined my life by making one bad choice after another. I wouldn\u2019t ruin their chances to become good Hunter\u2019s by trying to be someone I wasn\u2019t. I knew my limitations at least. In the end I was a user like my mother. Even though I was using myself and not someone else, the idea was the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThere was also a small space around me now that was mainly given off by my fellow classmates. They weren\u2019t doing to me what they were doing to Gregory, it was more of a bubble because of their respect. But I still felt a bit like I was the one having Lapiiree enacted on me. Still this was for the greater good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that thought firmly in mind I was able to ignore the stares and the whispers. It wasn\u2019t like I didn\u2019t have practice at being alone. Or learning how to push away the silence. This was just how my life was. Turning down the sidewalk I headed for the cold quiet building I called home. Perhaps I would feel up to making more than a bowl of noodles for dinner even though I would be the only one eating. Riktal Zelkov. Master of being alone. That was me in a nutshell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo ends the day of our young hero. Filled with the good and the bad, how do you think it ended? What made you decide the route he took? What made you chose this instead of that? Did you second guess yourself? Think to take an odd route and hoping to be surprised by a twist of fate? Where they based on your own feelings of the issues? Or on how you thought he would react in the situation? Are you satisfied with the way things have gone?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCome again and choose another destiny. Perhaps following the same path except making one minor change. Would such a change do anything I wonder? Or was it all determined before you ever got here? Perhaps next time we shall find out. The next time you play god that is.</span></div></div>",

I suppose it was fortunate they sat so close to each other. Despite my misgivings abut whether this was the right thing to do or not, the potential gain was worth the risk. Even if I did screw this whole thing up, if I could make them better Hunter\u2019s by even just a fraction then wasn\u2019t that worth it? I sneered at my mother because she only thought of herself, how would I be any better if I made a choice that was easiest for me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cDaniel, Jethic, if you guys have some time right now I can show you to that augmentation crafter I was telling you about. Make a few introductions for you so you don\u2019t get cheated and start you on your road to dealing with this kind of stuff. I\u2019m sure he will be glad for the extra business from up and coming Hunter\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBoth their eyes widened and their jaws dropped as they stuttered their thanks. After a few moments they both looked at each other and looked to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn second thought I think I\u2019ll pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYeah me too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cReally? Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tJethic seemed to blush a bit as he mumbled out his answer and Daniel nodded in agreement with the shield bearer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cMy family is poor. I don\u2019t have any money to get my shield augmented right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSame with me. We got a bit of money but not that much. I was planning on getting a part time job to save up before getting it augmented.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI felt so awkward and fake as I pushed them both in the back to get the moving ahead of me. This wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t how I operated. Especially since I didn\u2019t know them all that well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo worries. He owes me a few favors so I\u2019m sure I can talk him into giving you this first one free. Though after this you\u2019ll be on your own. And lucky for you, he comes from the far east across the seas, he loves to haggle and loves to barter even more. Why I once got him to give me an augmentation for a rubber chicken, a gag arrow and an ounce of vampire blood. Not sure what he used it for but he seemed happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see the group of five kids that had tried to corner me gaping like stranded fish. I could also hear their whispers to each other about how they wished they were that lucky. I knew some of it was just them wanting to get close to me for their own reasons, but I was sure they were like everyone else trying to make connections for their future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf your going to whisper, it\u2019s a good idea to do so in a quiet voice that can\u2019t be overheard. I mean isn\u2019t that the whole point of whispering?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThey all blushed and looked away from me as I let out a deep sigh. Every fiber of my being was saying to let it go. That my next words were the wrong ones. That I was already in too deep by offering my assistance to the two boys in front of me. But I couldn\u2019t. I had already jumped into this headfirst, might as well screw it up royally if I was going to screw it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou guys can come as well if you want. I\u2019m sure he will be glad for all the extra future business. Just try not to make me look bad since I still have to deal with him. That\u2019s the catch to having someone else introduce you to the people they know in the Hunter world. Your actions can also affect me and ruin my reputation and credibility with my contacts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t The five kids looked like I had just announced I was from another planet and wished to be taken to their leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou serious! We can go with you too!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIs their an echo in here? I wouldn\u2019t have said anything if I wasn\u2019t serious. I\u2019m not going to wait up for you guys so make up your minds quickly. And keep down on the inane excited babble if you can. It\u2019s not like this makes us friends or anything. But if you really are serious about becoming Hunter\u2019s, you need to start dealing with this kind of stuff sometime. Best if you start early before you really need it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned away then and went through the door into the hall, pausing only long enough to make sure Jethic and Daniel were following me. Interacting with people like this felt weird just like every other time I had tried to do it. And I had a feeling that also like every other time, it would fail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThen again perhaps not. Even if they acted like regular high schooler\u2019s, unlike my last school they were also Hunter\u2019s in training. That already gave them more in common with me than anyone at the last school. That had shown they had a desire to honor the codes and learn the skills to protect innocent people just like me. Only time would tell, but I had to at least give them a chance to prove if this was a mistake or not didn\u2019t I?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA slip of the tongue, a wisp of thought becoming more important than another. A thousand different variables as to the who\u2019s, how\u2019s, and why\u2019s of the choices we make. And yet there are a thousand and one more that decide which thousand variables we are given at any given moment. That is what makes it so difficult to tell if we truly have free will, or if such a thing is an illusion and we are all guided by some grand hand called fate. Our lives predetermined for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tPerhaps free will and destiny are actually two names for the same thing? Perhaps even as we speak our words are dictated by something or someone greater, forcing us to go down a path of it\u2019s choosing. You are free to come again and play god, seeing what else might have happened this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut then again, maybe you\u2019re not. Maybe such is simply your fate.</span></div></div>",

That was the law of coincidence. Always double check and expect the unexpected, that was how I had grown up thinking. Having to take care of my little sister all the time and living on my own I had learned this fact through much trial and error.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tLooking at myself in the mirror after washing my hands I tried to calm myself down. But that anger was still boiling inside just under the surface. Did she not trust me enough with information like this? Did she not think I was a good enough Hunter? What were her reasons for keeping me out of the loop? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI could see my reflection clenching it\u2019s jaw as my hands gripped the edge of the countertop tightly. With my curly red hair and the slight narrowing of my eyes it looked like my gaze had ignited my head. My thin framed glasses felt like they were holding that dark glare back from burning everything else around me. What was wrong with me anyway that I didn\u2019t deserve to know any of this? How long had it gone on and did big sis know about it? If she did then why hadn\u2019t she told me? Just how far did this conspiracy to keep me in the dark go? Obviously my father knew about it, but who else? Was everyone around me in on it? Were they simply hiding behind fake smiles under my mother\u2019s orders to keep me from finding out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith a growl I punched the wall next to the mirror, making the porcelain tiles crack and fall away and leaving a small crater after I pulled back my hand. Damn that conniving woman anyway! She didn\u2019t want me to be angry at her yet she pulled crap like this. She wondered why I was always so hostile and refused to act like a good son when she thought keeping secrets like this was a good idea!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tCalm down Riktal. It did no good to work yourself up. It would just make you do something you would regret. Don\u2019t feed into it. That\u2019s what she wants. She wants you to keep blowing up over every little thing she does so she can use that as fodder against you later. You're too violent to be a Hunter right now, with a temper like that you can\u2019t be trusted to do your job effectively. Weren\u2019t those some of her words before she forced this stupid school on me? Prove her wrong Riktal. Shove it all back in her face the next time you see her by keeping your act together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tEven though I told myself that it didn\u2019t seem to help too much. I just couldn\u2019t get the anger to go away. The best I could manage was to bottle it up for the moment. Later on I would slip out of town and go slay monsters until it was all gone. A bit of mindless killing was just what I needed. Once I was sure I could keep myself from exploding on someone in the classroom over something small I left the restroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal! You were just the person I was coming to see!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI turned to see a slightly plump old woman in a yellow dress and a black eye patch over her right eye coming towards me down the hall. I felt some of my anger slip away and a smile spread along my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHilda, I can honestly say I am glad to see you. You are one of the few people that I can\u2019t help but smile when I see.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cTrying to bottle down your anger over something again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHow could you tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe shrugged as she absently gave me a hug and a quick kiss on the cheek like we were long lost family. Apart from a handful of other people, she was the only one I didn\u2019t mind when she was so familiar with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou know me, I can always tell. You get a certain look about you when you are in one of your moods. Let me guess something to do with your mother again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhen isn\u2019t it about my mother in some way? I take it you\u2019re here on business as her aide though and I probably won\u2019t like it one bit am I right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGot it in one. Come on, let\u2019s talk on the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe turned and began walking back the way she came while I fell into step beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn a scale of one to ten how much am I not going to like this meeting?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIn the state you are in now? A seven or eight probably. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a bad time and what she wants is only going to make it worse, but would you please try to hold it in with a little extra while for me? From what I know there is a good chance this might bring you two to blows again and I don\u2019t want that. I might be your mother\u2019s aide but I\u2019ve known you for years now and I can\u2019t help but want to take care of you too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOn top of that there is a little girl involved. I don\u2019t know much about her but she has been through a lot already. I don\u2019t want that poor child to suffer seeing a parent and child trading fists. Not after losing her own parents only three days ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHitching my bag of weapons up on my shoulder a bit higher I looked over at the old woman that I had more feelings of family towards than my own mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat bad huh? But you know I can\u2019t make such promises. The best I can do is say I will try.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s all I can ask for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe walked in silence a few moments longer as we went down the stairs to the first floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThis girl. What kind of state is she in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNow that\u2019s a funny question to ask. Not what she is like or why she is here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNot really. If she just lost her parents three days ago and has probably been yanked around everywhere meeting a bunch of strange people in strange places, depending on how old she is that can really damage the mind. If I know the state she is in I can guess at what she is like based on how she reacted to all these changes. I already assume she is here because she has something to do with either why my mother wants me or part of a job she is on. I tend to think the former since my mother doesn\u2019t do well with kids at all. Preferring to just abandon them to grow up alone.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s a strange one. Silver hair, crimson eyes. She hasn\u2019t said a word for the last three days. Refuses to eat or move on her own, so your mother has taken to using magic to sustain her life. That won\u2019t work for long though, the body needs real food in order to survive. She just clutches a tattered teddy bear to her chest and stares at nothing all day long, barely blinking. She will sit for hours on end not even moving, as if she was a puppet that only moved when someone else moves her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd my mother has probably just grabbed her arm and dragged her around everywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPretty much. I\u2019ve told her the girl was in shock and needed some attention but she is always so busy, she simply left such things to us aides. I\u2019ve done what I could but I didn\u2019t have much time to focus on the girl the way your mother runs me around and the other aides are pretty horrible at dealing with this kind of thing. I even heard the new girl Inga tell her to just get over it already, her parents had only died and it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. Henry was a bit better, but he\u2019s a real man\u2019s man if you know what I mean. Great for the strong arm stuff, but not so great when handling women and little children. Has the mindset that the woman should stay at home with the kids while the man goes making the money.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAnd he managed to get a job as my mother\u2019s aide? How\u2019d he pull that off?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf you figure that one out then you let me know. But I don\u2019t see him lasting more than a month. Your mother has a new job and she can\u2019t take the girl with her. We were at our wits end trying to figure out who we could get to take her, then I remembered how good you are with this kind of stuff and little kids in general. Admittedly I remembered after you called your mother earlier but still, I\u2019m the one who told her to talk to you about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWe came to the door and Hilda stopped to look at me with soft eyes before opening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPlease help that poor girl with her suffering will you? Even if you have your differences with your mother don\u2019t take it out on that little girl. I know you can help her. From what little I know of how she used to be before her parents died, she sounds a lot like Olia. She needs you, and I think you need her more than you realize right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tWith that she opened the door and stepped aside, allowing me to enter first.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\tAs my mother got up to shower me with her hugs and kisses which I knew were fake from start to finish, I held up my hand. Completely ignoring her I went over to the little girl who was just like Hilda had described. Kneeling in front of her and staring into those dead blank eyes I couldn\u2019t even see a flicker of intelligence. Granted this might not be the best move as it would make any bargaining chips I had with my mother weaker, but I couldn\u2019t let this little girl suffer. Even if I hadn\u2019t already decided to take the job before even walking in the door, I couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to her. My anger was at my mother, not this little girl. In the end she was just an innocent I needed to protect as was my duty as a Hunter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBoy Hilda was right, you are creepy. Those dead looking eyes, that starved body, those ugly green clothes that look like someone dug them out of the garbage after a dog vomited on them. Yeah I think they made a mistake. They brought a zombie along with them not a little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI made a show of sniffing the air like a hound catching a scent before plugging it up with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYep you even smell as ripe as an undead. But you know, I got a special magic that can bring zombies back to life. It\u2019s a super secret magic I came up with myself. I bet if I use it on you I can get you to return to normal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy left hand began to twitch sporadically and I gave a look of surprise. I tried to stop the shaking with my right hand before it too began to shake quickly. Soon my  entire body was twitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI feel the magic coming! It knows there is a zombie girl in front of me and I can\u2019t hold it in much longer! I feel the power building! If you don\u2019t break free of the spell yourself I will have no choice but to unleash it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI knew she heard me. All the small tells said so. No matter how deaf and dumb she played to the world, she still held that bear. That took a bit of conscious effort and knowledge of the world around her. Otherwise it would simply slip from her fingers and she wouldn\u2019t even notice. With a small fake scream I shot my left and right hands out to tickle her sides and under her armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe held out for a good thirty seconds before she began to squirm and giggle trying to escape my fingers. I wouldn\u2019t let her go though as I continued my assault until life came back to her eyes. Only then did I let my fingers fall away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRestoration magic complete! Your still a scrawny girl in a god ugly dress but you\u2019re no longer a zombie. My magic never fails. If you start slipping back into that zombie state my secret magic technique will activate again you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tAfter a moment of silence she blinked her eyes at me and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cGood. I\u2019m sure you are pretty scared right now. I would be too if  I was in your shoes and had to stick close to this old woman here. I\u2019ll admit, my mother can be pretty scary at times. Just between you and me, I think that\u2019s how she got her name as a Hunter. Not because she is so good at killing them, but she scares them all away with just her looks and attitude. Could you imagine her storming up to a big ugly troll and grabbing it\u2019s arm to drag it around everywhere? Telling it to do this and do that? I bet the troll would even end up doing what she said!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a small smile as I winked at her quickly. The bear in her hand getting crushed to her chest as she watched me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m Riktal by the way. Would you tell me your name? If you don\u2019t want to talk that\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just call you squash. Why name you after a food you might ask? Simple, because it was the first thing that came to my mind. I could call you zombie girl if you prefer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe stayed silent, refusing to answer me, simply shoving her face into her stuffed animal and closing her eyes. Seeing her reticence I suddenly got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWell squash. How about this. I have another special magic I created that will allow your bear there to talk. It can answer my questions if you want. But for this magic only you can hear the secret words and how to activate the spell. So I am going to whisper them into your ear right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tTrue to my words I leaned forward until my lips were next to the left side of her face, cupping my hands around them so no sound leaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSimply put the bear up to your face and close your eyes while thinking about what you want to say. Then open your mouth and the words will come out. I\u2019ve already put the magic on you to make it happen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSitting back and looking at her I gave her another grin which she returned hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo let\u2019s try this again. I\u2019m Riktal, what\u2019s your name?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me and then at the bear before hiding her face in it\u2019s back. There was a moment of silence before I heard a small soft voice coming through the muffled fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAsala.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cA pleasure to meet you Asala. Are you scared right now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe nodded her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAre you scared of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA quick denial back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen how about I sit next to you for now? Would you like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tA bobbing of the head as I pulled my chair closer and she leaned against me. I wrapped my arm around her before turning my attention to my mother. As I switched gears, I still had a bit of the anger still under the surface but no desire to explode on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cOk now you can talk. It\u2019s a wonder I was able to do this much so quickly since you were the one taking care of her. I guess I should be lucky she didn\u2019t go completely comatose with your tender treatment. What kind of Hunter are you anyways that you can\u2019t see she was in shock and just needed a little attention? Even someone as inept as you are with kids should have been able to manage this. Hell a half retarded, blind, deaf and mute person could have managed better than you. Hilda even told you she needed a bit of care. What do you have to say for yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just got so caught up in work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou\u2019re sorry. Well not like I expected you to say anything else. That was always your fall back answer where I was concerned too. As if the word\u2019s sorry and work justified everything. And why is it I am the one lecturing you? You\u2019re the parent you should know better! I hope your work toppling the union is worth all the I\u2019m sorry\u2019s mother. Because from where I am sitting it isn\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat are you talking about darling?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou really want to play dumb mother? Just give it up already, I found out about the corruption in the union and the secret dealings with different governments. I heard it from a girl named Liz who\u2019s parents work with you. It seems they at least trust their daughter with this information even if they won\u2019t let her help them. You going to keep denying it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve been fighting against it for the last nine and a half years. I\u2019m going to be going to another job where I will be continuing that fight. I want you to take care of that child until someone can come pick her up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhy me? There are hundreds of Hunter\u2019s out there who could do this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cBecause you have nothing against monster summoners. Her powers are unstable and you are strong enough to deal with anything she could most likely summon. Most other Hunter\u2019s would want to kill her on site. And you\u2019re good with kids as you have just proved. You\u2019ve gotten her more active in the world around us then anyone has in the last three days since her parents died.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat if I say no?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother shrugged as she looked between the two of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAfter what you just did I doubt you will. Even if you do I\u2019d be surprised if she didn\u2019t stick to you like glue anyways. But even if she doesn\u2019t I was thinking of Pelei, though you know how he is.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine. I\u2019ll do it. I want ten thousand Reul\u2019s though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI\u2019ll give you five thousand. You\u2019ve already shown a willingness to help her and her a willingness to trust you. I could leave now and you\u2019d get nothing out of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSeven thousand and me and you have a long talk after this job is over where you tell me everything. Even if you leave you should know me well enough to know that doesn\u2019t guarantee I will protect her for free. Plus I need some spending money and a bit extra for myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAgreed. But only if you continue to go to classes while you protect her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIf and only if doing so won\u2019t endanger her or the students at this school even more because of her powers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen have the money transferred over to my account and get going. The sooner you get this job done the sooner we can have our chat. And I am really looking forward to that mother so you had best be prepared. Just thank Hilda for calming me down before I came in or things would have gone much differently.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother let out a sigh as she gave me a last long look and left the room. Hilda also glanced between me and the girl before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou planned to take her from the start didn\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPerhaps. Only someone who knows me well could answer that one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a conspiratorial grin and a wink before nodding her head in my direction and leaving the room. Once she was gone I turned my attention back to the girl who was looking at me with those big trusting eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cSo Asala. Let\u2019s get to know each other a bit better shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe window closes on this timeline. Thought there is more to the day, we do not know it at this time. Are you satisfied with your choices? Do you wonder where else his life might have ended up? Come again and find out. Sate my curiosity again and answer more of my questions as you tempt fate and take up the mantle of god. Until we meet again fair traveler.</span></div></div>",

The girl was just like Hilda described, sitting as still as stone while everything went on around her. As much as I had thought about dealing with her first, I needed more information from my mother.  I had a feeling she was going to ask me to watch this girl while she went running off to wherever. If I showed concern for the girl I wouldn\u2019t have much leverage to make a good deal if I even decided to accept such a job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tIf it was any other person I might easily accept without question, but because it was my mother asking I might decline just out of spite. I felt sorry for the girl but that wasn\u2019t a reason to shackle myself to my mother\u2019s whims. There were other Hunter\u2019s out there that could do this job. And right now I wasn\u2019t feeling too generous towards my mother to begin with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cWhat do you want mother? I\u2019m sure you are busy since you are always busy. So lets not beat around the bush. Tell me why you are here, leaving out the truth like you always do of course, and I will decide whether to walk out or not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Darling, do you really think that little of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I think even less than that. Now can we get on with this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked as if she was going to say something but slowly shook her head instead before pulling her work face down into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cFine, if that\u2019s the way you want it. Can you protect this little girl for a few days until someone I know can come get her? I\u2019ve got an important job in Bornica and I can\u2019t take her with me. She is a monster summoner who just lost her parents three days ago, causing her powers to activate suddenly and go out of control. She\u2019s unstable at the moment and needs someone that won\u2019t hold her ability against her. After you called earlier I thought of you and how good you are with this kind of thing.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can see why you couldn\u2019t go to just any Hunter. But have you forgotten? I\u2019m not a Hunter. Apparently my mother didn\u2019t think I was good enough to be one and she sent me here instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cRiktal darling, that\u2019s not true! I think you are a great Hunter! I\u2019d rather have you at my back then any dozen experienced ones I know!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThen why? Think I couldn\u2019t hold onto my temper if I took the Exam and helped you take down the corrupted union from the inside? Think I wasn\u2019t smart enough to understand the wide scope of your plans? Or that I wasn\u2019t worth being let in on the grand secrets?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHer mouth fell open slightly and her eyes began to widen as I gave her a small sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cThat\u2019s right, I found out. Did you think you could hide it from me forever? I don\u2019t know your reasons why but I\u2019ve been filled in on many of the facts. All thanks to you sending me to this school. So if you tell me why, then I might actually accept this job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe was quiet for a few minutes as she studied my face and looked down at her clasped hands. Finally she gave a small nod and looked back up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI wanted you to become a Hunter after it was all over. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think you were ready, or lacked anything you couldn\u2019t learn with experience. I just used your quick temper as an excuse, another in a long list of things I did to force you to go along with my wishes without being given any worthwhile reasons. Your sister has been working from the inside for a long time now. Since she became a Hunter herself in fact. And it has changed her. She doesn\u2019t show it to you when she is home, but we see that other side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cShe\u2019s done many things already that she found distasteful, both as a Hunter and as a person. Even some she found distasteful as a woman. All for the sake of our cause. I didn\u2019t want you to go through any of that. I knew the things I did made you angry at me. Indeed I knew I could control you with that anger and so went out of my way to cultivate it. Making you do things simply as a way to spite me. I knew if I told you not to do something you would do it anyways. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t trust you, I simply wanted to do something right as a mother after all the things I\u2019ve done wrong. I guess even that desire backfired on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at me with eyes that pleaded with me to believe her. I found that anger that had been simmering under the surface all this time slowly slipping away. I\u2019m sure there was more to the story, there always was. But I believed her words. Even though I knew how much of a liar and a conniving woman she was, I believed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll take the job. It doesn\u2019t make us square and it doesn\u2019t mean I forgive you, but I\u2019ll take the job on one condition. Me and you need to sit down and have a very long talk when you are done with this mission. I want to know all of it. Every last detail and what I can do to help. Because now that I know, there is no way I can sit on the sidelines anymore.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI suppose that\u2019s inevitable now. I really thought you would take this a lot worse. I thought for sure this would end up in some shouting match at the least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cIt could have. I was even thinking about it. But in the end you trained me to be rational in my decisions. I might not always be able to apply that when I deal with you, but I\u2019m still rational when given the facts and not treated like an idiot or a fool. Plus you have Hilda to thank for me holding off coming in here screaming my head off at you like I was originally going to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI do want you to do one other thing while you protect Asala dear. I want you to continue to attend this academy. I know it doesn\u2019t seem fair but it\u2019s important.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cPart of some scheme to let you come out ahead you aren\u2019t willing to tell me about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNo. I\u2019m just helping out a friend. I won\u2019t say I don\u2019t get some benefit from it, but my reasons for sending you here are to help her more than anything.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI don\u2019t suppose you will tell me why would you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cNext time. I\u2019ll tell you next time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cStill with the secrets huh? Fine, whatever. Go on with your business and leave the girl to me. I\u2019ll continue to go to class if and only if I deem it safe for the girl. If I feel there is more danger to either her or the class because of her power I won\u2019t hesitate to skip or leave early.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cI can live with that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMy mother stood up then giving me a soft smile and a softer thank you before heading out the door. Once it closed behind her Hilda smiled at me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cJust so you know, this next mission is really dangerous. She won\u2019t say anything, but there\u2019s a real possibility that she will die. That\u2019s why she said she would tell you the reasons next time. To give her extra incentive to stay alive.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe looked at the girl a moment then back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cYou were already planning on taking the job before you ever entered the room weren\u2019t you? Otherwise you never would have asked about her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm shocked you think that Hilda. You know me better than that.\"<br>\r\n        <br>\r\n        \"Yes I know you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tShe gave me a conspiratorial grin before heading out the door after my mother. Once we were alone I got up and went around the table to sit next to the girl. It would probably take a good three or four minutes to get her to respond to me and then another fifteen to twenty to build up some trust. Perhaps more depending on how closed off in her mind she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tBut I would manage. I was horrible with people in general and anyone between the ages of fourteen and twenty three in particular. But not children. They were the one kind of people I was good at dealing with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\u201cHey Asala. I heard your in need of a friend and a family. Well I got some experience as a big brother. Let me tell you about it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI settled down more comfortably in my chair as I began to speak, picking up one of her tiny hands and holding it in my own. She didn\u2019t respond at all but that was ok, she would in time. When I gave her hand a small squeeze I smiled a bit when I got the slightest of squeezes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tThe window closes on us for now. I have learned much while watching you. I have come to understand some of the answers of which I seek. Thought there are still many more blanks that needs must be filled. Feel free to come again and choose a different path for young Riktal. I will be more than happy to observe and learn yet more of that which I desire to know. And more than happy to give you a portion of my power to do so. Until then, may you find the answers you seek from the choices you make.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">\tMy name is Adivino. I have been named The Seer. He who can see the future. Right now we are within a pocket between reality and non-reality. Where every possibility exists. Time both has meaning and no meaning here. Possibilities and opportunities happen, have happened, will happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI observe the flow of these possibilities. I am a god here, though at the same time I am nothing more than a figment of imagination. All powerful and powerless. I have no face, no form, no identity of my own. Save for that which those who look upon me may desire to attach unto me. Man, woman, young, old. These words have no meaning to me as I am all of them and none of them at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tI have existed here for an unknown number of years. Or perhaps it is mere minutes. is this the first time we have met or the thousandth? I do not know. I brought you here because I was curious. What path would you choose if you were given the ability to alter the course of someone\u2019s life? I have found it is easy to make such decisions when it is your own life that you alter. But when given the power over another? Will you charge into battle without regard to his or her safety? Or play it safe and avoid confrontation? What do these choices say about you? Would you put them in danger simply because it is not you in this situation? Or would you value their life as you value your own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tSo for this span of time as you are within my domain I shall bestow upon you this small gift. The power to alter destinies. To guide a person to glory or destruction. Delve into their innermost thoughts, see what they see and feel what they feel. And then let you chose their path for them. Of course I may or may not tweak the thoughts of those around you slightly to vastly alter the outcome. I doubt you would wish to return to these days again and again if the differences in the timelines were only slight as to be non-existent. Come pick a window, your destiny awaits. Or perhaps I should say someone else\u2019s destiny awaits.</td>",
