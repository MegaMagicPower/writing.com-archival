Time and time again, Eggman would strike some ingenious or over complicated plan that would make Sonic strike back before finally foiling the doctor's plans for world domination. After that, Sonic would simply relax until the next time that Eggman would pop out to strike again. But after his most recent defeat by Sonic's hand, he simply vanished...but his Egg Army did not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic was already outside a town that was being attacked by a collection of Eggman's Badniks, dashing miles ahead of any other members of the Resistance with his best friend Tails not so far behind him. The townspeople, a mass collection of mobians, were either in trying to get to the storm shelter or defend the town with the small group of milita armed with certain wispons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, miles away in the Knothole Base; The \"so-called\" disbanded Resistance was keeping tabs on each and every Eggman Attack sighting that had occured in the last six months since Eggman's defeat and we're trying to make sense of why his Badniks were still operating without Eggman's control. At the top of the helm stood Sally Acorn, staring at the map and wondering the ever burning question; \"Who is controlling the badniks?\" To her side in the control room were her bodyguard and best friend Frost and Nicole while on the other side of the table sat a pair of individuals who were affected by Eggman in the past; Eric Prowler, a half-mobian fox/half-cyborg who was a pawn of Eggman for most of his life and a grey/black wolf with red eyes named Hypon, the last of his kind thanks to a certain doctor...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the six months of the slow change of the Resistance back into the Freedom Fighters, many recruits came out from many different parts of the world to become a part of the Freedom Fighters who wanted to be a part of something bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is where our story really begins...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Knothole Training Room</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral recruits were using the training room for the actual purpose to train but there were a few recruits who sitting to the side and that caught the eye of one of the first recruits who signed on; a brown haired female echinda with blonde highlights in a black tank top and tan shorts named Clementine. She then barked towards the small crowd of recruits \"Hey, shouldn't you be training or running laps instead of being like rocks in one place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the ire of the main head of the group, a simple looking red armadillo that people know as Mighty who spoke down to the brown echinda, \"Look who is trying to be all high and mighty, boys... Maybe we need to show the recruit the ropes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides Mighty, there was a yellow squirrel named Ray, a green duck named Bean, and a yellow polar bear named Bark; each of them looking at the \"fresh-faced\" recruit and trying not to just laugh at her face before a figure both Clemintine and Mighty knew stepped in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mighty! Clem!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the pair of fighters to turn the focus over towards the voice, revealing Knuckles... \"And what seems to be the problem here?\" Knuckles chimed which lead to Clementine trying to defend herself, \"I was trying to get people in shape. Why hang out in the training room if they aren't going to train?\" Mighty then retorted, \"Oh please, we just finished up a simulation and are taking a breather. What's the harm in that? Seems like someone is thinking a little too highly of herself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine slightly growled as she stood an arm's length away from the armadillo, a small flame slowly appearing into her hand. Knuckles quickly grabbed Clementine back before she could even think of lunging at Mighty in a hold, adding, \"Okay, that's enough of that for the moment. Mighty, you are dismissed.\" Mighty just smirked before walking away with his crew in tow as Clementine struggled endlessly in Knuckles' grip before hearing him added as she stopped for the moment, \"We've talked about this, Clem. You need to remember that you aren't in clan lands anymore. This is a whole new environment and you can't be trying to pick a fight with every person here. If you keep that up, Sally will have no choice to let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine sighed before being let go of Knuckles' grip before jabbing him into the side lightly, adding, \"I just don't like it when I feel like a nobody. Back home, everyone knew me...here; I'm just a number and a face.\" Knuckles then patted her head, trying to cheer Clem up, \"Don't worry about that for long, Clementine. You might draw up some buzz with the other recruits and Fighters for trying to stand up to Mighty the Armadillo.\" Clem chuckled before hugging Knuckles for a brief second, \"Thanks...I needed that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for them both too notice that they became the center of attention in the training room which then caused Knuckles to improvise, badly, coughing before shouting at Clem, \"Now give me five laps now, rookie...\" Clementine then bolted for the tracks, taking her moment of relaxation to the laps. Clementine knew that Knuckles was trying to cover for their talks but knew that rumors were going to spread about them regardless of the evidence. They were simply protecting each other; to protect your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt these times, people need someone to look up to. Most recruits say that Sonic is the reason why they joined the Resistance or the Freedom Fighters but there are a few who don't find that person until they get into the base life. For Clementine, that was Knuckles. She wanted to become better and do something than be stuck in the clans forever. This was her moment to show that she can make it and make something of herself. She wanted to become a Freedom Fighter...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The tracks weren't bad considering how Clementine had trained before joining the Freedom Fighters, but she was far from the only one trying to improve. The issue that she had was the unusual number of eyes that seemed to be glancing around the base as if they were concerned an attack was to happen or they were keeping an eye on her and those like her. It wasn't something Clementine liked, to be treated with suspicion and distrust, but she knew that they were just trying to be cautious considering the number of time people had managed to sneak in and cause damage. She heard of one particular member who held Acorn hostage after gaining everyone's trust from Knuckles, yet it seemed that that debt was most forgiven for some odd reason which seemed to Clem an issue waiting to happen. She also heard that an ex-AFF member was also in place by Acorn's side, which astonished her how someone could be trusted who fought the very ideals that they needed to gain a step into the cause. However, these people had fought the war before it even became that, and now they needed to stand against a more covert movement by the enemy that used to love the stage light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClementine could see that the threat was real and these people needed more help than ever, which was exactly what she needed in a cause. She knew that she was going to have some fights with people who treated her as less than capable, which she looked forward to, even if it put her on the spot with Acorn or the other high ups. There was going to be some push back from Knuckles, but sometimes people only respond when the ground between the two is equal in standing or after there behinds were kicked. Clementine, however, sighed at the end of her laps and drank some water, thinking through what else was required from her for the day before she had to start fresh in the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to prepare for her instruction as a new recruit, which entailed lessons in fighting while some were more tech and stealth-oriented for the more covert missions, so training for them was key. She did have to speak to the medical staff about making her file since the clans didn't exactly have something ready for her, which would lead to some questions that could be embarrassing for her. Clem also figured she needed to speak to resources about her soon to come, roommate, that she would share with, hoping that she could be friends with them. The female Echidna took another breath and decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clementine wanted to see to she had gotten paired up with as a roommate but figured it was going to be someone who was already been planted in the knowledge of what goes on and what to watch for in a possible mole, not enjoying the fact that she was going to have all eyes on her during her first couple of months on base. Clementine then made her way to the roster list that was located in the on the other side of the base located outside one of the recruit counselor's office. Clementine decided to make the back ways that she was shown on her tour the first day on the base, not wanting to seem like in a rush. The lady echidna wanted to prove that she belonged but had to control her own anger or face the paperwork that comes with people who break the rules. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Clem was walking the halls towards the recruiter's office, she then noticed a pair of people who were standing in the open room that was between her and the office. Clementine quickly recognized each of them from either news photos or the opening speech to new recruits. One of the first people Clementine noticed was Lupe the Wolf, a counselor, and former leader of the Wolf Pack. She was the one leading the entire recruit introduction speech, mentioning how she was inspired to join the fighters after her village was pinned down by Doctor Eggman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Lupe, there was a second wolf who was known for breaking protocol when it mattered: One dark grey wolf named Gris Nightshade but took up the nickname \"Hypon\" which didn't really match his background history as a member of Night-Blood Tribe, a tribe who were guardians of the moon and the dark forests but were cut down short by Doctor Eggman's manipulating a rival tribe known as the Frost Wolves who wanted the clan removed from the face of Mobius. He was now working with the same clan who had planned on destroying his clan and trying to rebuild the legacy of the fallen clan by using an item that was locked away and was to be used in case of clan extinction to deliver vengeance on those who brought them to an early end and to help rebuild from the ashes. He now currently runs the undercover operations for the Freedom Fighters, using his many years of experience being in and entering other several organizations with ease. From what it looked like Hypon was checking in with his fellow wolf about the most recent influx of recruits but was being quiet about it before he looked over towards Clementine and then back at Lupe and excusing himself from the conversation. Lupe then noticed Clementine and then gently waved towards her to approach, knowing Clementine from earlier in the day as she remembers how anxious she was in entering a new heavy populated area with a lot of eyes on her...</span></div></div>",
