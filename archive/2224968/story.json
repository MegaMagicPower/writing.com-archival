An exceptional high school full of remarkably talented students, each of which had to prove their worth in an audition just to be admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile in many ways, the students at Hollywood Arts still participate in the universal high school experience, it is undeniable that collecting the extraordinary all together creates a student body that makes weird the new normal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis LA high school fully embraces and encourages the unique student populace and does its best to help cultivate an environment in which the students are able to thrive in all aspects of their life, especially creatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne student of Hollywood Arts, Cat Valentine, became quite obsessed with a magazine catalog called Sky Store, where she ordered all kinds of improbable and strange things not likely found in any local stores. Her obsession with Sky Store became a problem and had to be quelled, but in the process she brought the magazine to the attention of all her friends and many of her acquaintances. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone just received a package shipped from Sky Store, who?</span></div></div>",

Upon picking it up, however, she realized it may not be a surprise she was totally excited to get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe package had the Sky Store logo emblazoned on its side, and since she herself hadn't ordered anything, it meant Cat had sent it to her. In truth, she rarely bought anything from the Sky Store. The few times she bothered looking through the magazine, it seemed like an unorganized collection of random odd items and weird inventions, most of which seemed to have extremely niche usage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer best friend Cat Valentine, however, had gone through a bit of an obsession phase with Sky Store. With the help of her friends, she managed to kick the obsessive habit...sort of. She was no longer buying multiple items a day and racking up extreme credit card debt for her parents, but she still bought things from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally she bought her friends things, too, which would be sweet if it weren't at risk of bringing her problem back. Not to mention, Tori thought, it was rare for her to be very thrilled with the oddities that Cat bought her. Still, it would be rude to not at least investigate, for Cat's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori sat on the red sofa in her living room and opened the box to inspect its contents. There were a few items inside, most of which were just the usual weird stuff. But one item in particular caught Tori's attention as something truly unique, if it could be believed to be real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a small receipt next to it, which revealed from a quick scan that it was a unique item that could only be purchased by exchanging Sky Miles from frequent purchases. And it looks like Cat cashed in a lot of Sky Miles to get this thing. Tori wasn't even totally sure if she was supposed to receive it, Cat may have included it with Tori's items by mistake. What was this strange, unique item?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A bottle with red liquid inside. Labeled as a shrinking serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A bottle with blue liquid inside. Labeled as a growth serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. A strangely-shaped metal pistol that looks like some sort of sci-fi ray gun. Tori hadn't looked at the label yet, though.</span></div></div>",

Probably just some cute strawberry drink marketing, like if it had been called a health potion from an RPG or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori twisted off the cap and brought the opening under her nose. It had a very potent strawberry scent. She brought the bottle to her lips and started to tilt it back to drink, but paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did it cost so many Sky Miles? She didn't fully understand the value of a Sky Mile but the number was extremely high. Should she really be drinking this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Tori shrugs off her doubt, she's being silly. She drinks the liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Tori is...unsure. Trina's upstairs, maybe she can just have her try it first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Tori decides to wait to do anything with it.

She's almost embarrassed, but no one has to know she almost believed the silly marketing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted the bottle back and drank some of the so-called \"Shrink Serum.\" It had a very pleasant flavor, very strawberry as promised. And as far as artificial strawberry went, it didn't overwhelm her with its artificiality. It was so good it even earned an audible \"Mmmm\" from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori twisted the cap back on, walked to the kitchen, and put the bottle in the fridge. She only took a single drink from the bottle and figured it may be better refrigerated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked back into the living room, a strange feeling overtook her. Her whole body started to tingle and she almost felt like she wasn't in her own skin, sort of like the feeling when your hand or foot falls asleep. Her whole body felt that way, and her vision swam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything in her vision seemed to fall away, but upwards. <i>She</i> felt like she was falling, but without the panic or feeling of danger. It was rapid, and then it was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's body regained feeling, and she realized she had fallen on her back. But she was immediately confused, because she quickly noticed she was nude. The ground she lay on was uneven, and felt soft, like a large blanket. And it was maroon, just like the shirt she was wearing before she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori quickly stood up, and looked around her. The red material went on for several yards, and dropped off. The ground below that level looked like an ever expansive wooden floor, but with much larger grain patterns than she was used to. Of course, looking beyond the ground confirmed her fear. Giant furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori was mortified. The shrinking serum was so expensive because it was real! She was standing on her own clothes, that she shrunk right out of. She felt so small, helpless, and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did her best to walk along the uneven surface of her shirt, finding it surprisingly difficult as there was no telling how far each footstep would sink into the folds of fabric. Once she reached the edge, she jumped the short distance and landed on the hardwood floor of her living room. She was between the couch and the rug, trying to decide which direction she should head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, someone enters the room. Who is it?</span></div></div>",

It seemed to echo through the air, constantly changing, but always sounding off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Trina's singing. Tori looked towards the stairs, where the overwhelming noise originated. She was shocked at how terrifying Trina looked. At Tori's size, from this distance, Trina's casual movement down the stairs looked like a distant titan descending from the heavens themselves. The stairs were so far away from her scale that they may as well have been skyscrapers on the horizon, but now there's a god-sized being descending them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Trina reached the bottom of the stairs and headed into the living room, Tori felt fear strike her heart as she could feel the vibrations with every step. Trina was unbelievably massive, her mind could hardly comprehend their size difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina was dressed very comfortably, wearing a large, loose-fitting shirt, sweatpants, and fuzzy slippers. The giantess walked over Tori, and sat down on the couch, her huge slippered feet resting on the ground, yards apart on either side of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Tori left her clothes just lying in the living room? What a slob,\" Trina remarked with annoyance. Her voice was so loud to Tori, it seemed to travel through the air as practically a roar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori ignored the comment, and tried yelling up to her giant sister from the floor hoping she could hear her and get her some help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Trina hear her bug-sized sister on the floor?</span></div></div>",

Tori's ears are assaulted by a ear-shattering cracking sound as Trina's huge tan toes scrunch inwards intently, cracking her toe knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori looked at her sister's huge bare feet with disgust on her face. Ugh, gross, she didn't want to be anywhere near Trina's feet. She wished she would put her slippers back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori could see Trina pull out her PearPhone and begin to text. Perfect, she thought. She was worried Trina would turn on the TV, and then it would be impossible for Trina to hear her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori shouted her lungs out at her giant sister from the hardwood floor down below. She kept yelling her name, as well as indiscriminately yelling just hoping she could make her voice loud enough. As a singer, she had faith in her powerful vocal cords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally, Trina's feet would move or shuffle slightly, and Tori grew nervous as they seemed to slowly come closer over time. The longer she spent down here near Trina's feet, the more she began to notice a stink slowly permeating the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori mostly stared up at Trina while she yelled, waiting for the moment she saw her big sister's gaze finally turn towards the ground. But she couldn't help but steal glances to her left and right, seeing the monolithic peds shift in her peripheral vision. Watching such huge toes, most probably bigger than her, wiggle and shift and occasionally seem to try and crawl closer, set her on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Tori's voice was growing hoarse and she began to doubt if she'd be able to go on, Trina's eyes finally flickered to the floor, and seemed to focus on where Tori was standing. Tori was ecstatic, she jumped and cheered, yelling, \"Yes! Trina, down here, it's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina's facial expression was confusion, and she peered closer. Tori assumed she just had a hard time processing what she was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was Trina seeing?</span></div></div>",

Oh no oh no, this is the worst-case scenario! \"Trina, no! It's me, Tori! It's your sister! I am not a bug!\" Tori shouted like her life depended on it, because it did. Unfortunately, her voice had grown quite hoarse from all the yelling she'd already been doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's heart seized with fear as she saw the gigantic foot to her left slide closer and lift into the air. It was brought directly over her, her huge sister's tan bare sole becoming her new sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a moment of terrifying clarity. She thought her life was supposed to flash in front of her eyes, but instead her mind seemed to slow down time so she could take in every detail of this moment. The exact shape of the giant sole looming over her, ready to remove her from this world. The round toes that would be cute if they weren't so huge and threatening. Every crease in the skin where Trina's foot flesh could fold if need be. The swirls in Trina's toe prints. The way that the foot looked mostly clean, cast in slight shadow from indirect light, yet still being able to see flecks of dirt and almost imperceptible spots of grime here and there, and even microbeads of sweat clinging in several different places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way Tori's mind captured this moment so perfectly, you would think she had seen God for the first time. In way, Trina's foot was sort of like a god to her in this moment. It loomed above, massive, incomprehensible. And it judged her. It judged her, and deemed her unfit for this world, so now it was taking it upon itself to remove her from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could potentially argue that, but nope. This was just her big sister's smelly foot. And Tori was the bug about to be squashed beneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment ended and Tori could only take a single step back as the monolith of foot flesh descended upon her. It crashed down, an unstoppable force crushing her in a way similar to how she thought being hit by a meteor might feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised to find that she lived long enough to discover that Trina's soft, fleshy foot even had some give. As she was pressed between the hardwood floor and her sister's skin, she felt her body pressed <i>into</i> Trina's foot, rather than just exploding immediately and letting Trina's foot reach all the way to floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a pleasant position by any means. The pressure was immeasurable, Tori thought it a miracle she was still alive. Such intense contact and friction between Trina's foot and her entire body meant she could feel the grime rubbing off from Trina's foot and onto her. And the microbeads of sweat coalesced and squelched between their two skins, coating Tori from head to toe in a light sheen of sweat. Though being covered in foot dirt and foot sweat was the least of her worries, as her life was about to be snuffed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr was it? Is it possible that she shrinking serum made Tori too durable to be crushed?</span></div></div>",

It was incredibly warm, and there was a definite scent of feet. She felt somewhat moist, from the incredibly light sheen of sweat from Trina's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori couldn't picture a more humiliating way to die. Being squished like a bug was horrible all on its own, but to die under her sister's stinky foot was the icing on the awful cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt as if she were rising, and gravity began to tug on her as the ground fell away from her. Her connection to the unbearably warm foot flesh began to weaken, and her body peeled away and fell what felt like ten or so feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact hurt, but she was more focused on the massive foot looming over her lifting away. Tori realized what had just happened, she had been stuck to Trina's foot. Gross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina's face came into view, peeking into vision miles above from behind the giant sole. Her face was filled with disgust, as she looked right at Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuck, it's still alive,\" Trina said, still viewing Tori as no more than a bug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrina didn't offer her any more words, she didn't feel a bug deserved such. All Tori saw next was the foot coming down at light speed and then nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer last ten minutes, Tori lived as a bug. She became the size of a bug, Trina identified her as a bug, and then she squished her like a bug.

After repressing the urge to buy absolutely everything she came across for a full ten minutes, she switched over to their Sky Mile selection. Every time she made a purchase she earned Sky Miles, and there was a section of their online shop that sold items that could only be purchased with Sky Miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany of the items were enticing, but Cat finally saw something that piqued her interest more than any other item. It would cost a <i>lot</i> of Sky Miles, but it definitely seemed worth it. She read and reread the description twice just to make sure it really was what she thought it was. When she was certain it was exactly what she hoped, she clicked \"Buy Now\" and confirmed the use of her Sky Miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Cat was a Sky Store Premium Member and the package was small enough, the website informed her she could expect her package in thirty minutes by drone.

It was easy for her to get distracted, so her mind left the serum hiding in her backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she remembered to visit Tori's house after school. Tori gladly welcomed her inside, and told Cat she'd be back in a minute. Tori went upstairs, leaving Cat in the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat opened her backpack and saw the bottle inside. \"Oh yeah, how could I forget!\" she said with great surprise, giggling. She took out the bottle, uncapped it, and took a big drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strawberry flavor was so delicious, Cat almost wanted to down the whole bottle, but she was hoping to get to use it more than once, so she put the cap back on and stuck it in her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was really yummy-\" Cat had started to say, but then she felt the process begin. Her whole body went tingly, and her vision began to swim. She had an intense feeling of falling for a couple of seconds, and then finally her vision came back to normal and she regained feeling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Cat exclaimed. It was dark, for some reason. And there was a scent of...her, it smelled like her, but there was something else to it.. She tried to move around but could make very little progress, there seemed to be fabric all around her. As she struggled she realized she was no longer wearing any of her clothes, so it was obvious what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat continued to struggle to find a way out of her clothes, while she heard faint booming sounds in the distance. They grew closer and more intense, until she could feel slight vibrations in the fabric she was trapped in with every boom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat?\" she heard, only just barely muffled, loud from above. It was Tori's voice. The booming sound got even closer, until it sounded like it was really close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, what the heck?\" she heard Tori's thunderous voice from above. The sound of fabric rubbing against fabric was louder than Cat expected it would be, and then light finally entered her area. There wasn't much to see, as her vision was filled with pink-filtered light. The fabric around her could just barely be seen through, especially this close up, so she could vaguely see the outline of her giant friend above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh, Cat? Why are...all of your clothes on the floor?\" Tori called out loudly, obviously sounding very concerned. Cat pushed against the pink material, finally pushing it aside and finding an opening she could walk out of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove her, Tori stood like a mountain, a goddess. She was massive, it was unbelievable. And it was something she could never have seen without that serum, so she was glad she bought it. Cat looked below and behind her, to see what pink clothing had trapped her, then she felt slightly embarrassed. She had been trapped inside of her own panties. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat tried yelling up to Tori. Does her friend hear her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Yes, Tori hears Cat and is quite surprised to see her friend naked and shrunken standing in a pile of her own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No, Tori doesn't hear Cat and continues looking for her, Cat has to figure out how to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No, Tori is weirded out by Cat's clothes all sitting in her living room so she takes them to her room for her. In the process, Cat is bunched back up into her panties and she's trapped there for now.</span></div></div>",

Cat grew nervous as her gigantic friend got so close to her, and then realized she was still naked. Embarrassed, Cat did her best to cover herself with her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori, whose face appeared only a couple dozen feet away from Cat's scale, studied her friend's tiny body in detail. Cat thought shrinking so small would be fun, but now she's thinking it's a little scary. She thought they could play and be silly, but the reality is much different. Tori's size is truly intimidating to her, she hadn't pictured her seeming so...powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori's face displayed a mix of confusion and concern. \"Cat? Is that you? Why are you small?\" she asked, genuinely surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bought a shrinking potion from Sky Store!\" Cat called back up to her, \"I thought it would be fun! Now I'm not so sure, my clothes didn't even shrink with me. I got trapped in my own panties!\" Cat confessed, embarrassed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCat's anecdote broke the tension a little and Tori giggled slightly, \"Aw, that's kind of adorable,\" she said, poking the tiny redhead's body. As the giant digit collided with Cat, it easily shoved her over. Cat fell back into the folds of her panties, before picking herself back up. Tori giggled at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be okay, Cat,\" Tori assured her tiny friend, \"Because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Tori say?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. \"Because I'm going to make sure we do all kinds of fun stuff while you're small, whatever you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. \"Because you look so cute like this, don't worry, I'll keep you and look after you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. \"Because you're the perfect size, I have just the job for you.\"</span></div></div>",

She hardly even looked at him, preferring to ignore he was even there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a package from Sky Store for you,\" he said, a little nervous. Even some grown adults naturally feared Jade, she just had that effect on people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing what he said, however, her demeanor changed. She looked at the man, with a smile of excitement. \"Ooh, my scissors,\" she purred, suddenly enthusiastic. Well, enthusiastic for Jade. This seemed to make the man even more nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cautiously handed him his clipboard, saying, \"I need your signature...p-please.\" Jade took the clipboard and quickly scribbled something and handed it back. He handed her the package, and then looked at his clipboard. The line she was supposed to sign had a couple of harsh expletives instead of her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-um, ma'am, you're supposed to sign your-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go!\" Jade barked, cutting the man off. He bolted in terror, completely intimidated by the scariest high school girl he'd ever met. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice shorts!\" she called after him, with a smirk. Jade quickly opened her Sky Store package and was delighted with its contents. It was a complex set of four-headed scissors. Quite the complicated design, but it looked intimidating, and if operated correctly, could cut four things at once. She was delighted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the box seemed awfully big just for her scissors. Investigating it, she noticed there was a smaller box inside, of which her scissors were lying on top of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a note tucked to the side, so she pulled it out and read it. The gist of it was since the scissors were such a pricey and unique item, they were offering her a free premium item to try and entice her to join their premium membership and get discounts on items such as her scissors, or gain access to items such as the one in the smaller box. Jade rolled her eyes, but decided to check it out anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened the box, what was inside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. A bottle with red liquid inside. Labeled as a shrinking serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A bottle with blue liquid inside. Labeled as a growth serum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

She had been keeping a secret deep in her heart that she had never, ever told anyone. Not a living soul. Because she found it embarrassing, and knew it was so contrary to everything everyone knew about her. She was afraid of being ridiculed, she didn't handle embarrassment well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade's big secret was that she secretly had a foot fetish. She was such a scary, domineering person who struck fear into the hearts of everyone who knew her. But her one secret weakness was feet. They made her weak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding this shrinking serum in her hands brought her weakness to the forefront. If she drank this, she would shrink down to tiny size, she would be small, helpless, and at the mercy of the feet she desperately craved. She could serve them, and be a puny little foot slave. In her heart of hearts, it's what she felt she deserved to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was internally struggling. Logically speaking this was the stupidest decision she could make. This potion does not indicate any time limit or way to grow back. There's no antidote as far as she's aware. She's almost certain a separate growth serum would need to be purchased to change her back, and from what she understood this shrinking serum was hard to get, so the growth serum would be too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew it was stupid to uproot and completely change every aspect of her life, and become the extreme opposite of what everyone else saw. To go from a scary, socially-powerful teenage goth girl to a shrunken, pathetic little foot slave dutifully serving the feet of her master...It was the worst, most stupid possible decision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut lust always wins, and Jade already found herself walking to her destination. She thought she was arguing with herself, but her legs were already carrying her forward to the decision she was trying not to make. Because she was going to make the decision. The shrinking serum was in her hand, and she was minutes away from drinking it and starting her new life. She left her new scissors behind, because she wouldn't need them anymore. Possessions were for big people, she was about to be nothing more than a tiny foot slave who had no use for things like that. Well, also, if she was small she couldn't operate them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was to find the person she wished to serve. Their feet were the ones she lusted after most, the ones she most wished to serve and worship. She sneaked glances every chance she got, but now she felt as if she could fulfill her purpose. She thought it may be hard to convince them at first, but once they saw her dedication to their feet she was sure they would allow her her new position in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose feet did Jade desire to serve so badly?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There are several Hollywood Arts students we're very familiar with, but the school is full of students you've never heard of. Who shall we follow?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Kyra Lane</b><br>\r\n Kyra has a very light brown skin tone, and long dark brown hair. She's around 5'5\", and has a more slender build. She got into Hollywood Arts for being an incredible dancer. Kyra is very outgoing and speaks her mind. She can be a bit feisty and loves teasing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>James Way</b><br>\r\nJames has lightly tanned skin and short black hair. He's about 5'9\" and lean. He got into Hollywood Arts on the merits of his acting. James is fairly popular, and a relatively pleasant guy. But some find him annoying, and he's got a couple of ex-girlfriends who hate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Melody Evans</b><br>\r\nMelody has light skin and medium-length blonde hair. She's around 5'3\" and a healthy weight. She got into Hollywood Arts for her singing voice, and yes she's heard that joke before. Melody is often pretty nice on the surface, but she holds grudges and can be kind of petty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Jenny Wallace</b><br>\r\nJenny has pale, freckled skin and long, red hair. She's about 5'10\" and skinny. She got into Hollywood Arts for her writing talent, as she both writes scripts as well as songs. Jenny is often seen as pretty weird. Most still like her, but she's undeniably strange and has odd interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the custom students, you can kind of do what you want, maybe they interact with the main cast, maybe all the people they interact with are custom, maybe they only know custom people but are acquaintances or even good friends with just a single main cast member, whatever tickles your fancy, have fun with it. And feel free to write more custom options, I suck at them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you add to \"More Options\" and can only add two choices, go ahead and make two new custom characters, and then either message me or wait for me to add a third More Options choice. If you can add three or more choices yourself, then you won't need my help. Have fun!</span></div></div>",

Please do your best with your writing. If you need help with anything or need any typos fixed feel free to message me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The original had a No Male Giants rule, and while male giants are not my thing personally, I see no reason to explicitly ban them. So male giants are allowed if that's your thing, however, if you are following a path with females and wish to add a male giant, please always allow a choice/path forward to avoid it. The same applies to the opposite scenario, for fairness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. I kinda hate scat, so preferably avoid it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that feel free to do whatever I guess. If something becomes a problem I will update the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: You may be wondering why in certain sections I have added the option for either shrinking/growth serums or a size ray instead of just picking one and sticking with it. The answer is because I wanted to allow an option for people who enjoy stories with frequent size changing and the ability to \"get revenge\" if a tiny person gets regrown, hence the size ray. Also I'm thinking the serum/potion won't shrink/grow clothing and the size ray will.</td>",
