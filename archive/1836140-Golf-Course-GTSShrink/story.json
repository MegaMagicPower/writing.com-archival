In that time, you've been sitting at a table putting marks on the driving range balls so that nobody tries to steal them from the place.  In short, you are bored stiff.  But you can't complain much; it's free money if you just sit around with no customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, things are going to be different.  You have a way to make this a fun work day...for you, at least.  You reach into your pocket and pull out a small rectangular device.  It almost looks like a small remote, but there are only a few buttons on it.  It's a size-changing device, and you want to give it a whirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about the possibilities: You could shrink yourself down if you wanted, or you could try making Mary or Kelly -- the other two people in the clubhouse -- grow a bit.  A smile forms on your face.  You like the idea of giant women; you've had a giantess fetish for years.  It wouldn't be hard to do, either.  Mary and Kelly are both in the back room.  You could head back and try it right now, or you could wait.</span></div></div>",

Kelly was a absolute beauty before but now, the fact she's a giantess, She is like a real goddess. Her blonde straight hair over her fine shaped face. Her perfect figure body managing to look better than it ever has. You would be lying if you said you didn't have a crush on her. Even though she's several years older than you. You put the size device that shrunk with you into your back pocket and make your trek to Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently she's sitting in the lobby on one off the chairs. Since its a slow day both of you don't really have to worry about a guest. Hence the reason you shrunk yourself. You walk up to her giant sneaker and come stunned again at the colossal in front of you. You smile as you start running towards the sneaker and pulled yourself onto it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on top of the shoe you decide to get your freaky foot fetish a quick shot. You run over towards Kelly's sneaker opening and took a big sniff. The foot odor entering your nostrils and even though it was disgusting you were loving every second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kept sniffing over and over again. In the meantime getting a massive erection. You were so into your own little world that you didn't notice that Mary your boss came in . Quite pissed off by the fact that both her employees are goofing around<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly get up. I don't pay you to sit down\" Mary scolded \"Fine, but I'll be doing nothing standing either\" \"At least look like your busy. And where the hell is (Your Name)!\" Mary yelled as she walked out and looked for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly got up from the chair and started walking towards the _________. With you hanging onto her shoelace for dear life.</span></div></div>",

You get up from the table and start walking toward the back room of the clubhouse, but before you get to the doorway, you pause.  You think to yourself that you might get a better reaction from her if she didn't know that you were behind it.  For that matter, since you're only trying it on her, you don't want Kelly to see you do it, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are interrupted when Kelly emerges from the back room.  You jump back, slightly startled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, didn't mean to scare you,\" Kelly says, brushing her dark brown hair out of her face.  \"I'm heading to the store.  I'll be back later.  Mary's in the back if you need her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait as Kelly leaves the clubhouse, then gets in her green Jeep and drives away.  <i>Now's my chance!</i> you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Mary comes out of the back room.

She walks over to the table and starts inspecting each golf ball one by one.  Her back is facing you, and she doesn't see you take the size remote and point it at her.

After all, since you're 5'11\" and she's normally 5'8\", she'll practically tower over you at her new height.  You press the button to make her grow.  A low hum comes from the remote, but not enough for Mary to notice.  Slowly, you see Mary's body getting larger.  From what you know of the remote, it is supposed to keep most clothing fabrics intact, so Mary's shirt and pants won't rip or anything like that.  You don't know if that applies to shoes, though.  If she's wearing socks, those might stay intact...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head and snap back to the present moment.  You release the button when it looks like Mary's grown a full foot.  Right on cue, Mary stops what she's doing and looks down at the table.  \"Did something happen to the table?\" she asks, still not facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it seems lower than before,\" Mary says.  \"It's weird.  It seemed just fine a minute ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug.  \"Looks okay to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should look into getting another table,\" Mary says.  You're kind of surprised she hasn't noticed anything about how the ceiling seems closer to her head, or how everything in the clubhouse looks like it's gotten smaller.  Mary must have been really focused on inspecting those golf balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut sure enough, something does happen to get Mary's attention to her new height.

By a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, you fake surprise.  \"This is news to me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary walks over to you, grimacing just a little bit.  \"Look for yourself,\" she says.  \"I'm practically a foot taller than you now.  I've never been taller, and definitely not by this much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to say,\" you tell Mary.  \"Though you look very attractive at that height.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is no time for jokes, Nick,\" says Mary.  \"Something isn't right here.\"  She walks over to the doorway that leads to the back room.  You notice that she seems to be walking awkwardly.  \"See, Nick?\" she says.  \"My head goes over the top of the doorway.  It wasn't like that a minute ago.  I could go right through it before.\"  Again, a slight pained look comes to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary bends down and takes off her sandals.  \"My sandals feel tight.  Very tight,\" she says.  She checks the sole where the size is labeled.  \"It says Size 8, which I know I am, but they weren't tight at all when I put them on this morning.\"  She pauses for a moment.  \"I can't believe it,\" she says.  \"I've...grown somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's pretty unbelievable,\" you say.  \"I mean, nobody grows that much that quickly.\"  You can barely contain your giddiness.  You want to find out how much longer you can keep this up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't explain this,\" Mary says.  \"It is very, very strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't contain the grin on your face any longer.  You just hope Mary doesn't see it.</span></div></div>",

She steps toward you and towers over you.  \"If you know something, now would be a good time to speak up.\"  Your heart is beating faster than normal.  Clearly you're nervous, and Mary can sense it.  She puts her big hands on your shoulders and grips tightly.  \"What did you do?\" she says with a calm tone, a tone that defies her apparent displeasure with her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath.  \"I think I should show you something,\" you say.  \"But not here.  We need to go outside, where we'll have space.  Like maybe the parking lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary looks confused, but nods.  \"Okay,\" she says.  \"It's not like we have customers anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After you,\" you say, sweeping your hand toward the door.

You press the \"Grow\" button and Mary shoots up to a bigger height.  You stop at around 30 feet, a sort of \"mini-giantess\" height.  Big enough for now, anyway.  You look up at Mary's huge body, all the way down to her feet which are as long as a car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the fun begins,\" you say.  Mary, meanwhile, is NOT amused.

As the hand comes down, you dodge and roll away.  Mary's hand hits the ground causing a light rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not messing around, Nick,\" says Mary.  \"I don't know why you think this is a good idea, but let me tell you this, it is NEVER a good idea to make a giant angry.

Still, she's mad, and she intends to get you.  You need to distance yourself somehow.  Unfortunately, being at a golf course doesn't leave you with many options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't make it to your car because Mary is standing between you and it.  However, off to the side of the clubhouse sits one of the golf carts you use to check the greens.  It's not fast, but it could be enough to escape.  Unless Mary gets to it first, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, you could always make a stand <i>inside</i> the clubhouse.  If forced to, you've got plenty of clubs laying around in there, so you have weapons to defend yourself should Mary get really angry.

You can actually see the tear line going through Mary's sandals.  It's almost like something you'd see on TV, the kind of thing that happens for dramatic effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary notices, too.  \"Oh my God!\" she exclaims, just as the tearing is complete.  With a small pop, both sandals break, and now Mary stands barefoot in the clubhouse.  \"What the hell just happened?\" she says, picking up her sandals to examine them.  \"There shouldn't be anything wrong with these.

Are you scared of my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than take the time to think up a lie, you instinctively tell the truth.  The WHOLE truth.  \"N-no,\" you say.  \"In fact, I love your feet.  I've always stared at them whenever you come in here.  That's part of why I brought the remote.  I thought if I had the chance I could shrink down and see your feet up close and at giant size.

So, Kelly it is, then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start thinking about how you plan to get Kelly alone for long enough to make her grow.  You're also thinking about how big you want her to be.  Maybe just a little at first, maybe a lot.  Just then you hear Mary's voice from the back room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick!\" she says.  \"If you're done putting marks on those golf balls, I need you to bring one of the benches over to the clubhouse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to groan.  Menial labor is not one of your favorite things to do.  Still, you might be able to work this in your favor.  \"Which bench?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The one out by the 16th hole on the miniature course,\" Mary says.  \"It's looking pretty rough from being out in the elements.  We need to put some paint on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that when Mary says \"we\", she means you.  Something else to look forward to, you say to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mary,\" you say, \"those benches are pretty heavy and awkward to carry.

That's exactly the opening you were looking for.  You and Kelly head out to the wooden bench in question.  Kelly brushes back her brown hair and looks down at her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have changed into something other than flip-flops,\" she says.  She takes a look at the bench.  \"I know Mary wants to put paint on this thing, but even if she did, this still looks awful.  She needs to get a new one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've mentioned that to her before,\" you say.  \"She says she doesn't have the money to buy a new one, so as long as this one is somewhat usable, she's keeping it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly snorts.  \"Maybe someone should just take an axe and smash this shit to pieces,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who needs an axe?</i> you think to yourself.

You and Kelly look over to the parking lot, where a silver minivan has just pulled in.  A mother with two young kids come out.  Because of the distance from there to the clubhouse, they must not have taken notice of Kelly, but now that they're out of the van, they notice all too well.  The kids start screaming frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Monster!  Monster!\" they start crying.  The mother tries to hurry them back into the van.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly growls at you.  \"Dammit, Nick!\" she says.  She then turns toward the mom and kids.  \"It's okay, really, there's nothing to be afraid of!\" she says.  She adjusts her body and moves her feet, but she didn't think about the clearance she would need to swing her legs like that.  Her left foot smacks into the brick and metal structure on Hole #11, which is designed to look like Humpty Dumpty.  It doesn't break, but to Kelly, the impact is like stubbing your toe on the corner of a piece of furniture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Kelly roars in pain.  Slightly off-balance, she wobbles a bit.  She puts a hand out to steady herself, which is right on the clubhouse awning.  It fails to hold, and her hand crashes right through.  Tiles and wood fall into the walkway around the clubhouse windows.  By now, the mom and kids have hopped in the van and sped away.  No one knows what they're going to do with the sight they just saw, but suddenly you feel a knot in your stomach.  It's the kind of feeling you get when something very bad is about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis feeling is further validated when Kelly glares at you with fire in her eyes.  \"What the fuck is wrong with you, Nick?\" she bellows.  \"Are you enjoying this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of dread washes over you.  Almost instinctively, you start to back away.  \"Kelly, calm down, I'm sorry,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you're sorry, then change me back!  NOW!\" Kelly roars.  She takes a step toward you -- presumably without fulling considering her current size -- and steps right onto the bench you were supposed to move.  With a quick cracking and crunching sound, the bench now resembles kindling like Kelly had previously been talking about.  \"Happy now?\" Kelly demands.  \"Did that get your rocks off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is clearly furious with you.  This is a bad situation.  And, naturally, you make things worse by running in terror.  Not far, mind you, but toward the back end of the mini-golf course, thinking that Kelly won't come after you with all those obstacles in her way.

You wave back, and the two of them walk out to the parking lot towards Kelly's car.  They stop about halfway.  You can see they're wide in the open, so you can grow them quite a bit if you wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gets you thinking of something else.  Obviously, you could just grow both of them to something like 10 or 20 feet, just to start small.  But since Kelly is already a bit taller than Mary, maybe you could grow them and leave Mary taller than Kelly.  That might be really funny.  In any event, you don't know if growing two women at the same is even possible with the remote.  Still, it's worth trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip away from the water feature and walk toward them, standing in the awning at the edge of the clubhouse and still several feet away.

Aside from you, the worker on this shift, there are two other major characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary, the owner of the golf course, is about 5'8\" and has size 8 feet.  She's 45 years old and nice most of the time, but she loves being the boss and taking charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, the owner's niece, is about 5'10 and has size 9 feet.  She's 30 years old and likes chatting with you, and she doesn't like the way Mary runs the business.  She thinks she could make for a better owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday you brought with you a size-changing device which serves as the catalyst of the story.  The rest is self-explanatory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGround rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.  No sex.  Some nudity is okay, but don't go overboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.  No vore/toilet/insertion related things.  Keep this as foot-related/crush-related as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.  It is up to you whether you want the interaction to be shrink or growth as you write the chapters.  Just no giant males.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.  Shrinking should be limited to no smaller than 3 inches, and growth no bigger than 150 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.  The size-changing device can be broken.  If that happens, you must find another way for the size changing to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  Don't do one-line chapters.  I reserve the right to delete anything I find unsatisfactory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7.  If you have questions, message me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.  NEW RULE: Make sure ANY and ALL giantesses are AT LEAST 18 years of age!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, since this is an interactive, I encourage people to add to this themselves!  Trust me, if I'm left to write it all, it would only be a matter of time before all the branches converged to the same thing.  Get in there and add some of your own flavor!</td>",
