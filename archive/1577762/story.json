When all of the sudden, a freak greenish beam comes out of the sky, and engulfs the handsome young teenage boy. The boy could literally feel himself being picked up, and levitated off the water. The beam has also destroyed Tim's small ship. Tim is wearing nothing but blue cut off jeans, as the mysterious beam engulfs him further, and he begins to moan in a bit of pain. He is starting to become huge, as his swimming trunks rip off his body, falling down towards the sea. Now completely naked, and gigantic, the boy is released and dropped into the sea, unharmed. Now a nude giant, and Tim goes where? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Also, we will start him off at sixty feet tall, but he can get even taller!     </span></div></div>",

All of the party-goers began to scramble to the end farthest away from the giant, whilst others chose to commit suicide by diving over the edge and drowning. They would be considered the lucky ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim reached down towards the boat and grabbed up ten twenty-year-olds. Raising them to his face, he gave them a wink and then a smile. Quickly, he reached down towards his Yacht-sized dick and crushed them against it. Shortly after he had his fun with them, he positioned himself on his knees. The water washed all of the blood and guts off of his groin area. He smiled before plowing a hand down into the boat. Many perished underneath of the enormous teen's palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim chuckled and stood back up.

As he walked down the road, he saw an old hippie style van parked near a large lake. Chris then saw a skinny old hippie guy, complete with a long dirty beard, sitting in the front seat of the van. Immediately, Chris recognized this guy as his dealer. Chris didn\u2019t know his real name, so he just called him Fred. As Chris walked over to Fred, Fred smiled, and greeted him with, \u201cHay dud, how\u2019s it hanging homes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cA little to the left,\u201d Chris replied! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSmart Ass,\u201d Fred said laughing. \u201cSo what do you want today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLet me see, I will have a Big Mac Jamaican style,\u201d Chris said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWell, here it is,\u201d Fred, said, as he took Chris\u2019s money, and gave him a small box full of joints. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Chris then smiled and said \u201cThank you,\u201d as he walked away from the van. Just to let you know, a few days before Fred cultivated his weed, a secret government plane dusted a small portion of his crop with an untested defoliant, or weed killer, just to see what it would do to the weed. Chris was more then a half of a mile from the van, when he decided to go behind some lush trees and smoke a joint. As Chris smoked this really powerful joint, he started to giggle stupidly, and he began to feel lightheaded. He then continued to smoke his roach, and as he did so, he began to feel dizzy. He then looked at the joint, and said, \u201cThis is some really good shit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As Chris continued to smoke, he felt his clothes becoming tighter, and at the same time, he also saw that everything was becoming smaller, much smaller. He then felt all of his clothes suddenly ripping off his body, (Think the incredible Hulk) but he never felt any pain, he was now as high as a kite. Now laughing stupidly, Chris still didn\u2019t understand that he was now over one hundred feet tall, and completely naked. Still hidden, but barely by the nearly two hundred feet tall redwood trees, Chris stands up, naked as the day he was born, and looks around in aw. Now a little over a hundred feet tall, and still high, Chris goes where? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Note; the tiny women and girls Chris finds would be around four inches tall.</span></div></div>",

He shifted his grip and ran his fingers along every feature that he had previously only been eyeing. He gently massaged those perfect boobs, he brushed the fiery red hair away from her face and made an effort to comfort her, and he rubbed his index finger along her impressively toned thighs.

He lowers her down to his erection and, flipping her over, places her front on it.<br>\r\nTaking the hint right away, she starts grinding on his cock, wrapping her arms and legs around it and using those on him. She then starts licking him as she feels her juices flowing out. She keeps doing this up and down his length, even through his twitches.

Chris always wanted to visit Japan but this was different. One night he was in a club in Japan while on Summer break. He was only mining his business when he notices he started to get dizzy and finally passed out. Here is where he woke up. He woke up with his same clothes and his belongings. He thought he was going to be dissected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door opened from the other side of the room. A beautiful Japanese woman came through the door. Her long black hair passed down her shoulders and her lab coat was barely kept buttoned from his 34 D rack. She was carrying a clipboard and a strange vile that glowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name is Asuka and I am here to conduct a test\" , she said in perfect English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it going to hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, all you have to do is drink this vile and wait for 5 minutes. After that we will pay you for any inconvenience we have brought you including a plane ride home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?....Well what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a serum to enhance the body and mind. We have been working on it for quite some time but there is one problem. It doesn't work well on Japanese people. So we decided to capture a foreigner to test it here on yourself. There should be no negative effects and if you keep quiet about this, we will pay you for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris smiled and the idea. He had problems paying his student loans and needed cash to pay for his rent. It was by chance his parents paid this vacation for him to Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I will do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Well bottoms up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe liquid poured down his throat. It was warm and felt strange. In moments Chris felt as if the room was getting smaller. Asuka stood back in amazement as he grew. His clothes began to shred off his body as his head hit the ceiling.

The manager at Happy Fast Eats was a totally prick. He continue to come up with crazy ways to make his food taste better even though some of his ideas were illegal. Dan usually kept his mouth shut as he helped him do it. The manager usually gave him a bonus helping him do it after hours.

He looked at the barrel and noticed it smelt funny. The top of it was open and some of its goo had spilled out onto the top of the barrel. He took his finger and wiped some up and licked it off his finger. The taste was unbearable. Dan almost couldn't believe the taste. Morning was coming and he had to go home and get some sleep before his next shift. He began to walk home when he noticed everything was getting smaller.

Then you grabbed the rest of the people who were in the dinner and plopped them into your mouth and chewed them up till blood started to seep out of your mouth. You left one person tough just in case you got hungry later. You got up and realized everything about yourself has change. It wasn't just the height it was the muscles, the toned muscular legs, your manhood that now reached down to your knees and the girth of your manhood was so thick that if you were at normal height you would be thicker than a gallon can of milk. Your balls could be used as beanbag chairs, a well-defined diamond hard 12 pack abs, biceps, triceps, muscular forearm, broad solders. You had everything to woe over any girls over even is she was lesbian. You started walking down the street stepping on any cars, people, you could find. You enjoyed they way your cock would swing with every step. Finally once you got to Sunny's house you tear the roof off and see his hot blonde girlfriend Melisa, who was once your friend. They try to make a run for it but you are quicker and pick them up. Your cock started getting erect. With each pulse it got bigger and bigger and bigger. It finally stopped once the tip was just underneath your chin. You could hear their pleas but you payed no heed to them. First you put Sunny in the top and watched as he slowly slid down until you could feel him in your left ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa: \"Danny, Please I beg of you I'll do anything just let me live\". You saw Melissa Start to sob<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan/You: \"Don't cry Melissa, Please, I wasn't going to kill you. We were once friends remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa: *starts to calm down* \"Really you're not going to kill me Dan? OH THANK-YOU SO MUCH. WAIT WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE WERE ONCE FRIENDS! WE STILL ARE!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan: \"Woah- c-c-calm down Mel. It's just that we don't hang out anymore and ...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel.: \" THAT'S YOUR FAULT DAN, YOU DIDN'T DATE ME!!!!

I SHOULD HAVE JUST KIDNAPPED YOU DAN AND KEPT YOU TO MYSELF!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan: \"Mel. I-I-I never knew you liked me. S-s-s sorry:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: \" LISTEN UP DAN I DON'T LIKE YOU I LOVE YOU, AND I WANT YOU!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan: *Blushes and sits down on Sunny's house (destroys the house)* \"Mel how do I grow you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: \"IDK, but based on the giant(es) couple stories most grow by cum / sex we should try that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan: \"Okay, we'll try that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou create a circle with you legs and put Melissa down in the circle. And you started to masturbate your long manhood. It did not take long for you to cum. You came and came again. Your semen shot up in the air and landed around Mel. you came so much that it surfaced to Mel's shoulders. Immeditley she started to gulp as much as she could. \"Damn she must really love me\" you though to yourself as she practically chugged your semen. Slowly she started to grow! her clothes started to tear at the seams of her shirt and jeans. While she grew she gulped more and more of your cum. She finally hit 20 feet and her cloths have finally given up. she stood naked, long legs, slim waist, thick hips,a juicy round toned ass, breasts the size of melons, long blonde hair, green eyes. What was there not to love about her. Soon it seemed her body started absorbing the cum like a sponge and she grew faster and faster until all the cum was gone. She was now 195 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel pushes you down destroing 2 other houses and lays on top of your body and gives you a kiss. You don't smell any cum. She continues to kiss slowly. Once she is done she looks into your eyes and breathes heavily. You look back into her's until she says...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: \"I really love you Dan\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan / Your : \"Same here Mel\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: \" I'm a bit tired I'm going to sleep, We'll continue in the morning.

You need him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: \"Yhea, I'm a bit hungry\" * You give her to Mel, and she chews on him very delicatley to try and keep him alive for some time then she finally chomps down on his body and swallows*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan: Mel you remember when we were kids and we'd act like giants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel: Yhea, that's why I love you, you were the only one who was into that stuff other than me. *Mel gives you another kiss and then falls asleep on your body.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once upon a time, there was a 3 year old boy named Simon. He was sitting in his playpen playing with his toys when he started feeling tingly. Then he started growing and he was smiling as everything around him was getting smaller. His onesie strained to keep up and soon ripped. Only his white diaper was growing with him. It wasn't long until he hit his head on the 1st floor's roof and then smashed through it. A few seconds later he hit his head against the 2nd floor roof. Then he smashed through the roof and kept growing. A few minutes later he stopped growing at 200 feet tall. He had obliterated his house and a neighbor's house. Many people were just staring at him and were panicking when they saw his diaper. Simon smiled as he saw toy buildings around and many bugs running away from him. He stood up and brushed rubble off his diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yelled out \"New Toys\". He walked over to a small building and stomped down on it. He giggled as it crumbled. The he sat down on another building and crushed it beneath his diaper. He turned to face a building that was a little taller than him. Dozens were staring at his massive diaper. Simon smiled and wrapped the building in a hug. He giggled as the building groaned and crumbled. Then Simon walked to another building around the same size. He turned around and smashed his butt through the building. He giggled as he sat amongst the rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon felt nature calling and walked to another building. He told everyone to get out before he destroyed the building. People began running out in mass panic. Simon scooped them up and shoved them into his diaper. When he had dozens trapped inside, he ripped the building to shreds. He walked over to a 50 foot building and ripped off the roof. The people inside just looked up as Simon sat down on the building. First, he started peeing and the people inside his diapers desperately tried to swim in pee but they all drowned. Then he ripped a big fart and laughed. He pushed several logs into his diaper killing everyone inside. His diaper sagged into the building pinning the people in the building to the floor. The building groaned and crumbled to the ground. There was a crunch as most people inside his diaper were squished. Simon squished around in his full diaper, squishing any of the bodies that were left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon laughed as he caused death and destruction with a full diaper. He stood back up and let his diaper sag several feet. He patted the seat of his diaper. He enjoyed the warm feeling of his blood stained diaper. He looked down at a group of little bugs and smiled. These people started running in a mass panic. Simon started chasing after them, leaving footprints in the street. Simon was gradually gaining on these people. As he caught up to them, he lifted up his foot and stomped it down on the crowd, squishing several people. He lifted his other foot and squished several more. The people screamed as a toddler\u2019s foot came down and flattened them like pancakes. It hardly took a minute for him to squish every last little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he squished these people, the buildings stayed standing. Simon had an idea to change that. He walked over to one row of buildings. He lightly shoved the first building. It leaned over and collapsed into the building next to it. That building collapsed into the building next to it. These big buildings had been turned into dominoes by a giant kid. When the crumbling stopped, dozens of buildings had collapsed. Simon walked over to the other side of the street and did the same thing. He just laughed at the easiness of causing such destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed the bright lights of the city center. There were still dozens of buildings between him and his new target. These buildings were not going to stop this giant toddlers\u2019 playtime. He walked up to the first in a line of buildings between him and the city center. The height of these building ranged from being level with the waistband of him diapers to being several stories taller than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first building was the shortest of all. His diaper was pressed up against the building. The people inside the top floors were gagging from the smell of his massive diaper. Simon ripped the roof off the building and smiled at the bugs inside. Simon waved and said bye-bye to the little bugs. Simon stepped forward and smashed through the building, giggling as the building crumbled. He kept skipping along smashing buildings. The people in the floors that were level with his diaper got a quick view and sniff of his diaper before he smashed through the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimon smashed into the city center with a smile on his face. He sat down on a building, and it crumbled beneath him. Then he targeted a building that reached his knees. He got down on his knees, put his hands on the building, pushed down, and the building crumbled. He got up and smiled as he destroyed another building by pulling it towards him. After that, he pushed another building to the ground. Then he stomped down on another. Simon walked down the street a bit and swung his hand back. His hand smashed through a few buildings. The people on the ground were running. Simon just smiled and shoved another building, again creating a domino effect. Then he did the same thing on the other side of the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of buildings were destroyed and the rubble trapped the citizens. Simon walked over to the trapped toys. The people looked up at the giant toddler\u2019s sagging diaper. Simon turned around and patted his diapered butt. Simon sat down and giggled as several people squished beneath his full diaper. He got up a bit and sat down squishing several more. He kept bouncing on his butt and crushing people every time his diaper hit the pavement. Many were gagging from the smell of his diaper before they were squished like bugs. It took a couple minutes for all the people to be squished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly single or double story homes were left standing. Simon got up and walked over to these buildings. He got down on his hands and knees. Simon reached forward and smashed his hand through a house making him laugh. He started crawling though these small houses. These houses were no match against his hands and knees. Anytime he found a little person in the street, the bug would be put into the giant\u2019s diaper. When he got to the last building still standing, he sat on it. Then was a crash and crunch as the house and everybody inside his diaper were crushed. He looked around and laughed at the destroyed city. \u201cThat toy city was destroyed so easily, but there are more toys to play with\u201d said Simon as he noticed another city.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason was a young 23 year old, college student for the past three years now. He'd lived a rather troubled life over the past few years. It seemed like everything had gone wrong for him since middle school - changing schools, losing all of his friends, dealing with bullies. He never was all that popular, and his older siblings flaunted their own popularity and success in his face. His siblings always used to bully him as well - he was the youngest of four children, and the smallest. His siblings always picked on him for being so small...that is until he got his growth spurt and became the tallest one in his family. It was at that time he'd realized the power that his size could give him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourse Jason was no stranger to this; all throughout the stresses he'd discovered since adolescence, he'd figured out a way to relieve his tensions. He'd always had a latent size-fascination since childhood, but he didn't know it was a full on fetish until he started using the Internet; finding out there were people out there who shared his proclivity. He began reading several stories about size-changing; usually women becoming giantesses, and it wasn't long until he'd found several websites dedicated to some adulterated \"artwork\" of Giantess-Themed situations. Though throughout all that, he never really saw himself in place of the protagonist - he didn't fap to the idea of substituting himself with the victim. He saw the stories as a bit of a power-fantasy; imagining all the things he'd do if he were a giant - especially to all the people who wronged him. He would sometimes joke about being a giant in the Anime - Attack on Titan. He was sure he'd be the biggest and strongest Titan there. He knew that he was a pretty tall and intimidating guy, but being a true giant...no one would stand up to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was just a stupid power fantasy to him; after all, he didn't consider himself the type who would hurt anyone, even given the opportunity. Besides, even if he was, it's not like he could just grow in size one day. But that's the usual dialogue; nothing that Jason wanted ever went his way. He wasn't even able to go to the college he wanted to - he got accepted, but there were complications. He had a crappy apartment that smelled like a sewer, he didn't have a car so he had to walk everywhere he went, he was tired of having to take bullshit classes and he was fed up with his minimum wage job, where all of his customers trampled all over him. Jason didn't know why he bothered anymore; he didn't know what he would do after college, except be saddled with years of debt. And with no career in sight, if things didn't change for him, he often considered that suicide would be the only option left. But he never brought himself to it; he seemed too angry to go through with it, like it would be an admission of defeat. Jason soon realized that it was his anger that was keeping him alive. Too bad it couldn't fix his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr could it? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The incessant beeping snapped Jason out of his day-dream. He sighed and slowly dropped the dirty bacon-tray and his scour-pad. He walked back over to the drive-thru window, and listened as his coworker took the order at the front window. Sure enough, the car came around the corner, only for another car to quickly replace it. Jason hated this part of the job - he remembered that it used to be fun, but after the past three years, it just got tedious. Whenever a customer showed up here, it meant that an entire convoy was wrapped around the damn store. It wouldn't be so bad if the people would stop coming for about 10 minutes or so; but whenever they get started, they won't stop for nearly 3 hours. And Jason's job was split between taking these people's money AND washing the dishes; bad enough that the two stations were on separate ends of the store, but compounding the matter was that whenever the customers started, he had to stay put until they stopped, so that he wouldn't be able to get back to the sink. If he wasn't done by the end of his shift, he was forced to stay behind until they were done - without pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut of course, the worst part of this job was dealing with the impatient, self-important, over-entitled customers who came to his window, and harassed him whenever they don't get their way. And Jason was expected to - as he put it - 'take it in the ass', no matter how many times he got into trouble through no fault of his own...like right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" he heard a voice call. He turned to see his manager, Clark, come around the corner. \"The gentleman up there is saying you were giving him attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He ordered two desserts with his meal; our desserts are buy-one, get-one free, so he only had to pay half-price. But he kept expecting to pay full price for it; so I calmly explained to him about our sale...and he didn't believe me. He thought I was lying to him; God knows why. What the hell is going on, Clark? We've had this sale for over a month, and people are still ignorant about it; even though that fucking sign out there tells them about it out-right! I'm NOT responsible for these people's stupidity!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter, Jason,\" Clark said. \"The customers are always right; which means stupidity is always right. And I'm tired of coming back here to remind you of that; just an hour ago, I had a customer complaining that you were losing your temper with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy intentionally dropped his change on the ground and then demanded that I replace it for him!\" Jason yelled. \"You want my drawer to come up short at the end of my shift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep taking that tone with me, and see what happens,\" Clark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right; you're not going to fire me,\" Jason said. \"After half the things I've pulled in this store, if you didn't fire me then, you're not firing me now. Plus, over the past three years, I'm the only person who has stuck around with you for this long. Want to get rid of one of your most loyal workers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright smart-ass; just try to hold back for the rest of the day. And get those dishes done,\" Clark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah; next time that guy shows up here asking for dessert, I'll provide the cream-filling myself...special filling,\" Jason said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I don't understand - why do I have to pay THAT much for my order?\" stupid woman number 378 (for that day) asked Jason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You DID order four LARGE combos all with specialty sides; correct?\" Jason asked after a quiet sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those combos are charged at $8.69 a piece and the specialty sides are $1.00 extra,\" Jason said. \"And you ordered four of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I don't see why I should have to pay ALL of that,\" the woman said. \"That is way too expensive; I remember just last week, these same combos were only one dollar each.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-No, they were not,\" Jason said. He'd been working here for three years, and yet he heard nonsense like this every week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, did you just say 'No' to me?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-I think your biggest problem is that you haven't been told 'no' enough in your life,\" Jason said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't say 'What' - it's very impolite,\" Jason smirked. A woman like her once used that saying on HIM a long time ago, and it really pissed him off; he was glad that he got to turn it around for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you cranked up the price and are just trying to extort me,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I went through ALL that effort to just randomly target one self-entitled woman, who thinks she's owed a free meal,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while, more customers had been coming through, and Jason knew that they were wrapped around the store. People waiting behind this bitch were honking their horns trying to get the line moving. And worse, the guy at the intercom was being a total douche-bag. He'd had four multiple orders, and each were incredibly long and very specific. Mandi was the one taking orders at the front, but the guy was going so fast, she couldn't keep up the order. And worse, he kept switching back an forth between the orders, making changes to his previous orders, and it was hard to keep them straight. And worse, he was losing his temper with Brandi when she asked him to repeat his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I am being treated unfairly,\" the stupid woman continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to pay for your food, or not?\" Jason asked, losing his patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not paying that ridiculous price for just a few sandwiches,\" she said. \"Especially not when its so obvious that you're trying to cheat me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was now getting really pissed and started to cringe; even this woman's grating voice was intolerable at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of this; I want to speak to your manager, now,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason had begun to tremble with rage, gritting his teeth and clenching his fists. This woman's shrill voice, the honking cars, and the bastard over the intercom was decimating his last nerve. And then, finally came the last straw that broke the camel's back. Mandi was having trouble with the man's final order, and the guy went full asshole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-no-NO! I said I wanted extra mayonnaise, not mustard! What is wrong with you, you stupid bitch?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason's eyes shot open, his blue eyes glowing brightly. He was used to getting spat upon by people coming to his window. But the idea that this guy had the gall to act this way over the intercom, to a girl who is trying her hardest no less, was too much for him to put up with. And the bitch at his window was still going on and on with her demands. Finally, Jason yelled, turning away from the window and throwing a punch at the nearby refrigerator. The fist actually dented the metal inward upon impact. But Jason didn't care about that - nor the sudden startled look on the bitch customer's face. Jason immediately left the register and turned to the back door of the restaurant. He immediately kicked the door open, breaking it off its hinges, startling the ranting bastard at the intercom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe customers in line watched as Jason came out. He walked out of the restaurant and yelled at the top of his lungs. But it wasn't a yell...it was a roar; an inhuman, monstrous sound. And Jason wasn't even fully aware of himself anymore; he was just overcome with rage. He didn't even notice that he was growing taller, and his uniform was ripping at the seams. The man at the intercom saw this happening and began to panic. He tried putting his car in drive, only to rear-end the car in front of him. It was too late to escape anyway. Jason was almost 50 feet at this point. He reached out and grabbed the car, not even realizing what had been happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted the car up to his face and saw that the man inside was alone. It pissed him off, knowing that one person shows up to order four different meals. He didn't say anything to the man, just stared at him with gritted teeth and enraged eyes. He then raised the car above his head and slammed it down onto the parking lot. The car began to crumple with every impact. Jason then gripped the car with both his hands and finished crushing it like wrapping paper. He then looked forward to see the drive-thru line scattering. The obnoxious bitch who commandeered the window was taking off. He threw the crushed car in his hands toward her car, landing just in front of it, forcing her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason approached the car as she tried to turn the other way. He grabbed the car and lifted it up. He pulled the roof off the car exposing the tiny woman inside. He reached inside and lifted her up, wrapping one hand around her. She was so terrified that she couldn't even scream, much less say anything in her defense. Jason growled at her before saying, \"You wasted my time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then tightened his grip on the woman, and before long, the pressure caused her body to pop like a grape; her blood rushing over Jason's hands. Jason opened his fist and let her entrails fall to the ground. He turned his head up and roared into the sky.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason took some deep breaths and finally began to calm down. He slowly looked down and observed himself. He couldn't believe it; he was standing 50 feet off of the ground. His uniform had been torn up except for - oddly enough - his boxers and the crotch section of his pants. The elastic had somehow expanded to continue to fit him, but now they were incredibly tight; so tight that they now resembled little more than a speedo. But this wasn't the only thing different about him. Jason was fit, but he wasn't exactly athletic; but now it was clear that his muscles had much more definition. He had abs and his biceps were larger as well. He couldn't believe it; he was a giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the screams of the people around brought him out of his observation, He saw the cars that were trying to pull into the drive-thru were now turning around and driving away. The customers inside the restaurant were beginning to flee. Jason took a moment to consider; the sight of these people running for their lives was strangely empowering to him; maybe even slightly arousing. But it wasn't long until Clark and his other coworkers came outside and began staring up at him. Most of them were quiet, but Clark was getting very angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason!\" Clark said walking up to him. \"What the Hell is going on here?! You're scaring away all our customers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason winced at hearing Clark speak to him. Clark usually took a loud and commanding voice, talking down to him before. But now, the man was the size of an action figure, and he was giving orders to a person nearly nine times larger than him. Was he delusional?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of your crap, Jason. You got problems with our customers; that's YOUR fault! But I can't have you holding us up; you're FIRED! Get off this property, NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason grit his teeth and began growling at Clark again; his blue eyes glowing. \"Shut up, Clark - you uptight, arrogant, stupid, waste of space!\" Without even thinking, Jason immediately lifted his foot and stomped it down on Clark. The man's body was crumpled as the giant foot came down. Jason then raised his foot and pulled it back, kicking what remained of his boss into the distance, taking out a portion of the restaurant with his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the other workers turned and ran. Jason looked at the rubble half of the restaurant had become. It was now that he was starting to get drunk on the power being giant was giving him. He didn't even care that he probably put his friends out of work or that he'd just killed three people. Why should he trouble himself with the likes of insects? Those that were still alive were lucky he let them exist in his world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason then noticed that one of his coworkers hadn't run away yet. It was Mandi - she was a nice girl, who often joked around. But now she was terrified. Jason actually smiled seeing her terrified expression. He knelt down and got close to her. His grin was somewhat sinister and sadistic.<br>\r\n\"Hey there, Mandi,\" he said - his voice was deep and shook her boy with each syllable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-J-Jason...you just killed, Clark. You-You killed those people!\" Mandi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, what can I say? They had it coming; that asshole at the intercom was being very rude; he called you a bitch. I couldn't let him get away with that,\" Jason said. \"And the woman was trying to complain her way into a free-meal. And as for Clark...Heh, none of us liked him anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-How did you get so...big?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jason said. \"I was really pissed off after listening to all this nonsense; and then something snapped. And now, I'm a big and powerful giant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you killed those people because you were angry?\" Mandi asked. \"That's insane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet, you stuck around anyway,\" Jason said, his smile becoming more sinister. \"You could've ran away like the others just now. Why did you stay?\" Mandi looked very nervous seeing the evil look in Jason's eye. \"You really did like me a lot, didn't you, Mandi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMandi began to blush, realizing the situation she was now in. She often would flirt with him while on shift just to see how he'd react. She'd sometimes joke around that he was her boyfriend. She began to stutter, trying to find an answer, \"I-I-uh,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is true then, huh?\" he asked. \"I think I kind of like you, as well...Maybe even more while I'm like this. From this size, you're like a cute little doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well...actually Jason,\" Mandi said, now more nervous than ever. \"I was just...joking around before. Just teasing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jason said raising an eyebrow. \"Y'know Mandi; I don't think its wise to tease someone much larger than you.\" But before Mandi could respond, Jason suddenly moved his hand toward her. He pinched the back of her shirt between his thumb and forefinger and lifted her off the ground. She began thrashing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey - what are you doing?! Put me down! Put me down now!\" she shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason just laughed and began to stand up to full height. Mandi soon found herself dangling precariously from the scruff of her shirt nearly 40 feet off the ground. She stopped thrashing for fear that she might fall. Jason smiled down at her, while she now began to try and grip onto his fingers holding her.<br>\r\n\"See what I mean?\" Jason asked. \"Teasing Giants is risky business; you might've bitten off more than you could chew.\" Mandi was just clinging tightly to his hand, not wanting to fall. She was too paralyzed to respond. \"But still...are you sure that you do not like me? You said you thought I was funny and sweet before; but look at me now. I've got a physique that puts most male-models to shame. You trying to convince me that you don't want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason posed his free arm, flexing his biceps. He moved his other hand around, making sure Mandi had a view of his abs. She was blushing harder than ever. He definitely knew she thought he was hot. He smirked yet again at her stunned and somewhat lust-struck expression. This was almost too much for him; being big and strong was one thing, but actually having a bod that the girls would go nuts for, it was almost too good to be true.<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you better come along with me,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" Mandi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's face it; I don't think you'll be able to continue working after all of this,\" Jason said. \"Plus, I might want some company along for the ride while I get my plans underway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what are you planning to do?\" Mandi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My Revolution,\" Jason said, with an evil smirk yet again. \"But now, I need a safe-place to keep you. And I know just the place.\" Jason then lowered his hands; with his free one he pulled open the waste-band of his remaining loin-cloth. It was wide and Mandi could see his behemoth sized manhood in the darkness beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - you can't be serio-\" she asked, but before she could finish, he dropped her. She screamed as she fell into the darkness of his pants. She fell down to the bottom. He then released the band, allowing the shorts to snap back into place on his body. Mandi was pinned underneath Jason's balls, tightly between his sack and the cloth barrier. His bulge was tightly defined in the fabric, and she was only a small part of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smiled, feeling the absolute power he had over the tiny woman. \"Enjoy the ride, Mandi; right where you belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Jason had begun his power-trip, what was he going to do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No sooner than Jason was finished packaging Mandi in his bulge, did he soon hear the sirens coming his way. He wasn't surprised; the restaurant was pretty close to the fire-station. But soon he aw the flashing blue an red lights on the black cop cars roll into the parking lot. The police were here. Jason was taken aback for a moment; it suddenly all became real - he'd killed three people and just kidnapped some girl. Not to mention all the damage he'd caused. He was going to jail for sure. He was beginning to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cars pulled up and formed a blockade. The cops all got out of the cars, using them as barriers for cover.<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" the chief called out pointing his pistol. \"Get down on your knees, and put your hands in the air!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly reality came back over Jason. Suddenly the illusion of authority that the police had always held over ordinary civilians like him was shattered. Jason knew that this was just a mortal man - several mortal men - the size of toys, trying to order him around. What threat did they really pose to him? Then again, there were a lot of them...and they did have guns. Was Jason really going to risk it? But his burning sense of curiosity overcame him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" Jason asked looking down at them. \"What exactly do you plan to do if I surrender? You got a pair of handcuffs big enough for me, Chief? Got a holding cell the size of a foot-ball field waiting for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do not surrender, we will be open fire! Now get down on the ground and do not move; RIGHT NOW!\" the Chief replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P'feh, I don't think so,\" Jason scoffed. He started to turn toward the barricade, positive that the cops were too afraid to open fire on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE!\" the Chief said shooting his gun. Soon the near two-dozen policemen began shooting all at the same time. Jason was startled by the loud noise and immediately tried to cover his head with his arms, certain they'd shoot there. He went down on one knee, to cover as much of his sensitive areas as possible and turned off to the side. He felt the forceful impact of the bullets hitting his body...and then the pain was gone as quickly as it came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason opened his eyes. He didn't feel like his skin had been punctured at all. He just felt like he'd been hit with something small at high speeds, like someone had thrown a pebble at him. Some of them felt comparable to insect bites. But he was certain that they didn't break the skin. Soon the cops had emptied their pistols and stopped firing. They watched as Jason moved. They began reloading quickly, but some were stunned to see that Jason hadn't been hurt at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason was astonished. The bullets seemed more like a nuisance than an actual threat to him. He looked down at his arm and his side to see that the bullets had impacted on the surface of his body...but no blood was rushing out. The hollow-point bullets crumpled upon impact, but did no damage to him. Jason figured that because his relative size had increased, the top surface layer of his skin must've been so thick that it could stop bullets now. He couldn't believe it; he'd grown up watching Godzilla movies, where it seemed like Godzilla was immune to gunfire. His skin was so thick that they did nothing to him; and now, Jason himself was exactly the same. He couldn't be hurt by conventional weapons. He flexed the muscles of his arm and shook his side; and all of the impacted bullets were shaken loose and they fell down toward the ground, making various clinking sounds on the pavement as they rained down to the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops were astonished by these events. And some held their guns at Jason, clearly trembling in fear about what to do next. Jason looked from his arm, over to them a bit curiously for a moment. Then he lifted his arm and swiped it across the line of cars, sending them all flying upward. The cops scattered, trying to avoid Jason. Some began firing on him. Jason either stomped on them or kicked them away. Jason picked up one of the cars and smashed it down on some of the police trying to flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a shame; I'm pretty sure that guy was just two days from retirement,\" Jason joked with a laugh. He felt so powerful dishing out cruelty like this. He truly felt invincible! And before long, all the police that had come to stop him were either dead or had fled. He swatted them away like flies. Jason was beginning to realize the true power he held; as long as he was like this, he was the most powerful thing in town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, what should he do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As I mentioned earlier, Jason had a hard time from friends and family over the years. He often thought about what he'd do to get back at them. Maybe show them just how powerless he could make them feel. But which one should he go after first? He had a feeling that family should be the ones he should go after first. He didn't want word of his little rampage to reach too far, so that places would start evacuating; he'd never find his targets if they did. But then, who to start with?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had two older sisters and one older brother. Both sisters lived in the same state, and were pretty close by; so it was a smart idea to start with them. The oldest sister of the family was named Mabel - she was five years older than Jason and always used to pick on Jason for being the smallest one in the family...but the ironic thing is, as fully grown adults, she ended up being the shortest of the family. Maybe it was time to show her just how outclassed she really was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other sister was the third child in the family, Susan; she was three years older than Jason. She and Jason went to high school together. But she never really helped him with his problems. Plus, they both went into drama club together and were in some musicals during their school run. But it was clear that the drama teachers preferred her because she was pretty an could sing. But Jason was definitely a better actor than she was. Jason quietly reminded himself that he really should use his new size to get revenge on some of his old teachers too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, both of his sisters - now that they were adults - would constantly flaunt their wealth and success in his face; rubbing in the fact that they were accomplishing their careers and had actual houses to live in while he was stuck in an apartment. The fact that they had successful love-lives and were planning to get married. And of course, their belief that he should let go of the past and move on, even forcing him to get rid of all his old stuff.<br>\r\nThe question is, which of his sisters to go after?<br>\r\nSusan was probably the closest. She lived in the next town just north, and by car it only takes 11 minutes to get there. Mabel lived south from here, and took about half an hour to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo which one will he go after?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jason decided to go after Susan; after all he was already on his way since he was at work. It took him half an hour to walk a mile...normally; he could probably walk an entire mile in just a few steps now. He'd be there in a matter of minutes. So he started moving. He suddenly felt a stirring movement in his bulge. He figured that Mandi must be beginning to struggle around in there. It felt really good. He reached down and pressed a finger to where she was, squishing her even further into his yielding flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on tight, Mandi,\" he said. \"The ride is just beginning.\" With that, Jason began walking northward, stomping through town and kicking whatever vehicle dared to come too close. Truth be told, he didn't really like cars all that much; he thought they were noisy and cumbersome vehicles that actually made life more complicated rather than simplified. Plus they smelled awful. He was satisfied when he saw people stop in the street and abandon their cars to run away. This power-trip was never going to end as far as he was concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he'd gotten to the next town and reached his sister's house. It was actually the house that belonged to her boyfriend - a bratty spoiled twerp named Stu. The house belonged to his mom, but after she got remarried and moved in with her new husband, she gave the house to him. And now Susan was living there with him. And that really pissed Jason off. Effectively, his sister had gotten everything she needed in life, simply by dating the right guy. It made him very angry because he knew the opposite situation would never work for him. If he tried to date a wealthy woman, he'd immediately be accused of being with her for her money or a place to stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jason stood out there, seething with rage at this, he didn't notice that his body was actually getting bigger. He'd shot up from 50 to 75 feet tall. Only time will tell what these powers mean and where they came from. Anyway, Jason reached down toward the front door and immediately punched through it, reaching his arm inside of the house. You reached up to the living room where you assumed they would be. And he eventually found them on the couch. He wrapped his hand around the first person he found and pulled them out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted them up to see that he'd snagged his sister, Susan. She was screaming from the whole ordeal, until she saw his face.<br>\r\n\"Jason?!\" she asked in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey; what's up, Little-Sis?\" Jason asked, in a mocking tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to you?\" she asked. \"You're huge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well apparently, I had a growth spurt,\" Jason said, trying to be cute. \"It's just like last time. Only now the results are far more obvious. And I just had to drop by to show off. Good thing you guys don't watch TV anymore, or you probably would've seen me coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well uh...it's impressive...But can you put me down, please?\" Susan asked, trying not to upset him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm - Nah,\" Jason said. \"That would be counter-productive.\" He then gave a slight squeeze around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Jason, what are you doing?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a little bit of payback,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Jason heard another voice say. He looked down and saw Stu standing there. \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Jason asked. \"Stu, I think you're a bit outmatched here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I didn't mean me; I just meant you put her down and go pick a fight with King Kong; or Cthulhu,\" Stu said joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Stu, but that's not what I'm here for. I'm here for sister-dearest here,\" Jason said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with her, anyway?\" Stu asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sibling-issues, Stu; being an only child, you wouldn't understand. But still, I've got a bone to pick with you, as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey- what are you going?!\" Stu asked as Jason began to pick him up. \"What's the meaning of this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with us?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple - you guys have been quite rude to me as of late, and I want some payback,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rude? How?!\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys are always flaunting how much more successful than you guys are than me. And that is a display of power. A totally emasculating display that I really don't care for,\" Jason said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have two of each of the the latest generation of video game consoles. You set them all up in the same room so that you both can play the same consoles at the same time, without having to play with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're jealous because we can afford nice things?\" Susan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just that; you offered to sell me your previous generation consoles at a reasonable price back when you were buying the new ones,\" Jason said. \"But then you reneged on the deal and brushed it off like it was no big deal. You bought the latest generation consoles, but you kept the old ones despite being obsolete. You got my hopes up, and took it away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's our decision to do with our property what we wish,\" Susan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's more than that; you guys show me a general lack of respect. Every time we hang out, you guys treat me like I'm some kind of intruder or third wheel; you make me feel left out for not having a date, or for being too ugly, or not being fit enough. You make me feel like I don't belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Jason...I'm sorry that's how we made you feel. But please understand that, we didn't mean to make you feel like that. It wasn't our intention at all. We just hoped it would galvinize you into going out more often, and maybe you would meet someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut-up, Stu,\" Jason said. \"You're not getting off so easily; I came for you just as much as I did my sister. You are a spoiled and self-entitled, passive-aggressive brat who whines and complains until he gets his way. You say that you wish you had siblings when you were a kid? Guess what, pal; if you had as many siblings as I did, you would've gotten NONE of the great stuff you did as a kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spoiled? Passive Aggressive?\" Stu asked. \"Where are you getting this from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every single time we have a family get together, we always do what YOU want to do. You're not happy unless you're in control. And you act like an annoying little cunt until you get what you want,\" Jason retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well usually when we hang out, there's no structure to our meetings. Someone has to take-charge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tightened his grip on Stu. \"Do you feel in-charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStu gasped for air. \"Please, Jase - I'm sorry. But haven't I always been a good friend and a good to your sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think this gives you power over me?\" Jason asked raising an eyebrow. \"And good to my sister? I noticed how your relationship with her is on our last family trip...You might act like a prissy little bitch whenever the rest of us are around. But when you think you're alone with my sister? I saw how you always get your way with her...You bully her. You push her around until she kowtows to you. And she's too afraid to stand up to you, because if she does, you'll just throw her out onto the streets. You're worse than just being a douche-bag; you're an extortionist. I might have my problems with my sister...But since our father isn't around to protect her, I'm going to have to do it. My sister is going to get what's coming to her...but you...your punishment will be more severe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were terrified; they were like action-figures at the mercy of their smaller brother.<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" Susan asked.</span></div></div>",

He then moved Stu over to the hand he had Susan in. \"Unfortunately, I don't have much in means of carrying you.\" He definitely didn't want to put his older sister in the same place as Mandi. He might be power mad, but he wasn't depraved - just yet. \"So you'll just have to ride together.

She then shifted her arm to where she could slide it out of Jason's fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call your sister; I have a feeling he's going for her next,\" Stu said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is wrong; your phone isn't working,\" she said. \"The screen is completely blank. Did you charge it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure it's charged,\" Stu said. \"What is going on?\" Suddenly Stu heard some popping nearby. He looked down and saw the street lamps that Jason was passing on the street; the lightbulbs inside them were glowing brightly before popping. \"Oh my...I don't know how it's happened, but I think your brother is giving off some kind of electronic field; he's emitting a lot of energy. Electrical devices near him pick up the energy and it overloads them. We've got no way to call for help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad,\" Susan said. Their situation got worse when they saw that Jason was leaving the neighborhood and going straight into the forest. The high trees were obscuring him from sight. It seemed that Jason didn't want to attract too much attention. If he was actively avoiding populated areas, then they wouldn't be able to call out for anyone to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had eventually gotten hungry. He'd done a good job of hiding out in the woods up until now. But he knew he had to eat something. Fortunately he'd passed by his favorite gas station; he knew it wasn't really high class or healthy for him, but he absolutely loved the grilled roller-food they served here. He punched his way through the roof and reached toward the roller-bar. He pulled each of the rollers off the ground and lifted them up. He was disappointed to find that there wasn't much there; but even if there was, they were so small, they'd hardly be filling. He lifted them all up and turned them upside down, dropping all the hot-dogs, sausages, and taquitos into his waiting mouth. They barely made for a mouthful. He reached back into the gas station and began scooping up all the snack-food he could find in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people had long since ran for it. Pouring out of the gas station and watching the almost-naked giant man eating everything in the store. They began running away. He didn't blame them for being scared. But he was so hungry; and he was starting to think that being a giant wasn't so great after all, if he didn't have anything to eat. He'd have to hit up an entire buffet just so he wouldn't starve. He didn't know what he was going to do; but at this rate, it seemed like he wasn't going to get the revenge he so craved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long he noticed that he was being watched. There was a group of teenage girls standing near the back of the store, with their phones out. It looked like they were trying to get photos or video of him. He definitely didn't want that; especially considering that any footage of him would immediately go viral, warning people that he was coming. He pretended like he hadn't noticed the girls yet, when suddenly he sprang his hand towards them. They screamed and turned to run, but he managed to get one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled her around to his face. She was a blonde; maybe 17 years old, but incredibly busty. Her breasts were tight against her small white t-shirt and her immaculate legs rose up to her jean shorts. She was kicking and screaming as Jason lifted her up, demanding to be let-go.<br>\r\n\"Be quiet,\" Jason said as sternly as possible. And the girl was startled; she wasn't expecting him to be able to talk. \"What exactly do you think you're doing? You had your cellphone out...Were you trying to get a picture of me, without my permission?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait - it's not like how you think,\" the girl said in her defense. \"I couldn't get a picture at all; my phone just completely went dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that right?\" Jason asked. \"Interesting...and what about your little friends; where did they go? Did they get a shot of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No sir; all of our phones went dark,\" she said. Jason was very intrigued by what she was saying. It seemed like cell-phones seemed to malfunction in his presence. That would explain why he hadn't gotten so much attention over the last hour. In fact, it might explain why so many people were leaving their cars to run for it; he was giving off some kind of EMP, that was destroying electronics wherever he went. This could be useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I suppose that's alright then,\" Jason said, his sinister grin appearing. \"But regardless...I still can't just let you go; or your little friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what are you going to do to me, Mister?\" she said, now tearing up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The girl started begging for her life; to just be let go and she'd never do anything bad ever again. But Jason wasn't listening. He was too focused on the empty feeling in his stomach. Right now he was wishing he'd snuck a few extra chicken nuggets from work, or maybe even a whole burger. He just wanted the pain to go away; to feel satisfyingly full. He wished he had something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he slowly turned his eyes back toward the girl, right as his colossal stomach began to growl again. His eyes went wide as he looked at her pleading form; but her words were muffled by the sound of his own blood pumping through his veins. The desperation was clearly sinking in. He'd read all those stories on the internet; and even found them kind of hot...But would he actually go through with it? I mean...she was a human being...wasn't she? Or did he see her as less than that now? This would be so wrong...if he were in her place...but he wasn't. Maybe it would feel wrong or even be disgusting. But then again; he was so curious about it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me something, young miss,\" he said. She froze and stopped pleading with him. He gave her an odd smile; one that seemed earnest and almost apologetic, but still very creepy. \"Do you have any idea...what Vore is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...N-No,\" she said, now sounding very nervous. His latest expression scared her more than his stern one did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a shame,\" Jason said. \"Then this...will be a very new and...terrifying experience for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she asked, but immediately after, the hand that gripped her moved her close to his face. Jason lifted his head backward and opened his mouth. \"Wait - NO! Please don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason ignored her please and simply dropped her into his mouth. The moment her legs touched his tongue, an electric charge went through his body. His taste-buds were stimulated with a new flavor, never before experienced...but it was perfect. The girl was thrashing about, kicking inside of his mouth; somehow her struggles excited him even further. He closed his lips around her waist and then slurped her upper-torso inside. His eyes were wide with pleasure as he tasted this woman's flesh. He had decided that he was fully going to go through with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman continued to struggle inside of his mouth, even to the point where she pulled forward and actually pushed against his lips to slip her head through the opening of his mouth. She was fighting for her life. Jason couldn't help but admire her for that. She let out a terrified shriek, calling for help. She was a tenacious one; strong and vibrant. But Jason just pressed his index-finger against her forehead and pushed her back inside. He enjoyed her so much, that he certainly was never going to let her go...and soon, he wouldn't have to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided it was time to end this. He tilted his head back and curled his tongue, feeling the girl fall to the back of his throat. And then he swallowed with an audible gulp. And then, feeling her slide down his throat, Jason realized the obvious solution; he'd have more food than he'd ever need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God; he fucking ate her!\" one of the other girls yelled. The two of them had been hiding ever since their friend got captured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just stay calm; what we have to do now, is go get some help. We need to tell the authorities about that...thing! He needs to be stopped before he hurts anyone else,\" the other girl - a red-head - said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's too dangerous to run now,\" the brunette said. \"We should just wait until he moves on; maybe he won't find us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Fucking Christ!\" Stu shouted watching this display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason! Ho-how could you?!\" Susan asked in utter shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason didn't pay attention to either of them. He felt the blonde girl squirming all the way down his throat until she plopped nicely into his stomach. He felt her moving around in there, her tiny hands pawing all over the walls. He eventually felt her kicking and punching against the walls. He felt his stomach begin to churn in reaction to its new occupant; felt her tossed and thrown around in a churning sea of acid as her digestion began. He heard her muffled voice through his skin, shouting at the top of her lungs. He was certain that she was saying, \"Let me out! Let me out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason wouldn't heed her...He didn't care...As far as he was concerned...she was just food now.<br>\r\nAnd she was where she belonged...<br>\r\nOh he still recognized her as a living being, with feelings and a life of her own - that he was clearly depriving her of. But that didn't matter to him. He was a predator and she was his prey...Circle of life...Eat or be Eaten...For thousands of years of civilization, mankind had enjoyed a precarious and undeserved spot at the top of the food-chain...But now, he was undoubtedly the at the top; the Alpha Predator - top of the ecosystem - completely unchallenged - indisputable. He was doing what came naturally to him...He was hungry; he had to eat...And his prey was so delicious. And right now...he was still hungry...and he wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped his head over to where the two girls had run off earlier. Something in him was working against his sense of reason; almost like he could sense that they were still there...But even more disturbing...he could smell them. They gave off some kind of exciting and ecstatic scent that was drawing him in close. He felt like a shark and there was blood in the water. He began moving toward their hiding place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sees us! He knows we're here!\" the brunette began to panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't possibly know,\" the red-head said. \"He's probably coming over to check; maybe scare us out of hiding. He's bluffing. Just stay still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason knew they were there alright. He was getting ready to make his move. He threw his head back and released a terrifying and deafening roar again. Stu and Susan threw their hands over their ears to protect against the sound. Jason began to charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He sees us!\" the red-head said. \"RUN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls broke from their hiding place in the trees and ran for it. But now they were far too exposed. Stu and Susan were shaken on the worse ride of their lives. But they could see that two girls younger than they were, running for their lives down below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jason, please! Just let them go!\" Susan cried. She didn't even know how he was going to catch them both with only one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the answer soon revealed itself; he had gained on them so quickly that he simply brought a foot down on the brunette, pinning her to the ground under his toes. He then did the same to the red-haired girl, pinning her down with the other foot. Both girls were pinned but not hurt. They were still trying to escape. Jason scrunched his toes to keep them in place. He then reached down his free hand toward the brunette and lifted her up by one of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed and clawed at the ground, trying not to be lifted up. She was wearing a set of jeans and a blouse. Remembering the taste of the blonde was best where her flesh was exposed, he knew that clothes just got in the way. He lifted her up to his mouth and pinned the hem of her jeans with his teeth. With a powerful jerk of his neck, he ripped them away. Her lower half was exposed to him now. He did the same to her blouse, tearing away at it. He couldn't wait anymore; he was driven mad with predatory desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifted her above his head and dangled her over his open mouth.<br>\r\n\"No! Please! Please don't eat me!!!\" she shouted, but he dropped her in, just like her friend, closing his mouth over her waist, keeping her secure with his teeth while his tongue rolled over her torso and face. He was at first surprised; she tasted different. He remembered the blonde had a very distinct flavor that was unlike anything he'd had before. She was immaculate. But the brunette had a different sort of flavor; she had a bit of a smoky after-taste on her. Still satisfying and delicious as well as exhilarating. He began slurping her more into his mouth, until her round rear-end stayed outside his mouth. He'd been dreaming about doing this since this little adventure began. He released her waist and lifted up his tongue, sliding it under the opening of her legs. The legs had been pushing against his chin, trying to get her upper-half free. But when the huge tongue invaded her nethers and cupped around her ass, her knees tensed before going weak. She was slurped up easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't much longer before he swallowed her as well. He'd played around with the blonde longer, but now he was so curious about something, and was anxious to test his theory. He then quickly reached down and reached toward the red-haired girl. He ripped off her shirt before pinching her with his thumb and finger. He lifted her up from out of his toes. He wasted no time and gave no pretext. He unceremoniously tossed her into his mouth completely and closed down. His eyes shot wide - a spicy and sweet combination flooded his taste buds. She tasted like gingerbread...Ginger-spice. He gave a slight chuckle before swallowing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three girls had been taken care of. He could feel them reunited in his stomach, thrashing about; but the thrashes were dying down. But it was apparent that he was still hungry. He needed more. But what should he do now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mabel sat in her living room on her laptop while her fiance, Leroy was flipping through the channels. He landed on the news where a special emergency report was being given.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The City is under emergency-alert as widespread panic and riots have broken out in the northern city-limits. Panic-stricken reports roll-in, claiming that a giant man has appeared and gone on a rampage, destroying buildings and cars and terrorizing the people. Unfortunately, none of these claims can be substantiated due to the fact that no communication seems able to get in or out of the city. Various testimonies from anyone who sees the giant man and lives to talk about it, claim that being in his presence causes an electrical distortion, destroying all electronic devices in the area. We now go to a live chopper-feed trying to get a good look at the supposed 'giant'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view switched to a camera crew inside of a helicopter. The camera panned over the streets down below, where throngs of people were abandoning their cars and running for their lives.<br>\r\n\"As you can see down below, pandemonium has broken loose. People have abandoned their vehicles and are now running for their lives away from some unseen threat. Wait, what's that up ahead? Oh my god; it's true. It really is a giant humanoid-creature. It looks like a young man. He seems to be maybe 60; no, 75 feet tall. We're going to fly in to try and get a closer look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera was trying to get into position to get a good shot, when suddenly the helicopter began to malfunction. The vehicle teetered a bit and the camera was tossed about. \"The controls on our chopper have gone dark. We're trying to stay in the air. Wait - wait, the Giant is coming towards us. He's - OH MY GOD!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera turned one last time, and the giant came into view, jumping at the Helicopter and roaring. A huge fist flew toward the camera and struck the side of the chopper, sending it into a tail-spin, until it finally crashed. It was so quick that those watching the feed couldn't get a good enough view of what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is most disturbing news indeed, ladies and gentlemen,\" the anchorwoman continued. \"The mayor has declared a state of emergency; requiring that all civilians either evacuate or take shelter immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Mabel asked having watched the news report. \"You think we should leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" Leroy said. \"It's a hoax - can't you tell? It's obvious. They're probably just trying to advertise that new King Kong movie or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...Well I guess that makes sense,\" Mabel said. \"After all, how could a giant man possibly just appear out of nowhere? Who would be silly enough to believe such a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople were screaming as they ran for their lives. Jason was chasing a whole herd of people down the street. When he'd first gone on the hunt, his EMP was causing their engines to die. Most people didn't know what was happening, and stayed in their cars to try and fix the problem, and some others eventually tried to use their cars to hide. They were the easy pickings for Jason; he tore the roofs off their cars and pulled them out. It was almost like a packaged lunch; that's exactly what these people were for anyway - at least as far as Jason's mind could rationalize. Anyway, Jason was surprised to find such a variety of flavor when it came to these morsels. He wasn't discriminating from anyone; man or woman, race; as far as he was concerned, food was food. And the vast array of taste sensation actually made him consider them to be different types of cuisine. One gentleman had the texture of dark turkey-meat. Another young lady had spicy flavor to her. They were all so delicious. Though, Jason had to admit, he probably preferred the blonde's taste above all others. He was sure to pick them out when he'd spotted them in the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason had became so overzealous that he eventually did something he didn't expect he'd do; in his vigor to get to the next victim, he'd bit one man in half below the waist. The man screamed in agony as his lower half was separated from his body; blood gushing from the wounds, and the man's organs began to fall out. Ordinarily this would've turned Jason's stomach; he was never one for gore. And in fact, as a child, the sight of blood made him squeamish. But now that he was a giant cannibal, a completely new attitude came over Jason. He honestly couldn't believe it, but the man's blood tasted wonderful! The flavor delighted him! He'd remembered in the past that blood usually had a metallic almost iron taste to it. But this man's blood was almost like barbecue sauce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tossed the remaining half-man into his waiting maw and chewed him up before swallowing. He was surprised that the bones gave a very satisfying crunch when he bit down; he'd always loved food that 'crunched' in such a fashion. Jason couldn't believe he hadn't tried that sooner. Since he started, he'd been swallowing his victims whole. For a moment he thought about how morbid that was; he was effectively sending these people into a cauldron of boiling acid to be digested alive. And although their tiny movements inside of his body gave him such a satisfying arousal, he deemed that it was cruel. Killing them outright would be quicker and painless. If he even still cared about that; at most he deemed that it was more wasteful; he didn't get to experience their full flavor that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, he began snatching up more victims to crunch-down on. Tossing them into his mouth, grinding them up under his teeth. Jason felt absolutely great while doing it. The screams of the people rang-out, like music to his ears; the fear, the adrenaline, the satisfaction of the chase; they were all feeding his desires to continue. Stu and Susan on the other hands were sickened by what they were seeing. It was truly obscene. And they were powerless to stop it; for now, they remained Jason's prisoners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tossed one last woman into his mouth, chewing on her before swallowing. That is when he felt his stomach gurgle. He hardly noticed it because of the predatory thrill he'd been receiving, but he no longer felt any hunger-pains. He felt completely satisfied. He was completely full. Jason smiled and patted his washboard abs. He then threw his head back, unleashing a dominant roar that was heard by all in the area. Immediately after, Jason gave a slight belch, signifying his satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason took a moment to realize that all of the people had fled; must've taken shelter somewhere. It seemed he'd gotten full just in time. Oddly enough, the thought that all his prey were cowering in the shadows like vermin, excited Jason even further. Throughout most of his life, he was the one who had to get out of the way of other people; the one who had to deal with them being there. But now the streets were quiet and empty; he could finally enjoy the peace...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this peace was short-lived as a new sound approached from the distance...Jason looked toward the source of the sound and saw -</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The streets were buzzing to life again as a several heavy vehicles began to approach from up the road. There were trucks mounted with missile launchers, and some hum-vs outfitted with machine guns, and even a few tanks. There was a whole artillery coming here. Jason suspected that now the National Guard had mobilized to take him down. He was a bit alarmed by seeing them, until he remembered when he was attached by the police. Their weapons did nothing to him. But then again, they only had pistols; he wasn't sure how he'd hold up against explosive missiles and more powerful guns. But then again, at this size, they shouldn't feel any worse than simple firecrackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took notice of how the vehicles were lining up; forming a blockade, ready to attack him. Several men carrying automatic weapons began lining up and taking formation, aiming their guns at him. He looked down at them all; they didn't to be worried or nervous at all; nothing like the cops. Jason began to wonder if they even saw him as human anymore or just a wild animal. He took notice of how a man with a megaphone stepped forward to address him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention! Stand-Down or be fired upon!\" the man shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason smirked at hearing the man's tiny voice; even amplified by the device, he still sounded so pathetic. All of Jason's fears melted away as he was reminded just where he stood in relation to these men. He knew they couldn't hurt him. So he might as well have some fun with this. He then remembered that he was holding his sister and her boyfriend in his fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got two civilians in my hand here; you wouldn't want them to get caught in the cross-fire would you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let the hostages go, and stand-down,\" the commander shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason wasn't going to back down, but he certainly didn't want his trophies to get damaged. He walked over to the roof of a nearby car-dealership. There was no staircase that lead down to the lower levels, so he dropped Stu and Susan onto the roof.<br>\r\n\"Stay right there!\" he ordered. The two of them cringed as their bodies regained their shape after being painfully squeezed in his hand. They looked around the roof, hoping to find some way to get down, but there didn't seem to be a stairwell or a ladder to get down. The two of them wondered if they can jump from the roof to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason stepped away from the building and stood in the center of the street and opened his arms.<br>\r\n\"Well go on,\" Jason said. \"Give me your best shot. But I guarantee you; it's not going to end well for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold the line, men!\" the commander ordered. The men simply raised their guns, taking aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? So you're not going to shoot?\" Jason said. \"Fine then; I'll make the first move. Let's play!\" Jason took a step forward, getting ready to swing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIRE AT WILL!!!\" the commander shouted. And suddenly every single gun was fired; several flashing lights and booming sounds flooded the area. Jason soon felt the tiny stinging pricks against his body. He grinned, staying confident that they didn't effect him much like the police bullets hadn't...But he couldn't deny that he did feel something. This was slightly more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN FIRE!\" the Commander said, gesturing to the artillery. The heavy guns of the tanks turned on Jason and fired at him. Huge booming explosions and flashes of fire erupted from the barrels. An enormous shell struck Jason in the chest, the impact causing an explosion. Jason was caught off guard. That wasn't the slight firecracker he was expecting it to be...That really hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact caused him to stagger backward, as the rest of the artillery took aim. Another tank shot at his leg, striking him in the side of the knee. Jason went down onto the knee and grabbed it, feeling the painful shock. Soon the missile launchers unleashed their payload. Jason looked toward the noise and saw them all coming in at him at top speed. One struck him in the shoulder, the explosion hurting badly, sending high speed shrapnel digging into his skin. Another hit him in the chest. The third in the stomach. And Jason knew this was hardly the end. The impacts were so hard, that he actually had begun to cough up blood. And a horrific moment of clarity struck Jason...He was going to die...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the missiles flew in and struck him in the chest, and the explosion was so great that he was pushed off of his feet and went flying into the air, down the street, a trail of smoke and the smell of  burning flesh left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStu and Susan had ducked for cover, holding each other when the shooting started. At any moment they expected to hear the vehicles crashing and being sent flying away. There were several explosions. Smoke flew over the scene. And the shooting had stopped. They looked over the edge of the building. They saw Jason had been knocked into the air; he had been brought down. His body impacted on the ground and he wasn't moving. Susan was shocked for a moment. She believed that it had finally been stopped, but the gravity of her brother being dead finally sunk in. She didn't want anyone to die, even him. But he had done so many horrible things; he had to be taken down. But he was dead now...How should she feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's down!\" the Commander said speaking into his radio, only to hear static from the other end. \"Alright men, pull up! Make sure he stays down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe troops began to slowly move forward, still in formation to check on Jason's body. During his fall, Jason had turned and he now laid on his side. He didn't look to be breathing, and his body was smoking. He wasn't moving. He was still alive, but he was in a great deal of pain. He honestly didn't know where he went wrong. After everything that happened, how could he still be vulnerable? Did he overestimate himself? His imagined invincibility because of his size and power? And was this how it ended?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everything began to go dark as Jason felt himself slipping and slipping out of consciousness. He was dying. After he'd become so powerful and done so much, it was over. But...Jason wracked whatever was left of his brain going over how unfair it was. He'd only just gotten started; there was so much he wanted to do, so much revenge he'd wanted to reap. It wasn't fair; he couldn't be done already. He wanted so much <i>more</i>; he <i>had to</i> gain so much more!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason tried so hard to move; to do something as simple as clench his fists. But he couldn't move as he felt himself slip further into the darkness. It seemed hopeless and he was doomed; and it infuriated him. He was screaming inside his own head; a heated rampage like a tantrum storming inside as he slipped deeper and deeper. And then he saw it...<br>\r\nThere was a blue light that suddenly pierced meekly through the darkness. And Jason began to panic; that was the light at the end of the tunnel. No; he couldn't go into the light. Not now; he wanted so badly to live! He had so much more he wanted to do. But despite how much he tried to will himself to move, he slipped further into the dark. And the deeper he sank, the larger the light source became as he was moved toward it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then Jason examined it. He found that the light source was not an opening in a tunnel of darkness. No, it was actually an electrical spark sending blue light into the darkness with each pulse. But the sparks were weakening and the light was dimming. Jason was now curiously intrigued by this spark. He felt oddly warm as he was by it; a warmth that spread throughout his entire body. It was almost like this light was the spark inside of him; the thing that gave him the power. And it was buried so deep down inside of him. He reached out to grab it; he finally clasped his hands around it, feeling the warming electric feeling pulse through his entire body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be on guard,\" one of the soldiers shouted. \"We have to make sure he stays down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he even still alive?\" another asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it; after taking all those shells at point blank range, he must be dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly any blood though; the guy must be tough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers poked and prodded Jason's body with their guns, hardly receiving a reaction.<br>\r\n\"Looks like he's down for good colonel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright men, secure the area,\" the colonel ordered. \"Get on the phone to Washington. I have a feeling that the science-types are going to want to examine the corpse. Get a clean-up crew out here with a net and a few helicopters; we're going to have to air-lift it out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what they'll find out about this thing,\" his Lieutenant stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'll just have to wait until they cut him open and see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason felt the life return to his body as his eyes shot open wide. He could move his hands again. Almost immediately he roared and swiped his arm in front of his face, knocking back any soldier unfortunate enough to still be close enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ, it's alive!\" the colonel said. \"Fire all; keep it down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jason was already in the process of standing up; his eyes were now glowing blue, much like they had when this began. Only now, in addition to the glow, they could see sparks of electricity discharging from his eyes. He rose to his feet roaring. Tiny blue static bolts were sparking across his body now; it was like he was covered in an electrical field. He roared loudest that he'd had all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers took aim with their guns only for the electrical sparks across Jason to arch toward their metal guns, shocking those holding them. Worse, the intense heat of the lightning was making their shells discharge while still in the clip. The men had to abandon their weapons and flee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose brave enough to look back as they ran for the artillery line, could see a most disturbing sight; Jason was growing. In his rage, the influx of power was causing Jason to increase in size. He quickly left his 75 foot height and shot up to a staggering 100 feet tall. His voice was deeper and monstrous; something inhumane inside of him had been awoken. Jason had now surpassed the simplistic 1950's B-Movie Monster and had evolved into something far more dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OPEN FIRE!\" the Colonel shouted to the artillery. The heavy guns shot off again, aiming at Jason; now taking careful aim to hit his face. Only now when the explosive shells struck Jason's body, there was no recoil. Jason wasn't stunned; he wasn't even phased by their weapons any more. The only response he gave was to now turn his glowing, enraged, blue gaze onto the row of tanks and military vehicles. He roared at them now taking a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fall back! Move the line; keep firing!\" the Colonel ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe artillery moved back, continuing to barrel their heavy shells and explosives upon the giant; but it was completely feeble as Jason continued to advance on them. He would occasionally wince at an explosion going off too close to his eyes, but other than that, he seemed a completely different creature than the vulnerable giant he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then as Jason's rage grew, he did something that was most unexpected. Jason roared loudly as his rage grew; his eyes shined brightest that they had done yet. And then without warning, two brilliantly blue bolts of lightning shot from Jason's eyes. They struck the heavy weapon's vehicle off to the right, completely destroying it in a huge explosion that almost knocked the other vehicles over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\" the Colonel yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's developed some kind of projectile, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Retreat! Retreat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vehicles were in a mad scramble to turn around as quickly as they can and flee the area, with Jason continuing to advance on them, firing lightning as he did. The puny soldiers were now fleeing for their lives after their haughty boasts of cutting him up for experiments earlier on. Jason was even more enraged by their cowardice; fleeing from him after such an attack, now that they had lost the upper hand. They needed to be punished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason roared and brought his hands up; the lightning around his body now focusing purely on his arms. He brought his fists above his head before slamming them down on the ground around him. Suddenly an incredible shock-wave in the form of a dome spread out from the epicenter of where Jason struck the asphalt. The wave was accompanied by several bolts of lightning, all shooting from Jason's body at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wave struck the vehicles and surprisingly did not send them flying. The vehicles instead immediately shut down and ceased to function; the shock wave was an EMP blast. The lightning in the wave however caused several of the vehicles to suddenly be pushed off of the ground and sent flying in several directions, slinging the puny men inside of them all around as well. The electricity was soon to overcome their pathetic forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colonel was among the few who survived the attack. Wincing in pain after being tossed from his truck, he looked around to witness the carnage. He could see how his men were convulsing from the electrical attack; he was fortunate to have effectively been paralyzed by it...whereas his not so fortunate men, were being cooked alive by the lightning. The colonel began to tremble as the realization was coming over him; this was the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe painfully turned his head to look forward and could now see Jason standing at full height above them. And the last thing to go through the Colonel's mind was how such a creature could exist...and how he was surely the end of human civilization as they currently knew it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when Jason saw the Colonel's eyes meeting his, the rage returned as he curled his upper lip in a growling sneer. He snapped his head forward again, shooting lightning bolts from his eyes, directly at the Colonel - incinerating the man - before dragging the bolts across the convoy of ruined vehicles, causing them all to vanish in several fiery explosions. When Jason was finished, there was nothing left of his opponents...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason surveyed his handiwork through his glowing blue eyes. His lips trembled as he grit his teeth. His muscles tensed as the electrical power sparked and danced over them. He could not in his wildest dreams have believed it. The power he'd had before was nothing; but this...he could not have fathomed he was capable of it. He grew even larger, the weapons that once hurt him now did nothing, and he developed a new weapon to attack the infidels who opposed him. He was truly indestructible now...<br>\r\nIt was clear to Jason that he'd now long since left humanity behind. He was no mere giant cannibal...he wasn't even a monster. No, there was only one description of him now that truly fit him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe truly was a God on Earth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe revelation overcame Jason as he threw his head back and roared his inhuman shriek to the sky, drowning out all other sounds in the area over his incredible voice; a testament to his power.</span></div></div>",

He even sees some National Guard Black-hawk helicopters approaching his position carrying a very large net. The combined attack forces have orders to capture him alive for study. He even sees some Apache helicopters, some military Abrams tanks, and some transport vehicles carrying heavy infantry heading towards him. \u201cThey managed to scrape up quite large force to subdue the giant,\u201d one TV reporter on the street tells her camera crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A minute later, the reporter, a beautiful, 28 year old busty blonde-haired woman in a tight fitting suit tells her TV audience, \u201cI cannot believe this. All of the aircraft have suddenly lost power, and crashed. Any missiles fired at him just fall to the ground before getting anywhere near him and detonate. The tanks stopped working just before they could get in range. Some of the missiles are falling to the ground and exploding on top of the stalled tanks, oh the horror. I can see most of the tanks are now on fire. I see tank crews abandoning the tanks and running for their lives. I can now see military, animal control, and police ground units opening fire on the giant. They seem to be using rubber bullets and elephant size tranquilizer darts. None of it seems to be penetrating his thick skin. I see the giant now grabbing the giant net and throwing it over the police and troops.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cWhat is happening now Kate?\u201d an anchor says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI cannot believe it, the net is trapping the troops and cops. The giant now seems to be river dancing?\u201d the stunned reporter says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d the anchor asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The giant is just laughing while river dancing over the troops and cops, crushing them like grapes,\u201d she says nervously.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it. The giant has beaten the police and the military. I have now received word that the Air Force will be sending in some heavy bombers that are shielded against EMP attacks. I am advised to seek shelter, but I am staying here to cover this story. I see the bombers above and they are dropping their payloads. The giant seems to be flipping off the bombers as the bombs start to go off all around him. I see the giant engulfed in fire. I now see a blinding flash of light, and now I see nothing, the giant is gone. The bombs must have gotten him,\u201d the reporter says in a relieved voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n A split second later, Jason and his tiny captives reappear somewhere else, completely unharmed. Jason teleported about 50 miles away right before the bombs could harm him. \u201cThat was fun, and I discovered a new power. Anyways, I am starting to get hungry again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jason is presumed dead for now as he rests in a lush forest surrounded by many tall trees and some mountains. To the East, he sees some nice homes, a town, and a nudist camp for youths next to the ocean. To the West, he sees some tents, a cheerleader camp, and in the distance, a small city. As Jason rests before the hunt, he suddenly turns invisible. At first, this naturally alarms him as he looks through his hand, but soon he realizes what is happening and smiles wickedly. Another power discovered as he becomes visible again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A few minutes later, Jason goes where?</span></div></div>",

After he fully masters his powers, only then will he will go back into a major population center. The seventy-foot tall young man looks around and decides to go east. Jason carefully walks through the trees, attempting to keep a low profile, but unfortunately, he is as stealthy as a bull elephant in a pottery shop. To help keep himself from being seen, Jason turns himself invisible. He may be a bit loud, but at least he cannot be seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jason walks on his tippy toes when he comes across a two-story farmhouse. The now invisible giant is leaving a trail of huge, bare footprints behind him as he sneaks up to the house. While he gets closer, he reaches down and eats a few cows, along with some pigs. Jason never knew it, but pigs taste a lot like humans. Jason then gets up to the house and peaks into a window, and luckily for him, this family never closes their curtains. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He observes a young, blonde haired boy wearing only boxers sitting on the floor of his bedroom playing a game. The boy looks like he is around 12 years old. He peeks into another window and sees two girls with long blonde haired talking to each other. The girls are just wearing panties and long t-shirts. They look like they are sisters; one looks like she is around 10 years old and the other looks as if she is around 14. Jason peeks into a third window and sees a lovely, nude, pregnant girl walking around her bedroom. She has blonde hair too, and looks like she is around 16 years old. Yummy he thinks to himself. He then peeks into another window and gasps. He sees a gorgeous, buck-naked, thirty something couple passionately making love on their bed. The woman is riding her husband like a cowgirl and they are both moaning loudly. Jason\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Feel free to add.</span></div></div>",
