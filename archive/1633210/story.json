The other members are called: Cliff, Jill, Ron and Maurine.<br>\r\nThe cave you enter is very dark and gloomy, the only light coming from your helmet light. It illuminates everything in front of you, the wall of the cave, the stalagmites and stalactites. Soon enough, you all decide to split up. You and Jill go together and the other four go together. You and Jill wonder around, fascinated by the wonders that await you.<br>\r\nEventually, you stumble upon a peculiar rock. It is blue and has sharp, jagged edges. You decide to put it in you're bag. You walk around a little more, until Jill interrupts your quiet tour. \"stop!\" she instructs. And you halt.<br>\r\n\"what is it?\" you ask, intrigued.<br>\r\n\"the stone's moving.\" Jill replies.<br>\r\n\"but how can it be moving?\" you wonder. Jill approachesit slowly and cautiously. She picks it up in her hands.<br>\r\nA few seconds later you hear screams. Her screams.<br>\r\nYou turn around and she has stumbled off the edge of a cliff right next to them. Her face appears to be bloody, as if it has been torn off.<br>\r\nYou run for the others in fear. Your breathing is becoming harsher. \"roy!\" you bellow. Your voice echoes around the cave.<br>\r\n\"we're coming!\" a reply comes a couple of seconds later. You suddenly stumble over a rock and you burst into tears.<br>\r\nThe others come to you. \"what happened?\" Roy asks.<br>\r\n\"jill's fallen!\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

She seems to be unconscious.<br>\r\nYou choose to lift her up on a stretcher.<br>\r\nYou all decide that Burt should go up and winch the ropes for the stretcher. <br>\r\nHe goes up and lifts the stretcher up, carrying her to a safe place before finally helping the others at the edge to climb back up.<br>\r\nWhile he does this, a creature bursts violently out of Jill's head, coming out of her eye. The eyeball drops off it as it opens it's huge mouth and hisses loudly.<br>\r\nBurt turns round in wonder, only to be immeadiately faced with a quick as lightning creature racing toward his neck.<br>\r\nHe reaches out to stop it, but too late, as it is already on his neck and advancing it's retractable teeth into the flesh.<br>\r\nBurt screams in pain, alerting the others. They watch him tumble down the cliff, only to be stopped by a rope that has caught on his leg.<br>\r\nThe alien digs further, snapping his spine with it's pressure filled bite. And it is then that his head starts to slip off, slowly. It finally comes off, dropping to the ground. You stare at the upright head, part of the helmet smashed.</span></div></div>",
