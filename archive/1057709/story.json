Little did they know that soon, they would have to fight for thier lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrstal the athletic girl huffed, \"Look. Once we get there, can we PLEASE stop fighting? It is getting very old.\" June the bookworm adjusted her narrow rectangular glasses, \"I agree. It's mainly 'cause Amelia won't shut up about finding rare treasures. You know that nowadays, all the rare gems and stones have been found. So just drop it, you won't find anything where we're going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia the treasure hunter spat, \"I don't care what you say, bookworm, i'm going to find a rare gem and sell it for a handsome ammout of cash. And no one is going to stop me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a meteor shower flooded the sky, and Keira the rocket mechanic said nervously, \"Guys... I think one of those meteors is heading this WAY!!!\" Seconds later, a meteor slammed into the jet, causing it to explode!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDays later, the four girls wake up on a tropical island, their clothes ripped to ribbons from the explosion, but none were hurt too badly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia stated, \"Well, what do we have here? A tropical island? Sweet! I bet there is a ton of rare gems and stones here! Hahaha!\" Krystal removed her shreaded shirt, revealing an ice blue bra, \"I dunno, I get a sense of fear from this island, like something here that can turn us into meat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a scarlet dragon flew above them, but didn't attack. June's jaw dropped, \"This island is inhabited by... DRAGONS!!!\" Keira moaned, holding her wrench, \"But that's impossible... isn't it? I mean... Dragons don't exist... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a spiritual dragon appeared before them, \"So, you are the new ones on the island. If you wish to survive on this island, you must befriend a dragon and fight to live. If you become the Queen of Dragons, you will be rewarded for your efforts, and you will become the ruler of this land. But beware, many dragons, monsters, and other creatures would be willing to turn you into a healthy snack, so you must be alert. You will need weapons to survive, I wish you the best of luck.\" and it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia laughed, \"Hah! This will be a piece of cake! I will find the strongest dragon here, and soon, very soon, I will be a queen! Oh can life get any better?\" June spoke up, tossing away her melted sneakers and socks, \"Didn't you hear him? If we're not careful, we're dragon meat. We can't run headlong into this, we have to plan it out carefully.\" \"Hah! Sounds like words from a coward. I'm going into the island and finding me a dragon, so I can be rid of you three. Ta-ta.\" She gave them a mock kiss and walked into the jungle. \"She's dead.\" Krystal said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira spoke up, \"Well, she does have a point. Unless we get a dragon or two, we're sunk. Let's split up and see what we can find.\" The other girls nodded, and went their seperate ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho will you follow?</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately she wasn't very jungle wise so her remaining clothes were shredded by the thick undergrowth leaving her completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That\u2019s just great!\" Amelia complained to no one. That\u2019s when her eyes fell on a long and sharp stick. She decided to pick it up and begins to examine it. \"Well, that dragon spirit thing said that we should get a weapon. I guess this will have to do.\" She says taking it with her. \"Now all I need to do is find a dragon to tri... I mean befriend. But I need to find a really strong one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment the bushes in front of her started to shake as something started to move through them. Amelia lowered the point of her make shift spear in front of her as she prepared to defend herself. But to her surprise a 3 foot long blue scaled dragon emerged from the bushes. It had a thin snout with wide eyes, little tiny horns on top of its head and short feet that ended in four tiny claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh... aren\u2019t you cute!\" Amelia says as she reaches down and strokes the top of the small dragon's head.</span></div></div>",

She then screams as the dragon's tongue works itself over her face getting a good taste of her. The tiny dragon then starts to swallow her down with very little trouble despite its small size. Its jaws seem capable of stretching to any size as it easily gets her shoulders and then later her hips into its throat. In a matter of minutes Amelia completely disappears into the body of the small dragon leaving it looking more like a scaled beach ball than a dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia lay curled up and sobbing in the extremely tight stomach as it slowly started to excrete digestive juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the stomach the Dragon Spirit looked at the small rounded dragon and couldn't help but laugh.</span></div></div>",

Still, this was the first island inhabitant that she had met that appeared to want nothing more from her than a good stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name, little one?\" she asked.  Blue eyes blinked back at her and the little dragon nuzzled her hand again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled and massaged a scaly ear.  \"You wouldn't happen to know where a girl could get a new set of clothes, would you boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little dragon blinked, scuttled back a few feet, and hissed at her.  The dragon was small, but it flashed razor sharp fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not asking for Calvin Klein or anything!  Like a couple of sewn together leaves would do...\" she quipped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twig snapped just behind her, and she felt hot breath on her naked back.  Suddenly, she knew why the little blue dragon had hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something scary behind me, isn't there,\" she asked.  The little blue dragon didn't bother to respond.  Instead it turned about, bending sinuously in on itself, and took off running through the undergrowth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia would have liked to have taken the time to weight her options and make an informed, rational decision about whether to follow her newfound friend, but just then a deep gurgling roar echoed through the trees.  In a heartbeat, she too was beating her way through the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the deserts of Kalimbad, while searching for the Jewel of Despair, she had gotten caught in a herd of charging rhinoceruses.  She thought she had ran for her life then, but that was nothing compared to fleeing a blood thirsty dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerror gripped her, and she flew though bushes and leapt over fallen logs.  Branches tore at her unprotected skin and soon she was covered in a network of small scratches.  Up ahead, the forest began to thin, and suddenly she burst out from under the cover of the trees onto the edge of a salt flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA field of white sand, covered in fine salt dust stretched out before her.  Behind, it sounded as if the pursuing dragon was simply charging <i>through</i> trees instead of going around.  The sound of exploding timber was horrendous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing no other choice, she prepared herself for a dash across the salt flats when she heard a frantic chirping coming from her right.  The little blue dragon was signaling her from the safety of a cave.  The entrance was full of jagged rocks, but, if she squirmed, she might be able to fit.</span></div></div>",

He was huge, all muscle and sinew.  His scales glittered crimson in the light, and his eyes narrowed as he spotted the fleeing girl.  Crouching like a cat, he bunched his hind legs and leapt into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia shot a quick look over one shoulder and nearly lost her balance when she saw the dragon hurtling towards her.  She had no time!  Jagged rocks crowded the cave mouth, and here she was without a stitch of clothing.  It was going to be a hard landing...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hestitation, she closed her eyes and made a leap for the cave mouth.  The little blue dragon chirped in terror and scurried deeper into the cave, just as Amelia landed--hard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragon was only seconds behind and a thunderous boom shook the cave as he collided head first with the mountain outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, my friends, we all know that dragons are tough creatures, but red dragons, in particular, have exceedingly thick skulls, and this one was no exception.  He was dazed for no more than a minute, and when he regained his senses, he tore at the mountainside with sharp claws, digging his way towards the helpless, naked girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, bleeding from a deep gash in her thigh, struggled to pull herself further into the cave.  All around her, jagged rocks bit into her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA dark shadow obscured the cave mouth, and the red's crimson snout pressed into the cavern, teeth snapping.  Behind Amelia, the little blue dragon howled and scratched at Amelia's shoulder, trying to drag her further into darkness.</span></div></div>",

Amelia screams again as she slides down the dragon's moist throat before ploping into its soggy stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia spends the next 15 minutes sobbing to herself and slopping around in stomach goo before she finally sucombs. Amelia's remains soon liquify and continue to slop around in the red dragon's stomach for a while before she drains into the intestines. Her remains spend the next couple of hours slowly sliding through the beast's innards. Before long Amelia is nothing more than a large pile of fertilizer.</span></div></div>",

Amelia guessed that last time he came here, the rather large dragon in front of them had not been there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia tore her eyes off of the dragon for a bit to survey her surroundings. The nest looked new, some of the plants used to construct it were still green. Although it was kind of hard for her to tell, with the green light coming from the fungus on the walls. But one thing caught her eye... it was sunlight. They were close to the exit of the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low growl drew her attention to the problem at hand. If they wished to get to the exit, they had to get past the dragon guarding it. And he doesn't look too happy to have had his nap interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry...\" She began, \"We were running from another dragon, and we thought this cave was empty.\" She was about to say more, but an impatient clicking of teeth silenced her. The dragon moved it's head closer to the girl, sniffing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia thought she was done for, but the little blue dragon she had befriended stepped into the conversation. It looked the big red dragon in the eyes, and started making noises. To Amelia's ears, nothing was understandable, asides from the tone the dragon had, which was an apologetic one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the dragon's ears, it sounded something like this... \"Sorry to disturb your rest, but like the girl said, we were being chased by a rather large red dragon who wished to make a meal of the both of us.\" The large dragon growled, causing Amelia to panic slightly, but a sound which comforted the little blue dragon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Describe him for me? I think I may know who you're talking about... if that's him, then I'll let you go. He doesn't know about the back way out of this cave, and he'll wait at the entrance for a day or so for you two. I don't like him much, he's the one who gave me this.\" The dragon pointed to a scar on his shoulder, only recently healed. \"So if it's him, I'll let you go for informing me as to where he is. I've been looking for him to, ah, return the favor, or so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little blue dragon began to speak again,  but the larger dragon cut him off. \"Enough! The dragon you are describing...\"</span></div></div>",

Not long after that, they emerged out of a mountainside into a sunny clearing, about a hundred feet across, in what appeared to be a dense forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the clearing Amelia saw the other three girls she had left on the beach, sitting around a large black dragon, itself sitting down, his massive head towering twenty feet over the heads of her companions, with his tail curled up around his feet.  His scales were black as night, and shimmered in the sunlight when he moved.  His underbelly and the underside of his wings were tinged crimson, and she could see thin wisps of smoke rising from his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon seemed to be expecting her, as he looked straight at her and she heard him say in her mind, \"Ah, welcome Amelia!  I sensed you beneith the mountain.  We've been waiting for you!\"  He turned his gaze to the small blue dragon that had come with Amelia, and again, spoke telepathically, \"Thank you for bringing her here.  You may go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small blue dragon turned and walked off into the forest, leaving the girls alone with the large dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Amelia!\" Krystal said excitedly.  \"This is Vermithrax.  He came to us right after you left!  He said he'd protect us from the other dragons here, and help us figure out which one of us was supposed to become the Queen of the Dragons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Vermithrax thought at them.  \"I needed you all together first though.  I am glad to see you survived your adventure under the mountain.  We dragons have no society as you know it.  I am somewhat of a sorcerer but, even my considerable influence is very limited here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira interrupted, \"Hey, now that we're all together, why don't we get with figuring out who the Queen of the Dragons is going to be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax chuckled audibly.  \"Not so fast.  The sun is going down, and it gets cold at night here.  You should gather materials to build a fire, we will rest here tonight and continue our quest in the morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the girls began gathering sticks and branches from the nearby forest.  Vermithrax dug a pit with his claws, and the girls threw their firewood in the pit.  It wasn't pretty but it didn't need to be.  After about an hour of work, as the sun was starting to set, they were quite sweaty but had gathered a large pile of tinder and branches.  Vermithrax told them to stand back, and then he took a deep breath, and exhaled a stream of flame over the firewood.  A roaring flame was kindled and the girls, still naked, sat around the fire to keep themselves warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax coiled his great tail around the fire and behind the girls, who, being very tired at this point, found as comfortable positions as they could on the ground and fell fast asleep.</span></div></div>",

But now, she was on an island with real dragons!  The thought both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched the sun go down, her guardian's scales shimmering with hues of red and orange, and then white as the moon rose.  She lay on the ground but couldn't seem to fall asleep no matter what she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, my senses are much keener than yours.  You don't have to pretend to be asleep\" Vermithrax spoke into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just.. I've never seen a real dragon before!  I've read about them and made up stories about them but I never though they were... real\", Keira whispered softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This island is special.  It's a sort of.. nexus if you will.  Half in your world, and half in ours.  We have always had contact, of a limited sort.  Let us talk away from the others though.  I wouldn't want to disturb them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Keira and Vermithrax walked to the far side of the clearing.  She was amazed that something so big could move so silently.  Vermithrax sat down, once again coiling his tail around himself, just in front of his fore claws.  Keira shivered once she was away from the fire, it did indeed get cold on the island at night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, sit down,\" Vermithrax thought to her, motioning with his head toward his tail.  She sat on his tail, facing him.  Vermithrax folded his wings over her, and exhaled a stream of warm, slightly sweet smoke over her.  Her chill faded away, and she found the scent quite pleasing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better?\" Vermithrax thought to her.  \"Yes, much!\"  Keira spoke quietly, and continued, \"I've always been such a huge dragon fan.  My friends always told me I was such a huge nerd, reading stories and collecting little sculptures.  But now.. that I really met one... you I mean... I don't know, should I be excited or scared?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax chuckled softly, and pulled the end of his tail back and started slowly wrapping it around Keira's midsection.  \"Scared?  Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... don't dragons normally eat people?  Especially girls like us?\" Keira said.  She found the sensation of Vermithrax's scales against her skin, and the scent of his smoke strangely soothing.  Vermithrax seemed to notice, and continued twining his tail around her.  He exhaled a denser cloud of warm smoke over her; she inhaled deeply, surprised at how she didn't gag or cough.  She began to feel slightly lightheaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, some of us do.  But if I wanted to just eat you I could have done that any time I wanted to.  Do you want me to eat you?  Don't talk, just think, I can hear your thoughts just fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Keira was completely coiled up, her head and arms sticking up through the top of Vermithrax's twined tail.  She felt so good, she just relaxed there in his coils.  \"I don't think it would be so bad.  But I don't want to die just yet.\" Keira thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you earlier, I am a sorcerer.  If a lesser creature than I desires it, and I decide to grant their wish, I can assimilate their spirit.  They become a part of me, in mind, body, and spirit.  It is not death, merely a transformation.\"  Vermithrax lowered his head down to Kieia's level.  Keira reached out and scratched his eye ridge gently, and gazed into his mesmerizing eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would do that for me?\" she thought dreamily, thoroughly under the dragon's spell.  Thick smoke began to waft from Vermithrax's nostrils, contributing to the dense cloud held around her by the dragon's enveloping wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I would do better.  My mate and I have a clutch of eggs at the moment.  Since you have been a dragon-follower your whole life, even if you didn't know it, I will put your spirit in one of those eggs.\" Vermithrax thought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira could actually feel the dragon's spirit around her now, pulling at her gently.  Her senses began to blur, she saw Vermithrax with her eyes and herself with his eyes at the same time, her body felt warm and appealing inside of his coils.  She was hungry, desirous, and merciful all at the same time.  And she knew everything he knew and knew she wouldn't say no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", they said together, their spirits and minds one.  All that remained was to make them one in body.  Together, they lowered his head, and slowly licked the female body that was soon to join them in their oneness.  The salty taste of sweaty human flesh was so delicious, they hadn't tasted it in a long time, but they knew they had to be careful as the slightest amount of pain could break the trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey loosened their coils, and opened their mouth wide.  Carefully grasping the body with their fore claws, they wrapped their tongue around it, and slowly pulled it in, savoring its taste with every moment.  They tilted their head back, and gently swallowed, their massive head easily taking it down with one gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, the lesser creature's soul would be assimilated by Vermithrax's now.. but he had other plans for her.  They pictured Vermithrax's nest in their minds, with a small clutch of eggs in the center.  Keira's soul slowly disengaged from Vermithrax's, his own identity returning to him as he did so, and with a small, precise mental twist, he placed it within the egg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax snapped out of the trance and returned to reality.  He silently flapped his wings to disperse the cloud of smoke beneath them, and silently padded back over to the remaining girls, still fast asleep, not yet aware anything had happened.  As Vermithrax lay down to sleep himself, he wondered how he was going to explain it to them.  He knew everything Keira knew, but wasn't sure he should just come out and tell them.. and least not yet.</span></div></div>",

The girls groggily struggled to their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have rocks in my hair!  Is there anyplace we can clean.. hey, where's Keira?\" Krystal said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had a talk last night.  She was quite enamored with me, and, after we had talked a while she revealed she wanted to be a dragon herself.  So, I took her spirit and placed it in one of my eggs.  Now, there's a stream not far from here in the forest, I'll take you there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he strode off into the forest.  The girls followed, talking amongst themselves about who would be the Queen of the Dragons, and what they would say when they saw Keira in her new body, and other things.  While they were walking, they heard many menacing noises coming from the forest, nothing approached them.  Soon, they reached a small stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally!\" Krystal said, and she and the others jumped in, and began cleaning the dirt and grime that had accumulated on them from the previous day's exertions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are we going to be doing today?\"  June asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today we are going to go to the top of the mountain in the center of the island, where, with any luck, we will find out which of you will be the next queen.  Now come.\" Vermithrax said as he lowered his head to the ground, beckoning them with a fore claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls took the invitation and climbed up onto Vermithrax's back, positioning themselves between the three-foot spines.  After they were all mounted, Vermithrax took to the air, his powerful wing beats carrying them quickly to great heights, and he angled toward the mountain when they were even with its top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were flying, June asked, \"Why does one of us need to be the Queen of Dragons, anyway?  Why is there even such a Queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This island is a sort of portal, a nexus between the world of humans and the world of dragons.  But the rift is not natural, it must be held open.  Only one who is both human and dragon can do this, and that person is the Queen of the Dragons.. of this island at least.  But nobody lives forever, the old QUeen died some time ago, and without a new Queen this island will sever itself from both worlds and drift in limbo.  That is why one of you must become the new Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax angled in a lazy descending glide.  They were over the top of the mountain now, and they could see a small marble building with a large, paved plaza in front of it below them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long at all before they landed.  The girls hopped off the dragon's back, and looked at the building, which was definitely a lot larger looking from the ground.  It looked like some sort of temple, easily a hundred yards square.  A large patio about ten yards wide was in front, its overhanging roof supported by great marble pillars with statues of dragons twining around them.  A large, imposing entrance about twenty feet high by forty wide stood before them, leading into a dimly lit chamber inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inside you will find the means to become the Queen of Dragons.  I can not go inside or offer guidance beyond this point, save to say that only the new Queen will return from inside.  I do not know what will become of the others, but, I can offer you a life of sorts on the island if you choose not to go inside\" Vermithrax thought to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't we just go home?\" Amelia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't.  The connection to your world has already been severed.  There is nothing in this world except this island, and it will remain as such until one of you becomes the new Queen\" the dragon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal turned and faced the entrance.  \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained!\" she said as she walked inside.  June shook her head and followed.</span></div></div>",

He was a bit disappointed, he had hoped to have another one of the girls for himself.  Perhaps he still would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the temple the girls paused as their eyes adjusted to the gloom.  The inside of the temple seemed to be one giant, bare room.  A large circular pool, about ninety yards across, dominated most of the room.  In the center of the pool, on a small island, stood a small statue of a sitting dragon, which held a brightly glowing orb in its jaws, which provided most of the illumination for the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls looked around a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's what we're supposed to get,\" Krystal said, pointing at the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how are we supposed to get there?  I am NOT going in that water, it looks nasty!\" June replied.  Amelia contented herself to try and look around the dark edges of the pool, perhaps there was another way to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was undettered and began wading into the pool.  \"I was a champ swimmer in high school!  I can handle a little dirty water.  It's not like we're not filthy already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia and June watched as Krystal carefully worked her way toward the center.  She was about fifteen yards out, in water up to her chest when she suddenly stumbled, saying, \"Hey, I just bumped into something, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice trailed off as the water in front of Krystal began to churn, then roil as a huge serpent thrust up out of the pool.  It looked to be about a foot in girth, with a wide, crested head and a long fin running its muck-encrusted length.  Amelia and June backed against the wall as it rose about fifteen feet out of the water in front of Krystal, blocking their view of the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal stood absolutely still, barely even breathing, hoping that the creature somehow would not notice her.  It lazily flicked its tongue out, and slowly rotated its eyes until it was looking straight at Krystal.  She looked back, into those alien eyes, and suddenly lost her nerve and tried to frantically back toward the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature merely hissed, and then struck with lightning speed, biting her shoulder and lifting her out of the water.  She screamed as she ascended, and as soon as her feet were clear of the dark water the creature rapidly spun her around, and she vanished into a writhing mass of coils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune and Amelia could only watch as Krystal's screams were muffled, and then silenced as the creature squeezed her tightly.  A moment later, its head emerged from the mass of coils, and Krystal moaned weakly as the coils loosened a bit and shifted, revealing Krystal's barely conscious head and shoulders, the left of which was bleeding freely, dark drops of blood dripping into the gloomy water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent fixed its predatory gaze on Krystal, and its tongue flicked again over her face and hair.  It began to visibly salivate in anticipation, and opened its mouth wide and took her head into its mouth, face down, tongue against her face.  Thick drool flowed over her bleeding shoulder and breasts as it swallowed, her head causing a visible bulge appear in its throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt stopped at her shoulders, as it considered how to pass this wide obstacle.  It held her there for several minutes, shifting more of her out of its coils, letting the drool dribble down to her waist, and then shook her gently as it unhinged its jaws and pushed, getting her right, then left shoulders in, and swallowed again, its throat expanding into an almost lurid outline of the still weakly struggling Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother push and swallow, and her drool-covered breasts disappeared into the beast's throat.  Globs of spittle began to dribble over her box, and onto the serpent's coils around her legs before finally falling into water, the splashes sounding deafening to Amelia and June in the silence.  It uncoiled her completely as it pushed forward again, her rump facing up in the serpent's mouth as her barely-kicking legs hung outside its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hissed as drool filled her crack and dribbled down her legs, and swallowed again, her knees in its mouth, the rest of her clearly visible in the enormously bulging throat, which resembled a skin-tight snake suit at this point.  It turned to face Amelia and June, seeming to show off its prey, before lifting her legs into the air and swallowing again, leaving only her twitching, glistening feet visible in the back of its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent closed its mouth, and Krystal slowly descended down its length and passed out of view beneath the surface of the pool.  It flicked its tongue at Amelia and June, and then slowly lowered back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining girls stood in shock for a few minutes, before June finally exclaimed, \"I am SO not going in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to.  There's a bridge in the back.\" Amelia said, pointing to a narrow path leading to the island on the far side of the room, barely visible in the near-darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still not going in there!  Did you see what happened to Krystal?  That thing... ATE... her!\" June said, still unsatisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well one of us has to take the orb, or we're all going to end up on the menu!\" said Amelia, who began to walk around to the back of the pool, toward the bridge.</span></div></div>",

Slowly, one foot in front of the other, she continued, and, after what seemed like an eternity but was really only a few minutes she stood on a small marble platform in the center of the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the statue.  It could be trapped.  She knew from her previous treasure hunting experiences that valuable treasures usually were.  But then again, this treasure was meant for her, she was supposed to take it.  It wouldn't make any sense to trap it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?  Take it!\" cried June from across the pool, interrupting Amelia's train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, it might be trapped,\" she replied, still trying to make up her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's only one way to find out.  If you don't take it, I'll come over there and do it,\" June yelled back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia looked at the brightly glowing orb, held tightly in the statue's jaws.  There was, indeed, only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wrapped her arms around the orb, and pulled.  Slowly, it began to slide loose, grating over stone teeth as it slowly came free...</span></div></div>",

Amelia stumbled backward a few steps, and the serpent's head broke the surface, mouth open in anticipation of another meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, however, caught herself at the last moment, and avoided falling into the water.  She regarded the large orb cradled in her arms, its warm glowing seeming to draw her in.  So complete was her attention that she didn't notice the stone dragon blink, and become animate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia!  Watch out!\" June cried.  Amelia blinked and looked up, just in time to see the dragon snap at the orb, snatching it and one of her hands into its mouth with lightning speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to pull her hand free, but the dragon held it fast.  It seemed to regard her with amused interest as she wriggled and jerked on her trapped hand.  Amelia quickly realized she wasn't getting anywhere, and then stood there and looked back at the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. let go, please,\" Amelia said, and added in a somewhat hopeful tone, \"Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon seemed to smile, and responded by pulling her arm in up to her elbow.  Amelia shrieked and began to struggle in panic, to which the dragon responded by biting down just hard enough to draw a single drop of blood, and gently shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia took the hint and relaxed, and the dragon pulled her in up to her shoulder, her hand and arm now inside the dragon's throat.  Despite it's stony appearance it seemed flesh on the inside, wet, warm, and strangely inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"June!  Get out of here!  There must be another way!\" she shouted, waving emphatically with her free arm as the dragon opened it's stoney maw wide and descended over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune however did not run away, once again frozen in place as she watched another of her friends be devoured.  The dragon pushed forward, and Amelia's shoulders slipped into his mouth as her head joined her arm in the dragon's throat.  It lifted her up into the air, until her legs dangled above the beast's head, and it swallowed again, taking in her entire torso in one swallow, seeming to grunt with effort as its neck swelled tremendously as its new prey passed through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt shook its massive head as it swallowed again, her body disappearing into the dragon up to her calves.  The dragon licked a bit at the petite feet dangling outside its mouth, seeming to save the taste as it pulled her all the way in.  June watched as it slowly closed its mouth and swallowed again, and the bulge in its neck passed down down into its body and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone dragon relaxed, then looked at June, seeming to almost beckon her.  She remained in place at the edge of the chamber however, and after a few minutes the dragon returned to its original spot, and coughed violently a few times.  Another bulge, this time coming up, appeared in its throat, followed by the orb reappearing in the dragon's mouth.  It sat down, holding the orb between its teeth, and once again appeared to be only a statue.</span></div></div>",

I will use my magic to assist you,\" Vermithrax thought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads her to the center of the courtyard, to the center of a large amphitheater-like bowl, where an ancient stone altar sits, its stone blackened by soot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place?\" June asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A very special place.  Here, the people who lived on this island long ago would gather to worship us.  On this altar we would accept whatever they wished to offer us - food, gems, and their bodies and souls.  The energy that still resides here will allow me to give you a powerful blessing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune looked at the altar, and then at Vermithrax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to get on that?  Are you going to eat me?\" she asked, a little apprehension working its way through the smoke-induced calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled, and exhaled over once more.  \"Though I have blessed many thousands by allowing their spirits to become one with my own, and would happily grant you this blessing, you must still become the Queen.  But where I will send your spirit, your body can not follow.  Now please, lay on the altar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune felt a little lightheaded from the smoke, it was very relaxing, and she thought if the dragon simply wanted to eat her he could have done that at any time.  Besides, what choice did she have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that thought, she walked up to the altar and laid down upon it.  It was oddly warm and despite being solid rock was not uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax thought to her, \"Now relax, and breathe deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to chant vocally in a language June did not understand, and as he did so thick, black smoke billowed from his mouth and nostrils.  In the still air of the amphitheater, it did not disperse and soon filled it with a gradually thickening haze.  June soon found herself feeling deeply relaxed and peaceful as she breathed in his draconic essence, and after a few minutes he paused, inhaled deeply himself, and exhaled a voluminous cloud of thick, black smoke directly over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed in as the smoke blocked out her sight of everything, surprised that she did not gag or cough, it felt as natural as breathing air.  Vermithrax began to chant faster and louder, she found herself craving his smokey essence, breathing deeply and quickly herself, each breath expelling smoke as if she was a dragon herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual reached its climax as Vermithrax reared back on his hind legs, emitting an ear-splitting roar as he expelled a jet of white-hot flame over the altar, it's flames splashing over the edge and singing the ground.  June felt no pain however, only a sensation of warmth as her flesh disintegrated instantly, her bones lasting only a little longer beneath the gout of dragon's fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed like an eternity, but in reality only for a few seconds Vermithrax doused June with flame, the dense smoke filling the amphitheater.  Finally, he stopped, and though June's body was completely gone, her spirit could clearly be seen, a human outline of the dragon's smoke and fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax sat up before the altar, and wrapped June carefully with his wings, and began to chant again.  June found herself lifting into the air, still feeling nothing but a warm calm as the dragon stopped chanting, and opened his mouth.  She floated toward, and then into his waiting maw.  He closed his mouth, and as he did so June felt herself begin to fade, and as she did so, felt the dragon's body, as if it were her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly normal thought returned to her as Vermithrax padded softly out of the amphitheater into fresh air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What.. happened?\" asked June, realizing as she did so she was speaking through the dragon's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just think, little one.. it is all that is necessary,\" Vermithrax thought back to her.  \"The magic I have infused your spirit with will allow you to become any creature that eats you for one day.  But unlike right now, you will not share the body for that day, you will have full use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. OK\" she thought, a little confused.  \"But what happens after that one day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will sleep, and wake in your human body.  But there are a couple of limitations,\" he thought back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. what are those?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, to become the Dragon Queen, you must take the orb while in your human form.  And second, the magic is less effective on dragons.  I can only guarantee that you will be able to possess the first three dragons that consume you.  After that your spirits will commingle, and you may not be able to separate who is dragon and who is human - if that happens you will not be able to return to your human body and will remain in whatever form you inhabit for the rest of your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for today however, we will share this body.  Come - I will show you what a dragon's life is like!\" he thought, and she sensed he was in fact eager to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, June spent the rest of the day learning to fly, to breathe smoke and fire, the thrill of the hunt, the satisfying feeling of having a belly full of prey, the sight of the impressive hoard of treasure in Vermithrax's nest, and many other things.  But, eventually, the sun hung low in the sky, and she felt suddenly very tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. now sleep, and when you awaken continue your quest to become the Dragon Queen.  I will not be able to aid you further, but I am sure you will succeed,\" Vermithrax thought to her, as she nodded off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, June found herself back in her own body outside the temple.

Maybe if I can get rid of that snake and dragon, I can just pick the orb up!\" she thought, as she started down a path into the jungle and down the mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't gone far, maybe a mile or so, when, as she was crossing a clearing in the forest, she heard the beat of leathery wings, and looked up just in time to see a large (though not as large as Vermithrax) red dragon land in front of her.  It looked to be about forty feet from snout to tail, and it was solid, bright red color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. are you lost?\" the dragon asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can talk?\" asked June, a little surprised to hear him speaking verbally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I can talk - though it takes a little of my magic to let you understand me.  I was flying down to the lake, and saw you all alone.  You must be lost to be here,\" the dragon said to June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yes.  I guess I am a bit lost,\" said June, not quite sure what the dragon was up to, but having a hunch it was going to involve her ending up in his stomach, which, given what Vermithrax had done earlier, wouldn't be a bad outcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in luck then - I happen to know of a nice, warm, place that I'm sure you be perfect in!  Would you like to see it?\" the dragon asked, smiling wickedly at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. sure,\" said June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!  I'm glad we both agree that you would be much better off in my stomach,\" the dragon replied, as it suddenly lunged at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune, surprised by the sudden movement, stepped back, and stumbled, grunting as she fell on her stomach.  The dragon wasted no time, snatching her up by her rear into his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was bent double, and even though she was quite flexible it was a bit uncomfortable to have her head suddenly shoved between her legs.  Her legs flailed around outside the dragon's mouth, and she instinctively grabbed hold of its lips with her hands as she tried to pull herself, at least into a more comfortable position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon, however, would have none of it and simply pulled her backwards, and swallowed, and she felt his throat bulge around her rear as it swallowed.  Her hands lost their grip and her feet were all that remained outside his maw.  He swallowed again, and she felt the throat slipping around her back and thighs as she was drawn all the way in.  Another swallow, and she felt herself sliding down his tight throat, before finally coming to rest in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There - nice and warm, and rather comfortable, for both of us I think,\" the dragon said to her.  \"Now relax, and you may find the experience rather enjoyable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon swallowed a gulp of air for her, and she did find that the dragon's juices only caused a feeling of warmth, even as her new body's skin was turning to goo.  She did relax, and before long passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awoke, after what seemed like only a moment.  She felt rather pleasantly full, and noticed that she was in the red dragon's body.  Fortunately, after being with Vermithrax the day before it only took her a few moments to get accustomed to it.  She was also very thirsty, but knew she should be getting back to the temple, she only had a day to use this body and who knew what the dragon would do when it realized his body had been possessed by its food.</span></div></div>",

After that, it is impossible for them to ever find it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune looked at the temple and to her surprise she saw that it had vanished.

I would say that this will hurt me more than it will hurt you, but that would be a lie, because I know that I'm going to enjoy this.\" Vermithrax chuckled as he breathed another huge lungful of his smoke on her.

She found herself suddenly becoming aroused as he worked her breasts, and then lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" she moaned.  \"What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drawing out your juices.  Human females are so tasty you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned evilly as he began probing about inside her, expertly thrusting the forked tip of his tongue deeply inside of his prey.  June moaned as she suddenly came, her juices gushing out onto the waiting tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the intoxicating smoke and the dragon's attentions he found herself helpless grinding against his tongue, grabbing it with her hands and pulling it deeper into her.  She scarcely noticed as the dragon's huge maw engulfed her, the tongue wrapping around her even as it probed ever deeper inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon her moans become louder and more urgent, as the dragon drove her to climax again, and again, and again.  Soon she was completely covered with a mixture of the dragon's saliva and her own juices as the dragon, impossibly, continued to drive her to heights she had never known even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after thirty minutes of almost nonstop orgasm, she tired, and the dragon withdrew.  The tongue loosened its coils around her, and she felt that huge head tipping back, and she slid easily into the dragon's waiting gullet.  He swallowed, and she felt the throat contract around her, and push her down, down towards her final destiny.  Once in his stomach, she felt an odd sense of peacefulness come over her, as she finally passed out, and then slowly liquefied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax was glad to have another of the girls.  It would be another hundred years before the planes would align again, and he would have a chance at such a meal again.

Where are you?\" she called out, but the black dragon was nowhere to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having anything else really in mind that she could do, she decided to set about finding some shelter.  Perhaps a nice cave, or even a spot on the beach free of all the predators that seemed to roam the island at will would do, at least until she could find something to defend herself with against the dragon guarding the orb in the temple would do.  It would only take a day, maybe two at the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill determined to become the Dragon Queen, she strode off into the jungle, but had barely gone out of sight of the temple when she felt a sharp, piercing pain in her left leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" she cried out, and looked down to see a very large cobra, easily the size of a large anaconda, with its fangs sunk deeply into her thigh.  She struck at the serpent with her fists, and it withdrew, hissed, and slithered into the shadows, but the damage was already done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune shrieked as the strength left her legs and she collapsed onto the ground, a slow paralysis slowly creeping its way up her body.  \"No!  Not like this!\" she sobbed, and then began to suck on the wound, spewing her own blood on the ground trying to stop the poison, but it was no use.  Soon her strength faded entirely and she collapsed again, able to feel and breathe but totally unable to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could only watch, helpless and terrified, as the cobra slithered out of the underbrush toward her.  It flicked its forked tongue over breasts and neck, its smooth scales feeling cool against her flush skin.  It dove under her, lazily wrapping a coil around her midsection as it flicked its tongue, tasting her legs, then her calves, and then finally tasting the soles of her feet before opening its mouth wide and engulfing first her left, then right feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snake's inner teeth alternately tickled and vaguely pricked her skin as the cobra slowly worked its way up her legs.  As it pushed up over her box and rump, the fear and panic left her, and June felt oddly at ease with the whole situation, glad that at least it would be over soon.  She was just a naked girl, on an island where humans were obviously nothing more than food, this was her natural place here.  Besides, the inside of the snake felt wet and cool, very good against her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cobra bulged enormously as it took in its meal, wiggling its head a bit to get her hands in with a proficiency that belied previous experience with consuming human food.  June liked the bulge, it revealed her contours very nicely, and while it lasted at least the snake wouldn't be hungry.  The snake was happy too, it didn't get to eat such sumptuous prey very often, especially warm, still-breathing prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt pushed over her breasts, and neck, and for a moment she looked into its eyes, and in that moment, locked in pose as predator and prey, she completely surrendered herself to it, and closed her eyes as the snake slipped in the rest of her.  She was surprised as she did not pass out immediately as she passed down into the snake's stomach.  \"The venom must have slowed my metabolism,\" she thought as she felt the snake slithering away, the bumps in the ground cushioned by the tube of muscle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the cobra's movements slowed and stopped, and as it rested she felt the fluid around her become warm and it started stinging her skin as it began to liquefy her as she gradually passed from awareness, and then this world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon spirit looked on as it digested its latest meal and thought, \"How sad, that she would come so close just to fail.  Now we must wait another hundred years for the planes to align again - perhaps then a true Dragon Queen will come to our island.\"</span></div></div>",

She realized in horror she was being digested just as she was being swallowed, and frantically tried to grab hold of something with her foreclaws and mouth, still dangling outside the fire dragon's jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was to no avail as the fire dragon, being much larger than her, simply continued to pull her in.

Even though it burned steadily it had no obvious source, merely hanging a few inches directly above the engraved dragon's open mouth on the floor.  As she approached it, it began to flicker in her direction, as if by an unfelt wind.  Even though she was close enough for it to touch her snout, it didn't burn, it merely felt warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of pondering and poking the warm flame with her foreclaws, she carefully tried flicking her tongue at it.  When it touched the flame, she felt its warmth jump into her tongue, and down through it into her.  Surprised, she jumped back, involuntarily hissing before regaining her composure and approaching the flame once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. in for a penny, in for a pound!\" she thought to herself as she opened her massive draconic jaws, then clamped them shut around the flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, she felt a flash of heat run through her body, snout to tail, and then subsided, leaving her with only a vague warm feeling that slowly coalesced right at the base of her serpentine neck.  She felt another hot flash at that spot, then felt something new inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe coughed, puffing out a small cloud of smoke, and as she caught her breath she realized her nostrils were emitting twin puffs of smoke when she exhaled, and small wispy streams if she tried to hold her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune thought for a few moments about what had just happened, and then decided to familiarize herself with her new abilities.  She felt as though she could squeeze the warm spot inside her.  She tried that, and was surprised to see herself spout a huge gout of smoke and fire through her mouth and onto the floor, blackening it and filling the room the room with a murky haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, then tried squeezing more gently, and found she merely breathed an enormous smoke cloud.  As she played around with it, she found that if she squeezed lightly she would breathe smoke, and if she squeezed hard she would breathe flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes hunger pangs disrupted her concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must be burning a lot food here.. literally!\" she thought, as she looked at the barrier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she knew what to do.  She opened her jaws and squeezed the warmth inside of her for all she was worth.  Instantly, a roaring inferno emerged from her maw, and in seconds the barrier was reduced to a few smoldering embers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effort was not without cost though, as June was now ravenously hungry.  As she strode down into another dark passage, she hoped she would find some food soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was not the first to take this journey, she realized, nor would she likely be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still thinking about her odd situation, the bookworm-turned-potential-Dragon-Queen, when she rounded another corner, and found herself looking at.. Amelia?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia?\" June asked, unsure of how her friend had escaped the statue's belly but sure it had something to do with all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia turned, saw her, and screamed.  \"No!  Please don't eat me!  I don't want to be eaten again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia?  It's me, June!\" she said, but Amelia didn't seem to understand, and went on pleading for her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune realized she was no longer speaking English.  She wasn't sure what language it was but she was sure it was a draconic language and not a human one, and that she wouldn't be able to talk to Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to do anything for her friend, June looked around.  She was in another octagonal room, like the others, but this one had no clues to help her.  The only way forward was blocked by some sort of blueish, transparent barrier.  She couldn't pass through it but Amelia didn't even seem to notice it was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune turned to Amelia, who promptly stopped dead in her tracks, collapsing on the ground, pleading not to be eaten.  She was faintly glowing with a shimmering blue light, the same shade as the barrier over the door, but Amelia seemed to also be unaware of this.  She also smelled positively delicious, the sweat of her own fear wafting an inviting odor into June's nostrils.  She found herself overcome by instinct, pinning Amelia to the floor beneath her and licking her over, the tantalizing taste of fresh meat and her own ravenous hunger from breathing so much smoke and fire earlier beckoning her to do what came naturally to dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.. she's my friend!  And she seems to be the key to getting past this challenge...\" she thought to herself, before turning to the hapless prey trapped beneath her foreclaws.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>June put her nostrils close to Amelia, unable to keep herself from breathing her scent.  She reeked of prey, of warm, still-breathing flesh waiting to be consumed.  As she expelled her own smokey breath over Amelia, Amelia breathed it in, and began to calm.  June realized her breath must be one of her tools to catch prey - she squeezed her flame gland gently and blew a dense cloud of smoke out her nostrils over Amelia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia tried to hold her breath, but after a few moments was compelled to breathe, taking in lungful after lungful of June's breath.  As she did so she calmed, and stopped struggling beneath June's claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effort of expelling even smoke finally drove all conscious thought from June's mind, and consumed by hunger surrendered to her own instinct.  She picked up Amelia in her foreclaws.  Amelia was still awake but completely pacified by her smoke, the blue haze around Amelia following her as June took Amelia into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being that large of a dragon, Amelia's rear and legs dangled outside June's maw.  Amelia grabbed hold of June's teeth, trying to steady herself as June wrapped her tongue around Amelia, sampling Amelia's taste even as June drew her further in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune tipped her back, letting gravity slide Amelia back to her throat, and she swallowed, pulling Amelia's buttocks and thighs into her mouth and forcing the prey's arms down against her sides.  Another swallow, and Amelia was fully swallowed up to her waist, with her legs and feet resting on June's tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune felt her throat bulging with the effort of taking her prey whole.  It didn't hurt, it felt good actually.  Very good, and Amelia tasted better than anything she had ever eaten before.  June flicked her tongue around Amelia's feet, savoring her taste, before swallowing again, and she felt Amelia pass down her throat and make a squirming lump in her belly.  It felt good, very good, like after eating a buffet after fasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hunger was sated, but another remained.  She could feel Amelia within her, not just her body, but her essence, her spirit, her very soul.  She closed her eyes and concentrated on it, it was trapped within her, but not part of her.  Not yet, anyway.  She probed at the spirit, then her instinct overtook her again, and she simultaneously pushed and pulled at it, and it expanded through and into her, and began to merge with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune was flooded with Amelia.  Her life, her experiences, her memories, all became June's, and as her spirit merged with the dragon's her own mind was overwhelmed with the dragon's, and soon nothing of her own spirit remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs June regained control of herself, she found she was no longer blocked by the blue barrier - she passed it through it just as Amelia had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be the Dragon's Power - I can consume souls.  The barrier was keyed to Amelia's spirit, I consumed her soul, and now it is keyed to mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia was sad for her friend, but in a way Amelia hadn't died, her body and soul had simply become one with June, and that was better than anything that might have awaited her on the island.  But her own trials were not yet complete - Wisdom still awaited her, somewhere down the corridor.</span></div></div>",

She was eaten by the statue!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. only royal dragons can consume the spirits of their prey.  And Amelia.. when she failed the task the statue put her in that dungeon the same time it put you there.  The statue wasn't really a statue, it was a spell, placed by me to find my new Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, June, for every Queen, there must also be a King, and I am the King of Dragons, and of this island.  Only one thing remains for you to become my Queen... you must fulfill the the task given you on the pedestal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My.. virginity?\" June asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" the dragon replied, and then he exhaled a smokey breath over the dragoness.  She found his scent pleasing, and oddly arousing.  Involuntarily she felt her own flame gland heat up, and she began to smoke quite a bit herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax breathed in her smoke, closing his eyes as he began to twine his tail around June's.  He drew close to her, exhaling a cloud of his own pheromone-laden smoke over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune suddenly felt an urgent need to feel him, to take him inside of her.  She squeezed his tail hard, and pressed her muzzle against his, exhaling her breath directly over him.  He reacted by twining his tail even more tightly around hers, and opened his maw, taking her muzzle into his.  His tongue flicked out into her mouth, and for a moment their forked tongues met and also twined around each other, before he withdrew and began to groom June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe worked at her scales with his tongue, gently flicking, then licking between them, smoke pouring from his nostrils with every exhalation.  She could barely contain herself, her own smoke mingling with his as she quivered in excitement from all the attention, her tail, still twined with his, flicking to and fro on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he reached her rear with his attentions, and began to nose at her tail.  Needing no prompting, she lifted it, and Vermithrax firmly gripped her shoulders with his claws as he climbed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready to become the Queen?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. yes!  Yes I'm ready!\" she replied, her lust for him driving any rational thought from her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us be mated!\" he said, as he squeezed her tail and drove himself forward and into her.  She reflexively dug her claws into the ground.  June only moaned as he began to rhythmically thrust, slow and shallow at first, but rapidly progressing to deep, rapid penetration.  June matched his rhythm, thrusting her hips backward in sync with him, driving him even further inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the fire inside of her burn hot and bright, as she panted a cloud of smoke with every breath.  Her mate did the same, their scents driving each other mad with passion.  One of them, neither was sure which, began a low rumble, quickly spreading to both and rapidly rising in volume and intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rumble became an urgent grunt, then a growl, and then an ear-splitting draconic roar as the fire inside the dragons escaped them, spilling out in twin jets onto the ground as they reached climax.  June felt Vermithrax's hot seed shoot up into her, as it did so she threw her hips back to take it as deeply into herself as draconically possible, before slowly retracting her claws up out of the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax, still panted, pulled out and dismounted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. now we are mates, and you are the Queen of the Dragons!\"</span></div></div>",

June walked slowly to avoid hitting anything in the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it wasn't so bad, but after walking in the pitch black passage for ten minutes June started to feel nervous. She couldn't see any light ahead to indicate if she was reaching the end of the passageway. June started to wonder if the passageway would ever end. Would she be walking down this dark tunnel forever?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune kept walking for another ten minutes until she started to panic. She ran down the dark tunnel desperate to reach the end. She eventually ran right into a wall. It didn't hurt though, because the wall was strangely soft. Thinking she hit a dead end, June turned around to go back the way she came. She felt around blindly in the dark and to her surprise she discovered that a new wall had mysteriously appeared only a few inches behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" June stammered, \"What happened to the passageway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune felt around to both sides and discovered that two walls had also appeared on either side of her only inches away. She screamed in fear, thinking that she had stumbled upon one of those booby traps where the walls come together to crush someone. She quickly realized that wasn't the case. The walls were uncomfortably close, but they weren't moving any closer together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" June muttered to herself as she blindly felt the four walls searching for a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when she realized that the four walls felt soft and squishy. The walls were also very warm and slimy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithax grinned as he felt the last contender for the title of Dragon Queen wriggle in his belly, \u201cPoor little one, she must have failed the tests and been teleported straight into the belly of a random dragon. It must be my lucky day, because it was MY belly! *BELCH!*\u201d</span></div></div>",

After catching herself, she looked at the orb in her arms, and as she did so, it began to shine with a brightness that was almost blinding, and it started to evaporate.  Glowing mist flowed into Amelia and she began to levitate.  It didn't hurt though, in fact in felt kind of good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune watched as Amelia too began to glow, dimly at first, then as brightly as the orb as it finally evaporated completely.  Soon she began to evaporate as well, her own mist streaming into the dragon's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her essence streamed into the statue, it became less of a statue and more of a real dragon.  The scales turned a dark, then deep shade of green, stone eyes blinked, and became flesh, and it cracked and popped as it moved its legs and stood up.  As the last of Amelia streamed into the dragon, it became fully flesh and blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amelia?\" June asked the confused-looking dragon.  Amelia looked back at June, her new eyes capable of seeing her, and everything else in the temple with crystal clarity despite the darkness.  New, draconic instincts flooded through her being, and she hopped, beat her wings, and glided across the pool to June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.. it's me,\" she said to June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune looked a little confused, and asked, \"Amelia?  Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia blinked, and realized she had spoke to June in the language of dragons, which June could not understand.  So she merely nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. so what happens now?\" asked June, sitting down on the tiled floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia thought about that.  She was so very hungry, her new body felt as though it hadn't eaten in ages.  And June's purpose on the island had been fulfilled.  She was going to be eaten eventually, it was best that Amelia take her, June was her friend and Amelia wanted to be sure June wouldn't suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Amelia looked at June sadly, and flicked her new, forked tongue at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to eat me, aren't you?\" June asked, seeming to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia nodded again, and gave her a long, slow lick across her breasts and neck.  She was surprised at how good June tasted.  She supposed there was a reason dragons had such a reputation for eating people.  She found herself licking again, a bit more eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it's inevitable,\" said June, seeming to resign herself to her fate.  \"Will it hurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia shook her head as she licked down June's legs, playing a bit with the soles of her feet before slurping them up in her mouth.  She felt June's wonderfully tasty feet slide over her tongue, and she began to work them into her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune relaxed, looking peaceful, almost serene as she was devoured.  Being a small dragon, Amelia's throat bulged as June's legs slowly slid down, June's feet hitting her stomach just as her midsection was sliding in.  Her tongue danced over her vagina, and tasted a drop of June's juices.  Such wonderful flavor!  Amelia soon found herself instinctively probing around inside her friend, who gasped at the sudden penetration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!  Getting a little 'friendly' there, aren't you?\" June said, suddenly aroused.  Amelia merely grinned.  June was her friend, she may as well enjoy her final moments after all.  With that thought, Amelia pleasured June for all she was worth, reveling in her flavor as she moaned and writhed inside her mouth.  June screamed in ecstasy as Amelia drove her to orgasm, her juice pouring into Amelia's mouth.  Amelia tipped her head back, letting the juices seep down her throat as she continued to play with June, barely letting her catch her breath before driving back into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia brought June to completion again, and again, and again.  She was a bit sad that after five orgasms, June seemed spent.  Her juices stopped flowing and all she could seem to do was pant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Amelia.  That was amazing!\" June said as she struggled to catch her breath.  \"You found the ultimate treasure, now finish my story.  Take me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Amelia did.  As she swallowed again her throat stretched enormously, though not uncomfortably as her hips passed.  Another swallow, and her back was in Amelia's mouth.  June stretched her neck and gave Amelia a little peck on her scaly nose, and then relaxed as Amelia swallowed again, June's wide shoulders passing into her throat.  Then only her arms remained, then nothing as her first meal as a dragon passed into her stomach.  June settled quickly, not struggling at all, as her stomach acids slowly began to reduce June to mush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia regained her composure, then, sated, walked out of the temple, to her future as the Dragon Queen.</span></div></div>",

She walked up to the door, then turned and exclaimed \"No way, I'm not going in there!\"  She turned and walked back toward Vermithrax, who thought to her, \"A reasonable choice.  I'm not sure I would go in either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down on a slab of broken marble in front of the dragon.  \"So, what happens now?\" she asked.  \"I'm going to consume you,\" he thought back to her, as he effortlessly pinned her to the ground beneath one of his enormous fore claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia felt herself begin to panic as she struggled in vain beneath the claw she was trapped under.  \"I thought you said I would live if I stayed behind!\" she cried as she ceased struggling, saving her strength for any opportunity she may have to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And live you shall,\" he thought to her.  He inhaled deeply, lowered his head over Amelia, and exhaled a dense cloud of sweet smoke.  Amelia caught its scent, and was surprised that she could easily breathe the dense fog.  As the dragon's breath filled her lungs, she felt a strangle sense of deep relaxation come over her.  She closed her eyes and lay down on the broken slab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax released her from under his claw.  She no longer felt any desire to run away, and, as she looked at Vermithrax's huge draconic persona, felt oddly happy to at least be devoured by such a magnificent predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I told you, little human, I am somewhat of a sorcerer.  Long ago, there was a village of humans on the island.  I protected them from the dangers of the island, and in return they gave me their undying adulation and worship.  They revered me, and part of that worship was to give their very bodies to me when they were too sick or old or gravely injured.\"  He paused to replenish the slowly dissipating cloud of smoke over Amelia before continuing.  \"Eventually, the village's priest devised a simple spell by which I could absorb their very spirits and give them a true afterlife.  All they had to do was desire it, and I would take their bodies as nourishment and their minds and spirits would become one with mine.  To them, they simply stopped being themselves and started being me, and I learned all they knew and had ever felt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, being the worshipful villagers they were they all wanted me to consume them.  We held a grand celebration that lasted about two weeks, and I consumed every last one of them.  Since then I have consumed every human who wished it, and refined my technique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" Amelia asked.  The cloud was dispersing again, and she felt a strong craving for more of Vermithrax's sweet, intoxicating breath.  \"No, as a matter of fact it will the most pleasurable thing you have ever experienced in your life.\"  Vermithrax smiled, and lowered his head down, slowly exhaling more of his smoke directly over Amelia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inhaled his scent deeply, amazed that it could make her feel so good.  She closed her eyes, and laid down flat on the marble slab as Vermithrax gently licked from her pussy to her breasts.  \"Oh...\" she murmured as he began working her breasts with his huge tongue like some of reptilian lover.  Smoke poured from his nostrils over his helpless prey as he pleasured her, inciting her breasts to soft firmness before working his tongue over her stomach, and then lower, slurping at the wet juices of her pussy before beginning to thrust inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia moaned in surprised ecstasy as the dragon's tongue filled her, thrusting slowly at first, and then deeper and faster.  Vermithrax only smiled as he artfully drove waves of hot, orgasmic pleasure through his hapless prey.  Dense smoke wafted freely from his nostrils over her, and she drove her hips against his tongue, feeling an overwhelming need to feel him inside her, and her inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon carefully restrained his writhing prey.  He didn't want her to get hurt, this was her big moment after all.  He continued pumping his tongue into her, carefully working her clitoris, as well as massaging her ample, firm breasts with his oversize claws.  Amelia moaned loudly as wave after wave of pure ecstasy came over her, her juices flowing freely from her pussy over Vermithrax's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, she finally tired.  The dragon's tongue slowed, and withdrew as he fixed his gaze upon her.  Still wreathed in his smoke, she looked into his eyes, awed to have had such a magnificent lover, even if she could only experience it once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloud began to disperse again.  As it faded, she felt an overpowering need for him, to be inside him and stay there forever.  \"Are you ready, little one?\" Vermithrax thought to her.  \"Yes!  Take me! Take all of me!\" she silently thought back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the dragon exhaled over her once again, and wrapped her body in his tongue.  Even though the pleasure from her previous exertions still hung over her, she felt incredibly relaxed and peaceful as Vermithrax pulled her into his mouth.  She saw daylight fade as he closed his mouth. His tongue worked her to the back of his mouth, and she took one last lungful of his intoxicating smoke.  Vermithrax swallowed, his powerful throat muscles taking her down in one gulp.  She relished the sensation of his throat muscles over her body as she descended, and then the tingle of his stomach acids as they started on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in complete bliss, inside the dragon, about to become a part of him.  She could feel his very soul around her, tugging on her, pulling her own spirit free of its dying host.  She surrendered herself to it, and the dragon's mind quickly came into her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, little one.  This is not the end, but a new beginning.  See with my eyes, feel my scales, think my thoughts,\" Vermithrax said to her.  She began to sense him again, not around her, but as him.  She relished the taste of her own juices, the pleasant fullness of his belly, the feeling of the wind against his scales, and as she did so Vermithrax's thoughts became her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took her, her memories became his, her mind a part of his own.  He had done this countless times, thousands at least, perhaps tens of thousands, but he relished each and every one of them.  After all, what greater gift could he give to a lowly human than allowing them to become, not just a small part of him, but actually the dragon himself?  He lay there silently for some time, assimilating her soul into his own, and when she was completely subsumed into his own consciousness he finally stood up, shaking off the trance he had been under for the last several hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the entrance and wondered what would become of the two girls who had gone inside.</span></div></div>",

As they acclimated to the gloom, they could see they were in the entryway for a long disused, ancient temple of some sort.  The large chamber they were in had a high ceiling, easily twenty feet, and statues of dragons, gryphons, and snakes lined the walls.  They could see remnants of ancient artwork painted upon the walls, but it was in too poor of condition to make much out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited silently for about ten minutes.  \"I guess she's not coming\" said Krystal, who continued, \"Let's move on then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, they walked across the marble floor.

A large hole in the left wall illuminated a chamber about thirty feet wide and sixty long.  In the center of the wall in the far end of the room they could see a great sculpture of a dragon's head and open maw, carved from a single block of marble.  A passage led away behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room's contents had been rearranged, along with a fair number of added bits of cloth and various twigs, into a large nest for a pair of large gryphons, and their eggs, which rested in the center of the room.  Strewn about the room outside the nest were countless, unidentifiable bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They seem to be asleep,\" noted June, who added, \"We need to get across to that passage back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!  What if they wake up?\" said Krystal, who was thinking that maybe Amelia had made the smarter choice by staying outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we have to try.  There's no other way!\" June countered, and then began to carefully tiptoe her way quietly across the room.  Krystal watched worriedly, knowing that without any weapons or any dragons to protect them there was no way they could defend themselves against the gryphons should they wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of careful sneaking, she made it to the maw-shaped portal on the other side of the room.  June turned and faced Krystal, silently gesturing her to make her way across.  Krystal crossed her fingers for good luck, and slowly began making her way across.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully she tiptoed across the room, being very cautious not to make any noises.  Even so, when she was about halfway across, she inadvertently stepped on a small piece of bone.  It made a quiet, almost inaudible crushing sound as she put her weight on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyrstal stopped cold, hoping the small noise would go undetected, but it was no use.  The larger of the two gryphons opened one eye, and fixed his gaze upon the intruder in their nest.  Krystal saw the gryphon awaken, and took off running for June as fast as she could.  The gryphon jumped to its feet with surprising agility, and let out a deafening, falcon-like screech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprinted for all she was worth toward June, while the gryphon behind her pounced, its beak opening wide as it descended toward her.  She was only a couple of feet from safety when the gryphon struck home, taking her head inside its beak and lifting her up off the ground.  Krystal shrieked in terror, and June grabbed on to her ankles, trying to pull her out of the beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon merely shook Krystal a bit, knocking June loose.  June scrambled back for the cover of the passage as the gryphon's mate, roused by the commotion, also pounced at her.  She could only watch at the gryphon sat up and lifted Krystal about five feet into the air, still flailing helplessly in the beak of the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon licked Krystal's face with its birdlike tongue, and made a pecking motion as it swallowed.  Her arms were forced to her sides as the gryphon's beak advanced to her breasts, which one hung one on each side of its beak.  Her head disappeared down the gryphon's throat, which began to bulge slightly as it cut off her shrieks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the sudden, eerie silence, the beast held her there for a moment, then made another pecking motion, taking her in up to her midsection.  Her hands, just outside its beak, clenched and grabbed in vain, and the gryphon's neck bulged out more, clearly showing her shapely, wriggling outline.  It raised its head, lifting her kicking legs high into the air, until they were almost brushing the ceiling, and made yet another pecking motion, this time taking her in all the way to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune could see Krystal still struggling inside the gryphon's extremely swollen throat.  The gryphon, however, didn't seem bothered by this at all as it simply pecked into the air again, this time taking in all but her feet, her toes still wriggling in the air.  It pecked again, and then even those were gone.  June watched, and saw the gryphon finally close its beak as the bulge that had been Krystal descended into its belly and disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gryphon sat there for a moment, seeming to enjoy the feeling of its wriggling prey inside it, before giving June a disinterested look and returning to its nest.  Its mate followed, and they both laid down and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune knew she was all alone now, and there was only one way she could go.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>June walked down the passage and once again found herself shrouded in total darkness.  She felt her way along the walls, glad they were smooth at least, and she found the passage narrowed and curved sinuously about.  After about fifty feet or so she was brushing the walls with her shoulders, and she hoped it wouldn't narrow any further or she might have trouble getting through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't more than another twenty feet or so before the narrow corridor finally opened up into another chamber.  And what a chamber it was!  It was circular, easily a hundred feet in diameter, and looked as though it took up most of the building she was in.  A brightly glowing globe some three feet across was mounted to the ceiling in the exact center of the room, and provided illumination, and five dragon statues of various colors, life size, stood spaced evenly around the room, reared up on their hind legs with their mouths pointed toward a six-foot by two-foot altar directly under the glowing orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure what to do, so she cautiously approached the altar.  When she reached it she saw there was a human-shaped indentation on the altar, as well as a small pile of soft cloth where the head should go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess this is it!\" she said to herself, and then climbed up on the altar and lay down on it, resting her head on the soft cloths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, the eyes of all the dragon statues began to glow.  She saw the yellow dragon's mouth spark and crackle, and then yelped in pain as a bolt of lightning shot from the blue maw and arced over her body.  Her skin charred instantly, and then vaporized, revealing a new covering of shimmering, prismatic scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune caught her breath, and started to lift her head to see what was going.  Before she had even raised it an inch, however, the green dragon's mouth began to drip, and then spray a torrent of acid over her.  It sizzled and pitted the stone of the floor and the altar, but did not harm her.  It soothed her still smarting scales, and she found she was suddenly more thirsty than she had ever been in her life.  She drank and drank and drank, and she felt it burning terribly inside her as it ate away her human organs.  She felt strange inside as new, draconic organs instantly grew in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe joints on her arms reversed and they lengthened, and her legs grew stronger as well.  June felt uncomfortable as wings began to sprout from her back and a tail grown from her spine, and she turned herself over, lying down on all fours on her belly.  Her neck lengthened, and her head reoriented itself as it sprouted horns and her mouth extended into a long, slender snout.  She dug her new claws into the stone as spines sprouted from her back, and after a few minutes the stream stopped.  Thoroughly exhausted the new, small dragon collapsed onto the altar, just wanting to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the process was not complete.  Fire danced from the red dragon's muzzle, and then shot over and into her.  She felt her own fire kindle as thin wisps of smoke began to trail from her nostrils, and a desire more powerful than anything she had ever known took hold over her.  She moaned as she struggled to her feet and presented her hindquarters to the red station.  Fire surged into her new sex and filled her entire being, and she roared in ecstasy and the flame took hold of her.  With each immense orgasm she belched a huge gout of fire and grew larger, two or three feet each time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after a dozen climaxes, the statue's flame died out.  Now thirty-five feet long and larger than the statues themselves, June ripped the altar out of the floor and tossed it aside.  Completely spent from the bizzare passion, she lay down, hoping at last to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lay on the marred stone floor, and as she did so the black dragon statue's snout began to emit a stream of smoke over her.  She found its scent pleasing and breathed it deeply into her draconic lungs, and as she did so she felt her human instincts and emotions leave her.  She was a huntress, the Queen of an island of predators.  She desired treasure, and to consume all who were not worthy of her regal self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter several minutes, the black dragon stopped smoking, and the air cleared.  She was now the Queen of the dragons, but the process was still not complete.  The blue dragon statue began to stream water over her.  She found the sensation of water on her scales relaxing, and lay down in the stream, washing the bits of her previous self that were still clinging to her away.  As she did so, she felt the knowledge, the spirits, the very essences of the previous queens enter into her, become one with her.  She absorbed them all, retaining her own identity but acquiring the memories, thoughts, knowledge, and magic of those who had come before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was done.  All the statues were again silent, and the new Queen of the Dragons stood up, and shook herself.  With a small mental twist, she teleported herself outside of the temple, ready to take up her duties.  She needed to reestablish the rift, she needed a mate, but all that could wait, she just wanted to make a nest first, and rest for a little while.</span></div></div>",

A single shaft of light streaming down through a small hole in the roof provided some dim illumination, but after their time in the dark hallway it seemed as bright as daylight.  Another doorway led onward on the far side of the room, and on the floor, in the center of the beam of light, a small, blue dragon was sunning itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, isn't that the dragon Amelia was with earlier?\" asked Krystal.  \"I think it is,\" replied June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned its head toward them, then stood and stretched, looking not unlike a large, scaled cat as it dug its fore claws into the floor and opened its mouth in a wide yawn, and then shook itself and stood there, looking at the girls, who were still standing in the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems friendly enough.  And it was with Amelia earlier,\" Krystal said as she walked out into the room towards the dragon.  It nosed and licked her hand, and she beckoned to June, saying \"See, its friendly enough.  Come on, we still have to figure out how to become the Dragon Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune cautiously walked into the room, and as she did so, they felt the floor shake, and stone slabs fell down behind both doors, hitting the ground with a thunderous crash and kicking up broken pieces of tile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great, now what?\" Krystal said.  June tried to lift the slab behind her, but it was no use.  \"It won't budge, we need to find another way out it seems\" said June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal turned to try her luck with the slab at the far end of the room.  She did her best to lift it, grunting with the exertion.  Behind her, she heard June say \"Hey, I think he likes me, and, hey!  Down boy!\".  She turned as he heard June let out a tiny \"Oof!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal turned and saw June lying on the floor, the small blue dragon on top of her, enthusiastically licking her face and breasts.  \"What are you doing?\" Krystal said to June, who answered, \"He likes me, I think, and, ooh, that feels kinda good actually,\" she said as the small blue dragon's tongue darted over her breasts.  June blushed as they firmed up, and the dragon moved its tongue down her belly, licking her pussy a bit before moving on to give her thighs a complete tongue massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was a little miffed, and said \"Hey, are you going to help me find a way out of here or lie there and make out with your new friend?\" she asked, keeping the fact she was envious June was getting all the attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a moment, this feel so good,\" said June.  The dragon licked her feet a bit before slurping first her right, and then left foot into its mouth.  Its tongue continued its sensuous message as the dragon unhinged its jaws and began working its way back up her legs.  Its throat bulged and its belly swelled as her knees and thighs disappeared into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.. June.. the dragon's EATING you.  Aren't you going to do, well, do something?\" asked Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vermithrax told us only one of us would come out here.  And.. oooh!\" she moaned loudly as the dragon's tongue entered her pussy and began exploring inside of it.  \"You wouldn't believe how good this feels!  If I'm going to go this is how I want it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal sat down, watching, as June thrashed about, as best she could for being half-inside her unlikely lover.  The dragon slurped up her freely flowing juices as he brought her to climax again and again, keeping her in ecstasy for at least thirty minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, June tired, lying down on the broken tiles, panting in exhaustion.  The dragon resumed its slow advance, and her sex and belly slowly disappeared into the swelling dragon's belly.  June stroked and petted the dragon's muzzle and eyeridges, and when the dragon reached her chest she helped push her breasts into its maw.  \"I hope I'm as good a meal for you as you were a lover for me,\" she said dreamily.  She surrendered herself, laying back her head and closing her eyes.  The dragon advanced again, taking in her head, and then quickly slurping down her arms.  June gave a goodbye wave as the dragon finally finished her off and closed its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon was so swollen he almost resembled a ball, its claws barely touching the ground.  Krystal watched as his belly quickly settled down, and the dragon seemed to close its eyes and concentrate.  She watched as the ball began to shrink noticeably, and as it did so the dragon grew.  It only took about fifteen minutes, shorter than the time it took to consume its meal, for the bulge to be totally gone, and Krystal stood before a much larger dragon, who was now fifteen feet from snout to tail.  It sat up, now eye level with Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now what?\" Krystal asked.  The dragon nosed the door opposite the one the girls had entered through, and it silently slid open.  The now much-larger blue dragon nosed Krystal towards the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Krystal stepped through the doorway, a little uncertain of what would happen next.  The blue dragon followed, and they found themselves in a large chamber that seemed to take up most of the building.  Light spilled in through a large opening on the far wall, and like everything in this place it was in ruins.  A medium-sized dragon skeleton, perhaps thirty feet from snout to tail, lay in the middle of the room, and a dimly glowing orb perhaps six inches across was visible inside its ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to her new companion.  \"You mean we could have just walked around the building and come straight here?\"  The dragon seemed to nod, and then nosed her in the direction of the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal walked to the skeleton, and slid carefully between its ribs.  She reached down, and took the orb.  It began to glow brightly as she picked it up, and with a brilliant flash it quickly darted on its own to her sex and began to force its way inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe screamed in pain as it penetrated her, and once inside her she felt its power radiating into her.  She braced herself against one of the ribs to keep herself form collapsing, and she saw another flash, this time herself flashing, and then she felt oddly different as the pain subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her hands as she released the skeletal rib, she noticed they were different.  Green scales covered her hands, and her fingers were tipped with four-inch claws, and a few quick scratched on the ribs around her confirmed they were, in fact, razor sharp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see the same scales seemed to cover her whole body, and her feet now only had four enormously clawed toes, arranged much like a bird of prey's.  Krystal reached up with her new claws to check her face and found she now had a snout and a pair of stubby horns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon seemed somewhat bemused by all this, and after she had thoroughly checked herself out he said, \"Hello, my new queen.  My name is Tr'xel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you talk!\" she said, somewhat surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always could talk, but now you can understand the language of dragons,\" he answered, and continued, \"Vermithrax sent me in here to make sure one of you made the transition smoothly.  He was the chief adviser to the old queen, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had a hundred questions, and just started firing them off.  \"What am I supposed to do now?  Why did you eat June?  Why do I look different now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As the Queen of the Dragons, you can command all the dragons on the island.  Actually, on the dragon side of the rift, it's more like a peninsula, and there are some ogres making trouble on the south side of the island, but that can be dealt with later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I ate June first because I wanted you to be the Queen, and second because I wanted to be properly sized to you.\"  He nosed her gently, and continued, \"You see, us dragons can choose to grow or not to grow.  There are advantages here to being very small - larger dragons tend not to mess with you.  But you see, as the Queen, you are part dragon and part human.  The orb inside you has balanced the draconic and human energies in you exactly, which is why you have the shape of a half-dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, when you take a mate, the nature of that mate will shift the balance to one end or the other.  Take a human mate, and you will become much how you were before, almost indistinguishable, in fact.  Mate with a dragon though, and you will become like us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal listened, and thought about it a bit.  \"So, you want to be my mate?  I suppose all men think the same!\" she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wouldn't you like to be able to fly and breathe fire?  Or live for a thousand years?\" Tr'xel said.  He twined his tail slowly around hers, and said, \"What I did for June is nothing compared to what I can do for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are the ogres, but I guess they can wait.\"  Krystal giggled a bit as she lay down, still in the belly of the skeleton dragon, and pulled her new King on top of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... ... ... ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks later, Krystal surveyed her territory from her new cliff top nest.  It had taken her a little while to adjust to having wings and walking on all fours, but she felt she was doing quite well.  Besides, she loved how her deep blue scales matched the sky and how they shimmered in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ogres had been dealt with, and the dragons had eaten well.  She missed her old friends but knew it couldn't have been any other way.  Keira had hatched in her new form, a cute little black hatchling, and Amelia had become one with Vermithrax, who still acted as the Queen's chief adviser.  June was gone, but it had been her choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill lost in reflection, Krystal lay down, coiling her around her eggs.  She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep, hoping that perhaps some small piece of June's spirit would come to rest in one of them.</span></div></div>",

She enters the hole and a gulp is heard.  Moments later, the hole explodes in dust, and a huge dragon-bigger than Vermithrax-clambers out of the hole, a woman-shaped bulge traveling slowly down his throat.  He looks after the other girls and licks his lips.  Vermithrax turns around with a shock and says \"Gorilax! where have you been!?\" The two dragons embrace, and Vermithrax notices Amelia, just entering Gorilax's throat.  \"Hey, that one was supposed to be mine!\"  The girls, hearing this, turn towards them uneasily.

Besides, he had to know more about them, and only by consuming one of them - body, mind, spirit, everything - could he truly learn about them.  June had been quite enamored by him anyway, he hadn't even had to use any of his tricks to persuade her into voluntarily sublimating her own existence into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped to eye the remaining girls.  How delicious they looked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" asked Krystal, who about bumped into the dragon when it suddenly stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, nothing.  I'm just thinking about which one of you is best suited to become queen,\" he said.  Of course, he left out the part about how he was hoping that after he had absorbed their souls, he would be able to trick the ancient magics into granting him dominion over the island.  They would find out in due time.  Tonight, actually, if all went well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy midmorning they had reached the cave he was leading them too.  But he wanted them tired, so he veered around it so the girls wouldn't see, and led them on in great big circles through the jungle.  The girls followed, mostly in silence, but occasionally chattering amongst themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so tired!  When are we going to get there?\" Keira asked as the sun began to hang low in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"tomorrow, we're close.  But we will rest here for tonight.\"  Vermithrax pointed toward the cave, which they were coming 'round again.  \"You can rest in there.  We'll be safe tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the girls made beds of leaves and twigs, and as the moon began to rise they settled down and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple of hours, Vermithrax rose and went to the cave opening.  He inhaled deeply, and gently exhaled a voluminous cloud of dense smoke into the chamber.  The girls stirred, but did not wake as they inhaled his naturally drug-laden scent, and it lulled them into deep sleep with pleasant dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax took a deep breath to recharge, and exhaled again.  And again.  And again.  Eventually the cave chamber was completely filled with his fog, and he sat back to contemplate which girl he wanted first.</span></div></div>",

Her athletic body was firm and lean, and looked absolutely delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave her long lick, savoring her taste while he waited for her to rouse from her smoke-induced coma.  He was starving and could take her flesh whenever he wanted but he needed her spirit as well.  Vermithrax remembered when he was younger and not as large these human morsels were much more filling.  Not to mention more common - the island had supported a population of some thousands of them.  He supposed the dragon spirit was still annoyed with him for eating *all* of them and forcing the recruitment of Dragon Queens from off the island, but they had worshiped him as a living embodiment of the Dragon Spirit, and what greater honor could he bestow on his followers than allowing them to become one with him?  Besides, after tonight he would finally be able to take the title of Dragon Queen, or King, is his case, for himself if all went well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal stirred, then opened her eyes.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed, still groggy from the effects of his smoke.  She looked around, and asked, \"What am I doing out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to have a talk with you, away from the others.  I have big plans for you, you know.\" Vermithrax answered.  Krystal shivered in the cold air, and the dragon folded a wing over her, and exhaled a thin stream of his warm smoke over her.  \"Better?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much!  But, just what do you want to talk to me about?  Especially in the middle of the night?\" asked Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax turned his head around on his long neck and rested it on the ground in front of Krystal, and gazed into her eyes.  \"I need to know more about you.  Only one of you can become the Queen of the Dragons you know.  There's no sense in putting all of you in danger if we can determine who is most likely to succeed in the first place and only send them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gazed back at the dragon.  There was something vaguely mesmerizing about those giant orbs.  She reached out with her hand and gently massaged his eye ridges as she said, \"Well.. what do you want to know about?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax relaxed as she worked his eye ridges.  He always loved it when they did that, it made him almost sorry she was going to be in his stomach soon.  \"I need to know everything Krystal, and to do that I need to use an ancient magic, one I mastered long ago.\"  He flexed his neck slightly, and a bit more smoke began to stream from his nostrils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal inhaled its sweet scent, and felt herself slipping into a trance as she continued to gaze into the dragon's eyes.  She felt she could lose herself in those bottomless crimson orbs.  \"What do I need to do?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax thought back to her, \"When you feel my spirit around you, you need only surrender to it.  We will become as one, and I will be able to learn all that I must learn.  Now, lie down little one, and relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal laid down on the ground in front of Vermithrax's muzzle.  With a mental twist, he projected his own spirit around her and began to probe inside her mind, as he thought, \"Now, do you give yourself to me, little one?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small voice in the back of Krystal's mind warned her this might not be such a good idea, but in her deep, relaxed trance she paid it no heed.  \"Yes, I surrender myself to you.\" she thought back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax smiled as he took his willing prey's mind into his own.  She was so relaxed, so willing.  He displaced her thoughts with his, and integrated her memories into his own.  Mentally, he tugged on the remnants of her spirit, and they easily slid free of her body, glowing silvery-white in the night, with thin tendrils connecting both to Krystal's body and to the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another mental twist, he effortlessly severed the connections to Krystal's body.  The energy hung suspended in the air as Vermithrax sat up.  He opened his mouth and made a biting motion at the spirit energy, inhaling sharply as he did so.  Her soul entered him, and merged with his, and as it did so its human qualities vanished and it became entirely draconic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax broke his trance.  Krystal's mind and spirit had been assimilated into his own.  All that was left was to take her body as nourishment for his.  He licked over the inert body, thoroughly enjoying the taste, and then opened his mouth wide and pulled it in with his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his mouth, holding the girl's inert body body there. He hadn't had any humans, let alone such fine girls, in such a long time.  He savored the taste for a few minutes, then tipped his head back and swallowed.  He felt his throat bulge slightly as she went down, and felt pleasant after she landed in his stomach, although he was still plenty hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood up and strode back to the cave mouth.  Once there, he replenished the cloud of smoke within it before decided who he wanted to eat next.</span></div></div>",

He knew that was going to have to wait for quite a while though, as he still had to finish the task at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached into the cave, trying to decide who he wanted next.  \"Hmm.. that treasure hunter girl did have an interesting tattoo on her...\" he thought to himself as he carefully wrapped his talons around Amelia and pulled her out of the smoky cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax set her upon the ground, and now that she was helpless he got a good look at it finally.  A long, red, scaled neck came over her shoulder, its draconic head wreathing her breasts in tattooed fire.  Its tail snaked around her belly and its tip curled around her navel.  He nosed her on her side, and saw the rest of the dragon on her backside, wings spread wide in flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and thought to himself, \"A dragon-worshiper!\".  Of course, they always called themselves fans or kindred spirits or some such, but he liked them all just the same, as they always gave themselves to him without him having to resort to any trickery.  They were usually quite awed by the whole experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, that would have to wait a while.  He could tell he'd given the last two a bit too much smoke, as she was deeply under its spell and wouldn't rouse for a while.  He folded a wing over her to shield her from the wind and resigned himself to having to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour hours later, as dawn was just beginning to break over the island, Amelia finally stirred, and then opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you are finally awake!\" he thought to her.  She sat up, and looked around, saying \"Where am I?  Where the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keira is inside the cave.  I ate June and Krystal already,\" he thought back to her.  He laid his head down on the ground and fixed his hypnotic gaze on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" she said.  She was surprised, and wondered why she wasn't scared out of her mind.  She felt only a vague kind of relaxation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax seemed to pick up on this.  \"Don't be alarmed Amelia.  You're still under the effects of my breath.  It has a very intoxicating effect on non-dragons.\"  He breathed over her a bit to prove his point, and she felt a mild euphoric feeling come over her as she breathed it in.  It tasted very good, and she felt herself craving more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to eat me too?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe nodded.  \"Before we are done, you will beg me to eat you,\" he thought back to her, and continued, \"You see, all of you have the power in you to become the ruler of this island.  But only one of you actually can do so.  The others will become food, if not for the many creatures that live here, for the new Queen herself.  It has always been that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe placed his nostrils against her belly and blew more warm smoke over her, before beginning to work her breasts with his tongue.  He got a good taste of her, and she felt herself actually start to get turned on by the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled slightly.  \"And you don't think I have what it takes so you're just going to eat me know?\" she asked, pushing her breasts up against his tongue.  If she was going to go she may as well at least enjoy it a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have my own ideas.  You see, little one, long ago I learned how to consume not just the flesh, but the very souls of lesser beings than I.  When I do this I gain all their knowledge, thoughts, feelings, their very essence.  Including any magical abilities or powers they may have.  But... the creature must give herself to me willingly.\"  His eyes began to shimmer slightly, whirring through slightly different shades of crimson.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe withdrew his tongue from her breasts and opened his mouth.  Amelia stood up and leaned over his muzzle, getting a good lungful of the smoke streaming from his nostrils.  \"So, you want our spirits so you can become the ruler of the island yourself, huh?\"  She laughed, and then climbed into his mouth and lay down on his warm, wet tongue, knowing she was safe until she desired to be swallowed and consumed.  \"Why are you telling me all this?  Did the others consent so easily?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax closed his mouth around Amelia, and wrapped her in his tongue.  He sat up and thought back to her.  \"I did not tell them the truth as I have told you.  You bear the mark of a dragon-worshiper.  There is no need to deceive you, you will not refuse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia caught her breath as she started to get more than just a little turned on.  \"You mean this tattoo?  I was so into dragons when I was a teenager.  I used to have this dream.. that was a big dragon queen and slept on a huge pile of treasure every night.  I always did like treasure, that's why I got this tattoo and became a professional treasure-hunter, and.. ooh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moaned in pleasure as the tip of Vermithrax's tongue wound it's way around her leg and sensuously began to probe inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can grant your wish,\" he thought to her and he expertly began to thrust his tongue inside her, enjoying the taste of her juices as they began to roll on his tongue.  He tilted his head back and let them roll down his throat, thoroughly enjoying the taste.  \"After I have consumed you, your consciousness will become one with mine.  You will be a dragon, in the most literal sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his mouth, she surrendered herself to the lust the dragon was so expertly inciting within her.  She felt so good inside of him, like she had always belonged there.  Maybe she had.  She began to thrust her hips against the probing tongue, and grabbed hold of it, driving it deep inside of her.  She was amazed it could feel so good, like very gentle sandpaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax only smiled as he pleasured her, massaging her entire body with his tongue, still coiled about and inside her.  He felt her buck and heard her moan inside of him.  As she approached her climax he grinned evilly and withdrew his tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to be consumed, my little dragon-worshiper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, suddenly deprived of her passion felt an irresistibly powerful craving for him.  She desired to taste his smoke, she desired to feel him inside her, she desired to feel her inside of him.  \"Yes,\" she said.  \"Take me, please!\" she begged him, as she realized that only he could fulfill her deepest fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax inhaled sharply, and began to exhale a dense, smoky cloud through his mouth.  He cut it off sharply as he closed around her again, twin streams of dense smoke streaming from his nostrils.  He thrust the tip of his tongue deeply inside her, squeezing her as he did so with the coils around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drove her hips forward, wanting to feel all of that huge tongue in her, and screamed in delight as she reached her climax, her juices flowing freely into his mouth.  She felt very draconic herself as her lungs filled with the dragon's breath and she expelled it in turn, and kept driving herself upon him until she was thoroughly spent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt oddly peaceful as she relaxed, still inside the dragon's coiled tongue, and it still inside her.  She felt the dragon's presence around her, and Vermithrax said, \"It is time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe surrendered herself, and quickly felt herself being pulled free of her body.  The dragon's spirit felt warm and pleasant as it took her very being into himself, and she began to be aware of the dragon's body, her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" thought Vermithrax.  \"Now, feel your old self as I feel you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her body inside her new mouth, and was surprised that anything could taste so good.  She was so hungry too, and had to fight to keep from swallowing this little morsel, nicely stewed in its own juices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, take it.\" the dragon thought to her.  Needing no more prompting, she uncoiled her tongue and worked the body to the back of her new mouth, and swallowed it down hungrily.  It made a slight, but pleasant bulge in her throat and felt quite good in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she felt the dragon's mind come inside her own.  \"Now, become one with me.  Become me.\" he said hypnotically, and she found herself saying it along with him.  His thoughts became her thoughts, and her thoughts became memories of a person she once was, one of countless thousands who had made the same choice as she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax felt the familiar rush as her spirit joined with his, and once again broke his trance.  By now it was well into morning, but he knew Keira would remain under his spell until he pulled her out of his intoxicating cloud.</span></div></div>",

Vermithrax was glad she was finally awake - he was going to have to make this one a quickie, he hadn't eaten a real meal in a couple of days and he was starving.  A big dragon like him needed a lot of food, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to her feet and looked around for a moment, then looked up at Vermithrax who was lying down outside and said, \"Where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You slept rather late.  They went ahead of you already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!  Has one of them become the dragon queen already?\" she said indigently.  How dare they go off ahead and leave her behind?  It wasn't fair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.  Actually they were all eaten.\" he thought back to her.  \"That's why I'm still here.  You are the only human who can become the Dragon Queen now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" she said, kind of sad all her friends had become food but a little relieved she still had a shot at the big prize.  \"So, when do get going?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right now,\" he thought to her.  \"But, there is something we must do first.  Look into my eyes,\" he commanded her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira did as she was told, and as she gazed into his huge, crimson orbs she suddenly felt oddly relaxed and a little dizzy.  \"What are you doing?\" she whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentally beckoned her.  She walked to his head, still resting on the ground, and began to massage his eyeridges and snout gently.  He let out a soft myrrh, and exhaled a light stream of smoke over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An ancient magic.  There are many dangers on this island, little one.  I can make our minds as one.  You will know all I know, and I all you know, and you will know what must be done to become the Dragon Queen.  All you have to do is surrender yourself to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" said Keira.  \"Sure, do whatever.\"  She was rather enjoying the experience, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax smiled as he extended his own mind into her.  She jumped slightly when she felt his mind inside her.  She felt mildly curious as to what was happening as he displaced her thoughts with his.  Soon she too felt very hungry and slightly impatient, and shortly after that her mind was indistinguishable from the dragon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon sat up, and leaned his long neck over, taking Keira's inert body into his mouth.  He leaned his head back, gravity sliding her over his tongue to the back of his throat, where he swallowed, and as her body began to be processed into nourishment for him, he absorbed her very essence, her soul merging with his like a drop of water splashing into a vast ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped from his trance.  The girls were gone but their essence, and the magic to become the ruler of the dragons along with it, was now his.</span></div></div>",

He'd been guarding the place for centuries, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew toward the large mountain at the center of the island, and, once he caught sight of the huge but dilapidated marble structure, he slowly spiraled down and landed with a soft 'thwump' on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the roof, there wasn't much to see, but he knew where the orb lay within the building, so he padded over to where he figured he was just above it, then lifted his massive tail in the air, and brought its spike down hard on the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt struck home with a thunderous crash, and cracks appeared in the roof.  He lifted his tail and smashed it down again, and again, and again.  Finally, he heard the roof begin to crack and snap, and then, it suddenly gave way underneath him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scrambled for a foothold, not wanting to risk damaging his wings amidst all the debris, but it was no use.  He landed with a great splash in a deep pool of water, which, even when he was standing, came up almost to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax looked around.  He'd never actually been in the temple before.  It seemed to be all one room, and he was in a circular pool of some sort.  On an island in the center stood a small statue of a dragon, the orb of the Dragon Queen held in its maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stopped to behold the orb, the object of his quest.  Normally only a human girl with the magic to become the Queen could take it, but he was sure that with the magic he knew he could draw out the magic the girls had had from within him and take it for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he began to wade toward the orb.  The bottom of the pool seemed to covered in a good deal of muck and moving was difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he felt something brush against his leg, and before he could react an enormous serpentine head, easily four feet across, rose from the water and darted toward him.  Slowed by the water he could only roar and bite at the head as it, being in its own element, darted easily around his maw and latched onto his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt its powerful coils begin to snake around him.  Vermithrax was mildly annoyed, usually he could easily dispatch such a beast but there was the small matter of being stuck in the mud.  He wasn't worried though, as a plan was already beginning to form inside his scaled head.</span></div></div>",

Vermithrax grunted slightly, he massive, ancient bulk could withstand such force but not for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled to himself as the serpent threw coil after coil around his body.  He had the skills of a hundred wizards, after all, and one of them had been quite adept with electricity.  He waited, tolerating the ever-tightening squeeze, until the serpent had him completely encoiled.  With a mental twist, he sent a mighty electric discharge over his scales and into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serpent convulsed, and, mere seconds later, it was over.  The serpent loosened its coils around him and began to float unconscious in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax freed himself from the serpent, thinking to himself, \"Finally, some food!\".  He could barely contain himself as he grasped the serpent's head in his own jaws and began to greedily wolf it down.  His throat enlarged as he took it in, and as sixty feet and thousands of pounds of giant serpent disappeared down the dragon's gullet his belly began to expand in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later he finished his meal and resumed moving toward the orb.  His belly drug along the muck, reminding him he wouldn't be able to fly until he slept off his meal, but he didn't mind, as he wouldn't have to eat again for at least a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he pulled himself up out of the water and stood before the orb.  The dragon statue it was encased in was much smaller than he, sized for the human girls that had always pulled the orb from its maw and claimed it for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mental twist he summoned the energies that had belonged to the girls from within him and projected them around the orb.  It began to glow brightly, varied colors whirling within it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was preparing to take the orb for himself, the Dragon Spirit suddenly appeared before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, ancient one!  You can not do this, it is an abberation of nature!\" she commanded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax chuckled.  \"What would you have me do then, goddess?\" he asked her in the language of dragons.  \"This place has been severed from both our world and that of humans, and the girls are all gone.  If I don't do this, we will float in limbo forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Spirit shimmered in the gloom, spirit energy rising from her like wisps of smoke.  \"Perhaps it is better that way.  All you live for anymore is to consume.  You consumed the humans that used to live here.  You consumed the entire nation that used to border this place.  You consumed all who came to consort with you from our world.  You consumed the girls who should rule you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax regarded her and said, \"I am a dragon.  The oldest dragon.  The greatest of all living creatures.  Why would anything not want to be consumed by me?\" he asked, genuinally puzzled.  \"There are billions of unhappy humans in the world the girls came from.  Once the rift is open once more, I will give them happiness.  I will allow them to become one with the greatest creature in existence!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon spirit knew it was hopeless, and that she had to stop this deranged dragon from eating the human race to extinction.  But she had a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not stop you,\" she said to him.  \"Take my spirit.  With it, you can become a true dragon god.  Perhaps then you will see the folly of your plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax looked at the Dragon Spirit.  He knew it was a trick, but he also knew if he could trick the trickster, he really would become a god.  He was supremely confident in himself though.  After all, with the experiences of countless thousands within him, he had seen every trick there was, and even some that weren't.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Vermithrax regarded the Dragon Spirit.  'Foolish goddess' he thought.  Foolish, but still immensely powerful, her spirit was far more powerful than his, even though it was greatly augmented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe regarded the Dragon Spirit, still hovering there, waiting for him.  Mentally, he reached out, and then with all his power invaded her mind.  He felt her defenses lash out against his own mind, ready to engage in a battle of wills he could not possibly win.  So he didn't fight it, instead he ducked under her consciousness and with a swift mental twist removed her desire to fight him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly robbed of her motivation, she thought, \"Oh, this isn't fair!\"  Vermithrax only chuckled and said, \"But it is, foolish goddess.  Now join with me, become one with me, I will show you what it means to truly be a god!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he opened his mouth and mentally pulled on his newest conquest.  Being a purely spirit being, she began to move toward him, and and as she did so she began to lose her shape and stream into his waiting mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax caught his breath as he assimilated her.  Such power!  It was almost corporeal, and as her essence streamed into him he found himself literally drinking it.  He continued to pull, suppressing her thoughts as he did so, and replacing them with his own.  Soon nothing remained of the Dragon Spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVermithrax stood there for a while, acclimating to the new power within him.  He had been powerful before but only an insect compared to what he was now.  His crimson eyes became little flames, and with each breath he exhaled a dense cloud of smoke.  His scales become dark, impossibly dark, seeming to suck the very light from the space around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new god turned toward the dragon statue, and gently took the orb in a foreclaw.  He raised it to his mouth, and bit down hard on it.  The orb shattered, and released its energy in one explosive burst.  Vermithrax merely swallowed, not even having to bother with finesse anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith yet another mental twist he re-established the rift between worlds, and then took to wing, bursting through the ceiling of the temple.  As he flew into the world of the humans, the first dragon in 500 years to do so, he felt the energy inside of him pushing outward.  He felt uncomfortable, and began to grow larger to relieve the stress, finally stopping once he reached about two hundred feet in length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon he found himself flying high above a beach in a land called California.  The wretched creatures didn't see him, and he felt sorry for them.  They were so puny and weak and.. well.. small.  But Vermithrax would fix that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his wings in and went into a steep dive.  The people on the beach looked up.  Some ignored him, some did a double-take, not believe what they were seeing.  None tried to run though as the dragon exhaled a huge blast of fire over them, incinerating their bodies instantly.  As their frail bodies died Vermithrax pulled their spirits into himself, no longer needing their permission to absorb them.  In a few minutes the beach was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flew inland, and found himself over a vast city.  By now people had become aware of him and were hiding, but he could feel their spirits.  He pulled with all his newfound might, and countless millions of human souls began to flow into him.  He could hardly believe what was happening himself as he consumed their spirits, leaving their bodies, far too many to handle or even count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he took more and more humans, he continued to grow.  Soon he was the size of a skyscraper, and as he moved north, leaving a swath of dead, soulless husks behind him, he grew and grew until he was the size of a mountain, and then a city, his wings covering the sky from horizon to horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a few hours he had devoured the souls of the entire nation and grown so large that his body stuck outside the atmosphere when he sat up, and the smoke from his breath was beginning to encircle the entire world.  He lay down, his massive, three-hundred mile long body crushing countless former communities as he did so, and rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later he woke, and knew what he had to do.  He took wing, flying high above the Earth, where there was no air to fly through, going purely on the power of his vast spirit and looked down.  It would be a tough fit, but he was sure he could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he opened his mouth and unhinged his jaw, and slowly began to work his jaws around the entire Earth.  He willed himself to grow as he did so, and slowly mountains, cities, countries, oceans, the entire world began to pass through his jaws.  Vermithrax sucked the life force out of everything as he did so.  Grass turned brown, animals and plants died, and people stopped lifeless even as they beheld his colossal teeth.  He absorbed them all, happy to be able to grant them eternal life as a part of the greatest, largest dragon who had ever lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later his jaws finally closed again, and he swallowed, his massive throat sending the entire world to his stomach, where it was swiftly digested, processed into pure energy for a cosmic dragon.  Vermithrax looked around at the universe he was in, and saw countless stars, and surely some of them had worlds, worlds that he would consume until all of existence had become one with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at a nearby star.  Nearby was a relative term of course, it would still take many years to reach it.  But it seemed like a good place to start.  With that, Vermithrax beat his wings against nothing, and started flying through the void to his next meal.</span></div></div>",

The moon was blocked by the mountain and it was nearly impossible to see the blue dragon. He himself realized this a came to a halt. Then he motioned Amelia to settle down in a small whole in the ground. It then lay on top of Amelia. \"What are you trying to do!?\" Amelia struggled under its weight. The blue dragon looked at her as if to say,' I can of course come off and let you freeze to death.\"<br>\r\nAmelia stopped struggling and tried to grab some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning she woke up to be cold. The blue dragon had disappeared. Amelia started to panic, she looked out of the hole she was in. It was large field full of flowers. The most beautiful flowers she had ever seen. No treasure she had found beat the beauty of them. As she starred at them a blue figure suddenly appeared from the flowers. The blue dragon came along with and spat a bunch of berries in front of Amelia. \"Eat,' he growled to her. \"What! These things have been inside you, are you kidding me!,' she shouted. The blue dragon looked insulted. Amelia felt bad. \"I'm sorry, I'm just not used to this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the berries were familiar, such as strawberries and blue berries. Some; however, were completely new to Amelia. She ate them anyhow becuase she trusted the blue dragon. They continued through the sea of flowers. Suddenly the blue dragon pounced on Amelia and kept her pinned to the ground. Amelia realized that the blue dragon was trying to defend her for infront of them was a violet dragon. It was four times the size of Amelia. How could the blue dragon stand a chance against such a thing. The scarlet dragon started walking away from the. The blue dragon let go of Amelia, asuming the scarlet dragon only came in intrest to see what they were and helped her up. \"Thanks, you saved me again,' Amelia said and hugged the blue dragon. It blushed a little, but then the scarlet dragon's tail suddenly, grabbed Amelia around her legs, pulled her towards it, through her in the air and she started falling right towards its waiting maw.</span></div></div>",

Amelia was expecting a wet landing, but instead hit the ground. She dared to look up and what she saw was the impossible of impossible. The blue dragon had sunk its teeth into the violet dragon's tail and was now swinging it around and around. Then it smashed it from side to side on the ground. The swinging started again and Amelia saw as the violet dragon flew some distance from them, landing hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia starred, mouth open at the blue dragon. He; in the other hand, came up to Amelia, grabbed her with his jaw and threw her on his back. He continued transporting her for the next two hours not letting go of her arms. Amelia had no choice, but to let him do it his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the end of the flower sea and came to a rocky landscape. \"Rocks, rocks, rocks,' Amelia complained,' don't tell me this is our path.\" The blue dragon motioned her to look more carefully. Amelia did as told and realized that he rocks were swarming with riches. Diamonds, emeralds, rubies and other rocks completely knew to her. She of course thought she had died and come to heaven. Amelia advanced towards the nearest treasures, but the blue dragon snatched her arm and stopped her. Amelia was about to ask what's wrong with you when the dragon spirit popped in front of her and scared her to death. \"You are very fortunate, young lady. This friend of yours is a very special and rare type of dragon. As you saw earlier, he defeated a dragon with more power than ten of his kind. Though they are weak and small, they become very dangerous if they see someone they love in danger.\" Amelia looked down at the blue dragon who quickly blushed. \"Now, this place in front of you,' the dragon spirit continued,' is one of the most dangerous places on this island. It easily attracts the weak hearted who then never come back.\" Amelia protested,' I'm not weak hearted!\" The dragon spirit said,\" Oh, aren't you. The treasure hunter who sacrificed her best friend in-able to raid the tomb of Ramses the II. The greedy one who left her brother to suffer in the heart of a volcano to reach the worlds largest oil foundation. The infamous girl who stole her partners oxygen bottle in the underwater cave when she wanted all the honor of exploring the cave herself. You are a selfish, greedy creature with no respect for others around you. Don't you call this weak hearted?\" Amelia sobbed,' how do you know all this?\" \"I think I know those who enter my domain,' the dragon spirit said,' and one more thing. Don't trust anyone in there except your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon spirit disappeared and Amelia looked at the blue dragon who was entering the rocky region.

Amelia walked between its arms and it closed them, pressing Amelia against its chest. Then it grabbed Amelia between its claws and placed in the nest. It climbed in the nest after that, lay down and wrapped its tale around Amelia. It moved her right under its belly and let go.

She tried to free herself but the fit inside the dragon's throat was very tight and she could barely move.  Despite the uncomfortable-looking bulge in its throat the dragon seemed to be enjoying itself, and it lazily swallowed again, taking her in all the way to her shapely calves.  Another swallow and Amelia was on her way to the dragon's stomach.  She struggled in panic as she felt the stomach acids begin to eat away her skin and flesh, but it was no use and she quickly passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later she was rather surprised to wake again.  The first thing she noticed was the pain in her leg was gone, and the second was that she was inside something, something very small.

We waited forever outside the cave, but you never came out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you were with the others?  What happened to them?\" Amelia asked.

Would you like to join them?  I can offer you so much more than that... hatchling... you are with now,\" he thought to her with obvious disdain for Amy.

She rode the dragon's tight but comfortable throat down to the stomach, and relaxed in the tingling stomach bath as darkness took her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amelia woke again the next morning, and once again broke out of her egg.  She noticed the shells were starting to make quite a mess in the nest, she would have to clean that up.  Amy was lying down, coiled around the nest.  She raised her head and looked at Amelia when she heard the noise of her pet hatching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, pet.  I shouldn't have taken you to a dragon gathering quite so soon.  For now, just try and get settled in,\" Amy said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd settle in she did.  As the days passed Amelia cleaned up, and even decorated the nest a bit.  Amy taught her all about the Dragon Kingdom, as the place she was in was called.  It existed at a nexus between two worlds, a world of magic and fantasy, at which the Kingdom was at the end of a long peninsula, and the world of humans, in which the Kingdom formed a small island that phased in and out of existance at various places around the globe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy taught Amelia the language of the dragons.  In that language, her name was really Amee'xa, and as time wore on Amelia grew to be able to speak the language almost as good as a real dragon.  Amy was only fifty years old, quite young for a dragon, barely into puberty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was true to her word though.  Every day she ate Amelia, and every morning she was reborn from the dragon's magic, whole and healthy, no matter what had happened the previous day.  Even when she broke her neck, and when she eaten by a giant snake, Amelia ate her corpse, or the snake, and she was perfectly healthy the next day.  And as the years wore on she never aged either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia learned there were certain herbs and roots that grew around the island that the dragons had a liking for.  Amy was delighted when Amelia began to use them as spices, carefully rubbing them into her hair and skin, and even bathing with them, or smoking herself with them.  As her taste improved, their daily ritual became longer and more involved.  Some days Amy licked Amelia all over, savoring her fantastic taste, before finally swallowing her down, something Amelia enjoyed immensely.  Other days they would engage in mock-hunts, with Amelia tearing all over the nest, with Amy blowing little wisps of fire around her ankles before finally greedily wolfing Amelia down.  If the winters became too cold for Amelia, Amy would gently eat her every day as soon as she hatched until it was warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough it all though, Amy never bit down.  She didn't want her pet to suffer.  As Amelia grew more confident Amy would allow her to venture further from the nest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so one day, after many years had passed, Amelia was steeping herself in a bath of sweetroot juice.  It had taken her a month to gather enough roots to fill the crude tub she had created for herself, and she hoped Amy would appreciate her efforts.  Amy had been gone most of the day, and Amelia knew she should be returning soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a few minutes later Amelia heard the familiar wing beats, and the soft 'twump' as her master landed.  Amy looked at Amelia, who was busy working the sticky substance into her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you making tonight, my pet?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert.  I hope you like it.\" Amelia said, grinning.  \"Tonight is our ten-thousandth you know.  I wanted to make it special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grinned back her pet.  \"Yes, indeed it is.  I had something special planned myself.  But first let's see how dessert tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grasped Amelia in a foreclaw and lifted her out of her bath, and gave her a long, slow lick on the sole of her left foot.  \"Mmm!  Delicious!  I think it needs some juice though.\"  With that she lifted Amelia and put her back in the back in the sticky bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia giggled when Amy began to probe her womanhood with her tongue.  Juice, indeed!  She lifted her left, then right legs and thrust them on either side of her master's tongue, giving Amy a nice dose of sweetroot as her juices began to dribble, and then flow freely onto Amy's tongue and mixing with the sweet, sticky juice in the tub.  She moaned, softly at first, and then louder and faster as her master pleasured her.  At her moment of climax, Amy scooped her up in her jaws, along with a healthy portion of the sweetroot juice, and wrapped her tongue around her orgasming pet, savoring the flavor for a good few minutes while Amelia caught her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day ended for Amelia as had all the others, with Amy tilting her head back, her powerful throat muscles taking her pet in, and giving her a wonderfully smooth, tight ride down to her stomach, separating her life-force from her body, allowing it be born anew the next day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight was their ten-thousandth.  Almost thirty years.  And Amelia had been such a wonderful pet.  Tonight would be different, tonight Amee'xa had different plans for her pet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amelia grunted as a sudden sharp rock caught her foot. She braced her chest with her arms as she fell facedown onto the rock floor. Grimacing as her garnet hair fell over her face, her eyes widened as she felt the warm breath of the dragon on her back. Although she tried to keep her body as still as possible, she knew the most that feigning death could do was assure that her body wouldn't be chewed before she got eaten. There was no way to escape anymore. She felt a strange tickling sensation as the dragon's snout moved across her skin, its teeth and gums tracing a thin line of saliva over her shoulders and spine. Raising her head, she saw the little blue dragon turn its head in despair, watching her helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really screwed, I guess,\" she thought to herself. Her nerves then tingled as she felt the hot air from the predator trace down her legs to her feet. Reaching forward, she tried to look for something to grab onto. Her fingers clamped onto the edge of a rock at the same time she heard the dragon's maw opening behind her. She gasped as the warm and moist tongue brushed against the soles of her feet, instilling a distinct sense of stimulation. Gripping hard, she felt the tongue wrap around her ankles, pulling her backwards. Amelia turned her head back for one second, and saw the vast gaping jaws of the dragon wide open behind her, the deep and dark gullet at the back, a thick tunnel of muscles leading to certain death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more and more Amelia thought about the tongue licking her feet, the more she felt strangely stimulated. She tried to suppress a giggle as the tongue extended forward, coiling up one of her thighs and running across the space in between her two thighs. \"Is it trying to tongue-rape me or something?\" she thought. The saliva soaking her skin and the tongue grinding across her womanhood made her weaken. Her hold on the rock outcrop loosened. Amelia then raised her head and closed her eyes as she climaxed, a rush of juices flowing out from between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon's firm but gentle jaws then extended, fastening around her knees. Feeling herself being tugged backwards, Amelia lost her grip on the rock. She sighed helplessly as the dragon slowly raised her into the air, holding her up with its tongue, prepared to utilize gravity to send her into its belly. The little blue dragon watched on in confusion as a smile formed on the girl's lips. At the moment, Amelia could think of nothing except the tongue that was pleasuring her and coiling around her naked body. She felt the desire to be swallowed; she wanted to enter the stomach now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moan escaped her lips as the dragon's jaws opened to let her slide in further, the warm and wet interior of the mouth slowly encompassing her body. Her orgasm hit another peak as the strong throat muscles caressed her womanhood, squeezing her legs downwards. Feeling the teeth fasten against her shoulders, she turned her head around to gaze at the world one last time. She had learned that her body accepted being swallowed alive and whole as an erotic experience. The feeling of slowly being enveloped and pulled into a tight and encompassing blanket of flesh was arousing in nature to her. Unfortunately for her, being swallowed into the stomach entailed being digested as well, the ending of her life. She resigned herself to her fate, knowing that she would experience quite a bit of pleasure before her digestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jaws around her shifted open as the throat gave another swallow, sinking her body further down the dragon's deep gullet. Amelia watched as the teeth rimmed maw closed above her head, leaving her in the dark, crimson interior, her body halfway within the muscular esophagus. She kicked her legs against the tight surface of the throat as she was driven to yet another orgasm. Her heart pounding rapidly, she closed her eyes and waited for the final gulp that would send her body plummeting into the stomach. The heat of the dragon's mouth, the tongue licking her cheek and neck, all indicated that her digestion was imminent. But after a minute of waiting, there still was no response. Somewhat to her disappointment, the dragon was hesitating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the delicious girl squirm halfway in its mouth, halfway in its throat, the dragon was contemplating an issue. The girl was so delicious, and so cooperative near the end, it was beginning to think it would regret eating her. Perhaps it could regurgitate her for now, and maybe she would be willing to temporarily be its sex toy. It would finish her whenever it got bored. But for now, what was it going to do with her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep within the dragon's maw, Amelia writhed in pleasure at the pulsating throat that enveloped her lower body and the thick tongue that rubbed her upper body with saliva. Her cheeks were wet with the oral fluids, her long garnet hair clinging to her face. She was a little bit upset that the dragon hadn't swallowed her completely, but the sensual throat was enough to drive her to multiple climaxes as it continued to squeeze her between her legs. The pleasure had taken over her mind; she could only wait in suspense for the dragon to decide her fate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon slowly lied down on its belly, its maw still drooling with saliva and vaginal juices as the thin bulge in its throat continued to writhe about. Making the decision would be very hard. On one side, the human girl was very tasty and pretty; he could have a lot of fun with her. But on the other side, he was very hungry and wanted to eat something right now. The little blue dragon could remedy that, but he didn't have the taste for cannibalism. Besides, the girl's squirming about his throat was beginning to drive him crazy; he wanted to have that inside his belly. Tasting her cheeks, neck, and shoulders increased the amount of slobber that dropped from his jaws. But she was so promising as his toy...but what did he really want at the moment?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia's disappointment began to increase. \"The dragon is hesitating for a reason,\" she thought with a sigh. \"Perhaps it isn't going to swallow me after all.\" She closed her eyes and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden growl echoed from deep within the dragon's empty stomach, indicating the twisting of hunger from the dragon. Amelia felt a flood of orgasmic fluid flow from between her legs as the stomach groaned beneath her. At first she gasped, but she then formed a delighted smile on her face as she knew exactly where she was going. She moaned as her climaxing ensued; the throat opened and pressed down hard against her breasts, sliding down to her shoulders. Amelia revelled in the reality that she was about to be swallowed whole, with no way to halt her way down, no way to prevent her from her fate. She smiled one last time as the throat muscles squeezed over her pretty face, feeling the strong flesh pressed her soaked hair against her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the dragon tilted its neck up as a mass of drool spilled down its chin, giving one massive swallow, forcing the bulge downwards. As the writhing bulge shifted towards its stomach, an ominous gulp sounded and the bulge flattened into the dragon's massive belly. The growling of the dragon's stomach ceased as Amelia was swallowed into the stomach of the predator, filling the emptiness with food. Lying curled into a fetal position, Amelia felt the slimy, elastic surface of her prison prod her skin with a million tentacly villi, every convulsion squeezing and caressing her body with a surge of digestive juices. The heat of the stomach would usually be unbearable to Amelia, but she was completely lost in her climaxes, her slit still releasing juices in a never-ending orgasm. She sighed as her body faded to oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little blue dragon had long gone by then. The great dragon lay its head down softly, dropping off into a gentle snore as the human girl wriggled about within its stomach. It still regretted swallowing her, but it was necessary for it to satisfy its hunger. The dragon was then woken the next day by the growling of its stomach, Amelia having been completely and utterly digested.</span></div></div>",

Yet Luck seemed to hate they as they only ended up, crashing in to some sort of wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue dragon groaned softly getting up on it's four legs and check to see if Amelia was ok. The girl was all right but still in shock of the crash. \"ugh uh ... someone .. caught the number of that bus?\" she said groggily. The blue dragon looked over her and saw the large dragon getting up, yet they were safe cause from were they had ducked in was a too small of a tunnel, a good size for them only at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill the blue dragon wounder what they had run in too. Looking back at the 'wall' to see what it was, his dragon eyes grew wide as he came face to face with a huge snake. What they had run in too was part of it's coils. The snake it's self had woken up from a nice dream but seeing two little snacks, it was like a dream come true. \"Ooohhh... you both look ssssso tasssty\" It hissed. \"mm... I think I will ...eat the baby dragon first\" it added, making the little dragon backed away and bumped between Amelia's legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet, when the snake say this, it smirked a evil grin. \"or... have you both\" it hissed stricking forward with open jaws. The blue dragon yipped and tried to breath fire at it yet it was too weak and afride to get a small fireball going. Soon enought the gaint snake had whraped it's jaws around his head, neck and the girl's lower legs. When she finally got her barings she groaned and looked down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"little blue?\" she said nick naming it for now, she gasped seeing the snake starting to engulf him and her at the same time. \"AAHHH!!!\" she screamed out in shock and started to struggle, trying to pull out and her friend as well. \"Let go of us!!\" she yelled. Yet the snake didn't want to pass up free and tasty meals. It opened it's jaws, taking a hard gulp and pushed both of them further inside. Flicking it's tongue out underneath them both, it felt really weird and Amelia couldn't help but shudder at it. \"Eeewwww!!\" she cried out, struggling some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother powerful gulp and the snake had wrapped it's scaly lips around the dragon shoulders and her kneecaps. \"Don't fight it... just acsssept it\" it said but she wouldn't understand, even if she could, the girl would still fight to the bitter end. Which is what she will do. The girl wiggled none stop feeling those lips work up her body. slowly sliding there way over her form once it had took another huge gulp pulling the blue dragon ahead. She couldn't help as a little bit of tears weld up in her eyes seeing her friend budge the snake's neck and travel in to it's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to become desprit, she reached out and grabbed what she could get her hands on. What she had grabbed was a rock and now she started to hit it over the head of the snake, again and again. It was all pointless as it just swallowed up and over her legs and waist, giving her butt a few gnawing motions to feel it around in it's jaws. Amelia blushed then started to hit it again with the rock. \"stop it you sicko!\" she screamed then yelped when it's jaws heaved her forward now taking in her abdomen. If she didn't do something soon, she might end up as a snack just like the little blue dragon.</span></div></div>",

The snake swallowed over her plump mounds taking in it's time. The muscles of the mouth and throat squeezed together over her body, lending it's head forward, cracking it's jaws to fit her shoulders in nicely. Amelia could only watch and stare as those hungry jaws stretched over her shoulders, over her neck and finally opening it's jaws wide enough to slide over her head where it closed it's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver her head and just let it's throat work her down like a piece of dead meat.

She thought it would never end until she had entered threw another opening, must be the splinter that allowed her in the belly. She ended up bumping in to Blue who started struggled and yelped of another person inside wit him. \"easy! easy little guy it's just me\" she spoke to him.

Amelia wanted to protest, but the blue dragon looked at her as if to say,\"trust me\". As they reached the forest the sun was almost settled. The blue dragon lead Amelia under a thorny bush. Amelia was having trouble with the bush, but made it with a few cuts. Suddenly, the blue dragon pinned her. It was very strong for its size. It started blowing smoke in Amelia's face, Amelia squirmed under the blue dragon, but found herself becoming very weak. Soon she passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning Amelia woke up with the blue dragon shaking her. It had brought some strange fruit she hesitated to eat. After the night before Amelia had lost trust to the blue dragon.<br>\r\n\"...thank you... buddy\", Amelia muttered to the dragon.<br>\r\n\"Your welcome\", the blue dragon said to Amelia. Amelia fell into silence. She had just understood it. \"I see you are confused\", the blue dragon continued. I hope last nights events didn't brake your trust in me. I am sorry for such a harsh move, but to be able to go further with you I had to do it. See, as a dragon is born, it is blessed by the dragon spirit by a gift. The gift you get depends completely on what you are like. I was blessed with the ability to make another living creature understand and talk to me. There are a variety of different gifts. Some are very rare, such as the ability to mind control and shrink. These abilities are only given to the ones born to be wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelie had eaten the fruit. She didn't say anything for a while. She finally pulled herself together and asked,\"what now?\"<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to put on this shirt and pants I've made for you.\" The blue dragon showed Amelia a shirt made out of hay. The pants were also made out of hay. \"Don't worry, its a very tough material which I have used, it will withstand harsh environment for sometime. Now, we must move, however. It's dangerous to dwell too long in these parts. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, however, wasn't sure about the blue dragon yet. Her trust hadn't returned. Amelia's trust...</span></div></div>",

The dragon openned its jaw. Amelia looked in. She could see sharp teath and its tongue led to the back of its throat where the uvula was. Suddenly, the dragon made an odd move. Its tongue made a gesture like wave for her to come in.<br>\r\n\"I wonder if this is a good idea after all\", Amelia thought, but it was too late to say no.

This tree is ancient and has seen thousands of years. It is the king of this forest. All the plants and trees here are under its control. It mostly stays out of others buisness, but in imergancies it can do terrible things. It protects us and we in the other hand help it. The reason I was so far out in the island is that this tree requirs once a millenia a drop of a certain kind of water. Now eat,\" Buddy handed Amelia some fruit,\"This tree provides many things.\"<br>\r\n\"Why aren't the two others you're with so sure about me\", Amelia asked.<br>\r\n\"Well... they...,\"Buddy hesitated,\" they fear you will mess everything up with your lack of patience, control of fear and other aspects which makes us so good in stealth.

Then it pulled Amelia even higher into the ever green. Amelia struggled, she was panicing. Soon the tree wrapped Amelia completely out of sight. Amelia started to get visions, they felt really. In one vision she saw Buddy being ripped up. Amelia screamed, she wanted to get out, but couldn't. Then Amelia saw Krystal running towards the dragon crown. Amelia stressed and started running too, but she tripped, saw her opponent grab the crown. Then many dragons cheered. Leaving Amelia lying on the floor. Amelia panic again.

Finally, Buddy picked Amelia up by the legs in his foreclaw and lifted her over his snout. Then he slowly openned it and dangled Amelia over it. She got a good view of his mouth, the last thing she would acually see. Buddy brought his tongue towards Amelia. He gave her a small lick.<br>\r\n\"You taste suprisingly good\", Buddy said.<br>\r\nHe started licking her all over. He tore off the nice pants and shirt he had made himself for her. All this time Amelia was enjoying it. She licked the feeling of Buddy's tongue dragging against her tiny body. Buddy's stomach growled even harder now.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready?\" Buddy asked.<br>\r\n\"I guess so\", Amelia answered.<br>\r\nBuddy brought her slowly down towards his waiting mouth. Amelia could see his throat ready fro the swallow. Amelia was now inside Buddy's mouth and he let go. Amelia dropped into his throat and he swallowed a loud gulp. Amelia slid down into Buddy's stomach where she splashed around in the gastric juice and thought happily to herself that she had pleased the only friend she had on this island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon spirit chatted with the tree. The dragon spirit said,\"It was unfortunate for her to be a treasure hunter, though she had skill, her gread for treasure made her weak.\"<br>\r\nThe answered,\"I knew all along that she would fail.

This island is about the size of the place your kind call Africa.\"<br>\r\n\"How...\"<br>\r\n\"Nobody has ever found this place because it is the gate between your world and the dragon world. From both sides, creatures have entered by accident. Unfortunatly, those from your world are in grave danger because the dragon world has a lot more powerful creatures. However, if your kind and the dragons find a permenant entry way, this place could turn into a bloody battle ground. The strength of dragons and the weaponary of your kind are an equal match. This tree, The Evergreen Oak as it is called, though it has no less trates as any other tree. Me at it are one of the guardians of the island. The Evergreen Oak looks over all the living creatures when I make sure the portals that open, close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't all these creatures leave, don't you allow them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There hasn't been a dragon queen for two and a half centuries. Without one, portals open randomly and not even I can predict them. When a dragon queen is crowned, she then holds the portals shut and can open one whenever she wants. Most the dragon queens have been weak and have not been able to hold this island in order. They either go mad or meet their fate in some kind of revolt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... why don't you help them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The most I can do is give them small pieces of advice and give the a starting push like I'm giving you.

If a spirit or supernatural thing offers its help to get you on the throne, reject. Now you must continue your journey, however. Your companion is waiting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words the tree placed Amelia to the ground, next to Buddy. They started off. Buddy no longer lead. Amelia had to find the way. At first she felt uneasy about choosing the direction, but then she remembered what she had heard in a movie \"If you can't find the way, then no one can\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some travelling, they reached the root of the mountain.

Amelia place the first scorpion and rested for a second. She had never had to climb such a cliff. Was it even possible that nature formed such things as the cliff she was climbing. Amelia continued the climb. As she reached half way, the ground began to tremble. It stopped as suddenly as it had started. Amelia heard crackling. She looked down. The scorpion she had just placed was getting loose. Buddy's support was up to it completely. Amelia gasped. She took out another scorpion and started hammering it as fast as she could into the cliff. But too late. The scorpion below her came off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with his sharp claws and climbing skills, Buddy lost his grip. The rope tightened around Amelia's waist as Buddy fell.<br>\r\n\"Oh crap\", Amelia said, right before Buddies wait ripped her off the cliff. They both were falling now. Amelia hoped that the scorpion before the loose one would be strong enough to support both of them. Buddy fell past it, then Amelia. Rope was running out fast. Very fast. Amelia closed her eyes. The scorpion did not hold. It wasn't strong enough to support the two beings. Amelia screamed. She already saw too bloody pancakes laying on the ground at the root of the cliff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a terrible jerk at the rope. It felt to Amelia as if she would have been ripped apart. After realizing they weren't falling anymore, Amelia dared to open her eyes. What she saw was a miracle. Buddy and her were floating in the sky, flying forward at a high speed. They were rising very fast too. Soon they reached the top of the cliff.

She wondered if the big red dragon that had chased them into the cave would come looking for them...<br>\r\nShe turned to look up to the top of the cave, when she heard the small dragon growl. She turned, just in time to see the sun blocked out as an enormous dragon dropped in front of her. It was  astrange looking one, blue, but the right side of its' body appeared to be frozen over. She took a couple of steps back, bumping into something hard and icy. The Dragons' tail had wrapped around her, blocking her routes of escape. There was no way out.<br>\r\nThe dragons' tail wrapped around her, and lifted her up to face the dragon, who had blazing red eyes. Amelia closed her eyes and flinched away, prepared to be eaten, but after a few moments, nothing.<br>\r\nShe turned, expecting to see an open maw, but isntead only saw those blazing red eyes, studying her. <i>I am called Syria.</i> a voice spoke into her mind. <i>One of the oldest dragons on this island. I understand you are one of the contestants for the new dragon queen throne, are you not?</i> Amelia swallowed. \"Y-yes...\" Bellowing laughter resounded in her mind. <i> You humans are all the same. All you ever care about is power, money, and destroying everything you lay your filthy hands on.</i><br>\r\nAmelia felt the need to speak up, defend herself. \"And how are dragons any different?! Aside from this one here at my side, every dragon I've met so far has tried to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<i>Humans are a rare delicacy on this island you see, and not many of us are as...civilized...as we used to be.</i> Syria blinked slowly. <i>I'll tell you what human, tell me then, are you different from the others of your kind? Have you truly come here seeking to make this place better, or just to grasp power over something else?<i><br>\r\nAmelia considered this for a moment, then responded. \"I...\"</i></i></span></div></div>",

If you didn't want to get eaten, the least you could have done was lie to me.</i> <br>\r\nShe was dropped harshly onto the ground. She fell to one knee, weak from being gripped so har,d then turned to run, however, Syria's enormous tail blocked her path. She turned, retreating as far as she could from him. The little blue dragon roared and jumped to fight, but Syria simply flicked him away. Easy. Syria licked his lips. <i>I'm going to enjoy this, I have not tasted human in a very long time.</i> <br>\r\nAmelia screamed, but it was futile. Syria opened his mouth and gripped Amelia firmly in his jaws. He arms and legs dangled from the sides of his mouth, he pushed her towards the back of his throat, and was able to fit them inside as well. he had begun to salivate, drool dripping from his jaws as he tasted her. This was too good to pass up, he wouldn't even bother chewing. He ran his toungue over her a few more times, paying special attention to her tender breasts, before he lifted his head and gave a hard swallow, a prominent writhing bulge appearing in his throat. It quickly traveled to his torso, where it flattened out into his vast belly, which was now slightly bigger, and sagging slightly with his recent meal. Syria licked his claws clean of her delicious taste, burped, and curled up to take a long nap. </span></div></div>",

His greedy eyes gaze greedily at her body and thick drool dripped from Blazes glistening teeth onto his scarlet scales.  He thinks fondly of the last time he had feasted upon human flesh, only a faint memory now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-Blaze why are you eyeing me like that,\u201d Amelia stutters as she begins to back away from the towering dragon.  Her foot gets caught on a rock and she stumbles backwards and falls unable to regain her balance.  The crude wooden spear tumbled out of her hands and rolled out of her reach.  The fiery dragon takes this moment to pounce on Amelia pinning her to the ground under a black clawed talon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans are considered a rare delicacy here and that tiny dragon you call a friend did not satisfy my hunger,\u201d Blaze thought to Amelia.  A drop of fowl smelling saliva dripped from the dragon\u2019s maw, splattering on Amelia.  \u201cI said I would be close and how much closer can you get to me than being inside my belly,\u201d the massive dragon continued.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, trapped helpless under the dragon\u2019s paw, could only stare up at the towering dragon.  It stood 20 feet high, and was covered in large, crimson scales as tough as steel.  The cavernous mouth stood open above Amelia revealing long savage yellow teeth protruded from massive pink gums surrounding a rough forked tongue.  Like a snake, the dragon struck, fitting Amelia completely inside his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness encompassed Amelia as Blaze closed his jaws sealing off the light.  The mouth had an extremely dank atmosphere and smelled of rotting flesh.  The slimy chamber echoed with each of the dragons deep breaths.  The rough tongue jiggled underneath her back as it scrapped off some skin.  She squirmed in her wet chamber, looking for an escaper as slippery spit covered the girl.  The dragon held the struggling girl in his mouth, enjoying her extraordinary flavor and the sensation of her wiggling.  After what seemed like eternity, the dragon flicked his tongue back and swallowed the girl down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the throat kneaded Amelia into the stomach, she really began to panic.  She met up with the blue dragon she saw earlier but it had passed out in the stomach.  The low amount of oxygen in the stomach made Amelia light headed as she struggled to find the opening were she came from.  More slime secreted from the stomach walls and the acid began to burn at her skin.  She soon ran out of air and fell into an endless slumber.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not knowing when the last time she ate was, she tapped on the stomach walls and said \"excuse me, it's getting kind of cramped in here and I'm starting to get hungry. may I please come out now?\" The red dragon replied \"I myself haven't eaten in a while and am currently on the hunt for something to fill me up, all I ask is you be patient until I catch some prey before I let you go.\" Amelia began to wonder in her mind if the dragon was really going to keep his promise this time or simply kick his digestive juices into over drive and digest her for good.

Hmm..<br>\r\n   Great, it is not going to get out of here on its own, and she is not going to leave it here to die.  As if trying to crawl up that narrow tube wasn't going to be hard enough...  Well, it was big enough for her to come down, so it should be big enough to go out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Clutching the little dragon, Amelia shoves her head, and then the rest of her into the long throat and starts to climb up.  Thankfully the muscles that normally push food down are now relaxed, but it is still a tight fit, made even tighter by having to carry the dragon.<br>\r\n   But it is just a tight fit, and the throat walls are flexible enough.  Not like some of those stone caves she had to squeeze thru when her brothers thought cave exploration was a good idea.  There, she really came close to being stuck.  And the throat sees to be open all the way out, so while the air smells terrible, it is air.  <br>\r\n   Now comes the mouth itself, and while it has a border that is tougher to enlarge, now the little dragon can simply be pushed in first and she can then squeeze thru.  Then getting past the teeth to the outside is almost a breeze.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As she wipes off some of the sweat, the little dragon wakes and whimpers at her.  Amelia bends down to comfort it, but can do little more.  It's a definite break and only staying off that leg for a long time will cure it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"So you have made your choices.  Not what I would have chosen, but perhaps you were wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia turns and sees ...</span></div></div>",

What spear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That one there.\" the dragon spirit points to a wondrous looking weapon that Amelia practically had to have stepped over.  How had she missed it?  Well no matter now.  She rushes over to grab it, only to have her hands pass right thru it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Once you have selected a weapon, it is your only weapon.

He liked you, but liked dinner more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"So you are saying I am seriously screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Possibly.  But your choices worked well for you this time.

And she had all but climbed over it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Anyway, he is rather slow, and you likely would have been eaten before he could help you.

For a moment, it bothers her that the dragon lacks wings or other apparent means of flying.  But this island had already shown enough oddities to worry about this one long.  Much more important is make sure this one doesn't want an Amelia-sized snack. As big as it is, she might not be worth the effort, but...<br>\r\n    Now she spots the tiny girl on the dragon's back.  One of the others has clearly gotten herself a pet too.  Amelia has a surge of jealousy watching this thing that is over 10 times as long as her Angus.  Then she bends down to pat Angus \"No, I wouldn't think of trading you for him.  You've saved my life once already.\"<br>\r\n    Of course what she means is that she wouldn't trade him like a shot.  A little dickering and some agony...  That would be a different story.  But there is no good in saying that.  Instead she steps onto the beach and waves.  None of the girls like each other, and she is likely the least loved of all, but surely there is no desire to kill... is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Not at the moment anyway.  The dragon lands nearby and it is Keira who hops off.  \"Well, well, the great Amelia returns with a dragon, or is it a dog?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amelia manages to suppress her anger surprisingly easily.  This is not the time to get in a shouting match.  With a laugh that was somewhat genuine, she answers \"Dragon, and it has saved my life.<br>\r\n   \"But the island is tougher than I expected, and I think you had best stay with me from here on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Ooo, the great explorer has gotten scared and needs my protection.  And why should I stay with you?  Airblast and I can handle anything we meet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia keeps silent about the jab about being scared.  She had never backed down from a challenge in her life, and is not about to start, but arguing her courage is not her purpose here.  \"keep thinking that and you will be dead in no time.  It's the wrong thing to think anytime, and in your case, especially wrong.  Airblast is not a fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Nonsense, he's so big, he's got to be a real good fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"He's so big that he can run away from any fight before the attacker can hurt him.  Look at his teeth.  He's a plant-eater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But dragons don't eat plants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"This one does.  Take a look.  What you have here is transportation, not a trooper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Airblast?\"  Keira appeals to her dragon to refute the charges.  But the dragon's expression needs little reading to know he is very sorry, but ...<br>\r\n   \"Aw.. It's all right Airblast.  I still love you.  And the Dragon Spirit did say I would have to meet the challenges, so you couldn't help me that much anyway.  And I bet you will still be a big help.\"  Keira emphasizes this with a big hug, tho 5' of girl does not come even close to fitting around 50' of dragon, even when it is a skinny dragon.  Airblast is not quickly comforted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Keira considers \"Well, in that case, I best be getting a weapon.  I'm going to need something to fight with.  The Dragon Spirit did say I would need a weapon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amelia interrupts with \"I think you already have your weapon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That wrench you are holding.  My bet is that is the only weapon you will be able to use.  At least I wouldn't bet on finding anything better.  The weapons on the island here come under a 1 to a customer policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But I brought this with me.  Surely it doesn't count.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I know where we can test that.  But keep hold of that wrench because it may be all you get.<br>\r\n   \"But we had best band together and find the other girls.

And you should be able to find June quickly on Airblast.  If I search too, we can all get separated again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Sounds good\"  Keira agrees, and mounts Airblast, who flew off so quickly that Amelia almost wonders if she flew away or vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, we have to wait here.  Not east to do, but nothing is sometimes the best action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus has a different idea.  He starts licking Amelia.  \"Hey, you're getting me all sloppy.

Eventually ...\"Oh all right, if it makes you happy...\"  It seems to, and Angus has licked much of her body when a dragon and Krystal walk onto the beach.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As Amelia approaches, Krystal proves less hostile than Keira had been.  \"Well, I didn't expect to see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You almost didn't.

We should stick togeth..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  But as Krystal says this, Keira is back, again so quickly that Airblast seems to have almost appeared rather than flown.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Get on board.  June's in trouble.\" Keira yells.  The girls and dragons jump on, and they are rapidly flown to a valley where they see June and a dragon being attacked by 4 giant wasps.  Their landing and jumping off Airblast attracts the wasps' attention and 3 break off to attack the newcomers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Krystal is terrified by the one coming at her and William, who is blithely sticking his head out where the wasp can sting it.  And that is just what the wasp wants to do.<br>\r\n   ...wanted to do.<br>\r\n   The wasp has a big nasty stinger.  But William has a bigger one, and a faster one, which mashes right into the wasp when it is only a foot away.  The body of the bug almost floats into William's mouth, where he starts happily chewing [just as he had planned], until Krystal reminds him vigorously that the other girls are in danger too.  With a shrug, William flies to their defense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Keira does not need much defense.  It seems Airblast is properly named.  He produces a blast of air that stops the wasp dead in the air, allowing Keira to hit it with her wrench, and then another blast of air sends the insect back a dozen feet.  Whether groggy from the blow, or just working on instinct, the wasp tries the same tactic, with the same result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June is also not in great need.  Her dragon has a hammerhead that functions very well as a weapon.  The wasp tries to get to the dragon's rear to poison it, but June's efforts, while harmless, distract the attacker long enough for the dragon to turn around. She can use some help, but June will likely win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Amelia is another story.  Neither she nor her dragon have much in the way of offensive abilities.  This is not a fight they can win.  As Krystal steers William to her aid, she is surprised to see Amelia is doing as well as she is.  She may not be able to kill the wasp, but she is being amazingly hard to hit, while offering herself as a target.  Were Angus healthy, they might be able to dodge the bug all day.  But with his leg broken, Amelia must take extra chances to lure the bug to attack her.<br>\r\n   Krystal has to admit she is impressed.  She can out-dodge Amelia, but try to do it when this horror is trying to kill her?  Amelia may be a lot of mouth, but there is plenty of nerve to back it up.<br>\r\n   But one can dodge only so many times.  A loose rock, and Amelia is a little slow, and the wasp's sting rams into her.<br>\r\n   ...well rams her anyway.  <br>\r\n   To the surprise of both girls and the wasp, there is no gaping wound in Amelia.  There is something sizzling on her skin, but this does not seem to bother her.  She acts like she merely got a punch in the side.  <br>\r\n   Angus takes advantage of the surprise to attack, but without damaging the wasp, who prepares to attack back, only to be stopped by William's stinger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Krystal directs William to aid June as she gets off to check on Amelia.  A moment later there is a crunch as William finally gets to chew on a wasp, and a thump as Keira's foe falls to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"You ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia answers \"Yeah.  Wasp kicked like a mule, but I've taken worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But why didn't it sting you?  That thing's like a sword.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I don't know.  It just didn't penetrate.  ... Hmm...  My skin looks odd.  Feels odd too.\"  Amelia looks over her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"These spots that are giving off steam.  They look normal.\"  Krystal notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"They feel normal too.  Say, they would be where the poison from the wasp hit. ...  But they hit this slime on me and boiled it off.<br>\r\n   \"This slime... that's where Angus licked me...  Angus! Did you give me a suit of armor by licking me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus affirms this guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   After poking at some spots with and without the slime, Amelia judges \"It's hardly top of the line stuff, but It was sure useful this time.  Guess I was wrong to interrupt you.  Well, you can take care of that in a moment.  Let's check on June.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June is in fine shape and introduces her dragon as Floral-Foehn.  Having just been rescued, she is quite eager to be part of a group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"The Dragon Spirit said this island is divided into six sections, a volcano, an icy wasteland, a desert, a rainforest, a bone yard, and a mountain in the center.  And we need to visit them all.  Which to go to 1st?\" Keira asks.  The question produces considerable debate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As they argue, Amelia declares \"While you decide, I am going to have Angus give me a full suit of armor.  Come on little one.  Lick me all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus starts by licking her feet, but then he opens his mouth and puts her toes in his mouth.  Then he starts putting her feet in his mouth.  \"Hey, I said to lick me, not eat me.  Stop that!\"<br>\r\n   Angus does, but a moment later he is trying it again, and then again.  \"Look, I'm too big.  You can't eat me...  Can you?\"  Angus insists he can.  \"But that's not going to do me any good to be eaten, will it?\"  Angus again insists it will.<br>\r\n  \"You were right last time, but being eaten alive?\"</span></div></div>",

OK, Angus, chow down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus quickly does.  Amelia's feet vanish into his mouth, and as he starts up her calves, become a bulge in his neck.  As he reaches her knees, she can see that the dragon can hold a whole lot more of her than she could have expected.  His belly is expanding as more of her enters it.  It still seems impossible that he could swallow all of her, but she can no longer reject it as absurd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Amelia!  What is he doing?\"  Krystal had noticed what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Possibly making a real fool of me.  But the dragon Spirit said he would always try to help me, and he insists this is help.  So I have to let him do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But how can being eaten alive help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I sure hope I find out.  Anyway, I am risking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I do hope you are right.\"  Krystal stepped away with a very worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia is of course even more worried.  Some creature have very perverted ideas of what help is.  However, there are some compensations for her situation.  The dragon's tongue and internal parts provide a soothing massage.  If she wasn't worrying about what is going to happen afterwards, she would even be enjoying herself.  The swallowing is very pleasant, even sensual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In fact, too sensual as he reaches the top of her thighs...  \"Whoa, stop.  That's off limits for dragons.\"<br>\r\n   Angus stops, but only for a moment.  \"No, I may not be a prude, but there are limits, and sex with a dragon, one that looks underage yet, has got to be past it.\"<br>\r\n   And again Angus flicks his tongue at its target.  \"You're just not going to stop until I say yes, are you?  And you want to assure me your perverted male mind didn't add this in for your own fun?  That it's good for me?\"<br>\r\n   Angus can't nod his head when Amelia's legs are in his mouth, but he tries to agree.</span></div></div>",

Amelia is surprised at how quickly she changes from reluctant to eager as quick darts slide over her mound.  She feels her excitement building and building until she climaxes.  \"Well, you are not to do that again, but..\"<br>\r\n   But Angus does proceed to do it again, and again.  His tongue again and again goes over and into all of her, driving her to completion time after time.  It is only when she comes for the 6th time that he finally has mercy and resumes swallowing her.  \"My, I can't say that any of my lovers have done that well by me\" mutters Krystal.  June and Keira say nothing.  Their sexual experiences are distinctly on the limited side.  They are wondering if that was a good thing after this scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A satiated Amelia is rather serenely watching the dragon swallow her.  As he opens wider to engulf her breasts, he blocks her view of all but dragon mouth, but it is only as her shoulder enter his mouth that she starts to worry again.  This has all been very pleasant, but what comes next?  A very good question, but there is no way now to avoid the answer.  A moment later her head is out of sight, and her arms follow quickly.<br>\r\n  As her hands vanish, June starts giggling.  Reprimanded by the others, she says \"I can't help it.  Angus looks so much like a silly beach ball with legs.\" <br>\r\n    Looking again causes Krystal to break up. The dragon does look silly, with a stomach several times the size of the rest of him.  He can't begin to move with Amelia in him and his attempts to do so are comical. Keira however remains serious  \"Now what?\"</span></div></div>",

Too bad she found out that it wasn't to her liking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly felt the stomach walls excrete digestive enzymes, and it started to work on her flesh. Now she was scared, she called out, \"O-okay Angus! T-that's enough! Let me out... LET ME OUT!!!\" The acids chruned all over her, dissolving her skin and flesh. She began to cry, \"This can't be how it ends. Not for me. I was destined to be a queen! How could you betray me, Angus!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls watched in horror as his stomach shrank slowly, and soon, Amelia was no more, never to walk the earth again. The Dragon Spirit floated up, \"Pity really, but I don't think she should have trusted him with that kind of task. You see, when a dragon gets a free meal, they tend to finish it off quickly. Pity. I guess one of you remaining three shall be queen. I wish you the best of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngus gave a loud burp and scurried off into the underbrush, satisfied of his sexy and delicious catch. Keira sighed, \"How did I see that one coming? I guess it's up to us now. Adios Amelia.\"</span></div></div>",

She is half-way thru swearing never to drink again when she realizes there was no wild party the night before.  That the last thing she can recall is Angus swallowing her.  That was supposed to give her a suit of armor on her skin.  Right now it does not seem worth it.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Say, where is everybody?  <br>\r\n   A tongue wetly tells her where Angus is a moment before her eyes can focus enough to notice him in front of her.  But the other girls?  <br>\r\n   \"Come on, let's find the gang.\"  A command that proves a bit hard to follow as it takes 3 tries to get to her feet, and 5 to stay up.  But as she starts to stagger forward, she continues to recover and is functioning moderately well as she moves into a clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Amelia!  What are you doing here?  Are you all right?\"  Krystal is suddenly right in front of her.  Clearly Amelia is still groggy if Krystal can get this close without being noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I feel like I'm recovering from a 3 day drunk, but besides wishing I was dead, I guess so.  What happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"That's what we would like to know.  We pretty much assumed the worst when Angus's belly started to shrink.  And then he ran off into the woods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wait a minute.  Angus has a broken leg.  He can't run!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well he did, and fast too.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But...\"  Amelia bends down to look over Angus, and finds that his broken leg is fully healed.  \"Is that what this was all about?  You eat me and you can draw off enough pep to heal your leg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus tries to deny it, but he looks really guilty.  \"Well, I do need a healthy dragon, so I suppose I have to forgive you anyway, but you just keep in mind that you made me feel terrible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    A shrill whistle from Krystal makes her feel worse.  \"Please!  My head is too sensitive!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Sorry, but when we went looking for...well, whatever, we selected that as a signal.  The others should be here shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    And they are.  It is June who points out that Angus seems to have provided the desired tough skin.  At least Amelia's skin looks and feels different.  But for the moment, none of the girls are willing to chance Angus's mouth to get their own benefit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, the dragon spirit said we would need weapons, and you said we would get only one choice, so we are working on that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Good point.  I want to go get mine back.  It is not much, but it has already been useful.  But it can wait if you have any idea where to get one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

She has barely lived outside of books, and her current experiences are not encouraging her to leave them.  \"You do?  You do!  Where is it?  How do we get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia interrupts \"This could be long and dangerous.  How about we get my stick, not to mention a bit of dragon meat to eat, first?</span></div></div>",

Dead dragon ranks well up on many diets.  So not surprising the body of Amelia's foe has been half-consumed already, and is nearly covered by feasting lesser dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    William is easily able to chase off those who look interested in fresh meat, and Floral's hammerhead proves sharp as an ax and she is able to carve out plenty of stakes for the party.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia, however, is after her stick.  If the dragon spirit is correct, and there seems no reason to doubt that, she will not succeed without it.  Just how she can with it is hard to see, but it worked once so far, so....<br>\r\n   But here it is, about halfway eaten loose from the dragon.  So just grab it and...stuck.  Pull harder...  Is it caught in some bone or something?  Determined, Amelia puts all her muscle and concentration in her next try.<br>\r\n   Which means she does not hear the cry of warning from her companions.  Instead she feels the confines of a huge dragon mouth again.<br>\r\n    It does not take her long to guess what has happened.  This big dragon came swooping down and decided it wanted living food, and she was the only thing not diving for cover.  She is right back where she was with the other dragon, except she lacks stick and little assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She also is dealing with a smarter dragon.  Once it has gotten a distance away, it starts chewing on her.  To both parties' surprise, she takes no damage.  pain, yes, but no damage.  Has Angus done some good again?<br>\r\n  The dragon is not too concerned.  If it can't chew, it is still big enough to swallow.  So Amelia is turned to face its throat and it starts swallowing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Her head goes down easily and her shoulders are soon following.  As more of her enters the passage to the stomach, Amelia is finding the actions of that huge tongue surprisingly erotic.  Is she actually going to enjoy being eaten?  She is not sure whether to deem that a small generosity or a huge insult.  <br>\r\n   But as her hips leave the mouth and the tongue can no longer stimulate her sensitive regions, she finds she can't resist the urges of her body and her hands seek her sex, rubbing vigorously.  She soon comes and relaxes for a moment.  When she recovers, she sees she is entirely in this dragon's belly.  An \"earthquake\" is quickly identified as the dragon giving a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    With a sigh of contentment, the dragon lies down to digest its pleasant meal.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   Amelia fights down her panic and tries to find a way out.  But the options are grim.  This time she has no weapon, and the stomach is too small to turn around in, or even to move much.  This looks hopeless.  For a moment, she considers just playing with herself.  That way she can at least go out with a bang.  But she has never walked away from a challenge in her life, and she is not going to stop now.  She is almost certainly dead, but she is not going to surrender quietly.  <br>\r\n  <br>\r\n   So there are only the two ways out.  And not only is the throat behind here where she would have to push her way backward with just her hands, but she would surely wake the dragon no matter how deeply it sleeps.  Then it would just swallow her again.  No hope that way.<br>\r\n   Forward is the only hope.  That must be 100' of crawling thru a tiny tube, with all sorts of reasons she can't make it, but it is the only chance. Forward she goes..<br>\r\n   The tube is as small as she had feared, and does not stretch easily, but she starts to make progress.  However, the air is getting bad.  And likely will be worse soon.  Right now, there is only a hint of oder.  That will get a lot worse before it gets better.  <br>\r\n   But more important is that she is feeling tired and sleepy, and having trouble remembering why it is so important she keep moving, especially when it is so hard to get around the corners...  Finally she just has to take a break and rest for a l i t t l e bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She is quite confused when she wakes.  Why is there grass under her?  Wait, shouldn't she be inside a dragon?  Yes, that is right, a dragon ate her.  Did she actually manage to crawl out?  That seems wrong.  She is a mess, but not that kind of mess.  But how else could she have gotten out?  Well, this place is weird in many ways, and some will have to remain mysteries.  Right now, she had best concentrate on finding the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The first of them proves quite easy to find.  Angus is looking at her from only a few feet away.  \"Angus?  How did you find me?... Oh why bother asking a question you can't answer?  How about where are the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This he is able to answer it seems.  He gets up and scampers off in what seems a random direction, looking back to make sure Amelia is following.  She is, and is soon rewarded for her faith.  A few minutes later, all of the girls are together again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It is June who asks what happened to which Amelia can only reply \"I don't know.  the dragon ate me and somehow I got out of his stomach, but I have no idea how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June considers \"You know...your skin looks normal again.  Do you suppose what Angus did to you got you out of the stomach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Angus, did you provide me with a 'get-out-of-belly-free' card?\"  The answer is positive.  \"That was a real good gift.  I have got to thank you.\"  A hug seems to be sufficient.<br>\r\n   \"Now, as soon as I get cleaned up, I want another trip to your stomach.  That sound like a good idea to you?\"  Apparently.  \"Good, now the other girls need protection too.  Can you provide it?\"  Again, the answer seems positive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Turning to the others \"Airblast, can you take us to some water?...some safe water, for a quick bath?...Good.  Now I want first crack, but all 4 of us need some protection, so if my cleaning up is going to take some time, one of you had best be eaten 1st.  We can decide which on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Oh, Amelia, here's your stick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Thanks Keira.  Doesn't look worth getting eaten for, does it?  Well, the dragon spirit says I need it, and while its help has not been as much as we need, it hasn't been wrong yet.<br>\r\n   \"OK. everybody on Airblast and off to a spring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

William, you guard her while she is bathing.  Now Angus, you give me a great big \"kiss\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That Angus does.  His mouth expands and his head darts forward, engulfing Krystal's entire head.  Expected or not, it is a little much for Krystal who tries to get free, but Angus is not about to let her.  Instead he swallows and he is working her shoulders into his mouth.  The next swallow reaches her breasts, and another brings them out of sight.  <br>\r\n   Angus slows down now and the audience can see his tongue is moving around in his mouth, apparently on her boobs.  Whether she has simply calmed down, finds the attentions desirable, or realizes resistance is futile, Krystal now stops struggling.  Nor does she start up again as Angus resumes swallowing, at least not while he is swallowing a flat belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Being distinctly smaller than Krystal, her passage down his throat is easily followed by the bulges she makes.  By the time she reaches his belly, he is starting to look more like a strange skin-tight outfit than a dragon.  indeed, he is skin-tight enough to make the outfit almost lurid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But as Angus starts to consume her box, Krystal starts making objections again.  Apparently his lickings are not appreciated.  Eventually Angus finishes what ever task he has in mind and starts sucking down her legs as well, folding her inside his belly as he went.  It is not long before her feet enter his mouth, and a moment later all of her has slid down his throat into the stomach.  Once again, Angus is a weird looking beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Amelia has finished with her bathing and asks \"That was how I looked in there?\"  That being confirmed, she notes \"kinda silly looking.  Now, Angus, she is alright, right?\"  This gets an affirmative nod, which isn't that easy to believe as his belly starts to shrink.  It takes some time, but eventually Krystal is barely a bulge, at which point he scoots off into the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What is he doing out there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Ah never mind.  I don't think we really want to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A few minutes later Angus is back, and Amelia claims the next turn, without much challenge.  June and Keira may have seen Amelia return from Angus' stomach, but it is still not easy to overcome the image that this is Angus digesting them, not helping them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But Amelia has no worries and merely asks Angus what position he wants her in</span></div></div>",

He opens his mouth a little and starts licking on her toes, slowly moving up her feet and then legs, swallowing as he goes.  Amelia more or less puts up with this, until her legs are out of sight, and this time too, when he attacks her sex, she tries to object, but not sufficiently to stop him from bringing her to climax and making her come again and again.  Finally he is satisfied, and starts to swallow her waist.  <br>\r\n   Once he reaches her chest, he again pauses and gives her rack his full attention, which Amelia finds most pleasant.  But all good things come to an end, and he resumes swallowing, pulling in shoulders and then head.  Finally her hands are all that is visible and then they are gone too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Once again Angus is a beachball, and once again, his hopelessly oversized belly is starting to shrink.  But there is no sign of Krystal yet.  June and Keira exchange looks.  Is this a trap by the dragon to get rid of some competition?  He shouldn't think that way, but who knows how he thinks?  Krystal had better show up soon...</span></div></div>",

Oh, never mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the Angus beach ball, and said, \"To tell you the truth, I was terrified when I was deposited in his stomach.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>   As before, Angus' belly starts to shrink and and eventually reaches a size where he can move, at which point he rushes into the woods.  A few minutes later he is back, with a flat belly and an open mouth.  June and Keira look at each other.  They have seen Krystal and Amelia survive this.  And they have been told that Angus is entirely loyal to Amelia, and wouldn't do anything to endanger her.  But it looks so much like they would be eaten and digested. Perhaps the other would like to go 1st?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Finally June gives in.  \"I guess I will go next.  But Angus, I don't know if I can take watching you eating me.  So can you grab me from the rear?\"  <br>\r\n   Angus nods a yes and June sits down and turns around.  With a quick lunge, June's head vanishes into Angus.  <br>\r\n   Surprisingly to June, she is quite calm.  Possibly that is because it is now too late. Whether or not this is a good idea, she is going down anyway.  Why worry about what can't be avoided?  But it has to be admitted that Angus' lickings seem friendly and pleasant.  They were even a bit erotic, a point that she doubts she wants to admit.  Still, as her breasts slip under his lips, she does have certain feelings.  Her flat belly and delicious hips are soon also being covered by his mouth, and his tongue slides over every part of her.  <br>\r\n   As he starts to slurp up her lovely legs, she is entering his belly and has to bend to let the rest of her enter.  Soon she is doubled up and then pushed around so her feet can enter too.  Now she is the beach ball stuffing.  A very sleepy stuffing that nods off quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Krystal and Keira watch the beach ball empty again, and Angus run off.  They also watch Amelia return, a definite relief, tho Angus is least likely to harm Amelia in any case.  Still, it is a little more evidence the process is safe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Keira mutters  \"My turn...now where is a comfortable place to sit..?  But as she bends over to select a spot, Angus decides to speed the matter up.  Opening his mouth wider than ever, he engulfs her bottom as well as much of her hips and belly.  Before Keira realizes what is happening, her hands are touching her toes as she hangs out of Angus' mouth.  The sight amuses Krystal and Amelia a good deal more than it does Keira.  However, beyond making a number of pointed comments about her so-called friends, there is nothing Keira can do as Angus gives her a complete licking as he swallows her.  Her body is down after a moment, and then he is working her head in.  As his mouth closes around her legs, she feels her rear enter the stomach.  Once she has stretch that, the stomach has a convulsion, knocking her in a circle and allowing her legs to enter the belly, and her to form the beach ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As the beach ball again deflates, Amelia says \"As soon as the others get back, I guess we get on Airblast and find June's weapon book.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A less confident Krystal corrects \"if they get back\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Oh come on.  Angus is here to help me, and you 3 are definite aids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Wanting to aid doesn't mean he can do so.  He can make a mistake, or not realize what is needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well he didn't this time...I hope.\" </span></div></div>",

A few experiments reveal the slime acts much like a plastic coating.  It is difficult to pierce. [They don't want to take a chance on really determined efforts to punch thru, and hit the girl inside]  But it is less useful against things like fists.  But given the number of teeth and claws they have already seen, this is going to be pretty useful protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Now then.  Angus, you say June can find a book somewhere and you can show us where, right?\"  a nod.  \"Airblast can take us there?\"  another nod.  \"Ok, everybody jump on board.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later the girls are getting off Airblast not far from a small cave that Angus points to.  But as they start to approach, a dragon pokes its head out.  It's a big head, with a bigger mouth, and lots of big teeth.  It seems to have a long white beard and mustache.  With most of it inside, it is hard to measure its size, but it might match William, and trying to fight it in that cave is clearly not a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus tries to push June forward, but she naturally hesitates.  \"Floral, is this a good idea?\"  Floral seems to be dubious of the idea, but she does not reject it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As June hesitates, Amelia offers \"I think you have to get your own weapons, so we can't help you much here.  I guess you will have to hope you can befriend it.  Of course if the answer is no, we will have to hope Angus gave us some real strong armor...<br>\r\n   \"Now I can try to lure it away.  All these dragons seem eager to eat dragon queen candidates.  So  I get close and wiggle some tasty hips at it and it should chase me.  I should be able to dodge it, and you can sneak in.  You would have to go fast because it will either catch me or give up fairly soon and you don't want to be in there when it gets back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  June wavers  \"I don't know if I like either choice, but...\"</span></div></div>",

And I am likely the best diversion.  So let's study and plan.  This is going to be tricky if I am to avoid being dragon chow...\" Amelia responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The preparation takes all day, but finally they are ready.  Amelia moves forward to the carefully calculated distance.  If she is right, this is the distance as which the hungry dragon will try to jump her, giving her just enough time to escape if she dives away at the same time.  The girls are waiting to give warning, but she had better be super-alert, without seeming so.  Their warning is all too likely to be a split second too late...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Nobody ever learns if the warning is in time.  Amelia is already diving away and the dragon is attacking as the warning reaches her.  Perhaps she would have still escaped if she had waited for the alarm, but she she does not take the time to find out.  Instead she is running at full speed away, with the dragon in pursuit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A big log is in the way.  Jump over and keep going..not!  Instead she dives to the ground just on the far side of the log.  The big dragon right on her tail can't twist that fast without tumbling out of control.  Instead it must slow down and turn around, giving her a lead.  Were she actually trying to escape, it would be back over the log and hide, or run left or right out of the sight of the dragon and her chance of escape would be excellent.  But June needs time, and that means Amelia has to keep luring the dragon.  So she stays on the same side of the log, where it will be able to spot her, and keep chasing.  She takes off to the left.  Good, the dragon had turned in her direction, and she will have to run full bore.  No need to slow down and maybe warn the dragon it is being led around by its appetite...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In the meantime, June is ducking into the cave.  It is big enough that she does not have to crawl, but when that dragon returns, it is going to completely block the passageway.  She must hurry and find the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She does, and finds two books.  The Dragons of Dragon Island,  and the Dragon Crown and its Pieces.  Both clearly useful, very useful.  But if Amelia is right, she can take only one of them.  That seems weird, but everything is strange here.  She will try to grab both of course, but she had better take care which she takes first, just in case....    </span></div></div>",

This last trick should be enough.  The pit trap is not really deep, but the dragon will be distracted long enough for her to reach safety...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Provided she doesn't step in a hole before she gets there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Suddenly she is falling forward.

Finding she can't be bitten, it begins licking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Amelia tries to object, but she is firmly held in that massive mouth.  Worse, the dragon is making good use of its tongue.  Her excitement builds rapidly and before long, she is shuttering with joy.  <br>\r\n   She is also being swallowed, and is in no shape to resist.  A moment later she is heading into the throat and some massive swallows move her rapidly into the stomach, where she once again is forced flat and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June watches in horror as the lumps that were her companion move down the dragon.  Then she is even more horrified as the dragon starts to move towards her.  Taking a step back, \"You sure you don't want to be friends?  You've had plenty to eat, and I'd ruin your diet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Another step back, and another, and ....ops...  Suddenly June is on her back.  The dragon lunges forward and grabs her feet in its mouth.  \"Please, I'm sure I must taste terrible...\"  But even as she tries this pitch, she can see the pleased look on the dragon's face as it licks her feet.  It definitely disagrees.  <br>\r\n  With a small step forward, it gets in range to pull her calves into its mouth despite her protests and these too receive a tongue back.  Her lovely thighs then receive the same treatment.  She redoubles her protests as her hips are engulfed and her vitals start getting attention, but she finds that the dragon is indeed skilled with that tongue, and her cries of \"No!\" quickly change tone.  And quickly become \"Oh, OH, OH!!\"<br>\r\n   Exhausted, June feels her feet entering its throat, but can do nothing to stop it.  She is not sure she wants to.  The feeling is warm and comforting, and stimulating.  Her flat belly and lovely chest are soon inside the dragon, and the rest of her quickly follows.<br>\r\n   Slipping down the throat into the belly, June feels an object ahead, a soft one.  Amelia?  As she goes deeper and her feet slip past the other girl's legs, she is sure of that.  She continues to slide past the other girl's firm flesh, until she found her face in Amelia's bush, and realized Amerlia's mouth was at her pussy.  \"Amelia, are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Right now, but I don't know how we are getting out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"What can we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That question is suddenly answered by the stomach walls.  A squeeze shoves her head between Amelia's legs to where she is kissing her vitals.  She can feel the same thing happening to Amelia.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"But I'm a normal girl.  I don't do that sort of thing.\"  Amelia's comment is more colorful, but also very negative.<br>\r\n   The stomach walls pay no attention to the girls' opinions.  Instead they start a series of contractions that push and rub the girls together in what they soon realize is a most erotic way.  Despite their insistence they don't go that way, the feeling is most pleasant and getting more demanding.  Instead of something to endure, it is becoming something to enjoy, and to welcome.<br>\r\n   June suddenly feels Amelia's tongue going to work.  For a moment, she tries to resist the urge to retaliate, but the idea is too strong.  Soon, her tongue too is in the other girl's hole.  <br>\r\n   A few seconds later Amelia comes and June's face is splattered by her juices.  But somehow this is not icky like she would have guessed.  Instead, she sees it as a triumph and sets to work licking all trace away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It seems like a long time before she feels herself build up and then explode, resulting in screams that would have waken half the island if she were not inside the dragon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Exhausted, she slumps.  But the dragon is not done with them yet and keep up the stomach contractions.  The girls eagerly respond and feel the same excitement building and then releasing.  This time the dragon relaxes and they fall into a deep sleep almost immediately<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But most important, she had been sleeping alone, and now there is a quite large dragon sleeping with her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June's scream of panic awakens the dragon, which June recognizes as the same one who had eaten her a few hours ago. She is uncertain if this is good or bad news.  In any case, cowering away seems a good idea.<br>\r\n   But not an effective one.  The dragon, smiling hugely, watches her and then extends its large tongue.  As it licks over her, June assumes it is just tasting her, but as it starts to concentrate on her \"sensitive\" areas, she realizes it may have a different use for her than a midnight snack.  A glance at the rest of the dragon supplies confirming evidence, some very large confirming evidence...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Stop!  You can't.  You have no right!\"  Her verbal and physical efforts look quite inadequate, but the dragon pauses, and touches June's book.

Not sure if she is disappointed or relieved, probably both, she looks at the entry in the book.  Now it says \"...maiden's Kiss...\"  Had it said that before?  She didn't think so.  <br>\r\n  Not that it mattered.  \"In for a penny, in for a pound.\"  This time she hugs the dragon as closely as she can and firmly plants her lips as she hangs on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This time the dragon stirs and becomes alert.  \"Oh, I'm glad you are alright...\" a statement interrupted when she sees the gleam in his eye.  Scrambling backwards, she clutches the book in front of her like a weapon.  \"Now look, I haven't said yes yet...\"  [it would be some time before she realized there was more than a little hint that she would say yes later, a realization that would turn her face distinctly red.]<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    As a weapon, the book does not prove extremely effective.  The dragon gently, but firmly, grabs it and pulls it from her grasp.  Putting it down, it starts toward the back of the cave, gesturing for June to follow.  Since it is away from the bed, she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A moment later she is looking at a huge library. The cave contains shelf after shelf crammed with books.  There are quite simply more than she can possibly read in a lifetime.  To make it even better, the dragon takes her to one shelf, where she finds books on one of her favorite subjects, more books on the subject on it than she had seen in her life, anywhere.  \"Wow...I'd kill for access to a library like this.  I'd ... I'd... \"  A glance at the dragon seems to confirm what she might have to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"But, but... Look, I'm not ready for such a step.

June is trying to think of a way to do more than wait a little, but no ideas are coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dragon is getting an idea, besides the one he already had.  He walks to the bookcase and selects a book, and then places it on the table in front of her.  Looking at the title, \"Oooo, The Index of Mobley.  The book I was doing my thesis on.  <br>\r\n   \"But that book is almost a legend.  Nobody has a copy.  All we have are references and quotes.  This is really a copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The dragon nods convincingly.  Convincingly enough that June swoops up the book.  Or rather tries to..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"I can't touch it.  My hands go right thru it.  I have the book I have always wanted right in front of me and I can't even open it.  Is this some sort of sick joke?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Perhaps puzzled, the dragon comes forward and opens it.  It behaves like a normal book, but when June tries to turn a page, her hands again just pass thru the book like it is not there.  again the dragon reaches out, and this time turns the page.<br>\r\n   This quickly becomes a routine.  June sits and reads, and the dragon turns the page.  From time to time, she finds something that bothers her and asks him to fetch a different book, which, no matter how obscure, he finds in the vast shelves and opens in front of her before getting behind her to turn more pages.  <br>\r\n   It is some time before June notices that an outside observer might see them as a loving couple.  He with his arms around her holding her close and taking care of her needs.  She leaning into him.  When did that happen?  Not that it really mattered.  The dragon makes a surprisingly comfortable chair.  Leaning away would be awkward and silly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Presently she yawns.  \"I have got to get to bed ... Oh dear... I suppose there is only the one ...<br>\r\nI should have figured.  You wouldn't consider sleeping on the floor? ...  Should have guessed that too.  OK, but remember you promised not to try anything...</span></div></div>",

She realizes she has fell back and starts to catch up, when something large, wet, and sticky wraps around her head and pulls her back, landing her on her pretty bottom and bent nearly flat.  Before she can say a word, her head is inside a huge mouth, toothless, but much bigger than that of any of the dragons she has seen.  <br>\r\n  The wrapping pulls her further in and June feels wetness on her shoulders.  Something like a large paw starts pushing on her rump and her boobies enter the mouth as her head starts to reach the throat.  That proves quite short and her head pops into the stomach as her flat belly is shoved in.  <br>\r\n   The stomach of her devourer is also short and when her hips are moving inside, the creature starts having trouble shoving her legs in.  Its efforts have the side effect of turning her on, and as it finally begins swallowing her legs, she climaxes powerfully.  It takes all of her energy and she is quickly stuffed into the stomach for digestion.<br>\r\n   As she drifts off, she is vigorous hoping Angus' protection extends to creatures besides dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   In the meantime, Keira notices she has not heard from June in some time and turns back to look.

Keira quickly climaxes.  The frog is not done tasting her and starts tasting the rest of her.  Her lovely breasts come in for considerable attention sending both waves of pleasure and outrage, sensations that greatly increase when the tongue finally returns to her mound, and plunges in.  The war of feeling is finally won as she bucks under one of the most intense orgasms she has ever felt.

And June is just so interested in so many things she has only seen in books before.  It is not long before she has once again fallen well behind the rest of the party.  She realizes this and is about to catch up again when she sees this flower, a huge flower. Instead of stepping after the others, she takes a step towards the flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The huge size is the immediate point.  It must be over 10' across, and the record holder according to what she had read was only about 3 feet.  Even if she had misread, this had to be the champ.  <br>\r\n   And the official biggest flower is supposed to stink something terrible.  But this flower smells sweet and wonderful, something she could go on smelling all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she reaches the flower, she realizes the scent is coming from the pit at its center, a hole a little over a foot in diameter and several feet deep.  As she leans over the scent becomes ever more powerful and delightful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now she realizes what sort of plant this is.  She had read of plants like this that lured flies by scent, trapped them, and digested them.  This was the same thing, only much much larger, and it seems it traps prospective dragon queens for its food.  The poor girls would be enchanted by the smell and crawl in to that pit, only to find they were trapped, and then they would be slowly digested.  A single girl might feed the plant for a year.  Well, she is not going to be trapped by this plant.<br>\r\n   She is going to feed herself to it voluntarily.<br>\r\n   Yes, the perfume is that powerful.  She is going to get to the source of it and bath herself in it.  She doesn't care that it will dissolve her into plant food.  She must enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Tho the plant is probably tough, June takes care not to injure it as she positions herself to enter that maw.  She feels rather protective towards her devourer and its health is her main concern.  <br>\r\n   But the scent is overpowering and she quickly stops trying to find a way to give it a comforting pat and pushes her head into that black hole.  Then she starts pushing the rest of her in.  <br>\r\n   As she enters, she feels the caress of what feels like hundreds of fingers slipping down her.  She assumes these are a form of spike that allow her easy entry, but would painfully bar her exit.  But she has no intention of exiting, and the fact she is likely already doomed is of no interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Her breasts begin to feel the tickle of these vines, a feeling that is most erotic.  She is surprised, even shocked, at a sudden wish that some male would happen by and take advantage of her vulnerable situation.  No such \"rescuer\" arrives, and she resorts to her hands caressing her mound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   As she builds towards her climax, she is pleased to see she is now slipping down the tube without further effort on her part.  For a second, her hips stick, but a little wiggle gets them past the narrow point.  As they do, she feels the outside petals of the flower start to close, covering her legs.  She is now quite cut off from the rest of the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She reaches the center of the scent just as she climaxes, a combination she find joyful indeed.  As she rest there, too happy to move, she feels a tingle at her feet, which starts to move down her legs.  Apparently the digestive juices are located in the petals, and will now flow down her, bringing her nutriments down to the base of the plant here.  She is now fully doomed, and happy such a clever plant is getting such a good meal.</span></div></div>",

The girls head thru some shallow water and of course Amelia puts her foot on the dry spot.  <br>\r\n   It will be a minute before she has the time to work out why it is dry.  But she knows in a second that something is wrong.  Instead of stepping on something firm and solid, it is almost like she is stepping on air.  There is something under her foot, but it sinks rapidly, carrying her down.<br>\r\n   At the same time, a ring of plantlife rises around her.  And, just as her foot finally hits something firm, the ring closes over her head, blocking all exit.  The \"dry spot\" had been a trigger.  Her own weight on it had pushed the outside ring up, and now she discovers that her weight also keeps the ring shut.  She frantically pushes, but with no effect as the pod now fills with digestive fluid.  It is not long before she is food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Krystal and Keira rush to the rescue, only to suffer similiar fates.  Trying to rush around Keira, Krystal leaves the path, and steps on another trigger.  This one lets loose two huge leafs that slam shut around the startled lass and lock into each other.  Krystal recognizes this as a fantastically huge Venus flytrap, with herself as the fly, but recognition does her little good as she is held tight and slowly digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Keira at least reaches Amelia's attacker, but as she starts trying to rescue her, she suddenly feels something like a sack over her head.  Had she been able to see, she would have discovered that one of the plants here had developed the intelligence and means to actively hunt food.  It had gotten behind the girl and now has placed its food pod over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Keira tries to fight, but the plant is used to shoving more and more of its feeding bod over victims.  Quickly shoulders and then chest are covered with plant fiber.  Keira is surprised to find the passage of the plant over her breasts is distinctly stimulating.  A stimulation that increases as her hips are devoured and her mound is subject to stimulation as well.  Her excitement builds as it moves down her legs, but she only climaxes as her feet are covered.  She feels herself hoisted into the air and allowed to exit the plant's \"mouth\", but she does not go far before she is in position for digestion to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    When they have reappeared, June mutters \"The girls who managed to become Dragon Queens seem to have really earned it.  I've lost count of the number of times we have been eaten, and we don't even have the 1st part of the Dragon Crown.  Do you suppose we can just chuck it and find some way to just survive here?\"<br>\r\n   Amelia is made of sterner stuff.  \"I am not giving up.  That crowd will be mine.  And we are making progress.  See, there is the edge of the swamp, and our goal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Indeed, it is in sight.  A few steps and they are on the very edge of the swamp, hiding as they study the menchodragon, a strange beast that seems to be half mechanical parts.  However, its oddities are not as impressive as its size.  Airblast might be bigger in total size, but this dragon had a lot more teeth and mouth, and fighting muscle.  Any of the girls would probably only amount to a large mouthful for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"We're not going to fight it.  So how can we sneak it?\" Amelia asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Well, I do have an idea, but it seems rather risky...\" Keira answers.</span></div></div>",

The dragon turns away and can't see the others entering the cave.  Nor can Keira beyond a quick look.  Her looking anywhere other than at the dragon could alert the dragon about where to look.  She must concentrate on her job and hope the others don't run into trouble.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fortunately it is work she finds interesting.  The dragon is a fascinating combination of meat and machine.  She can't really do much about the meat parts, but the machine is another matter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Of course, it would really help if she was twice her size, or more, and/or the dragon about half its size.  Even at such proportions this would be hard work.  At the actual sizes,... well, she at least is a muscular lass who has trained at such tasks, so it is not impossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Finally she gets the bad bolt free and stares at it in disgust.  \"Totally trash.  I am going to really have to work to make a jury rig.  I don't suppose you have any replacement parts...?\"<br>\r\n    It was more of a grim joke than a request, so Keira is shocked when the dragon coughs, and spits out a bolt, which proves to be the correct type.  After verifying this, Keira whistles \"...Amazing, can you do that for any part?\" <br>\r\n   The dragon shakes its head no, a shake that allows it to look at the cave again, an act that makes Keira very nervous, but she dare not look back.  All she can do is put the replacement part in, and hope the others are doing ok.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    In some respects they are.  The cave is just filled with a real dragon's horde.  Amelia almost faints with happiness.  The other 2 are barely less affected, but manage to keep their mind on the job.  \"Come on Amelia.  We can't take any of this.  We have to get the part of the Dragon Crown.\"  With a sigh, Amelia follows the others to look for the part.<br>\r\n   This is quickly found.  It is in the place of honor, on top of a 15' tower, a 15' slick tower.  It at first looks impossible to reach...<br>\r\n   Krystal mutters \"And I have a rope!  I can toss it up and climb right up.\"<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   Amelia is quick to suggest an alternate plan.  \"Krystal, you are the strong one.  You brace yourself and June will climb you.  Then I will climb you and June.  I should be able to climb the rest of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, we have no time to debate.  Which is it to be?\" </span></div></div>",

We'll try the human ladder.\"  With that, she leans slightly against the tower, bracing herself as much as she can. Jane quickly climbs up her and perches on her shoulders, but slips as Amelia tries to climb her.  The girls end in a mass, pained, but not damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, try again.\" is Amelia's comment.  But Jane keeps falling as Amelia tries to climb her.  \"I'm sorry, but I am ticklish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   \"Well, I guess you will have to try the top position.  Be careful.  A fall from there could be serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   This idea works much better, at least in forming the ladder.  Jane is soon standing on Amelia's shoulders, and reaching up to grab the edge.  Getting over the edge is another story.  Jane may not be a big girl, but she has had few chances to lift a weight larger than a thick book in years.  Scrambling over the edge is at the edge of her ability.  Fortunately Amelia is ready for that and supplies a boost.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The top, and there is the crown part.  Actually, it looks nothing like part of a crown, almost just a scrap of metal.  But she has no doubt this is a part of the crown.  Presumably, it will start looking like a crown when there are more pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    The trip down is merely a little work.  drop the crown to the others.  Then hang down far enough to let Amelia help, and then to the ground.  Now to get out...once Amelia can be dragged away from the shinnies.  \"Look, we have no time.  We can't really carry it, and we will get lots more when one of us is the Queen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   With a sigh, Amelia agrees and follows the others to the entrance.  There they see the dragon still being repaired.  It would seem they can run for it, almost sure to make it, but endangering Keira.  Or they can sneak, which will keep Keira safer, but giving the dragon more time to spot and catch them, thus ruining all their efforts.</span></div></div>",

Well, now there is not choice.  Not even time to glare at June.  They must run!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Even burdened with the crown part, the athletic Krystal quickly has the lead and widens it.  Amelia manages to keep an honorable [and likely safe from being dragon chow] second.  But June is deeply regretting all that time she spent sitting in libraries.  She is hardly in bad shape, even quite good shape, but compared to the other girls...  Every second she thinks she hears the dragon approaching and is sure it is about to capture her.<br>\r\n   So her terror is immense when she trips on a branch and tumbles forward.

Relieved, but puzzled, she takes the time to check on the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Which seems to have hardly even started to chase the girls.

The lovely mechanic is in his claws and at his likely non-existant mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A very scared Keira is still trying to appeal to that mercy, and to more pragmatic needs, reminding the dragon that she had done some repairs, and if he won't eat her, she will do some, a bunch, a whole lot! more. Whatever the dragon wants! But the dragon does not buy that.  That horribly huge mouth opens, and Keira is tossed inside.  The others can only watch as the dragon swallows.

True, even with Angus helping, there is no way she likes being digested, but it is something she is able to survive, at least so far.  Having foot-long needle-sharpt teeth pushed into her repeatedly is another matter.  Maybe Angus can help her survive that too, but she really does not want to take the chance.  Much better that this beastie did not stop to chew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   It is still uncomfortable being swallowed, and when the passage widens a bit, she quickly takes a chance to \"become lodged in the throat\".  More precisely, it's an area where the pressure to continue to the stomach is not serious.  Here, she can pause and recover.  <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n   But she can't stay here, at least not for long.  So what are the options?  Looking around, she discovers that, while dark, the dragon is still lit from within, and she can, with difficulty, see what is ahead.  <br>\r\n   The passage divides in two.  One passage goes to what looks like a typical stomach, which presumably will digest her, and then, if things work out, Angus will rescue her again.  [Just how does he do that?  He is rather secretive about his methods.  Well, as long as it works...]  The other proves to be blocked by a mechanical failure.  A look beyond reveals what looks to be an oil press.  <br>\r\n   Keira suddenly recalls how rusted the dragon is.  This must be why.  It used to create oil for lubrication and rust prevention here but now the raw material, such as her, is blocked from reaching the press.  All she has to do is remove the blockage and it can oil itself again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Now why would she want to do that?  Given that it had eaten her, it was hardly a friend.  Worse, she discovers as she looks over the blockage that removing it will release a flood that will force her into the press, with nasty results, results she can only hope that Angus can get her out of.  Most likely she will become the first supply of oil for the dragon.  No, much better to just continue to the stomach where she is fairly sure Angus will save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   But doesn't she owe the dragon something?  She was trying to rob it, and her friends seem to have succeeded.  It would only be fair to give it something in return, such as the renewed ability to oil itself...<br>\r\n   With her?  There are limits to how much she owes.<br>\r\n   But she never did like the idea of broken machinery, and she can repair this...</span></div></div>",

It did just took 1 minute and it was starting to work again. She couldn't savour her victory because the stomach of the mecho-dragon started to work too and the stomach acids were starting to burn her feets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n''Hey you, mecho-dragon.

I'd rather like some air to breathe.\" she didn't expect the plant to listen to her, but to her surprise, the plant responded immediatly by opening it's petals a small crack. It liked this food, it cooperated, unkike the other many prey it had fed on. June sighed. Shen suddenly, as if someone had pulled a plug, the juices started draining. the hole in which they were draining seemed to be directly below June. she looked down. \"Well,\" she said to herself, \"I can't possibly stay here, so I might as well go down, though i don't much like the thought of it. Then again, I have no choice.\" And she let her slimy self slide down the hole, while sighing because she felt very tingly. maybye that was the juices... The tube slid her down a long, narrow, hallway and it went on for a long while. June grew very tired of sliding down this chute, for she had nothing to do. her books, bag, and clothes had all been dissolved already, and the passage was too narrow to throw your arms up or anything like that.

June laughed, it tickeled a lot. a third tounge twisted around her anckles and entered her crotch. june shrieked with delight and laughed. a fourth tounge was stationary, then it reached deep down inside the dragon's mouth and  camr back up again with a male figure. June motioned for the boy to come closer, and the tounge moved foreward. she had never seen this boy in her life, but June, covered in dragon saliva and being rubbed and licked by a dragon, was kissing this boy as feircly as she could. the boy, whose clothes were removed courtesy of a fifth tounge, was returning her kisses and trying to embrace her, but having some difficulty due to the mass amount of dragon saliva. the third tounge released the crotch, and the boy entered it. writhing and squirming, the boy and June were slowly retracting back into the dragon's mouth.  niether of them noticed. when, at last, June looked up and saw she was inside the dragon's mouth, she yelled, \"THANK YOU,DRAGGIE!!!!!!!!!!!!\" and together, the two were consumed and digested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\ntwo hours later, the dragon was sitting in bed, stroking it's belly, when a voice rang out. it seemed to be coming from it's stomach. the voice said \"Draggie! can you send down another boy? this one got digested!\"</span></div></div>",

She may have gotten lost.\"  Keira offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"That seems reasonable.\"  June agrees.  At least compared to staying here and trying to decide if being eaten by Angus is actually a good idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  A minute later June is wondering if it actually was a good idea to split up.  True, there is a large area to cover, but alone, things seem a bit scary.  Still she had her dragon with her and that is a fair amount of defense.  <br>\r\n   But it is a hot day and a short break for a rest is in order, and Floral likes a sunny rock while June wants the shade nearby.  That she is out of sight should make no difference when she can just yell for any needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, she could yell if Angus wasn't sneaking up behind her and swallowing her head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   June gives out a scream, hopelessly muffled, and her hands jerk up to try and pry Angus off her.  But the result is that her hands get caught in Angus' mouth, and then slurped inside.  Before she really knows what is happening, she realizes she is helpless.  She can thrash around, but she has no way to stop Angus from finishing his meal and no way to alert Floral of her peril.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Angus is aware his meal is helpless too and takes his time devouring her.  Getting every bit of taste he can, he licks her inch by inch. Her shoulders vanish and then her breasts are attacked, a distinctly familiar effort that gets additional thrashing from the doomed lass, but does not even slow the process down.  <br>\r\n   He does slow down at her pussy, a delay June is shocked to find quite enjoyable.  He keeps his tongue active everywhere and June thrashes again, for a quite different reason.  When he resumes swallowing, she is disappointed, not horrified.  <br>\r\n   Not that it makes much difference.  Her legs are slurped down like oversized spaghetti and she is bounced around in his belly until she is squeezed into a ball shape that takes the least possible space.  Unable to move, she finds it impossible to stay awake either, and drifts off to a sleep she fears she will not wake from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Keira a fair time later is getting quite worried.  Not only has she not found Krystal, or Amelia, but now she can't find June either.  She looks around, but sees no threat, or anything out of order..  Wait, are these tracks on the ground?..  She bends over to see...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   That is when Angus bites her ass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Keira is too surprised to do anything.  Possibly, if Angus had sharp teeth, she might have realized something was wrong in time to act.  Instead Angus gets a firm grip and jerks the woman back, which then sends her deeper into his mouth when he stops pulling.<br>\r\n    For Keira, it feels like she is being jerked back and then that she can't straighten up.  In fact, her face is almost forced into her knees.  She manages to look back and see that Angus has swallowed her middle!  But there seems to be nothing to do about it.  She sees also that she dropped her weapon when she was pulled back, and Airblast is too far away to hear any cry for help, not that he could do much that would help even if he was here.  <br>\r\n    That is no reason not to try, and Keira screams for all she is worth as she tries to scramble to the wrench she had dropped.  Futile, clearly, but giving up has too obvious a result.<br>\r\n   Angus launches into his habit of licking his food, and this time her most vital parts are immediately available.  Like June, Keira finds that his attentions may be depraved and unwanted, but they can also be exciting and very enjoyable.  Her cries and struggles grow weak, and then she screams as she climaxes, and again, and again.  When Angus resumes swallowing, she is in no state to resist.  <br>\r\n   Clearly Angus's mouth must be wider than she had ever seen it, but Keira finds her head forced between her legs, as bent over as she can be.  He continues to swallow and all too soon, Keira can see a ring of darkness starting to limit her range of vision as Angus takes in her head.  That ring rapidly narrows and then is full of arms and legs.  And she can feel her bottom reaching his belly.  <br>\r\n   The rest of her rapidly follows and she too finds herself in a ball of flesh waiting for an end that does not look to be far off....<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

The dangers of Dragon Isle would surely have killed them as it has done to so many others.  Much better they be changed to dragons by him [and be his wives].

Next to her lies Angus, who apparently hit a growth spurt and has nearly doubled in size.  While Angus is still small for a dragon, only reaching 6 feet in length, he has become a more formidable opponent against other dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom overhead, Airblast spots Amelia and Angus and dives down in order to inquire about the location of Keira.  When Airblast lands, Angus takes the opportunity to pounce on the emerald green dragon.  The aggressive action catches Airblast off guard, who expected to meet up with friends and found a foe, and the blue dragon pins Airblast to the ground.  With Angus\u2019s mouth grasped firmly around the head of serpentine dragon, Angus slurps down Keira\u2019s companion, who forms a thrashing bulge in Angus\u2019s neck as he slowly makes his way down to Angus\u2019s waiting stomach.  The bulge formed by the writhing dragon fell still in the stomach and soon Angus\u2019s belly shrank o where there was no noticeable difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam also stumbles upon the camp and too falls for the ploy.  William finds himself pinned by Angus with his snout pressed firmly against the back of Angus\u2019s slimy throat.  As William slid down Angus\u2019s throat, William\u2019s thick fur matted against William\u2019s skin as the saliva saturated the fur making it easier for Angus to swallow William down.  During William\u2019s decent, the manticore lashed wildly with his scorpion tail and struck Angus several times leaving minor gashes in Angus\u2019s scales, and piercing Angus\u2019s flesh.  When the manticore\u2019s tail was all that was left as it laid in the fetal position inside of Angus\u2019s stomach, Angus bit off the tip of the tail to prevent himself from being stung on the inside and slurped down all that remained of William.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFloral had just finished sunning herself and headed off to find June when she caught the last of the scene between Angus and William.  Fearing the worst for June, Floral charged into the camp spewing hot flames from her mouth.  Angus dodged right, but still sluggish from feasting on William, he did not completely avoid the blow.  Pain shot down his left side as the bright flames licked his azure scales.  Angus strikes out to bite Floral but she quickly evades and rams full force into Angus.  He stumbles to the side and wildly lashes with his tail.  With a lucky shot Angus catches the hammerhead dragon in the knee and with a loud crack Floral crashes to the ground.  Angus takes the beaten dragon\u2019s head into his mouth and begins to devour the thrashing mass.  Angus begins to balloon out as more of the scarlet dragon fills his stomach, already full with William.  Angus only pauses at Floral\u2019s sex where he begins to probe the slick passage with his tongue.  Floral begins to squirm more as Angus probes deeper until she climaxes.  Once Angus had his fun, he finished swallowing the dragon, slurping up the tail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia resumes consciousness moments later to see Angus ballooned up like a beach ball despite the fact that he was 3 feet longer that he was last time.  Amelia laughs to her self and looks around.  She first notices the carnage and believes that Angus must have saved her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe runs up to Angus and hugs him exclaiming, \u201cThank you for protecting me Angus.  You are the best friend a girl could have!\u201d  Angus gives her a look that Amelia takes to be a smile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, noticing that none of the other girls were around, she asks, \u201cWhat happened to the other three girls?\u201d  Angus shows Amelia his open jaws.  \u201cYou didn\u2019t eat them, did you?\u201d she inquires with a horrified look on her face.  Angus nods.  \u201cAnd their dragons?\u201d Amelia continues.  Angus nods again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Amelia recalls the dragon spirits words, \u201cOh you can have any number of dragons. But only the first is absolutely loyal to you and will always try to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amelia feels Angus\u2019s hot slimy mouth tickle her feet but doesn\u2019t struggle.  Angus takes this as a sign of approval and begins to feed on Amelia.  She fees Anguses powerful throat muscles rippling at her toes and she begins to slide over his rough tongue.  Hot saliva drips onto her as she is bathed in the mucous of Angus\u2019s mouth to make the journey easier. Slowly she is drawn in, up to her hips, and then to her breasts and then finally she says goodbye to Angus as his mouth closes around her head.  The lips seal off the light and Amelia hears the heart beat of her friend as she slips down the slick esophagus.  She feels her toes push against the stomach sphincter which relaxes to let her in.   The rest of her body soon follows and Amelia curls into the fetal position in the stomach as the strong walls massage her.  Slowly her mind starts to drift off as she runs out of air.  She faintly feels a burning sensation as the stomach acids begin to do their job and slips into an eternal slumber.  Soon she will be permanently united with her friend Angus.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can trust me.\" The dragon seemed to understand, and just placed her head back on her claws. June gently touched the dragon's neck, expecting it to snap at her, but the dragon remained motionless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, at least you like me. Do you want to help me survive on this island? Without you, I might die, so please?\" The dragon yawned, turned her head towards her, and gave a small nod. June was overjoyed, \"Yes! Thank you! Now for a name. Since you're red and are a female, how about Floral-Foehn?\" The dragon nodded, but then used her tail to rip off June's shirt and bra, leaving her perky breast exposed to the air. \"Hey!

My name Keer'el, and I am the High Dragon,\" Keer'el began grandly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long ago, humans and dragons lived together on this island.  The humans worshipped us dragons, who in turn worshipped the great Moon Dragon.  Here, the high dragon and the human high priestess directed worship and presented sacrifices to the Moon Dragon.  This went on for many generations, until one day the Moon Dragon saw fit to bestow a great blessing on all the humans who lived on this island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Moon Dragon showed the High Dragon and the High Priestess how to perform a special ritual, such that the High Priestess' soul was projected from her body at the height of the ritual, and then the High Dragon swallowed the High Priestess whole, severing the spirit's connection.  The spirit was then placed in a nearby dragon egg.  When the egg hatched, it contained the reincarnated soul of the High Priestess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeer'el paused a moment before carrying on.  \"This ritual was repeated for every human on the island.  Hardly a fortnight had passed before the islands entire human population has been reincarned as new dragons.  The Temple of the Moon Dragon fell into disrepair as there were no humans around to maintain it, though the dragons still met regularly here to pay their respects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Moon Dragon told us that one day new humans would come to the island, and one of them would pass the trials to become the new High Priestess, and the Moon Dragon would bless her and she would become the Queen of the Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, no human has set foot on this island since the Grand Consuming, nearly five hundred years ago, until today.  Most dragons have forgotten human language and customs, though we can all talk, at least to each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first to visit this temple was Krystal.  I hadn't eaten in a couple of days, and I was very hungry.  I used my powers as the High Dragon to mesmerize her and swallowed her whole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I felt guilty, of course, so when another young girl, Keira, came along, I told her what I told you, but, sadly, she did not pass the trials, so I mesmerized and swallowed her too, I didn't want her to suffer a worse fate out on the island somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paused again, before going on, \"A few hours later, Amelia came here.  She also undertook the trials, passed them, but asked to take the Consuming Ritual, as all the humans did before her.  I begged her to reconsider but she would not be dissuaded - she wanted to be a dragon and that was that.  My mate and I do have a clutch of fresh eggs, so I invoked the ancient magics in the inner sanctum of the Temple and devoured her.  Her spirit now rests in one of those eggs, which should hatch in a few more weeks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That brings us up to now, June.  Are you ready to test yourself against the trials?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune thought a moment, before she realized she had no choice but to accept.  \"Yes, I am Keer'el.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the first test is the easiest,\" Keer'el stated, before exhaling a stream of dense smoke over June.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune smelled the smoke, realizing it was very sweet and not unpleasent smelling.

When all was quiet they could see the entrance had been totally blocked by the landslide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we'll just have to find another way inside.  There's no way we can clear this.\"  June stated, a little disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.  But, we may as well rest here for the night,\" Fra'xal said, as he yawned and lay down on the ground.  June though about going on through the night, but decided against suggesting it, as she was very tired from walking all day through the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune walked over the Fra'xal and lay down on the ground next to him.  Fra'xal folded a wing over June and began licking her, the long strokes of his forked tongue cleaning away the grime and dirt that had accumulated from June's long adventure on the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune sighed and relaxed, laying out on the ground with her new wings splayed out beneath her.  Soon Fra'xal's licks became a little more than just simple grooming as his tongue began working her still human breasts, and spending a little longer in the spaces between her scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, just as June was feeling nothing but deep relaxation and more than a little arousal, Fra'xal once again exhaled his smoky breath over her, and this time June felt the full effect of its pheremone-laden scent, and suddenly felt and urgent desire for her dragon like nothing she had ever felt before.  \"Oh, Fra'xal\", she moaned as she inhaled his scent, suddenly tensing up.  Fra'xal forced her back down onto her back again with a foreclaw, smiling as he exhaled more of his breath over her, driving June mad with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune's tail twitched and bumped into Fra'xal's tail, and instantly twined hard around it.  Fra'xal's own member slid out of its shaft quickly in response, as his reptilian eyes narrowed to tiny slits.  He stepped off of June and nosed her side, and June, not needing any more prompting, rolled over onto her hands and hindclaws, lifting her draconic rear into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal nosed the base of her tail, and she raised it, tensing herself for what was to come, still feeling an incredibly urgent need for it that overwhelmed her thoughts of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal was more than happy to oblige, as he grasped June's shoulders with his foreclaws, gave her tail a squeeze, and drove himself inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune gave out a very loud yelp as Fra'xal's full length penetrated her, her new womanhood now properly sized to it, and as Fra'xal thrust impossibly deeply into her again and again she could only drive her talons into the dirt to hold herself in place as waves of sheer pleasure took her to heights she had never known before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs June reached her peak, her womanhood clamped down hard on Fra'xal's member as he drove deeper into her than he had yet.  Fra'xal roared in sheer pleasure, a small jet of flame and a great cloud of smoke escaping from his maw.  June inhaled deeply, its intoxicating effects causing her to give out a very draconic roar of ecstasy herself, as she felt Fra'xal's seed once again fill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey held like that for several minutes as conscious thought returned to them both.  June felt a tingling sensation begin in her fingers and talons, which gradually spread to her entire body, though she couldn't be sure whether it was from the enthusiasm of her and Fra'xal's mating or from more of his energies being released into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal whispered into her ear, \"Yes, you are the one\", before gently lying them both down on their sides, with Fra'xal still mounted on June, his member inside her, which refused to release its grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, still mated, June quickly fell fast asleep, despite the tingling.</span></div></div>",

Fra'xal was still asleep, with his forelegs wrapped around June, but he had withdrawn from her during the night and she found she could untwine her tail and roll out of his embrace without waking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood, noticing that she did so on all fours now.  She padded silently over to a nearby pool, and looked at her reflection, pleased at the changes that had taken place during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body was now entirely reptilian, a bright red dragon like her mate.  She was just a little smaller than he, though still quite large in relation to most animals, though she did notice that her muzzle was short and little rounded still, with her crest being very underdeveloped, and the row of spines running from the top of her head to the tip of her long, shapely tail being little more than bumps.  A long silver mane ran from her head halfway down her back, and rather than a spade her tail also terminated in a small tuft of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe contracted some new muscles in her long, draconic neck, and suddenly spouted a stream of fire, incinerating a nearby bush.  She gasped, and noticed for the first time how hungry she was, and thought it was quite fortuitous that a doe was nearby.  It was hiding but she could smell it easily, and quickly spotted it in some underbrush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently she moved behind it, crouched, and then pounced, pinning her hapless prey below her before it had any idea she was even there.  Her new instincts took over, and she unhinged her lower jaw, picking up the terrified doe in her forepaws and swallowing it whole, headfirst.  She found its taste quite pleasing and despite it being nearly a third her size she devoured it quite easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating her breakfast, she walked back over to where Fra'xal had been sleeping, and found him awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, you only become more beautiful every time I see you.  I think we shall have to give you a proper dragon name soon, though I'm rather fond of June,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune nuzzled Fra'xal before saying, \"We need to find another way into the mountain still, so that I may become the Queen of Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Fra'xal agreed, \"We need to do it quickly.  Only a dragon in heat reacts to a male's smoke the way you do, soon you will need to nest to lay your eggs.  We need to finish our quest within the next few days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune's scaled turned a deep shade of crimson as she realized that soon she was going to be mother to a brood of young hatchlings, something that would have been mere fantasy just a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal continued, \"Do you think you can fly?  There's another entrance into an old cave system on the summit, but your wings still seem a little underdeveloped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune thought about it a moment, then experimentally skipped into the air, beating her wings.  She glided a few feet before returning to the ground.  \"No,\" she said, \"I can't fly.. though I can glide.\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Fra'xal thought.  \"We can spend the day together here.  One more day should complete your transformation.  Or we can look around for another entrance.\"</span></div></div>",

He showed her to control her fire breathing so she wouldn't burn the jungle down, how to stalk, catch, and devour the other predatory creatures that lived on the island, and a hundred other similar tricks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the sun hung low in the western sky, she and Fra'xal found themselves at the edge of a small stream.  She knew what they had to do but the right moment hadn't come for it yet, but she had some ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay down on the bank, with Fra'xal also lying down beside her, she yawned, and 'accidentally' sent a few wisps of her smoke drifting over Fra'xal's muzzle.  Fra'xal inhaled his mate's scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal only smiled as nuzzled June, exhaling his own odor over her.  Its effect was just as powerful, though not quite as urgent, and June felt oddly pleased that she would be able to enjoy herself more tonight as she rolled over onto her side, slowly twining her tail about Fra'xal's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal growled low and squeezed June's tail as he took her underdeveloped muzzle inside of his, his forked tongue sliding out of his maw and wrapping around June's tongue.  They held like that for several minutes as they continued to exchange breaths, before Fra'xal released his mate's muzzle from his and slowly began grooming her with long, sensuous strokes of his tongue, first running over her face, then her long, serpentine neck, her chest, torso, and then, first probing, then thrusting, his tongue inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune growled herself in arousal as she rolled onto her feet, digging her claws into the ground and lifting her rear and tail.  She craned her neck around so her head was facing her mate, inhaled, and then exhaled a great stream of her own smoke over him.  His tongue gave her one final thrust, before he withdraw, his eyes narrowed to predatory slits in his arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal gave June's tail a firm squeeze as he mounted her, folding his wings over his mate and exhaling a cloud of concentrated smoke.  June inhaled deeply, once again, an urgent need for Fra'xal overwhelming her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFra'xal obliged as he thrust inside of her, slowly at first, then gradually building in intensity.  June squirmed and growled beneath him as Fra'xal drilled his shaft deeply inside of her, their smoky breath driving each other mad with desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune reached her climax first, her insides once again clamping down hard on Fra'xal's manhood as she threw her hips back and took his full length inside of her.  Her roar of ecstasy shook Fra'xal's body hard, that and his mate grabbing hold of him triggering his own climax, and he roared with her as he released another load of his seed into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJune could do nothing but shudder in delight as she felt her mate's warm seed inside of her, and a different warmth began spreading through her.  Once again she felt tired and suddenly needed to sleep, and she lay down, managing to relax her womanhood enough for Fra'xal to withdraw, though it clamped down again as he withdraw, not so much as a drop of her fluids or his seed spilling out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir tails still coiled, Fra'xal put a wing over June as she fell once again into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>June beat her wings against the sky, soaring up above the trees, and then the clouds, toward the peak of dragon mountain. Up until the fateful flight that had brought her to this island, she had been nervous going on planes. Now, as a dragon, the sensation of the wind blowing past her streamlined body was ecstasy. She was free, invincible, and unmatched in her grace and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment that she truly realized, that no longer was she June, the shy, dainty little bookworm, but now a dragoness. She needed a new name for herself, as Fra'xal had suggested, to fit her new identity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am now Jun'exia, soon to become the dragon queen.\" she proclaimed, using her newfound powers so that her statement was heard by all the denizens of the island.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had she made this announcement when she reached the summit of dragon mountain. Jun'exia landed softly upon the protruding ledge, and was faced by a magically sealed oval door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had no handles, not that Jun'exia expected there would be. A glowing statue of a dragon was looked down upon her, standing guard over the doorway. The dragon curved its head down to face Jun'exia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Jun'exia, I am Kar'sal, the guardian of the draconic pearl. Before I open the door, I have one question that you must answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun'exia nodded. She had aced every exam she had taken in high school and had graduated with distinguished high honors. Yet like the trials she had taken on the island, she couldn't read a textbook and memorize the answers. No, this exam was to judge her moral character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all Jun'exia, why is it that you wish to become the Queen of the Dragons?\" asked Kar'sal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until that moment, Jun'exia hadn't devoted much time to contemplate this fundamental question. For a moment, her mind went blank. She thought about Floral, who had given her life just to give her the chance to see the Moon Dragon, of her other three companions who had failed the trails, and of Fra'xal, for his kindness and showing her how to be a dragon. Without them, she wouldn't have been where she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, I did so because I was scared; scared that if I didn't, I would be eaten\" Jun'exia began, sensing that honesty would be the better answer. Now that she was a dragon, Jun'exia could see just how vulnerable she had been when she was still human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have come to realize that this is my destiny, that I cannot go back. The denizens on the island depend upon me and I cannot and will not let them down, and if I do become queen it is because of how they have helped me. No matter whether you decide that I am worthy to be queen or not, I will devote myself to restoring the island to its former glory and serving its inhabitants\" said Jun'exia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you truly believe Jun'exia?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that said...</span></div></div>",

Slowly but surely, the door began to open, a bright light emanted from within. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun'exia crawled through the door, and no sooner had she walked inside when it shut behind her. She found herself in a large chamber, its gleaming, ivory walls dotted with numerous small torches. In the center of the chamber was what looked like a huge nest, illuminated by a ray of sunlight. A stairway made out of pure magical energy led up to the ledge, the path behind her dissapating as she ascended.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes grew wide when she caught sight of the Draconic Pearl. There it was, resting atop a petastal made out of marble, had a smooth, frictionless surface, and was about three times the size of a normal dragon egg. On the opposite side of the Draconic Pearl was another ledge, reserved for the dragon king.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body glowing, Jun'exia lifted her neck into the air, calling out for her mate, echoing across the skies over the island. The next moment, streams of red, plasma-like energy entered through the chambers orifice, dancing across the walls before gathering on the opposite side of the pedastal Jun'exia was perched on. They took shape and materialized and when the lights subsided, it revealed her mate, her king, Fra'xal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the glowing subsided, Fra'xal opened his eyes, they locked with Jun'exia's.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Jun'exia, my queen, you have called me and I have come...\" said Fra'xal, his voice filled with awe. \"You are so beautiful, it seems not even a god would be worthy of you, much less a dragon like myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun'exia couldn't help but blush and nuzzle with her mate. \"Oh Fra'xal, my dearest love, it is I who have been so blessed to find a dragon like you. Soon we shall become king and queen over the entire island...\" murmured Jun'exia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let us not waste any more time,\" said Fra'xal.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJun'exia and Fra'xal chanted a prayer to the great dragons above, before they approached the pedastal where the Draconic Pearl lay. She placed her claws upon the Pearl, Fra'xal doing the same with his. The pedastal dissappeared, and a burst of light emanated from the pearl, sending her into a trance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Fra'xal chant a prayer in the draconic language, and dissapated into pure life force. Jun'exia gasped as her body was levitated into the air, unable to control her movements. Opposite of her, the Draconic Pearl ascended, Fra'xal's life force circling it, before burrowing within the pearl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Jun'exia realized what was going on. The Draconic Pearl, in fact, was in reality an egg, and Fra'xal's spirit within it, into a king worthy to share the throne with her, and she would nurture the egg within her womb along with the clutch she already had, so that when Fra'xal was reborn as a king worthy of the throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun'exia found herself being gently shifting to a prone position, legs splaying open as the Pearl's pointed end aimed itself directly at her womanhood. The thought of an object that large burrowing within her, made her pant and moan, her juices leaking out of her and dripping onto floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing could have prepared Jun'exia for what came next. Without warning the Draconic Pearl began to spin rapidly, and then drilled into her womanhood. All Jun'exia could do was roar and thrash in wild ecstasy, as the Pearl's passage stretched her wider and wider to the point where it would surely tear her in half. When the egg was midway through her, Jun'exia gasped out breath, before grasping the Pearl with both claws and pushing it further within her, causing it to glow, while eliciting a fresh round of orgasmic screams.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire world seemed to explode when she burst into orgasm. She gave the loudest roar of all, spraying her juices all over the chamber, and releasing all her magical energies out of her body into the air, which spread through the air until every creature on the island from the smallest insect to the mightiest of dragons, was mating and rejuvenating the island of life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh!! By the great dragons above!! Would it ever end!? Part of her wished it would, yet at the same time wished her orgasm would go on forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after what seemed like an entire lifetime, the Draconic Pearl, which now held Fra'xal spirit, had been taken within her womb. Jun'exia floated back down onto the nest, was laid gently on her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough sore and utterly exhausted, she nonetheless had a sense of fulfillment. She was now queen, and before too long, would not only lay her clutch of eggs, but also reincarnate her mate, Fra'xal. Content with the world, Jun'exia closed her eyes and fell into a deep sleep.</span></div></div>",

Jun'exia rolled to the side, then blasted his foreleg with a burst of flames. The old, dry wood burst into flame.<br>\r\n\"Gah! What the-\" the statue's leg exploded, sending chunks of stone and charcoal everywhere. \"OW!\" It yelled, standing on only three legs now.<br>\r\n\"YOU'LL PAY FOR THAT!\" The statue swept its tail across the floor, sending it at Jun'exia.<br>\r\nShe huffed, then leaped into the air, beating her wings to keep her aloft and above the giant tail.<br>\r\nThe floor suddenly stopped, forcing the statue to rebalance itself as Jun'exia landed.  (Whoever thought it was a good idea to change her name, I think I'm going to find you and pour a gallon of milk on your head.)<br>\r\n\"Floor 1,\" The stone dragon mumbled. \"Thought it was further away.\"<br>\r\nAfter a few brief seconds, the walls began moving again.<br>\r\n\"Alright, BREAK OVER!\" He yelled, lunging at June'exia suddenly.<br>\r\nShe yelped and rolled inbetween his legs, then blasted the other foreleg with fire.

After his playtime, he eventually tossed her into his mouth where she rested as he tasted her some more--unable to move, still--and continued his tongue playtime. Finally he swallowed.

Just what I needed, to be completely nude!

You're saying that I can make some makeshift clothes out of those leaves. Good call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of picking and weaving, she managed to make herself a makeshift loincloth out of the leaves, using the bark from the trees to act like a rope, although she left her breasts bare. She also made herself a makeshift dagger out of a sharp, jagged rock, some bark, and a thick stick. \"Okay, now for a name... How about Canopus? Or maybe Miles?\" At the second name, the dragon gave her a look, \"Okay then. Canopus then?\" He nodded, \"Great. Canopus it is.

Oh yeah, I can so do this!\" \"I wouldn't recomend it, if I was you.\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira spun around to see the oddest sight she had ever seen. There, standing before her, was a man, but this man was also a dragon... a Hybrid. His upper body was normal, very muscular, strong arms with his forearms covered in fur ending with claws. A thin tail, his waist down covered in fur ending in clawed feet, large wings on his back, horns, and pointed ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Keira asked, the hybird responded, \"True, my name is Drakonoka, or Drake for short. And like I said before, I wouldn't recomend swimming out into that water.\" \"And why is that?\" \"There is a powerful dragon named Genwakumemu in that lake, a very evil dragon. He guards the crown piece, along with his minions, the Water Demons and Swamp Dragons. If you go into that water, you'll never come out again. Genwakumemu is merciless, and always hungry, I don't think he would pass up on a tasty female snack. Even if you, somehow, survive him, you would have to deal with his minions. So I don't recomend it, you'll have to find another way to get the crown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira thought for a moment, could this guy be trusted, or was he leading her off? \"Can I trust him... or is he trying to get me killed?

A pair of strong jaws closed on her, sealing her in, and Genwakumemu rose out of the water. Letting the water leak out of his teeth, Genwakumemu swallowed, forcing Keira's body to slide down his throat, kicking and screaming. Drake sighed, \"I tried to warn her. I guess he knows best...\" He eyed the moving lump in Genwakumemu's throat as Keira slid down into the stomach, and sighed. \"Why do I have the sudden urge to help her? She didn't take my warning seriously and now she pays the price. So why do I feel bad for her? Do I... No... Maybe... Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside Genwakumemu, Keira landed in his small stomach, about 1/8th filled with liquid, most likely stomach acids. She didn't feel anything, not yet at least, but she knew that soon, the stomach would fill, and she would die. \"No... no... This can't happen... Oohh, stupid Keira, stupid.

Drake reached behind him and pulled out a heroic looking spear, \"Here goes nothing.\" He lunged and stabbed the eye, causing Genwakumemu to roar in agony. He drove the point in deeper, until finally, Genwakumemu crashed onto the ground, dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that worked. Now for her.\" He forced the mouth open and started to crawl down the throat, \"She owes me for this.\" Inside the stomach, Keira was wondering what was going on, until the stomach sphinter opened and Drake's head popped in. \"Hiya, you look like you could use some fresh air. Follow me, unless you want to rot in here.\" \"No, no, no, I'm coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after painfully crawling out of Genwakumemu's thoat and mouth, they both stepped out into the fresh air. Keira wrapped her arms around Drake, \"Oh thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! Without you... I'd be dead. I owe you my life. How can I ever repay you?\" \"I'll think of a way. But you better grab that crown before anything else happens.\" Keira nodded, snatched the crown that had flown from the rock to the mainland, but realized that she didn't have any place to put it. \"Argh! I don't have a bag or anything! I lost everything in the explosion, and then lost my clothes to those two. What next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake couldn't help but chuckle, \"Some prepared warrior you are. If you want... I could help you find the remaining pieces of that crown. Thus I can keep a close eye on you, so you don't end up as monster or dragon chow. And so I don't have to search for you when I think of a way for you to repay me. But I guess you would like to go by yourself. It's your choice.

However, his tail started to rub Keira's womanhood, either by accident or on purpose. She began to moan and quiver, her womanhood was starting to get wet. Drake looked up to see what was going on, and he figured that this would be a good time to tell her a few of the requirements for his assistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to face her, his tail still hard at work, he said as he grabbed her shoulders, \"I hate to say this, but you will need to do some things for me if you want me to help you.

Now let's go.\" He removed his tail from her and started to walk away, Keira suddenly realized this and dashed after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNight fell, and Drake set up a small campsite for the two of them, the dragons sleeping peacefully nearby. Drake had caught a wild boar and cooked it up for Keira and himself. As Keira scarffed down the boar, Drake couldn't help but admire her beauty, until Keira noticed. \"What is so facinating about me? You keep looking at me with that same hungry look. You're not going to eat me, are you?\" Drake couldn't help but chuckle, \"No, no. I've just never seen a human before, so it's a first for me.\" Keira gave him a playful smile, \"I bet you've never seen a naked chick before either.\" Drake gave her a look, \"Oh I have, just not a human. You see, we Hybrids are more like dragons then people, so we don't bother much in the way of clothing, so you will see a lot of us either nearly or completly naked. Heh. Anyway, the reason I've been staring at you is that... well, I find you quite attractive, for a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Keira flushed bright crimson, never has anyone called her attractive, mainly becuase she is normally covered from head to toe in oil or greese. She put down her boar leg and moved closer to Drake, \"Mmm, really? You find me attractive? No one has ever called me that before. I am quite flattered. You know... I could seriously get used to having you around. You seem like a true man, not like most human men. I guess it's the dragon in you, teehee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira started to move in close, until the two of them were barely a hair apart. She started to coo, \"You know, never in my life have I seen a man like you care so much about a idiotic girl like me. You saved me from a terrible fate, so I have to find a way to repay you. Maybe I should just surrender myself to you... forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake's eyes, full of raw power and emotion, looked into Keira's emerald green eyes, which were full of lust. They started to close in, but do they dare go another step further?</span></div></div>",

I see you made it without any trouble, except for nearly turning into a icicle.\" Drake said, licking one of his wounds to clean it. Keira sighed, \"If it wasn't for you, not only would I still be in Genwakumemu's stomach, but carved up by that dragon, and nearly frozen to death. I have to find a way to thank you. But first, tell me, where are we, exactly?\" Drake chuckled, \"A crystal cave filled with magic energy crystal, or know as dragonite crystals. It's a little place I come to every now and then to relax and take a dip in the warm, healing hot springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healing hot springs?\" \"Yeah, the dragonite is used for various purposes. Such as healing deadly wounds, making you more resistant to heat and cold, and reviving a fainted dragon. Since the dragonite is in this cave of hot springs, the dragonite's power is liquified into the water, thus healing hot springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Anyway, you said it makes you more resistant to heat or cold, right? How can I use it for that purpose, since I'm practically running around naked in the middle of a blizzard?\" \"Simple, break off a piece and eat it. As your stomach digests it, the properities will melt into you, thus transforming your body's physical strength. Give it a try.\" Keira walked over to a small piece of crystal, broke it off, and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, she could feel her body change from weak and frail to strong and resistant, she even gained a few more muscles. \"Woah, awesome!\" She walked over to Drake and sat down next to him, \"Drake, how did you survive against that dragon?\" \"Oh, that. I used the legendary power of SinnSaber ot destoy it, but not before that blasted dragon gave me a good thrashing. But I'm fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reached into his bag and pulled out a map of the island, and unrolled it. \"Okay, here is the Ice Sector, and were here. Now, the crown piece is guarded here, in the middle of the sector, by Ice Leviathans. Trust me, one hit of their Freeze Breath, and you will be a icicle. In order to beat them, we need to first go to the Ice Village, just a little to the west from there. Once we're there, we have to find the Water Elemental Key. But the trip is dangerous, filled with thin ice, ice monsters, frost dragons, and leviathans. We will have to be careful if we want to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Elemental Key? What's that, and why do we have to find it?\" \"First off, we have to find it if we want to stop the Ice Leviathans. It will unlock a new power in us for better battles.\" Keria laughed, \"What's so funny?\" She managed to choke, \"I'm sorry, but like I told the Dragon Spirit, this sounds like a video game.\" Drake gave her an odd look, \"Whatever. But if you want to survive here, unlocking the power of the Elemental Keys is crucial. All dragons can do it, when they learn how to use it. I, myself, have been able to use one; the Wind Key. Anyway, once that key is in our possession, those ice creatures won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira Yawned \"\"Okay then, when morning comes, we'll head on out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake Yawned too \"You look tired, would you like to go to sleep?\" \"Yes please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake picked Keira up and slowly deposited her into his mouth, Keira fell asleep just as he started pushing her feet in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Keira woke up before Drake.

I was afraid that your body might not have recovered from the shock. Looks like that dragonite you ate really helped.\" Drake sat down and opened his bag, some arctic fruits rolled out and two large things with many sections, they looked like a cross between a watermellon and an acorn squash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Drake, what exactly are those things?\" Keira said nervously. \"Lunch.\" Drake simply said, giving her a sly smile. \"Translation, please.\" Drake picked on up, tossed it in the air, and exhailed fire, cooking it up. He placed it near her, and did the same with the other, placing it near him. He then reached into his bag and pulled out two thick bamboo straws, giving one to her. \"Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira looked utterly confused, until Drake tapped the thing with the straw, and it opened up to reveal it was a giant pillbug, filled with yellow meat! \"Ah, hot and crispy frost pillbugs, haven't had one in a while.\" he chuckled, looking at Keira's revolted look. Using the straw, he started to suck up the meat, making Keira sick to her stomach, she groaned, \"Drake, you dragons will eat just about anything.\" \"Including you.\" Drake smirked, \"Nice comeback... How... is it?\" \"You might like it. Don't love it until you try it, haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira gulped, and looked at her pillbug, then her stomach roared in hunger. \"I guess I don't have a choice. I guess it would be nice to have a hot meal...\" She repeated what Drake did, and took a small taste, it actually tasted pretty good, for a giant insect. She managed to swallow all the meat when Drake picked up the shell and started eating that too, \"Like I said before, you'll eat just about anything. Is the shell... good?\" \"Yeah, try it.\" She gulped again, and took a bite, surprisingly, it tasted like a ranch potato chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally gulped down her strange meal, she fell asleep in Drake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was roughly awakened as she was pulled out of Drake, again, with a sudden urgency. \"Wake up, we've got company.\" They looked out at the cave tunnel, and out of the dark tunnel came a...</span></div></div>",

They have been acting differently lately... Almost like the time over 100 years ago when Shinryu was released...\" \"Shinryu. I sure hope it is not him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Shinryu?\" Keira asked, Drake explained, \"Shinryu is the Ultimate Dragon of Darkness. Over 100 years ago, he brought death and distruction to this world. It was then that the Dragon of Light, Sennkoh-Coola, the original one, appeared, and finally managed to seal Shinryu in the sacred stone, the Dragon's Soul Stone. There is a reason why the crown pieces were scattered, since they are the key to the Shrine of the Four Sacred Dragons, where Shinryu is kept. You remember that meteor shower about a week ago?\" \"Remember? How could I forget, I nearly got vaped in that shower.\" \"Right, anyway, an ancient lore states that if the northern sky is filled with shooting stars, the seal to Shinryu is breaking. I didn't make the connection at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hybrid nodded, \"It also says that when the seal is breaking or is broken, Shinryu can manipulate any dragon's mind, expecially if they are dark types. That might be the reason why some dragons, like the Ice Leviathans, are acting unusual.\" Keira looked a little worried, \"Does that mean the Dragon Spirit is leading me to my death and the destruction to the world?\" Drake shook his head, \"No, of course not. He is mearly testing you, to see if you have a pure heart or a dark heart. If your heart is pure, you won't release Shinryu, even for the eternal glory and whatnot. He's just seeing if you can be trusted. Nothing more, nothing less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira sighed in relief, \"Whew, I thought that he was evil for a minute there.\" Drake sniffed the air, \"Well, we can't go very far for a little while, there's a blizzard outside, unless you want to freeze. It would be best to stay here until it clears.\" The Hybrid girl shook her head, \"No! We can't stay here! We have to get back to my village and stop those ice creatures!\" Drake turned to Keira, \"Well, what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira scratched the back of her head, \"Um...

Keira sighed, \"If it wasn't for you, not only would I still be in Genwakumemu's stomach, but carved up by that dragon, and nearly frozen to death. I have to find a way to thank you. But first, tell me, where are we, exactly?\" Drake chuckled, \"A crystal cave filled with magic energy crystal, or know as dragonite crystals. It's a little place I come to every now and then to relax and take a dip in the warm, healing hot springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Healing hot springs?\" \"Yeah, the dragonite is used for various purposes. Such as healing deadly wounds, making you more resistant to heat and cold, and reviving a fainted dragon. Since the dragonite is in this cave of hot springs, the dragonite's power is liquified into the water, thus healing hot springs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. Anyway, you said it makes you more resistant to heat or cold, right? How can I use it for that purpose, since I'm practically running around naked in the middle of a blizzard?\" \"Simple, break off a piece and eat it. As your stomach digests it, the properities will melt into you, thus transforming your body's physical strength. Give it a try.\" Keira walked over to a small piece of crystal, broke it off, and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn minutes, she could feel her body change from weak and frail to strong and resistant, she even gained a few more muscles. \"Woah, awesome!\" She walked over to Drake and sat down next to him, \"Drake, how did you survive against that dragon?\" \"Oh, that. I used the legendary power of SinnSaber ot destoy it, but not before that blasted dragon gave me a good thrashing. But I'm fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reached into his bag and pulled out a map of the island, and unrolled it. \"Okay, here is the Ice Sector, and were here. Now, the crown piece is guarded here, in the middle of the sector, by Ice Leviathans. Trust me, one hit of their Freeze Breath, and you will be a icicle. In order to beat them, we need to first go to the Ice Village, just a little to the west from there. Once we're there, we have to find the Water Elemental Key. But the trip is dangerous, filled with thin ice, ice monsters, frost dragons, and leviathans. We will have to be careful if we want to survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Water Elemental Key? What's that, and why do we have to find it?\" \"First off, we have to find it if we want to stop the Ice Leviathans. It will unlock a new power in us for better battles.\" Keria laughed, \"What's so funny?\" She managed to choke, \"I'm sorry, but like I told the Dragon Spirit, this sounds like a video game.\" Drake gave her an odd look, \"Whatever. But if you want to survive here, unlocking the power of the Elemental Keys is crucial. All dragons can do it, when they learn how to use it. I, myself, have been able to use one; the Wind Key. Anyway, once that key is in our possession, those ice creatures won't stand a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira yawned, \"Okay then, when morning comes, we'll head on out. Good night.\" She flopped her head down on his lap, Drake chuckled lightly, \"Good night, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen morning arrives, they headed out on thier journey.

She was in a different dragonite cave, she could tell since there were no hot springs here. She was wrapped up in a blanket, most likely Drake had managed to unearth one from his bag. She huddled by the fire that Drake had built, and was wondering where he went. \"Oh please don't tell me he left me here to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrake walked in at that very moment, \"I see you're awake. Good. I was afraid that your body might not have recovered from the shock.

He placed it near her, and did the same with the other, placing it near him. He then reached into his bag and pulled out two thick bamboo straws, giving one to her. \"Enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira looked utterly confused, until Drake tapped the thing with the straw, and it opened up to reveal it was a giant pillbug, filled with yellow meat! \"Ah, hot and crispy frost pillbugs, haven't had one in a while.\" he chuckled, looking at Keira's revolted look. Using the straw, he started to suck up the meat, making Keira sick to her stomach, she groaned, \"Drake, you dragons will eat just about anything.\" \"Including you.\" Drake smirked, \"Nice comeback... How... is it?\" \"You might like it. Don't love it until you try it, haha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira gulped, and looked at her pillbug, then her stomach roared in hunger. \"I guess I don't have a choice. I guess it would be nice to have a hot meal...\" She repeated what Drake did, and took a small taste, it actually tasted pretty good, for a giant insect. She managed to swallow all the meat when Drake picked up the shell and started eating that too, \"Like I said before, you'll eat just about anything. Is the shell... good?\" \"Yeah, try it.\" She gulped again, and took a bite, surprisingly, it tasted like a ranch potato chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finally gulped down her strange meal, she fell asleep in Drake's arms, only to be awakened roughly by him. \"Wake up, we've got company.\" They looked out at the cave tunnel, and out of the dark tunnel came a...</span></div></div>",

They have been acting differently lately... Almost like the time over 100 years ago when Shinryu was released...\" \"Shinryu. I sure hope it is not him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Shinryu?\" Keira asked, Drake explained, \"Shinryu is the Ultimate Dragon of Darkness. Over 100 years ago, he brought death and distruction to this world. It was then that the Dragon of Light, Sennkoh-Coola, the original one, appeared, and finally managed to seal Shinryu in the sacred stone, the Dragon's Soul Stone. There is a reason why the crown pieces were scattered, since they are the key to the Shrine of the Four Sacred Dragons, where Shinryu is kept. You remember that meteor shower about a week ago?\" \"Remember? How could I forget, I nearly got vaped in that shower.\" \"Right, anyway, an ancient lore states that if the northern sky is filled with shooting stars, the seal to Shinryu is breaking. I didn't make the connection at first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hybrid nodded, \"It also says that when the seal is breaking or is broken, Shinryu can manipulate any dragon's mind, expecially if they are dark types. That might be the reason why some dragons, like the Ice Leviathans, are acting unusual.\" Keira looked a little worried, \"Does that mean the Dragon Spirit is leading me to my death and the destruction to the world?\" Drake shook his head, \"No, of course not. He is mearly testing you, to see if you have a pure heart or a dark heart. If your heart is pure, you won't release Shinryu, even for the eternal glory and whatnot. He's just seeing if you can be trusted. Nothing more, nothing less.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeira sighed in relief, \"Whew, I thought that he was evil for a minute there.\" Drake sniffed the air, \"Well, we can't go very far for a little while, there's a blizzard outside, unless you want to freeze. It would be best to stay here until it clears.\" The Hybrid girl shook her head, \"No! We can't stay here!

As they went closer Keira saw a cave. \"What is that? Is that your cave?\", Airblast just nudged her and nodded and clambered into the cave. Keira was left outside to wait. Airblast came charging out and picked her up and went above the water. Keira screamed \"What are you doing?!\"... </span></div></div>",

Though some distance away from the explosion, the fireball had touch her only by an centimeter. She was wounded critically anyhow.

Looking upwards she caught a glimpse of the open maw descending upon her, before it cut out all light. Blaze pushed her head down forcing Krystal's head into her throat then, stretching her mouth she continued push her head lower, using the hanger floor to force Krystal deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of minutes Blaze's lips brushed the cold, stone floor. She closed her mouth, Krystal's feet kicked against the inside of her lips, most of  Krystal's body was now struggling in her throat. She raised her head and slowly tilted it till her nose was pointing straight at the ceiling, then gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she felt Blaze preparing to swallow her,  Krystal's struggles turned to pleading. The swallow lasted only a fraction of a second as a ripple ran through every muscle in Blaze's neck, then she was slowly sliding down the tight oesophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the powerful muscles pushing her down. She could hear Blaze licking her lips, hear the steady beating of the dragon's heart, hear the hungry groaning of the waiting stomach and, more and more, she could smell the acrid fumes of the digestive fluids below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon she was pushed from out of the throat and into Blaze's dark stomach. The heat was overpowering forcing her to pant, the air smelt of dead meat and the chemical scent of acids. She was in a sack of living flesh, mucus and acids covering the muscle, feeling around she found she could touch every inch of the stomach from where she was sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the stomach swinging  with each step as Blaze walked back to her own sleeping area, then a sudden jerk as she lay down. The stomach gurgled ominously and the walls started to churn slightly. Above the noise she could hear Blaze yawn, sleepy, happy and full. She Pushed herself against the stomach wall \u201cBlaze!\u201d No response, \u201cBlaze, please!\u201d she begged, her terror showing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally learning some manners are we, food?\u201d Blaze taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, please... don't do this\u201d she begged. The stomach's gurgling grew louder and Krystal could feel the fluids rising around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze groaned \u201cHmmmm, be quiet food\u201d she started to massage her full stomach, and felt the digestion speed up in response. Inside Krystal began to thrash, both hoping to make Blaze sick and refusing to die without a fight. Her struggles were short-lived however, heat and lack of oxygen drover her to exhaustion and forced her to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGiving up?\u201d Blaze licked her lips at the thought \u201csoon you're going to be soup in my intestines, nutrients for my body.\u201d she burped, tasting Krystal's flavour on her breath \u201cGoodbye Krystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was now struggling not to drown, rising digestive fluids and the constant churning of Blaze's stomach meant she was spending more and more time with her head beneath the fluids, and each breath she got contained less oxygen than the last. She could feel the dragons body waiting for her, wanting her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she was pushed under, she struggled once more to reach the surface then realised that this time she wasn't going to make it. She kicked weakly a few more times before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze lay, curled around her full belly, after a few minutes she started to snore.</span></div></div>",

The Manticore let out a murr as it enjoyed it's human meal wiggling downwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was in deep water as her new found friend got it's maw down over her tummy and clamped it's jaws around her torso. \"No stop it!\" she called struggling harder in the flesh but soon she was pressed right in to the stomach of the lion type creature.

To her dismay, he responded by gently nudging her forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam nodded towards the dragon, and Krystal carefully looked up to meet its gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, neither of them budged, giving Krystal a chance to look the beast over. She guessed it to be about 12 feet tall, as well as around 25 feet from head to tail. Between the horns on its head sprouted a dark purple mane that flowed gracefully down its serpentine neck. Bumpy ridges continued past the dragon's folded wings and along its back all the way down to its arrowhead-tipped tail. Each claw on its three-toed feet was at least the length of her hand, and its glistening teeth were of a similar size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when those teeth began to part, Krystal finally lost her nerve. She dropped to the ground and closed her eyes, terrified from the anticipation of those fangs digging into her well-toned skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, instead, the dragon spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose it would only be polite for me to say 'hello,' wouldn\u2019t it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal blinked. The dragon's voice was clearly feminine, not to mention somewhat calming in spite of its sarcastic tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, my name's Veluur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Krystal lifted her head back up and dared to answer. \"\u2026Um, hello to you, too, I guess\u2026\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, come now, little one!\" Veluur said brightly, sitting down and lowering her head to Krystal's level. \"There's no reason to be frightened. I'm one of the friendly dragons; trust me! I wouldn't harm a fly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal narrowed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you don't take this dragoness at her word?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal shot to her feet. \"Are you kidding me?\" she exclaimed, clenching her fists. \"You expect me to TRUST you? In the little time I've been on this freaking island, I've been treated as nothing more than someone's lunch! First it was one giant snake, then a second giant snake, then this manticore here \u2013 who I thought was my friend after he saved me from the snakes \u2013 turned on me and ate me himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And yet you're still alive, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does...\" Krystal's intended response suddenly caught in her throat. \"Wait...um, I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur chuckled. \"I think you need not worry about William's loyalty, young Krystal. I know all about your unfortunate escapade this morning, what with my mind-reading and all that. It sounds as though you'd wandered into a python breeding ground, and your manticore friend felt that using his gut as a temporary human storage chamber was the best course of action to bring you here safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.

The room was built in a perfect circle, with support beams arching up to the peak of the domed ceiling high overhead. Glowing plates were strategically placed around the walls to bathe the entire chamber in a golden light. Only a passage exiting the room on the opposite end was too dim for Krystal to see into. Set along the outer edge of the room were six hexagonal platforms, which circled around a small pedestal that presented a shimmering, cloud-white orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to my home,\" Veluur said with a smile. \"Although you might be more intrigued to know this is also the Temple of Souls, and it is here where you can become the Queen of Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's eyes widened. \"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur chuckled. \"I thought that might get your attention. See that orb there?\" She nodded towards the pedestal in the center. \"Go and touch it, unless you still don't think I'm trustworthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal frowned as she looked at the orb. It didn't look to be anything special. Granted, it didn't seem to be dangerous, either, so maybe Veluur wasn't trying to trick her. Maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Krystal advanced to the pedestal. From a closer angle, the orb perched on top looked to be made of clear glass, with the white color coming from a smoky wisp that filled the entire orb. She gingerly reached her hand out, with a single finger extended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant she touched the glass, a massive jolt shot through Krystal's finger and into the rest of her body. She hunched over, her knees buckled, and tried to pull away, but found that her finger was stuck to the orb. As the shock flowed through more of her muscles, Krystal feared that the pain would rip her body to shreds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jolt cut off as quickly as it had started, and Krystal's finger was finally released from the orb. Looking herself over, Krystal couldn't see any obvious changes, and yet, she still felt different, like something had entered and filled her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What...happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur approached her. \"The same thing that happens to every girl who touches the orb, of course. You see, that orb is filled with draconic magic in its purest form. By touching it, some of that magic flowed into your body and merged with your spirit, allowing you to use a little of our magic yourself. Good thing, too, because without that magic, you wouldn't be able to continue your quest to become Queen of Dragons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean there's more? I thought you said the orb would make me the queen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragoness burst into laughter. \"Oh, goodness, no! What I said was that you'd become the queen inside this temple. The magic orb was only step one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. So what's step two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur's comical tone suddenly vanished. \"Well, I'll tell you.\" She crouched down so that their heads were only a few feet apart. \"But first, I must ask you something, Krystal. Are you willing to humble yourself, swallow your pride, or risk your very life, even, for the sake of having a chance at success?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal was taken aback. \"Um...well, if that's what it takes, then I suppose so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better be, little one. Because you aren't going to like step two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why's that?\"</span></div></div>",

Her tongue shot out and wrapped itself around Krystal's arm, then pulled the girl into her open jaws. The dragoness flicked her head, tossing Krystal further into the mouth so that only her limbs remained outside. As she stood up, Veluur gave Krystal's body a couple of quick licks, adding to her extreme displeasure, which she made clear by flailing her arms and legs for all she was worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting Krystal to accidentally hurt herself on the sharp teeth, Veluur lifted her tongue to drop the girl's head and shoulders into her throat. This brought her limbs inside Veluur's jaws, allowing her to safely shut her mouth. Rather than waste any more time, the red dragoness raised her head skyward. A few swallows later, and Krystal was on a trip down her esophagus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal winced as she was squeezed through an opening and forced into the stomach. She felt the chamber stretch to accommodate her, and she ultimately ended up curled into a ball with very little room to maneuver. To make matters worse, her limited air supply carried the foul stench of rotten meat, making it difficult to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, as terrified and cramped as she was, Krystal immediately began punching and kicking as much as the stomach walls allowed her to. She was going to get out of here, no matter what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Veluur's voice sounded from above her. \"Krystal! Please, you need to calm down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down?!\" Krystal screamed. \"After you ATE me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your alarm is understandable. However, this is the only way to activate the magic you've been granted. Your magic allows you to enhance my very essence, but it can only be done while you're inside my body. I didn't make up the rules. Believe me, I don't like this any more than you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Liar! You were tasting me before you swallowed me! Don't think I didn't notice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Well, okay. You got me there. But, honestly, this is for your own good. This way, you can practice your magic in a safe environment, where failure doesn't lead to digestion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the exact opposite of a safe environment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal, in order for this to work, you're going to have to trust me. Your magic won't work while you're frenzied or angry. Take it easy. Relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal briefly paused to weigh her options, then eased up her muscles as she used the breathing techniques she'd picked up from high school track to calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Veluur spoke. \"Now, for the magical part.\"</span></div></div>",

It's subtle at first, but by the time the process is complete, it's the best feeling in the world!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReassured, Krystal relaxed and waited for any sign that the enhancement magic was about to kick in. As the minutes dragged on, she even found the stomach to be somewhat cozy, much to her surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Veluur looked over to William. \"Many thanks, my friend,\" she sighed. \"Consider your debt paid in full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manticore nodded and curled up near the door, intending to sleep off the python he'd eaten when he saved Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips, Veluur lay down, as well. She turned her head so she could admire the lump in her gut that was Krystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, my darling,\" she whispered. \"Let's make some magic happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Krystal could feel the walls around her begin to tickle. At the same time, she noticed something else, as if the magical energy filling her body was starting to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! I think it's working!\" As quickly as the energy left her, it was replaced by excitement as she awaited the moment when she'd finally get out of the dragoness's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it seemed as though the magical energy was collecting immediately above her, causing the stomach to stretch out even more. Soon, the final trace of it seeped out of her body, and, just as Veluur had said, Krystal felt nothing but immense pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Veluur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any second now, sweetie. Any second...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Suddenly, the energy above her solidified, and Krystal found herself squeezed underneath this new mass, whose extra weight made the stomach sag further. \"Oomph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the stomach was tight and cramped, and she could barely maneuver herself. Whatever had become of the mass of magical energy, it was oddly soft to the touch. Struggling, she reached one of her arms up to identify what this thing was. To her utter surprise, her fingers wrapped around what seemed to be...another arm?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on here?\" Krystal shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was her fellow occupant who answered. \"I could ask you the same thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal's eyes widened. It had spoken in her voice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow fear began to set in. She continued to move her hand around to identify more features. A hand, a boob, some hair, a face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in that moment when Krystal noticed she still felt the tickle from before. But the magic process was already over, and even her euphoric bliss had faded. That tickle wasn't coming from her. In fact, it had since become more of a tingling sensation, which was now starting to burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Veluur?! ...VELUUR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red dragoness watched as the bulge in her stomach, now twice as full as before, began squirming wildly. A smile formed on her lips, and she let out a sigh of pure content. Nothing in the world could match the feeling of live prey struggling inside her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAges ago, Veluur had used some illusion spells to make her cave appear to be an ancient temple, just for the purpose of luring humans into her den and into her maw. Later, she got the idea to have her unsuspecting prey touch an orb that filled them with magical energy, which she could manipulate with her own magic to create a perfect clone, meaning she could have two meals for the price of one. Some called it being lazy; she called it being creative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even then, there was no guarantee that the humans would find her cave. To compensate, Veluur would occasionally make a deal with one of her fellow island-dwellers, where she would do a favor for them as long as they brought her the next human they found. The manticore had wanted help driving a nest of pythons from his home, and she had been happy to oblige.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp kick in her abdomen snapped Veluur out of her thoughts, followed by some colorful language emanating from within. The dragoness shook her head and chuckled. Why did they always believe that she would release them from her stomach? The foolishness of humans never ceased to amaze her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur slowly rubbed her distorted belly, relishing the feeling of her prey squirming inside her and ignoring their muffled pleas. Eventually, she let out a yawn, laid her head down, and began to doze off, allowing her stomach to begin the work of claiming its prize.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Press the palms of your hands against my stomach walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal uncurled her fists and followed the dragoness's instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now, concentrate on me. Think of nothing except for the lovely dragoness surrounding you. Picture my body, my scales, my wings, my teeth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal had no trouble forming an image of Veluur in her mind. \"Now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now the process gets tricky. You need to take that mental image of me and imagine it growing larger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That doesn't sound hard at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep concentrating, Krystal. It's vital that you don't lose that mental image or let your hands go during the enhancement process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing her eyes, Krystal shut out all her other thoughts and focused on the picture of Veluur. She imagined the dragoness increasing in size, as if struck by a mad scientist's growth ray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did so, she felt the stomach around her give a slight shake. \"Veluur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Focus, Krystal! Do not break your concentration!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tried her best, but the stomach's movements only increased in frequency and energy. Finally, she felt the dragoness's entire body slam down into the floor, tumbling her about and forcing her hands off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, everything settled down around her, other than a barely noticeable rhythmic motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew...\" Veluur gasped. \"I...I'm sorry, Krystal. It's been...quite some time since the last candidate came along...so I guess...I'd forgotten how painful this is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal realized the rhythmic motion was, in fact, Veluur panting. \"Wait. I was hurting you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. An unfortunate consequence...of the enhancement. It's...not unlike what you felt...when you touched the orb. Don't worry...I'm quite fine now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, did it work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately...no. You have to keep it up for ten seconds...at minimum. Otherwise...my essence returns to normal...and you have to start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder you said this would be tricky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed...and this is only the practice round. You'll have to enhance the essence...of other creatures, too. And when you're trying this in the belly of a satisfied predator...well, it goes without saying that you're operating on a very strict time limit. Okay...I'm ready now. Try again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Krystal tried to brace her head and feet to minimize her chances of being bumped around. She pressed her hands against the stomach walls and began picturing Veluur growing massive again. The stomach quickly resumed its shaking as the dragoness struggled to contain the pain, but Krystal was determined not to be thwarted a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, Krystal. That's it! Keep going. Keep making me bigger! As large as you can think! Taller than the trees! Higher than the mountains!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the stomach's violent shaking, Krystal maintained her focus, and suddenly, what felt like a shockwave burst from her hands. Simultaneously, the stomach squeezed and forced her out. The next thing Krystal knew, she had been expelled from Veluur's mouth. William bounded over and happily began licking her clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent,\" groaned Veluur, who was once again lying on the floor in pain. \"Welcome back to the outside world, my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal couldn't help but give a smirk. \"So what's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we must touch the orb together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeluur reached out with one of her paws to the orb, stretching so she wouldn't have to stand up. Krystal did likewise. As they connected with the orb, another intense shock blasted both of them, though not nearly as powerful as the shock Krystal experienced before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, the shock cut off. Veluur now stood up proudly, all traces of her suffering having vanished. \"There. Now your magic is back to full power, and my essence is back to normal. It's as if I never gobbled you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why would you undo everything we just did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your magic is limited to six uses. After your successful practice round inside me, you were down to five. Fortunately, by us touching the orb simultaneously, the enhancement is reversed, and you're back up to six uses. I need six enhanced essences to turn you into the Queen of Dragons, but because I'll be the one conducting the ritual, I unfortunately can't use my own essence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on. Are you saying I have to be eaten SIX more times?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say that like you're going to chicken out on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not! It's just...what if some dragon decides to keep me inside and digest me even after I do the enhancement thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You saw how miserable I was, right? No living thing can tolerate having its essence blown way out of proportion like that. Believe me, after those ten seconds, the pain will be so unbearable that they'll immediately dislodge you from their gut in order to put a stop to it. With the enhancement process completed, all that extra essence will also exit their body, rather than shrink back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm supposed to trust that they won't try to eat me again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! They wouldn't try again even if you begged them to! A nifty side-effect of your magic conditions their brains to disregard you as prey, and even prompts them to drop whatever they were doing and proceed directly to this temple, where they'll await your return. So, as long as you manage to finish the enhancement, you are quite safe from their appetite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's the point? What does enhancing their essence have to do with me becoming queen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can become Queen of Dragons and remain a human? What's to stop some random dragon from devouring you and bragging to all his friends that the almighty queen was now digesting in his belly?\" Veluur shook her head. \"No; the only way you can become Queen of Dragons is to first become a dragon yourself. As a sorceress, I know the spells necessary to transform you. But to do so, I need to infuse your body with the essences of six other creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you at least be more specific about these six creatures?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not much need to get more specific. Any six will do, with only one condition.\"</span></div></div>",

You'd also be able to use your magic on, say, both a dragon and a wyvern, or an alligator and a crocodile. However, I'd advise you to play it safe and stick to creatures who are quite obviously different species. If you mess up and get eaten by the same species twice, your magic will fail to activate, and you'd become nothing more than an extra layer of fat on somebody's gut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How lovely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And once you've used up all your magic, you'd best return here without being eaten again, or else all your efforts will be wasted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for sure.

Okay, William, let's get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they exited the temple, Krystal took a moment to consider the task she'd been given. Having to be eaten over and over again? Clearly these dragons only want a queen who's brave enough to take on an army of predators and live to tell about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, a thought occurred to her. \"Say, William. Seeing as how I have to find six different animals, would you be okay with me enhancing your essence for the ritual? I know you saw how painful it is, but would you be willing to do it, for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some consideration, William slowly nodded his head, and then began to open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm not saying we do it right now. I was thinking later on...unless...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe weighed the costs and benefits. On one hand, letting William eat her now would give her another chance to practice without the threat of being digested. However, he'd then have to stay behind, forcing her to venture into the wilderness alone. On the other hand, having William eat her at the end meant he would be around to help her out of any bad situations. However, the fauna of the island might be less willing to gulp her down if they saw a dangerous manticore at her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis decision could potentially make or break her quest before it even began!</span></div></div>",

Krystal struggled a little bit, but was still far to weak to resist the snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the python worked its way up to her shins and knees she noticed the inside of the python felt strangely comfortable, and she reflected on her fate as the snake slowly worked its way up her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the python's mouth reached her waist, and as it passed her womanhood the snake's tongue flicked sensuously over and inside of it, and Krystal ceased resisting entirely.
