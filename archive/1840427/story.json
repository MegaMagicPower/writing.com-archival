You don't remember going to sleep. You remember going out for a walk -- just a short one, nothing crazy. You remember seeing that strange light that you went over to, and then it slid around you like a glove, and then --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- then you woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, heart racing and head pounding. You don't remember anything after that. And you're still wearing your shorts and shirt and shoes from the night before. And you're not in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's that last one that really causes you to panic. You get up off the ground where you were laying. You aren't on the sidewalk near your house, either. You're laying on some vast plain made out of slightly rough wood. It's like a giant basketball court, only no baskets. You see some ways off a wall that seems to climb to infinity. Where are you -- some kind of warehouse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it's bigger than that. In the dim light of the early morning, you see a building, the size of an office tower, draped in some sort of white fabric. You begin walking toward it, and that's when you see something that causes your heart to skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's some distance away, sitting near the base of the building. A white hill, sitting next to its twin. A white hill, with blue markings. Blue markings that are clearly and unmistakably a Nike swoosh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy those hills sit some other monoliths, red that rise on stilts, smaller blue ones, larger black ones. All of them, a half-dozen pair in all, clearly shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShoes belonging to people who are so much bigger than you that your mind can't comprehend it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around, trying to get your bearings. You can see beyond the tower rises an enormous window, and beside it, a door. You're in an entryway. Where the people kick their shoes off at the end of the day. The tower is some sort of table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind you, you see a set of stairs that climb to the heavens. Bedrooms are up there. You think you can spot a kitchen if you head left of the stairs and down the -- it seems impossible for this to be a hallway, but there you are. Another door seems to promise a living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are in full panic, but you still know that you have to do something. You can't just stand in the middle of the hallway. You have to go get yourself secure someplace. And maybe get these people's attention. Or maybe try to avoid that at all costs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gather yourself. It's morning. They'll be getting up soon. You don't have a lot of time. The way you see it, you have a few options. If you want to get noticed, you could head over to the shoes. They'll stop by there on their way out. You can get their attention. Otherwise, you could go to the living room, and maybe get someone's attention there...somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, maybe you should head to to the kitchen. Whether you want to be found or not, there will be food there. And the family will probably go there in the morning. Or maybe you should try to escape the house altogether. If you just wait right by the door, you could slip out when they leave in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over, you nod and head off for your destination. Once you secure yourself there, there's nothing to but wait for the giants who live here to awake.</span></div></div>",

Jenna and Tim wake up earlier than they'd like; they briefly squabble over who has to go grab the paper (Jenna loses the argument this time. Tim probably will tomorrow), and then they go wake the kids. Emily's easy -- seven years old isn't too bad. The oldest two, however, are much tougher. Brianna is 14 and Jake is 16, and neither one wakes up before noon willingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it's not that bad. At least their schedules are reasonably in sync. Tim leaves around 7:30 for the office, followed by Jenna at 8:15 -- she drops Emily on the way in to work. The teens are both in high school now, and Jake can drive, so they take off at 8:30 -- not that Jake likes driving his sister into school, but since he'd lose his car if he didn't, he puts up with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so they gather 'round the breakfast table, with the older teens sullen and sleep-deprived, Emily her usual bundle of energy, and Tim and Jenna trying to impose order on the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's going on after school?\" Jenna asks, pouring milk on Emily's cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have soccer practice,\" Brianna yawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Do I have to wait around for her?\" complains Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I can pick her up. What are you doing, though, that it's an issue?\" asks Tim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's got a date tonight,\" says Brianna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a...thing,\" mutters Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues on for a moment, until Tim has to go to work; he walks over to the shoes, bends down, and slips his foot into the first half of his pair of dress shoes. He looks down at the second...</span></div></div>",

With a simple step, the vast fabric-clad foot comes down upon you. It wasn't a brutal stomp but that didn't lessen the searing pain you felt as all your bones and body broke and burst under the immense weight and pressure of Tim's foot... Darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim put his other shoe on and went to work. He didn't give another thought to the bug he had killed, unaware that it was a shrunken human. He only acted out of an instinct to protect his wife and youngest daughter, both he thought utterly terrified of bugs...</span></div></div>",

Why would he be looking at someone else's shoes? And if he did, why would he expect to see a bug-sized man?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wouldn't. So as he straightens, you sigh, and look back down the hallway to the kitchen, where the rest of the giants remain.

You then hear her tell mom that she doesn't have time to slip on any socks and throws on the shoes barefoot. Your sister then says goodbye to your mom and heads out the door for school.<br>\r\nYou mention to yourself its not so bad in here but the day has only just begun. Your sister arives at school and heads to her first class wich is english. Throughout the time your in her shoe it gets alot smellier and hotter. The bell rings after an hour and your sister is on her way to her second class wich is gym. Your prison is about to get a whole lot worse you hear the gym teacher say that today everyone is doing the mile run.<br>\r\nYour sister is thankfully the first one to go you hear the teacher say \"on your mark, get st, GO. As your sister runs as fast as she can as she is running your being jostled all around the inside of her shoe. She laughs and smirks knowing how much pain she is causing you to have but on the contrary your in no pain. You are now stuck on the bottom left side of your sisters massive foot and you say to yourself that your kind of enjoying whats going on. Your sister is now heading to her third class wich is social studies.<br>\r\nYour sister stops at her locker and takes off her shoes for a minute to check on her tiny prisoner. She notices that even though your drenched in sweat your quite relaxed. She then puts her shoe back on and says only five more classes. As she sits in her seat she plays with you in her shoes to make you suffer but what your sus dosent know is that your having so much fun.<br>\r\nThe bell rings and your sis is heading off to the girls room before lunch she finishes her buisness and then heads to the cafeteria. She meets up with her friends and tells them about her little buggy in her shoe. All the girls laugh and say we should have a sleepover and torture it together. Your then hear your sister say maybee we can even find more bugs to torture. Her friends agree your sister then texts mom and asks if her frinds can spend the night. Your mom says yes and that she will head to the store to pick up some snacks.<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden there was an anouncement ofer the loud speakers saying that school wiil be let out early today due to the bad weather. When your sis gets home she takes off her shoes and dumps her new friend into a glass jar she takes a closer look at you and then realizes that it was her brother not a bug but she did consider you as one she laughs and said that tonight were gonna have so much fun. What dose she mean by that.</span></div></div>",

You clung to a stitch, trying not to slide back under the ball of her foot; it wasn't easy, as each step was like an earthquake as the girl stomped to the car. And there was no respite once she got in; she was tapping the foot impatiently, waiting for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she settles, and you feel the rumble of the car as it roars to life. Now, with a bit of rest, you have a chance to move a bit. You figure that you need to get on top of her foot, so you don't get squashed. Carefully, you move into the gap between her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're amazed that a young teen could have feet that smelled so bad. You suppose the scent, like everything else, is magnified. You find a bit of rough skin, and climb up until you're able to crawl out onto the webbing of her toes. You breathe heavily; that wasn't easy.

If this was English or chemistry or P.E., I'd be acing this stupid test.</i> She glanced over her answers, her frown deepening as she realized just how many she had to guess on. This was going to <i>tank</i> her grade, yes siree, and Mom was gonna kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of class bell pulled Brianna out of her slump. Turning in her sorry excuse for an answer sheet, she dragged her self slowly to her locker. She didn't really need anything special for the poetry class she had next period, but she hoped that Kira would be there to cheer her up. She wasn't, of course; her best friend had been busier and busier as the year went on, and that meant not a lot of time for hanging and chatting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brushed another hair out of her face (<i>I'll see if I can borrow a hair scrunchy later</i>), and trudged toward Mrs. Whit's class. She wasn't very strict, but with that F in math looming in her future she wasn't risking any other classes. Dropping into her seat a full minute before the bell, Brianna pulled out her class copy of <i>The Poetry of Robert Frost</i> and let her head fall to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly five more periods and lunch in-between, and she could forget about this trash day and just kick some ass in on the soccer pitch.</span></div></div>",

With a groan you take a look at your surroundings. A black tunnel looms behind you, no doubt the entrance way into the labyrinth inside this teen's head. Going down there would probably be a bad idea. The exit leading out of ear is not too far away so fortunately it doesn't seem like you were thrown that deep. From your vantage point it's like a massive vestibule. You can even just see the outside world beyond it, the interior of a classroom so you don't seem to have been knocked out too long.

Trying to stay calm, you watch a different girl head in your direction, stopping a foot or so away to turn on the sink that resided far below. She began washing her hands; to her, a quick, routine act that was hardly worth a thought. To you, however, it was a display of force, more effective than any in history, as fingers that could crush city blocks lithely bent and slid over each other, throwing up frothy bubbles that could encapsulate small cars. Were you slipping, inching closer and closer to the grinding hands that scrubbed and scrubbed under Niagara Falls? Or was it just your imagination?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she was done. With a turn of the faucet and a quick shake of her hands, the show was over. But, before curtain fell and she made her exit, she stopped and looked at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not at you. Above you. And behind you. She was looking at the wall you were stuck on. <i>I'm on the bathroom mirror,</i> you thought, trying to ignore the world's largest set of breasts that bounced in front of you.

With each twitch of muscle and tendon, she shed drops of water. They plummeted past you, each rivaling you in volume. You hoped she was done soon, but she was persistent. She leaned in closer, bringing her chest just inches away from you, and kept messing with her appearance. The drops kept falling, but this time they hit the mirror. One smashed down just below you, and another right to your side, leaving shining trails as they slid down the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then one hit, dead on, soaking you to your bones. You let out a scream-turned-gurgle as the waxy bonds broke, sending you hurdling off the mirror like a soping wet, super small comet. The sink's drain, an all consuming void that had just finished swallowing the thousands of gallons of soap and water this girl had used, opened up beneath you. You're helpless, screaming your way down to a watery death when from the side swipes in a living wall of skin; the girl's hand.

She'd resisted going to the dentist, but if it was going to bother her like this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go back to your tests, kids. I'm going to - ow - be fine.\" She dug her tongue back there, but she couldn't place anything out of the ordinary. The pain, though, remained constant, a dull throb that occasionally pulsed painfully hot. She looked down at her cup; had her coffee gone bad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dialed a number on her desk phone. \"Hello, office? This is Miss Brand. I need someone to take over for me for a couple minutes.\" She paused; she wasn't going to worry the admin about her tooth problem just yet. \"I just need to use the restroom. Alright, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe played with the spot with her tongue while she waited for her sub, and for the whole trip to the teacher bathroom. Opening her mouth wide, she stared at her bad molar in the mirror. Again, nothing seemed wrong or out of place. She was about to dismiss it, but another sharp wave of pain hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCupping her hands, she gathered some water from the sink and filled her mouth. The cool water felt soothing. She swished it around, back and forth, front of the mouth and back of the mouth. If this didn't make the pain go away, she'd need to schedule a dentists appointment, or at least do something about the pain. She spit the water out back into the sink's basin, and waited to see if it hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least the school had great dental insurance.</span></div></div>",

First off, this outfit. Blouse-skirt-flats is fine casual wear, but boys want more. They're driven by sex, after all. And you, my precious Bree, are a soccer star with a body that shows it. Shorter skirt, skimpier top, and you'll have boys like a horse has flies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything more... immediate? I've got to see Ted again once more during band.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... The shoes. Heels make your legs seem longer, and dudes love long legs.\" Kira opened her locker, digging around for a bit before pulling out a pair of heeled sandals. \"Ideally you'd get your own pair and match it with your own style, but this can work for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Doesn't this seem kind of superficial? Shouldn't I try to get him to like me for my personality?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him to like you for your looks, then keep him with your personality.

Finding one, she immediately shut and locked the stall door, flipped up the lid, tugged down her pants and panties, and slammed down on the toilet seat. She sighed with relief as her muscles relaxed and released a torrent of piss into the waiting porcelain bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she finished, Kathryn paused and panted for a moment. She became acutely aware of how much she was sweating, and suddenly felt a brief chill. She shivered, shifted a little on the toilet seat, and waited as the insistent push on her bowels became overwhelming. Then she continued. First came the small logs. They made little splahes in the water that were just big enough to send a tiny plume of toilet water up against her bare buttocks. Kathryn shivered again. She tried to keep going, but only released a string of farts. That didn't mean it was over,  though. She could feel something else coming, deeper in her rectum. And so she sat there, trying to keep her mind off the cold by mentally replaying the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, just ever so slightly before she could relieve herself totally, Kathryn shifted and lifted a buttock to scratch underneath it. As she settled back down, she wondered if she really was as smelly as some people claimed. To test it out, she sniffed her armpit. Not great, but not bad either. Then maybe they meant her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe log was very insistent now. And, unfortunately, it was very big. Kathryn suddenly regretted eating all that pizza yesterday. She strained and grunted, flexing her powerful gluteal muscles, but there was just so much crap. Kathryn started breathing through her teeth as she kept forcing it out. She gave one final push and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPLASH!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of water rose where her turd landed, soaking Kathryn's ass and even going between her thighs and into her panties,  which where around her ankles. Kathryn groaned, and reached for what she knew would be toilet paper that was little more than a long tissue... And there was none. Kathryn ground her teeth in agitation. Well, there was nothing else to do but face the music. She stood up and pulled up her clothes, shuddering at the wetness, which caused her rump to jiggle. Then she turned to consider her handiwork. Hell, it'd be a miracle if that thing flushed! But then, wasn't her, wasn't her problem. She lightly tugged the lever, unlatched the door, and walked out. During the whole experience, she hadn't said a word.</span></div></div>",

He looks down at the second, and slides that on, too. Straightening up, he opens up the door, and heads out to his car, yawning and quickly closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye Mom.

It was waaay too easy to set her off. He slipped his skate shoes on, not bothering with the laces. They were practically falling apart, anyways, with the sole peeling off and the fabric on the inside shredding freshly with every step. He'd been meaning to get new shoes for a while now, and with his date tonight... Maybe he'd stop at a shoe store on the way home from school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna was sitting in the passenger seat and looking out the window by the time he got there. \"Ready to go, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake shook his head as the engine turned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids,\" Jenna says, as her two oldest children depart.

She can't help but feel for the lint, but her thoughts are interrupted as Emily rushes down the stairs. \"Okay Mom, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two are out the door and in the car before you could count to three.

Isn't they beautiful?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were more than just beautiful to Emily. The purple sparkly polish on the first grader's toes was a sign of adulthood and poor little Emily, the youngest of her family, really wanted to be all grown up. \"You're so lucky. Mommy won't let me get painted nails.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want some nail paint? I took the bottle.\" Indeed she had, as she plucked the little glass container from her back pocket. \"Let's do it right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily looked up towards the front of the room. Their teacher this year was rather new, and often failed at keeping the kids under control. Now was no exception, as many kids were playing with each other or absorbed in some other activities. \"Yeah! Let's paint my nails!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Emily stripped her feet bare, and the two girls worked with the polish. Finally, after grueling minutes of work, they had all ten toes sparkling purple. It wasn't as neat and tidy as Mia's pedicure, but to Emily it was the most beautiful thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater in the day, Emily began to have second thoughts. Her mommy hadn't outright forbidden nail polish, but it wasn't something she'd normally let her young daughter have. How would she react to it? Emily began to nervously kneed her sock between her toes. She'd have to be sneaky until the paint faded away.</span></div></div>",

Let's face it, to be both completely over powered by a first grader's toes was one thing, but to be further undetected as the girls stared right at you? Just goddamn impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you had felt the shoe and sock being removed, you had clung to her toenail, hopeful to be detected and helped. But despite both of the girls (you're pretty sure Emily was your captor and Mia was her friend, but it was hard to hear over your screams) looking at your location, they didn't spot you. Instead, they ran a tree sized purple nail brush over the landscape of Emily's toe. It had hit you pretty hard, and for a good long while your right arm had burned with intense pain. Now though, the polish had dried, and you were stuck on your back, coated ever so thickly in sparkly paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there was any positive to this, at least you weren't still between her toes. Your new prison was still terribly claustrophobic, but at least the pressure was less. Of course every little shake Emily made rattled you to your core, so it wasn't exactly a vacation from the torment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight suddenly blinded you as the girl took off her sock. The world outside rushed by in a mess of colors, but once her foot settled on the carpet, you were able to focus. Her leg had no right to be as long as it was, shooting off into the heavens above. Seems like your eyes were left uncovered too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMotion again as she greeted her parents and ran upstairs, then stillness. Her eye filled the horizon as she looked at you. As she looked at the paint. It was hard to remember just how little you were to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I get you off...\" She was muttering to herself, likely about your purple prison. She just got these nails done; why would she want them undone? You watch as she sticks her thumb in her mouth, then moves the glistening digit towards you. Oh my god, she was going to try and rub you off her toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier you had considered your leftmost fingers the luck part, as they were sticking above the polish and thus free to move. Now they were most certainly unlucky, with the giant pad of the girl's thumb grinding them back and forth along the nail. You tried to scream, but your mouth was still glued shut. Tears welled in your eyes, but Emily's spit flooded off her skin and drowned them out. And, despite how brutally she ravaged the free bits of your body, the paint remained untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily stuck her thumb in her mouth once more, ready to go for round two, when the sound of an opening door hits both of your ears. She rockets back to full height, curling her toes to hide the color in the carpeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't see, but it's clear from the tone of her mother's voice that...</span></div></div>",

Then she lifts you and her foot up, and you try to hold your breath as she plunges you into the depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of the foot on porcelain forces the air out of you, and you gasp reflexively, the water filling your lungs.

By the time, a half-hour later, that she steps out of the tub and starts drying herself, you realize that you must be more durable than normal. It stands to reason, really; you should have been crushed a dozen times over already. You don't think you're invincible or immortal...and you don't want to try and find out. But at least you're able to survive when you shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily bounds into her room, and happily, you're finally spared having to gaze upon a naked kid as she gets dressed in shorts and a t-shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're alive, and that's something. But you are still stuck to Emily's toenail. It could be worse, but it sure could be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to drive the point home, Emily bounces back onto the floor and heads out of her room, probably to dinner.</span></div></div>",

The titanic girl you're stuck to half-walked, half-skipped to the bathroom, each footfall shaking your core. You hear a sudden cascade, as if Niagara Falls suddenly switched on. You try to see, when suddenly, a massive form drops on you, blotting out the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only lasts a second, and you and the foot slide back through the leg of the girl's jeans. Then another form -- not as massive, but still mammoth -- drops on you -- and again, you slip back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, not wanting to look at the enormous naked girl above you. But you don't have much choice -- you have to know where you are. Have to hope against hope that you can hold onto enough air to survive this. Maybe break free -- but you aren't sure you want to, not in the rapidly filling ocean of the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl stops over and grabs some toys from a bin by the tub -- Barbies, you see, each one a giant in their own right. Then you hear the mom say words you prayed wouldn't come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, sweetie, are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mommy!\" the girl bellows.

It feels like you're going to drown, each time, but you don't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily is currently engaged in playing, and she isn't paying much attention to her toes...for the moment. She taps the toe you're stuck to against the side of the tub just slightly harder than she meant to, and the cheap polish cracks, just a tiny bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she'd struck just a micron or two to the right or left, it would be irrelevant. But this crack was perfectly placed. A few metallic flakes peel off, and a tiny chunk of paint -- not enough for the girl to even notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough that your upper torso is freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, an idle swish of the girl's foot finishes the job, and you're expelled into an ocean of water, free...for a certain value of free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you're still knee-high to an ant, and swimming in a bathtub the size of a small sea. You're in a huge amount of trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct, you swim to the surface. It's tough even to break through the surface tension, and once you do, you're not sure it helps. You can see the girl's massive form, but only partially -- enormous islands of bubbles surround you like icebergs, and the water continues to chop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that in a few minutes, the girl will be done with her bath. You have to escape. So you begin to swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you spot something that gives you hope -- an enormous body off in the distance. Not the girl's -- it's one of her Barbie dolls, floating face down. With every ounce of your strength, you dig for it, and then, suddenly, it's racing toward you. But....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh God, the girl has sat up in the bathtub and is leaning forward to pull the plug. You collide with the Barbie, and try to hang on, but the entire world is chaos. You bounce off the girl's flesh -- you don't even want to know what part of her it is -- and then again off a wall of plastic. You hit something again, and try to hold on to it with all your might.</span></div></div>",

Just as Emily goes to stand up, you see her massive inner thigh come raising up from the depths below as it pulls you out of the water with it. You're sent cascading down the young girls thigh, towards her inner knee before you caught glimpse of the only thing that can save you, a bandage. She must have scraped her knee and forgot to take the bandage off before the bath. Reaching out you manage to grab the adhesive in a last ditch effort to avoid being sucked down the drain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily swings her leg over the side of the bathtub and you're hit with an incredible amount of G-force, the fact you didn't lose consciousness is probably contributed to your size. Coming to a stop, you watch as Emily grabs a towel and you brace yourself as she dries off, gripping the bandage as hard as you can, each swipe of the towel making it more difficult to hang on. You celebrate as you see Emily place the towel on the rack, you honestly didn't think you'd manage to hang on but your celebration is short lived as you see Emily grab a pair of panties and pajama bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace yourself even harder as you watch the giant girl slip her panties around her right foot before shifting her balance to get them around her left as well. These panties were mostly white with pink trim, there was a picture of the cartoon mascot on the front and appeared to be well worn by a child of her age. The front of the panties with the mascots picture was supposed to be pure white but had a yellow hue to it, most likely from the girl wetting the bed. As for the back, there was a light brown streak from what you assumed would have been a poorly wiped butt crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible gulp rings out from your throat as you imagine these panties must be almost a year old, which means they're probably a size to small for her. With not a whole lot of time, you had no choice, hanging onto the bandage would do you no good, and if you fell now, you'd probably get stomped flat by the humongous child. Your only option was to try and leap for the waistband of her panties as she pulls them up so you can climb up higher to maybe get her attention, so you place your feet onto the side of the bandage and prepare to shove off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Emily yanks up her panties, you push your legs off the bandage with all your strength. The panties rise up quickly and you manage to get a hand on the waistband but the material bends downwards as you swing into the sidewall of the underwear and the flexible nature of the material proves too difficult to hold onto. You fall backwards with your right hand extended almost in slow motion as you watch the waistband get pulled further up. The light starts to slowly fade as you hit the bottom of the panties and you're sealed inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily would go on to have dinner and go to bed, all the while unaware that your tiny body was trapped in the..</span></div></div>",

She was out cold after such a fun day of painting her toenails that not even the loud noises of her stomach processing last nights dinner or the couple of lazy farts that escaped her butt could wake her. As the first rays of light shone through the window, Emily slowly began to stir. Sitting up slowly, she swivels on her butt to get her feet over the edge of the bed. Standing up, she raises both arms above her head to stretch before rubbing her eyes with her hands. Feeling the need to pee, she starts to shuffle her way to the bathroom, stopping as she enters the restroom, she closes the door and makes her way to the toilet. <br>\r\nDropping her PJ's and panties down, she gives her butt hole a good scratch to get rid of a small irritation before plopping onto the toilet to relieve her bladder.

She skips washing her hands and heads downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Saturday today and both her parents have already left for work.

Your observation earlier about the size being to small was correct as the panties created a fierce wedgie which kept you pinned to her inner butt crack. You managed to remain as calm as you could, rationalizing that for one, the area you were in was pretty squishy so there wasn't much risk of being crushed. Two it was clean from her bath earlier and lastly you had some room to maneuver. You sat wedged between her butt cheeks pondering what your next move should be when you feel her giant globes start to rub each other as she walked down for dinner. Your small body was rolled around her fat bubble butt which was honestly rather pleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe this isn't so bad after all.\" You say to yourself. That is until you feel your body start to float as you're launched upwards. You see Emily's butt cheeks begin to part and her wrinkly brown anus come into view as she moves to sit down at the kitchen table. With a sickening splat your body immediately adheres to the pock marked skin as her butt makes contact with the chair, pushing her panties more into her crack, your body is flossed along her disgusting butt hole. You stayed like this all the way through dinner and throughout the night. Occasionally, Emily would roll onto her side which would cause one butt cheek to press down on you with immense force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRecognizing that there was nothing you could do, you try and force yourself to sleep. It was difficult because while her anus was clean, it was still an anus. There was a faint smell of shit that permeated the air but as the night wore on you slowly nodded off to sleep. While sleeping you dreamt of your family. Your mother and father smiling at you, looking upon you with so much pride. You dream was short lived as a loud monstrous noise tore you from your slumber. Opening your eyes, you look around worried about what could have made that loud gurgling sound. You're quickly brought back to reality as Emily's anus parts slightly releasing a devastatingly hot fart. The foul wind blows over you as you wretch and gag from the smell. The air becomes hostile and opening your eyes becomes difficult. Emily would go on to fart several more times that night, all the while unaware of the torture she was putting another human through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs morning came, you had barely slept a wink. After the third fart from Emily you were far to alert to continue to rest. Suddenly your world is shook as Emily begins to stir. You feel her butt cheeks twist as she swivels to get out of bed and are then compressed between her fat cheeks as she stretches on her tippy toes. As she finishes stretching, her actions gave you enough freedom to start trying to get her attention. With one of your arms free from the sticky greasy ass hole, you claw and punch at the skin around you. Your effort is met with no reaction as Emily's cheeks begin to rub you around her anus again as she goes towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear her small footsteps on the cold hardwood floor as she opens and closes the bathroom door. You have to squint your eyes as a blinding light pierces into your world as the young girl drops her PJs and undies to sit on the toilet. You catch a quick glimpse of the toilet and realize that it's now or never and you renew your efforts to claw, punch and even bite the foul flesh that surrounds you. Just as Emily is about to sit down, you see a pudgy finger start to enter your prison. This was it! You were finally going to be free of this hell and get help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FINALLY, HELP ME! HAHA YES!\" You scream as the digit slowly approaches.Your joy is quickly turned to regret as the digit doesn't stop to pluck you out. As a matter of fact, the digit crams into your body and forces your legs and stomach past Emily's anal lips. You watch in horror as the digit moves up and down your body, cramming more and more of you into the foul orifice this girl uses to expel waste. After a second of scratching, the finger retreats leaving just your head outside of Emily's butt hole. You then get a front row seat as she sits down on the toilet bowl and you watch as her young vagina expels gallons upon gallons of urine. As she pees, her butt hole flexes in and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole scenario overloads your brain and you lose consciousness as Emily brings the toilet paper down to wipe. You don't wake up until much later to find..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A single hair, maybe from Emily, maybe from an earlier shower, had been stuck in the drain's opening, and by the grace of God you'd managed to get your hands around it. At this size, it was rough and had plenty of purchase for your grip, allowing you to ride out the water as it flowed down to the sewer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick climb later, and you're standing in the endless porcelain expanse of the empty tub. Even if the lights were on, you doubted it you could see from one end to the other. More importantly, however, was getting out, and that seemed impossible. If there was a towel or something hanging on the edge for you to scale, you certainly couldn't see it. It was beginning to look like you'd escaped one death, just to experience another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, as you struggled to climb the damp walls of the tub, the light snapped back on. The sound of a closing door rung through the room, followed by heavy steps. Your heart in your chest, you looked up to see...</span></div></div>",

Oh, she liked the game, but the JV team was not very good, and she hated her coach, and frankly, needed more time than she had. She knew her mom would be annoyed if she quit, and...well, if she could make varsity next year, it would be worth it. But she wasn't sure she could go through another year of losing 5-0 and not even lettering for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the tub, and turned on the spout; idly, she stuck her hand in under the water to check the temperature. Once satisfied, she dropped the plug in the drain, and threw in some bubbles -- okay, sure, it was childish, but who doesn't like a good bubble bath?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she waited for the tub to fill, she stripped her clothes off and pulled her ponytail out of her hair. She regarded herself in the mirror; she had an athletic build, but not too athletic...which she was glad of. Oh, she was having no luck with the guy she was trying to win over, but he was a couple years older than her. She wasn't thrilled with her look, but she felt about as good about it as a 14-year-old was going to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tub had filled up, and she walked over to it. She turned on a mellow playlist on her phone, and stepped in, sitting down and leaning back, letting the warm water relax her muscles. </span></div></div>",

She just reached for the faucet and turned on the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were closer to the drain than you'd thought. The burning waterfall overtook you. It felt like Niagara Falls was being dropped down, washing you about with no control. You submerged, tumbling along the smooth floor before a current. Your flailing arm grabs a chink in the porcelain, just big enough to fit your fingers in. Desperately you hold on, fighting against the bubbles that zoom past, your muscles beginning to ache from exhaustion and lack of air. It's too much, just too much, and you slip free, hurdling with the water towards the gaping maw, the black hole of the drain. You catch a glimpse of the girl, just for a second, and try to scream once more, flooding your mouth with the warm bathwater and causing you to lose whatever control you had left. The drain overtakes you, and you go plummeting down into the depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the panic, you had to admit you were surviving a lot longer than you expected. The spinning vortex had forced you to swallow more water than an elephant could drink, but you were still kicking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a limit, though. As the drain pulls you in, you sink through the pipes. Your chest begins to hurt. Water pressure, maybe, or perhaps the lack of oxygen was finally getting to you. Regardless, your mind began to feel heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to gurgle out a last word, but your lungs are entirely full of water. Darkness, deeper than before, envelops you.</span></div></div>",

And, you should really be focusing on things other than music right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat on the far side of the tub from the drain. Not safe, not by a long shot, but you were able to watch her test the water and plug the drain without being washed down. When she threw the plug down, though, it began time to survive. There was nothing to cling to on the water's rapidly rising surface other than soft bubbles that even you could pop. That left you treading water; hard enough to do in normal circumstances, and even harder with the bubble bath having lower the surface tension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to not focus on the burning in your arms as they got more and more tired. Instead, you watched the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor, uh, research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was young, you had no doubt, likely the older daughter of the woman from before. Yet, she had at least a few years on the Emily girl who'd kidnapped you. That was evident by the swells on her chest. Breasts. Not big ones, not adult ones, but breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned back to the tub, switched off the water, and switched on the jazz. As she moved back to the tub, you yell up once more. \"Hey! Miss, I'm in the tub! Please give me a hand!\" Of course, she missed you. Your tiny cry faded on the air long before it could reach her ears, and your tiny form was lost in the sea of her bubble bath. She stepped in the tub, her foot directly over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart beating rapidly, you moved to swim out of the way. Her foot was on you before you had the chance. It had you pinned on the tub's porcelain bottom in half a heartbeat, and you felt it drag you along the bottom as she sat down in the waters. Her foot lifted slightly off the bottom, and you forced your eyes open. The sudsy water burned them, but you would need to see to survive this. The water around you frothed as she moved, an underwater storm that brewed before you. Desperate to not be caught in that torrent, you clung to her sole even as flecks of dirt and dead skin fluttered away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot moved again, rushing forward she as stretched her muscles. It pressed into the side of the tub, sandwiching you between the hard wall and the rough skin. You screamed, bubbles frothing around your mouth as you drowned without drowning, but every second she pressed harder and harder. It was dark, and getting darker. Finally, you fainted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle sound of a trombone woke you up, some unknown time later. Floating on your back, you could see the ceiling far above, and the mountains of slowly sinking bubbles up close. Between them was the girl, who had let her head slump to her shoulder, eyes closed and breathing softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you wanted to do was to rest in the warm water, to let your aching muscles just have a chance to mend. You knew that wasn't an option, though. Last time when a bath ended, you were lucky to not be drained away. That luck wouldn't hold. You needed this girl, as a ride out if nothing else. With a sigh, you began to paddle through the thick bubbles towards her.</span></div></div>",

Your thought process was simple -- there was something to grab onto at the junction of her legs, a neatly-trimmed thatch of hairs that, while slick, would be easier to hold onto than wet skin. You would admit, if asked, that what started immediately beneath that thatch had drawn your attention; you were attracted to women, and even if this girl was young, that thing had to be the size of a stadium inside. It was impossible to miss. But that wasn't why you swam toward it. You swam toward it so you could get out of the bathtub, and with luck, get to the girl's bed, where you could hopefully make your way to her head by morning. Maybe she'd see you. You didn't know what would happen if she did...or if she didn't. But you didn't have much choice. You had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the soft jazz music melted from one song to another, a hand the size of a parking lot appeared, and drug through the hairs with a loud scraping bang. It did so again. And again. And then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour swimming stops, for just a moment, as you see the boat-sized finger dip into the water, and slide its way up and down, up and down. You swallow, and goggle at the massive sexual display. The girl is just getting warmed up, but the slight cooing that you hear, mingled with the background jazz, starts getting you warmed up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer finger moves up to her clitoris, and her other hand soon joined the party, diving under the water and sliding inside her, in and out, in and out, in and out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel like you're being drawn toward it, slowly. And then, you break from your fugue to realize you are -- or more accurately, you're being pushed. The motions of the girl are sending out waves, which hit the end of the tub and reflect back, and you're being carried along with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn, and begin to try to fight the current. As amazing as it is, as much as part of you very much wants to see what's going on close-up, you realized that the motion of fingers could easily crush you. You push as hard as you can, but it's no use. You're being pushed pass her knee...halfway up her thigh...oh, God, you can <i>smell</i> her from here.

But given how she feels right now, maybe it's true -- heck, maybe girls get...uh...blue ovaries? She's not sure what you'd call it. She's just sure that she wishes Emily would have showed up two minutes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. She gets up, silences her phone, and pulls the drain with her toes. \"All right, gimme a second,\" she says, grabbing a towel and quickly drying off.

Grabbing up her dirty clothes, she opens the door. \"All right, all yours,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily practically bolts for the toilet; Brianna closes the door behind her, grumbling a bit.

It's not like she isn't still horny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enters her room, closes the door, and drops her towel, before hurling the dirty clothes into the pile on the floor of her closet. She walks to her dresser, pulls out a clean pair of panties and a fresh nightgown, and slips them both on. She picks up the towel, dries her hair quickly, and tosses it into the dirty clothes pile as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads back out of the room, just in time for Emily to exit back into the hallway. \"You about ready for bed, squirt?\" Brianna asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess,\" Emily says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what,\" Brianna says, \"we'll have a piece of cake for a snack, then you can brush your teeth and go to bed.

She didn't need to use the 'potty' at all, she just wanted to interrupt her sister's bath!  And she fell for it!  Oh, the power of being the younger sister!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the toilet, counting out how long she'd have to wait before flushing and leaving to keep her story authentic.  And what would happen then?  Bed-time was approaching, and having been disturbed, Brianna would want to get her little sister out of the way quickly.  Maybe she would offer Emily some cake?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily licked her lips as she sat down heavily on the closed toilet lid, counting out her time.  Her eyes roamed the room, catching the bath suds still clinging to the inside of the tub before spotting the speck-like bug wandering over the floor.  It moved so slowly, clearly attempting to get out of her way and hide.  Silly little bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill smiling, she imagined how easy it would be to crush the horrid thing beneath her foot.  It would certainly kill a few seconds of this wait!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she made to stand, she paused.  Why should she waste such an opportunity?  She could just as easily tear off a square of toilet paper, pick up the insect and use it to mess with Brianna some more.  Her evil little mind rolled over the merits of both options...</span></div></div>",

Assuming she believes you to be an insect you could be headed for a trash can or fed to a family pet or something.

You can hear her pounding footsteps as she skips away, shaking the can with each one. The sister sighs with frustration and then all is quiet besides the sounds of keys typing. Did the little girl drop you into a can of her sister's soda thinking you're a bug?! That's low even for a prank. It's then when the reality of your situation sinks in and you start splashing and screaming once more. You did not survive this day's events to end up getting drank! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP!

IN HERE! LOOK IN THE CAN!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything lurched once more and the ocean of soda you found yourself floating in was quickly transformed into a raging storm. You were quickly pulled under the choppy waves, only getting glimpses of the house whizzing by through the can's opening above. She was clearly on the move, but each of her footsteps was shaking and jarring the soda can so bad you found yourself being thrashed from one end to the other and nearly drowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the can hit a hard surface with a mighty thud and the waves subsided. You sputtered and gasped as you managed to paddle up to the surface.

This time instead of a whirlpool you found yourself trapped in a raging rapid current as the soda was pouring out the opening of the can and hammered down into a glass awaiting below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another dance with death you managed to barely break the surface of the fizzy drink. You weren't sure how much more of this you could take. You could feel your strength rapidly leaving you and your lungs were burning. Through the glass walls of the cup you could see the full might of the teen girl above. This was your chance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Down here!!\" you tried to scream, but your voice was so worn out by this point. Still, you thrashed and splashed in the soda, trying to alert her to your tiny presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the girl's eyes widened, then squinted. Was she trying to make out your form? Against the dark cola you probably seemed like a bug. You could hear her mumble something in disbelief, then began to reach for the can. But before she could bring you closer, a voice pierced the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRIANNA! CAN YOU COME HERE FOR A SECOND?\" it was the dad, calling from elsewhere in the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna sighed in frustration. \"YEAH, COMING DAD.\" and then pounded off. Damn!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started smacking the surface of the soda screaming and crying. You were so close! Eventually your fit ended and you realized she'd be back soon. Hopefully sooner than later, because paddling in the soda was giving you cramps and you weren't sure how much longer you could do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly approaching footsteps shook the glass. You looked up, hoping to see Brianna returning, but instead the massive form of the mother greeted you instead. She approached the counter with a swift gait. You began your screaming routine once again, but whatever sound you made was quickly drowned out as she turned the sink on and started washing dishes. Dread began to fill your soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started praying Brianna would get back here and continue her investigation, but it didn't seem like it was going to be in the cards as the titanic woman looked at your glass, grumbled something to herself and then reached for it...</span></div></div>",

You narrowly escaped being devoured by the woman, and now her daughter's going to get you? There's no justice!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamp, warm flesh presses against your back, soaking your clothes through. In total darkness, the tongue is all you know until your ears are suddenly smashed by the sounds of the girl talking. The powerful waves of her voice deafen you, the exhalation almost ripping into you with enough force to make you lose your grip on the toothbrush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost.  You've come so far, being stuck to nails, soaked in baths, crushed by thighs and dunked in coke.  This is nothing compared to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo you're still clinging on tight once the girl releases you from the depths of her mouth, and you can see the dry harbour of her palm below you: an expansive tract of young skin, criss-crossed by deep grooves.  It comes in close enough for you to drop off, landing fairly softly.  Intense heat rises from the land, the air still thick with the scent of soap.  Fingers curl upward at the periphery of your vision, each greater in size than a skyscraper, but moving with practised ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, the face of God.  Only, it's just a teenage girl looking down at you, a speck on her hand.  How much can she hear when you speak?  Is she Horton-like, the only one aware of your tiny danger?  What will she do now?</span></div></div>",

Each crease and fold in her young palm was an obstacle to him, and her thumb's width alone was an impassable wall!  Where had he come from?  Why was he in her drink?  What should she say to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, she whispered to him as quietly as she could: \"Sorry about putting you in my mouth, but I didn't want Emily -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking once she actually looked down, seeing that even her quietest exhalations blasted the tiny man across her skin, tumbling head over heels uncontrollably.  Instinctively, she cupped her hand so he wouldn't drop off it, and he bounced from the lower part of her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother 'sorry' almost escaped her lips before she bit her tongue for fear of making things worse.  Luckily, he was picking himself up, but talking seemed to be out of the question.  So how could the two of them communicate?  She didn't have a pencil in her room, and even if she had one, how could she expect a man that could be crushed beneath a shaving to write anything?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeck, she was too tired to think this through right now.  A good night's rest, and she could think on it in the morning.  She'd just have to give the little fella somewhere to sleep safely...</span></div></div>",

She thankfully remains silent as her fingers uncurl, and you take the initiative to realise that she wants you to climb down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thick skin is as unrelenting as a rockface, and just as pitted with marks and indentations.  It's easy enough to descend to the surface of her desk, and then you are bowled off your feet by the backwash of her withdrawing arm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSprawled, you look up at her immensity as she looks right back down at you.  A crack of doom and the light turns off, your only illumination what sliver of moon sneers through the window.  There are thuds as she steps away from you, and another storm washes over you as she pulls her bedsheets over herself, leaving you alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn near-total dark, you give considerable attention to the monoliths around you.  There's very little to go on, but you soon realise that it is not the moon shining down on you: no, that vast rectangle of light is the screensaver from the girl's laptop above you and bigger than the largest cinema screen in existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer surface of the computer's keyboard is a harder climb than Brianna's hand, but if you apply yourself with ferocity you should be able to get to the top, maybe see if you can type a message?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it really worth the effort, though?  Maybe you should just catch some sleep like Brianna is doing - it has been quite the tiring day, what with the feet, the baths, the thighs, the cola and everything.

Nearly springing from her bed, she looked over her desk for any sign of him.  Ah, there he was, on the keyboard of her laptop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquatting down, she realised all over again just how tony he was, barely the size of the comma symbol.  Had he climbed up there to try and type a message?  There was surely no way he'd have enough strength to press down a key, as evidenced by the still glowing screensaver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStifling a giggle, she allowed a breath to slip out, even that minor exhalation pushing the dude across where he lay.  He began to move, woken from his slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stirred, she already reached to her bedside table to retrieve an item before bringing it down toward him.  It was something she'd pondered before she finally dropped off to sleep, a way to touch him and communicate without too much danger.  She nearly laughed again as she wondered what he must be thinking as he awoke to the sight of a giant cotton swab before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to catch on quick, this guy, and he grabbed the clean white tip with both hands.  Brianna picked him up and brought the end around to her ear, careful not to crush the man against her face.  Feeling the barest tickle as he stepped into her ear, she put the swab down and began to get dressed.  He couldn't peep on her from in there, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now I should be able to talk without you being deafened, right?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems that way,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I can hear you too: cool!  So, how did you get that way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.  I just want it undone, I just want to go home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothed, Brianna sank into her desk chair, tapping her laptop into life.  \"Where is it you live?  I'll see how close we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words he whispered into her ear - though he may have been bellowing at the top of his lungs, for all she knew - made no sense.  They were gibberish, no places she's ever heard of.  \"What country are those in?  What continent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore nonsense, and at her clueless grunt he gave an exasperated groan of his own.  \"I couldn't be more clear, here!  I'm speaking plain English!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"English?  Is that a language?  Wait...\" Brianna pushed herself back from the desk edge, bringing her hands to her mouth.  \"What if...  What if you haven't been shrunk? What if you're an alien, and you're just naturally this tiny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be right!  What I've seen of this place seems so familiar!  What are the chances there'd be another planet that's pretty similar, just at a different scale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are the chances you'd get shrunk so small?  I say we give up on finding a place that doesn't exist on this planet, and try to find the spaceship that brought you here!  Where do you first remember coming here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was on your doormat, just before you and your family came downstairs for breakfast.  Then your sister -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, I don;t need the details of what happened then.  I imagine it's pretty gross.  Pretty much anything Emily ever does is pretty gross, so I can only imagine how much worse it must be at your scale.\"  She span in her chair, legs drawn up under her chin.  \"So, I think one of us must have brought you in with them when they came home.  I wonder who it was?  Who do you think I should ask about it?\"</span></div></div>",

The sounds of the macro world are fainter than Brianna's voice, and you are more in awe of her power than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she asks your opinion on where to start the search, you roll over it in your kind, while at the same time coming to terms with her theory.  What is this, <i>Land of the Gaints</i>?  Is that really the most reasonable, Occam-approved explanation for your predicament?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, let's say that it is.  Who should your benefactor talk to about it?  Obviously, not her asshole brother, and probably not the drunken mother that almost drank <i>you</i> last night.

You're gong to give up a Saturday to spend the day with your dear old dad in his dreary old office?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said I was getting very responsible last night, and I thought about it, and decided I'd take that responsibility a step further!

Well, get your shoes on quick, because I'm already a little late!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna whispers to you.  \"Must be you got on his shoe while he was at work, and he brought you back with him.  We go in the other direction, we'll find where you came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMakes sense.  \"Makes sense,\" you say.  \"Just - be careful!  Don't want you to get shrunk too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't - remember, you're a tiny alien, not a shrunken person!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says you - you've read too much <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come again?\" asks her father, and she shrugs off his question.  \"Let's go, Dad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou zone out of the banal familial conversation during the drive to work, and wonder what approach Brianna will take to her investigations.

You couldn't scale her knees, which looked more like mountains than legs as they rose from water, so realistically you <i>had</i> to take the middle route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, that's what you told yourself as you floated just mere yards above the her giant pink gash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kinda like swimming in the deep end of a public pool, except instead of a concrete floor there was a teenage girl's labia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is wrong,</i> you thought to yourself as you peered at the sleeping moon-sized face that hovered over her young breasts. But so far, you hadn't been noticed. Not by the child, not by the mom, and certainly not by this teen who stomped you into the bottom of the tub. So, was there really any harm in a little sight seeing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were always the kind of person who patted every dog you passed on walks, who had to pick up every item at a grocery store before you could make up your mind. A tactile learner, they would have called you. You had to touch something to know it. You see where this is going?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn and out, you prep your lungs, sucking down the biggest breath of air you can manage. In these last couple of baths you've realized that you could go quite a while on a small lung full, but you planned on only taking once caving trip, and you wanted it to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlunging down, you paddle through the bathwater for a few feet before grabbing a dark hair, pulling yourself along it. <i> She's practically an adult,</i> you reason, trying to soothe that nagging voice in the back of your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach bottom maybe fifteen feet down,  settling at the base of a hair just an arm's length away from outer lips. Suddenly you're thrown to the ground, slamming into the soft flesh of her pubic mound as she shifts. Heart in your throat you watch the ivory wall of her leg stretches out down the length of the tub, her foot lost in the foamy depths. You grab a hand full of skin, desperate to stop yourself from being tossed under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then everything is still. You float up, gently paddling in place amongst the dark forest. You check quickly- yep, your boner's gone, replaced by the abject fear of a god-like being. It was time to leave. You turn towards the surface and swim towards the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos, as from nowhere tower slams into your world. Her finger, you realize, as her nail scratches at the flesh you'd clung to moments before. You swim away in a frenzy, pushing past waving dark hairs as you try to get away, but her finger lifts up and finds you, driving down into you and burying you in the soft flesh above her vagina. Her rough fingernail tears into you, cutting your chest open and sending a small cloud of blood into the water before it shifts again, flicking you down her body. You tumble to a stop, grabbing at the folds that greet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven your panicked mind recognized the trouble that you've been thrown into. You catch a glimpse at her hand, four fingers rearing over you with more presence than any sea monster, before they come crashing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a grain of sand and she's a force of nature. Her lower lips open, taking you in as her fingers push you down as the girl strokes her nethers. Dimly lit by whatever light that managed to trickle down here, you are crushed between a sticky pink wall and her monolithic ring finger. Fluids leaked from below, slowly mixing with the water to create a thick soup. Her fingers returned, swiping back the opposite direction, pulling you back into the outer folds. Propelled through the water you bounce along her soft vagina, forced through her pubic hair until you crash into something hard, pink, and rapidly growing: her clit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd held your breath this whole time, desperate not to drown in a teenager's snatch, but you finally break, screaming out a stream of bubbles as her finger scoops you up and drives you into a clitoris that is four, five, six times your height. A trail of bubbles follows you as you're nearly flattened while the girl gently pinches her pleasure center between pointer and thumb.</span></div></div>",

She had moved one finger from her clitoris to inside of her, and pulled you along, and as she did, her back involuntarily arched, just enough for you to get a lungful of air. And then she had driven you down into her depths, which were full of a mix of the bathwater and an entirely different liquid, and then you heard a deep rumbling moan all around you...and then the sky closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it wasn't the sky, not exactly. It was the lips of her vagina, snapping shut as she pulled her slender fingers out. But it might as well have been the sky. All light was extinguished, and you were fumbling in a good two-to-three feet of water and come that clung to every fold in the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, there was the roller-coaster feel of her getting to her feet. You could hear say something like, \"Okay, it's all yours,\" the voice rumbling through the flesh around you. And then the world moved back and forth, as the goddess gently sashayed back to her bedroom, tossing you about in the cavern of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to move forward, toward the exit. You needed to get out before she fell asleep -- you were already sweating from the blast-furnace heat, and you weren't sure that you would survive a night in her snatch. You had to stop occasionally, as rumbles slid through her muscles. You assumed they were the slow end of your previous disaster; unfortunately, they were actually the early rumble of a continued arousal, one caused by the almost imperceptible motions of you within the depths of a teen's vagina.</span></div></div>",

A moment passes. The shower curtain is flung open, and she steps out. It's beautiful. The light shines off her damp body, giving her the look of polished bronze.

And then, she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer towel tied about her, you find yourself pressed into the deity's flesh. You're aware it's time to make a decision for yourself, and that it needs to be made quickly. Do you want to remain with the harness and the towel, safe(ish) but far from her attention?

I'm not tired!\" Emily wasn't happy, that was clear enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am, and I've got to put you to bed before I can sleep. If you're not tired, play on your 2DS for a while.

Hardly noticeable to her, but just enough to chip the paint and knock you loose.

But he'd decided the worst that could happen was that he'd end up friend-zoned, and hey, she was pretty cool in general, he didn't mind being her friend, but he was really glad he'd decided to ask, because...well, he liked her as a friend, but he liked her better as a friend who kissed like she kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat kiss had rather stuck in his head, and led to a dream in which she seemed to tower over him, but not scary or anything, just...amazing.

The atmosphere inside the boxers was thick and oppressive, his musk alone threatening to suffocate you and it was now that the various trials of the day had finally weighed enough on your mind to allow you to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been jarred awake from him snatching the rag you decided would be your safe quarters. Clutching to the rag desperately proved to a mistake when it left you directly in the line of fire of his ardor. Ignorant to your desperate pleas, his rod erupted before you as you tried to run. Thick slime splattered all around you, nearly crashed directly on you and potentially drowning you in the mire. You had no time to celebrate though when he reached down and yanked the whole rag up effortlessly. You screamed as you were remorselessly smashed into the head of his penis, and the rest was history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you heard birds chirping somewhere outside your prison you realized you must've nodded off at some point. You struggled against your bonds once more, managing to pry your right arm off. It wasn't much but it was a start. Reaching up you tried to find some sort of leverage only to feel your hand slide into something hot and slick. <i>Ugh!</i> You tanked your arm back, realizing you had slid it right into the slit of his penis. This whole shrinking thing was going to be one for the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant stirred and moaned in his sleep and everything began to rumble. Your eyes widened as your world began to rotate and soon you felt yourself sinking into the yielding surface of the mattress, pressing you deeper still into the giant's member. You could barely breathe now and started panicking as you could feel blood rushing to the head of the penis, swelling it even more. Smothered in his morning wood and sweating bullets from the heat you prayed something changed quick--!!</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, he rolled over onto his back to turn it off and with a quick glance noticed that it was Saturday. \"Shit\" was all he managed to say, realizing he had accidentally set it last night, he wasn't in his regular state of mind after that amazing date! With that he set down his phone and started to roll onto his side to drift back to sleep when a loud gurgling came from his gut and with a familiar discomfort, realized he had to use the bathroom. With another sigh, he rolled out of bed, wiped the sleep from his eyes and began to make his way to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the bathroom, Jake flipped on the light switch and immediately had to shield his eyes while he made his way over to the toilet. Pulling down his boxers he took his seat. First he started to release his bladder, there was a bit of a delay though as he had to push harder than usual, probably due to a poor clean up job after last night, he thought to himself. Finally after a brief struggle, his penis gave and urine came roaring out like he had held it for a week. After a solid minute, the stream began to die down and he started feeling that discomfort coming from his rear again to which he decided to let everything happen on it's own since he was to tired to actually push.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 minutes and a couple small turds later and Jake was finally done. He lazily grabbed some toilet paper to wipe his butt and while reaching down between his legs, accidentally dipped some of the paper into the disgusting mess he had made in the toilet without realizing until he felt something cold and wet against his poor butt hole. God that woke him up! He quickly dropped the paper into the bowl and grabbed some more, making sure to clean the pee water off. A third strip of toilet paper later and he was certain he had cleaned thoroughly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake pulled his boxers back on, flushed the toilet and made his way to the sink but stopped right before he reached it, a slight irritation or an itch maybe, was coming from his asshole. Probably due to the pee water, he thought to himself. Being a teenager, he reached back under his boxers and gave it a good scratch even poking in just a little bit to make sure he got it. Satisfied, he washed his hands hit the lights and made his way back to his bedroom, thinking back to his date last night, which started to make his penis stir once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like you thought, the nylons provide a suitable surface to climb on for someone of your size, but breakfast ends before you could even scale half of her leg and suddenly you find yourself holding on and screaming for dear life as the oblivious woman gets up from the table, walking at speeds that threaten to hurl you into the unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kitchen, family and living room all speed by in a harsh blur, and just when your aching fingers feel like they can't hold on anymore the woman stops.

I don't know what happened, but I shrunk and I need your help!!\" you scream above. You watch as the woman begins to lower a hand towards you. Yes! Her face makes an odd wrinkling expression, almost as if she's annoyed by you, but you're sure that's becaus--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are swatted away the same as your body as her fingers flick you off her leg. You scream bloody murder as you fall through open air, spiraling over and over. Glancing down, your eyes widen as the mouth of her red high heeled pump greets you. Then, a harsh thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to knock the dizziness from your head as you lay on the insole of her shoe. Wearily looking up, you see the woman pointing her nylon-clad foot right in your direction before lowering it into your new prison.

These were a sweet gift from Tim, but he was terrible at getting the size right. Maybe she'd do that after work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to work, firing up her computer. Her job wasn't the glamorous life of a professor, but it was never the less important. As the head admissions counselor, she helped high school hopefuls get into the college, and when the time came, she review their applications. That time had come, and she was up for another long day of reading cookie cutter personal statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConsciously, she looked over the applications and marked them for points. Subconsciously, she played with her feet. They were active as wild animals, swinging freely from her ankle with minds of their own. Her toes, too, had their crazy side, grabbing roughly at the chair, the floor, the desk, her shoes, anything that they could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt around ten, there was a knock at her door. \"Mrs. Stevenson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet stilled. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A high school is here for the tour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was right, she'd had this on her calendar. \"Give me just a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe instinctively began to slip her feet into the heels.

But to your unending anger and frustration, your torso was firmly caught, tangled among the stretchy fabric to the point of immobility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer feet settled on the ground, you mostly unmolested under the toes. The peace was short lived, as soon enough everything south of the ankle began working at full cylinders. The motion was never the same for long, constantly shifting and constantly driving you insane. At one moment it was all footwork, swinging you back and forth as the foot bobbed or shook. At other times the toes seemed alive, stretching and squeezing you as if you were nothing more than a part of her pantyhose. Sometimes, it was both at once, churning your world much like a blender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst parts were when she started to get grabby. As her toes wrapped around everything in proximity, from her chair to the carpet, you were granted the great pleasure to meet all sorts of hard, rough, or otherwise unwashed surfaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost missed the knock at the distant door. \"Mrs. Stevenson?\" the voice called out.

Where did this mystery behemoth work?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA pause, then, \"Give me a moment.\" Her feet, your prison, lifted. You watched in horror as the pale interior of the heel stared up at you. She started to put her foot in, her sole dragging you along the smooth insole. You're about to scream again, but the foot stops short. It begins to reverse, yanking you back up the slope. This time, though, you feel a snag. It may have been a bit of bunched up insole, some misplaced static cling, or divine intervention, but with a snap the nylon holding you in place breaks. You tumble down the shoe as the toes wiggle up above, a sort of stinky goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit in the deepest part of the pump, listening to her mutter to herself. A thump, the sound of her feet slipping into some other godforsaken pair of shoes, then she stomped away, into the great unknown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'll be back though, and who knows when you'll get another chance like this. You peer up the mountainous slope of the heel, the fluorescent lights from high above shining in. Time to get climbing.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't even trying, and she managed to score a home run with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe carpet in front of the door rushed up to meet you, but it wasn't a whole lot of help. It was the cheap stuff, a thin layer of fabric compacted tightly together. It hurt when you hit it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so you lay there, small as a speck and smelling like sweat, staring up at the sky-high ceiling. How did life ever go so wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Ah shit, you'd taken too much time. A pair of massive black flip-flops, filled by an equally massive woman, were walking through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked the other one. What indeed, as the foam shoes came closer. You flinched and prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a half-day today, remember?\" The booming steps stopped. Risking a glance up, you she she'd stopped right on you; her left foot to your right, and her right to your left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tower above laughed. \"What's going on here?\" Amused, her left foot tapped, blowing a gust of wind towards you. You gripped the carpet, desperate to not be blown away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\" replied Mrs. Stevenson. \"I'm.. not sure.\" She laughed. \"But I do need new heels. These ones Tim bought me are cute but they're just so tight!\" You had to agree with her on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe left foot by you tapped again. This must have been a much funnier joke, since this time you were powerless against the bellows of wind she displaced. You went flying again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if there's time we can go shopping after lunch.\"</span></div></div>",

You were blown on top of this giant woman's right foot from nothing but her idle tapping and when she and the your other captor walked from the office you were struggling to maintain grip on the mass of flesh, terrified of being blown away into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the woman's footsteps shook the earth violently, thrashing you and sending you rolling across the plain of her foot. You were knocked into and over the tree root-like veins across the top of her foot, forced to quickly grab onto her flesh as the foot would once again rise. The sound of her flip-flop slapping against the sole of her foot was comparable to that of a thunderclap to your ears, forcing you to constantly wince. With all that combined with the booming sound of the woman's idle chit-chat above, and the harsh sun beating down onto you, you were wondering how long you'd be able to maintain your sanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you wanted to just let go and fall somewhere, but being stuck outside was surely an even worse death sentence. You'd probably get plucked up by a bird or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps stopped harshly, and you were jarred from the top of the woman's foot shrieking and bouncing along the surface down towards her toes. You slid down the slightly sloped surface until you slammed into the column-like part of the sandal that separated her big toe from the others.You could hear the women booming above, but couldn't really make out the words. Something about... hippies? Then Wendys? Suddenly everything began to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no warning you found yourself squeezed harshly in the web of flesh between the woman's toes and the toe separator of the flip flop. You pressed up against the column as the slightly sticky flesh hugged you, still afraid of being torn away or even squashed at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another agonizing round of walking the lighting suddenly changed and you were met with blessed air conditioning. (Thought at your size it was almost freezing). Some extended time of standing gave you a chance to climb out from your alcove and see your surroundings-- the other woman whose morning you spent as her toe lint was still here, and you could see you were in a Wendys, now turned into an endless universe sprawling before you. The women were waiting in line for food and your attempts to call out to them were drowned out by the cacophony of sounds around you. Your prison suddenly lurched again as the two friends made their way to a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing everything zoom by so quickly was making you incredibly dizzy and nauseous and before you could even get your bearings everything stopped yet again and the foot you were on suddenly vanished from under you, causing you to fall onto a black, sticky surface. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour head was throbbing as you looked above you. The woman's bare feet loomed ahead in the air, her toes stretching and spreading before she tucked them beneath her chair. It took you a second to realize she slipped her flip-flop off and that you fell to its surface. You grimaced as you could see dust and debris litter the surface, realizing you were not much bigger than the dirt on a sandal. Turning around, you were treated to a sight of the woman whose name you believed to be Mrs. Stevenson's massive nylon feet slipping out of a pair of flats. Your eyes widened as her legs suddenly stretched forward, her feet barreling right towards you and the empty sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped right before you, crossing her feet at the ankles. Her soles loomed above you, almost threateningly. As the women talked and ate above, their voices sounding like distant thunder, she thoughtlessly scrunched her toes at you. You watched as they came into contact with \"your\" woman's flip-flop's straps, lightly stroking them. She didn't even realize what she was doing. You shuddered wondering just what it would take to get these behemoths' attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to think of something fast, but you didn't get much of a chance as...</span></div></div>",

It had been too long since they'd had a chance to just sit and chat. She looked at the picture of her family she had on her phone. Jake had been, what, 13, when Cynthia got married? Life had been so hectic since then, just go go go without anytime to rest. There was always something that had to be done, always a source of stress to be quashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna absentmindedly grabbed at her friend's flip-flops with her toes, pulling both of them towards her. She pressed her foot onto the foam, feeling the gritty surface through her nylon. As Cynthia returned and the two friends began to talk again, Jenna kept playing with the purloined shoe, tapping her foot over it and grinding her toes into the worn material. It was a subconscious distraction, keeping her thoughts focused on fun and away from any more depressing thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to stop at the ladies room,\" Cynthia said after the two had finished their meals. \"Don't you leave without me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't think of it,\" Jenna replied. Reaching down for her flats, she was surprised to notice that she'd completely slipped on the flip-flops during the meal. They were good, her tired soles feeling comforted by the soft, worm foam. She pulled her feet free, and grimaced as she saw the layer of grime that was stuck to the bottom of her nylons. \"Does Cynthia really wear shoes this dirty?\" she asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she grabbed a napkin and began to wipe her soles clean. Clods of dirt and shedded hairs and the corpses of bugs cascaded off her sole and onto the paper, where they were bunched up in tight fist. She dropped the balled up napkin in her purse, another chore to be dealt with late, and after kicking the flip-flops back towards Cynthia's side she slipped her feet into her own flats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia returned, grabbed her shoes, and with a smile asked, \"Ready to head on back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna smiled too, and simply nodded.</span></div></div>",

At first, the heel went alone, the toes pressing down on the front of the flip flop, giving the surface a chance to breathe and reform. But the moment passes quickly, and the shoe rushes up to fill in the void left behind, held to the foot by the thin plastic strap between the toes. Skin meets heel with a crack like a gunshot that roars across existence, bloodying the ears of the only speck close enough and entrapped enough to hear it. The force here is enough to hold the mucky shoe to the woman's sole, applying just enough pressure to make movement and impossibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she steps down again.

And so, when her foot began to have a slight itch, she just unconsciously kicked her shoes off and kept reading, unaware of and uncaring for the consequences of this act.</span></div></div>",

The little drop had dislodged you from the flip-flop, so in theory you were free. In practice, you were trapped in a metal cylinder the height of the Space Needle, but it was still an improvement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little was visible in the darkness. When you finally worked up the will to stand and begin searching for an exit, you had to go slowly. The last thing you wanted was to have survived half a day of trampling just to break a leg and starve in the garbage. It was hard to traverse the slippery ground at first, but you found a shattered toothpick and used it as a makeshift walking stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were crossing a field of coffee grounds and eggshells (jeez, hadn't she heard of composting?) when a scurrying sound broke the silence. You crouch, still, worried that a rat or something was about to break in and consume you. To your surprise, you watch an ant mount an apple core near you. It was maybe the size of a horse to you, and was moving over the rough terrain without a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemember \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids?\" You sprinted at the air. With a leap, you land on its back. The exoskeleton was rough, and felt like a weird cross between steel and ceramic. You gripped tightly as the ant continued on its way. Hopefully, the bug would know a way out of here, and once you were free you could dismount at your pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, after finding a bagel crumb the size of a small car, the ant headed home. It scaled the side of the black plastic bag, and slipped through the smallest of openings between the can and the lid. You held on well enough, minus a few scares during vertical parts, and was greeted to the wide expanse of the kitchen floor. Suddenly, dismounting the ant didn't seem like such a good idea. What would you do all by yourself on such a huge plain of tile? What if the woman came back and crushed you under her feet again? The ant, however, was an expert at surviving and not being stepped on; if you stuck with it, at least for a while more, you might be able to escape here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching tightly to your walking stick, you...</span></div></div>",

Two made their way straight for her bare feet and she recoiled in disgust. Dashing over to the kitchen counter, she pulled a can of Raid out and began spraying the intruders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn pests,\" she muttered under her breath. \"I thought we were rid of these!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a napkin, Cynthia kneeled down and dabbed up the bodies of the dead bugs and tossed them in the trash.

Sighing, Cynthia stood back up and turned to the trash, tying the bag up. If there was any more of those insects in the bag she wanted to make sure they'd go outside. She slipped her feet into a pair of moccasins by the door and took the trash outside, dumping into the can and closing the lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking back into the house, the woman grabbed a tape dispenser from the closet and went back over to the crack in the wall.

Together, they formed a sort of insect convoy, and gathering their scraps of food for the journey to the colony. You watched in awe from Bridget's back as the met up, tapping each other with feelers and sharing the heavier loads. They were a unit, well connected and able to act as one. Wordlessly, they set out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately the group leaves the relative shelter of the wall and begins crossing the open tile floor. The room stretches out for miles, an unbroken expanse of clean, green tile. You clutch tightly to Bridget's carapace; the sudden emptiness had left you woozy, and you had no desire to be left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive, ten minutes passed uneventfully. They walked on, tapping the ground with long feelers, making incredible progress that you never could have matched. Then from an open doorway came the woman. Her face and upper body were foreign and masked in shadow besides, but her feet, those unforgiving beasts that would crush and crush and crush without mercy, they were very familiar. She flicked a switch, and a blinding light flooded from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Move, Bridget, move!\" You smacked the side of the ant, trying to kick it into action before she noticed the convoy. The ant remained unaware, but the towering woman's eyes drifted in your direction. She leaned in, her face taking up the sky, her lips curling back in a grimace. It was as if the moon made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Ants!\" Her words came with a gust of wind and threatened your grip on Bridget. Still, the ants moved on. The lead two were getting very close to the woman's toes, which were curling up in disgust. For a split second you feared for them, recalling your time in Mrs. Stevenson's care, but before you could do anything the feet were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot gone; away. For something so big, the woman moved fast. You watched her cross the room in seconds flat to begin digging around in some dusty cupboard. She turned around again, a can clasped in her grip. Fear struck as you recognized the Raid brand label; you survived a footstep, but could you take a chemical shower?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn instinct more than anything you grabbed for your walking stick, shouting \"Sorry Bridget!\" as you plunged it into the insect's rear. It reared up, wrenching the stick from your grasp as it charged forward at top speed, rushing past the other ants who still had not sensed the danger. A crack in the wall, likely the convoy's original goal, loomed ahead, but behind was a terrible slaughter. You watched as the woman bent over your group, and without a wasting a second began to spray. A cloud washed over the ants; walking instantly turned to running as they finally understood what was happening. It was too late, though, as the cloud grew thicker and the ants began to collapse, their legs twitching as they dropped their crumbs to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn seconds, they were all dead. A part wanted to go back and mourn them, but the woman was already wiping up the remains with a paper towel. She tossed them into the trash bin; you hoped that the garbage would be a suitable heaven for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her face, hopeful she'd miss you. She didn't. Wielding the can of Raid she charged for you, but as her finger pressed down Bridget slipped into the crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBridget had the strength to carry you outside of the house, and no more. You buried her in the soft dirt of the garden, near the little chip in the foundation she had carried you through. In the light of the setting sun, you said a few words, mourning that she and her family had to die for you to live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the moon rose, you looked out through the yard's tall grass. You were still just a speck in a very big world. You needed help, badly. But, from who?</span></div></div>",

The force quivers through the worn rubber sole, your bones rattling as you clutch tightly to the clumps of mud that kept you from falling to the ground. As her foot settles, you glimpse down the hallway-like tread, taking in the poor condition of the material. Every surface you could see was chipped, dented, torn, and stained, and the entire world around you smelt like a mixture of old mud and stale sweat. Yet, as terrible as it was, it was infinitely preferable to falling loose and ending up <i>under</i> her treads instead of <i>between</i> them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've been clinging to this giant for a few minutes by now. It's a hell; never still, it swings you through the air at rocket speeds before plowing into the ground with thousands of pounds of force. Each step yanks at the bonds that hold you tight, each one feeling more and more like a deliberate attempt by the girl to knock you off and beneath her. Yet you know that's not the case. You're invisible down here. From the outside world it likely just looked like a normal, muddy boot, each heavy step the same as the last, each just as inconsequential as the previous. It tore at your ego, especially as you watched an ant about your size disappear beneath the girl's treads with a sickening crunch, all without her notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's where you were, as you held on for your little life, trying to ignore the aches in your body as each subconscious twitch of the foot that lived just above your head threatened to shake you off, when without warning the giantess lifted her foot up higher than before. The rough ground below you, darkened by her shadow, shifts from the familiar footpath to the dark, frothing waters of a mud puddle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, NO!\" you scream, but it's already too late and a flood of warm, tepid water rushes over you. Your screams turn to gurgles as the boot settles in the puddle, while you desperately clutch and claw at the thick rubber around you. You couldn't be left here, you'd drown! The mud around you turns you mush, your hold to the sole beginning to fail. Then, with a loud slurping sound, her foot lifts again. The air hits you all at once, and you suck it down hungrily in the second you have, before the boot rushed back down into the water. This time, you couldn't stay attached, and you found yourself flung into the soft mud at the puddle's depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't give in. With everything you had you kicked up, locked in a maze of tunnels formed by her treads but unwilling to die down here. You had only a moment, just seconds before she was gone, and as you felt the walls around you begin to lift, you found it; a tear, small, unimportant, between the shoe's tread and bottom, just big enough for you to jam yourself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer foot lifted back into the air. You spit out a bunch of water, laughing as you feel the familiar rush of her step. She's moving faster now, but you're secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so you thought, until a loud scraping announces an intruder's arrival. You scream as thick black fibers reach up between the shoe's treads, knocking free looser clumps of dirt and debris. Your whole world has suddenly become a twisting, back and forth death zone, and with a gasp you realize...</span></div></div>",

Conditions are dark and damp, and truth be told you're not quite sure how you're still breathing. You've gone from man to lint in an instant, jarred about by the simplest of footsteps as you felt the woman's foot lift through the air and slam back on the ground. For a time, the steps stopped, replaced by a more regular vibration (and rougher toe-rubbing), but that too ended and she resumed her walk. The up and down, combined with the strong combination of foot and body wash, caused you to puke a few moments past that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the walking stopped. Far, far above, you could hear voices, muffled by flesh, shoe, and distance to be indecipherable. Where was this woman?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can think further the toes about you clamp down, hard, grinding you between them and causing you to yelp in pain. The fabric, soft at normal size but much harsher at your scale, tears at you, burning your skin and shredding your clothes. The squeezing relents, but with a lurch the woman's foot is pulled from the shoe, dragging you along with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so would you be willing to sign this petition?\" you hear a voice say, but the words hardly register as you're sent flying free from her foot. The light disorients you as you soar through the air, but the flight is cut short as you slam, hard, into rough concrete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giantesses ignore your plight. \"Not right now,\" you hear from your former captress. \"I am really going to be late, but if you're all still here when the day is through, I'll be sure to sign it.\" She slipped her foot back into its shoe; from down here, it looks much less intimidating. Then, she's gone, walking off into the distance with purpose in her steps. You didn't know her, and all she'd done so far was beat on you, but she was the first person you saw when you shrunk. That had to mean something, right? Suddenly, though, you're alone with the other giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, not alone. Even from down here among the dirt and pebbles, you could see her comrades stomping about, waving signs and shouting about animal abuses. The lot of them looked like a bunch of unkempt hippies; not your crowd, and not the kind of people you would usually associate with. Still, they seemed to be all about peace and helpfulness, the exact kind of traits you were looking for in someone. And, to be truthful with yourself, you didn't have a whole lot of options.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess options than you knew, actually, as the girl suddenly began stomping your way. Her feet, clad in nothing more than a skimpy pair of sandals, marched right to you. Her second step was right over you, crashing down right behind you. The force knocks you to your knees, but there she stops and stands still. Her heel, slightly cracked and dry, was right there, just a short climb away; if you wanted her attention, this was the way to do it. With a grunt, you stand up and run...</span></div></div>",

To someone as small as you, the sudden displacement of air sucks you into the small (even by your standards) crevice.  As you land on the steep incline that is her sandal, you try to find something to grab onto. But the insole is greased with sweat, grime, and skin flakes. The smell is also unbearable, and you are sent into a coughing fit as you slide down the sandal like it were a slip and slide, only more terrifying.

Quicker, you need to be quicker, and so you swing your arm forward and jam it flat against the warm flesh, reaching above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a moment later she's back on the ground. Your shoulder strains, the forward sliding of the treadless sandal causing her foot to slip just slightly, just enough to yank at the speck beneath her, just enough to make it fear being ripped in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's been literal seconds but already you're already running out of strength. She steps onward, bashing you flat as you claw along her sole, inching forward to the relative safely of her toes, one handful of skin at a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stops, standing still over you once more. But you've done it, and with a final tug and a wet sucking sound you pull your head free, sucking in the air that filtered down from above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your left was a towering strap, the fabric that held shoe to foot. It ascended into the nearly vaulted ceilings of her toes, and you realized that you found yourself resting in the little gap beneath the curl of her second and third toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou choked back a pained laugh, as the toes clench around you.</span></div></div>",

Her feet were aching after all that traveling from a agricultural area all the way to this suburbia road. Unfortunately, the inn that she stayed back at the previous area wasn't the most pleasant place to spend the night at; the bed was almost as hard as a rock and not to mention a heated argument from the next room as well as some loud music from the ceiling kept her awake all night. As a result, she's nearly drowsy and decided to find another place to relax for a bit. This suburban community might have a nice home for her to stay in, but finding one that's suitable is a little difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, is there any place that'll look nice enough for me to rest?

I need a place to catch a break.\" she said as she stumbled across the concrete path that leads to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe approached the door and can see a sign that reads \"Stevensons\". \"I wonder if they'll be nice enough to invite me in...\" she said and ringed the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ringed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good ten times, she stands there and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dammit, looks like they're not even home!\" she said and left the doorway.

Your hiding spot, near a vent in the room's corner, also happened to be right near the entrance, giving you a great view of how small you were. Their massive feet, bare, socked, nylon-ed, stomped past you. How were you supposed to get their attention when the smallest toe of the smallest person was the size of a car? You lean back on the vent cover and put your face in your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Click</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was that? It came from behind, from the vent...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to run, but the gust of hot air catches you and sends you spinning into the sky. Hot air rises, after all, and you're caught in the biggest updraft of your life. You, and some pieces of dust that were mostly smaller than you, tumbled away from the corner, into the center of the room. Most of the debris fell harmlessly to the floor, though a few did collide with the giants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour fate was different. Perhaps because of your density or your odd shape, you drifted towards the table. towards the family's food. \"No no no!\" Gently, you began to sink to the bowl in front of the bouncing, skyscraper sized little girl as she struggled with the milk carton. \"Please, no!\" You flapped your arms, alternating between fish-like and bird-like motions, but your path was set by air currents, not you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"So, what's going on after school?\"</font> From nowhere an older woman appears, the family's mother. She grabbed the carton from her daughter's hands and began pouring it into the cereal below. You screamed again but the torrent flooded by, missing you by only an inch. Still, its power sent you hurdling away, further in the air and across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"I have soccer practice,\"</font> states the teen girl as you soar by. Her mouth stretches open, pulling in huge current of air. She's yawning, without even bothering to cover her mouth? The force is strong, pulling you towards the soaking cavern. \"Stop! Stop!\" Your shouts fall away in the wind, but as you pass her lips she exhales, pushing an endless volume of morning breath in your direction. You hurdle away, back to the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"Great. Do I have to wait around for her?\"</font> It's the teen boy this time who's words throw you about. It smells no better than the girl's did, but at least he was gracious enough to not suck you in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">\"No, I can pick her up. What are you doing, though, that it's an issue?\"</font> The dad speaks, but despite his greater size, you're blown about less roughly. In fact, it seems like you've descended past mouth level. You realize what's going to happen. The bowl of cereal looms larger than an Olympic pool, and the rough milky seas is all that's below. But who's bowl is it?</span></div></div>",

She had to finish before Jake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over and saw him with his bowl to his lips, drinking the milky remains. Milk dribbled onto his chin as he hurriedly gulped to last drops of breakfast. He slammed the bowl on the table, quickly standing up. \"<i>Buurp!</i> Alright, I'm done.

Smugly, he called back, \"That's right, I finished first, so I'm in the right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna slouched in her seat. She was so close to finishing, too. Dejectedly, she finished eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Emily could tell there was some drama flying about, she was way more interested in her food. She was careful to eat around the colorful marshmallows, saving the titular lucky charms for last. Getting that blast of sugary sweetness was so worth the effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Jake was just finishing up with the toilet. Standing over the sink, he washed his hands and smiled to himself in the mirror. Nothing in his teeth... Shrugging, he grabbed the mouthwash. He swished it around his mouth, figuring it be'd a fine replacement for brushing this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna was outside the door when he finished. \"It's all ready for you, Your Grace.\" He flashed her the biggest shit-eating grin before heading to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCovering her nose, Brianna stormed into the room. It stank alright, thanks to his insistence on a morning dump, but it had been worse, and she'd live. She urinated quickly, then grabbed for her toothbrush. A quick brushing, hardly hitting all of the important spots, then she was out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily's next, potty-ing and brushing with the help of Jenna. It's a thorough brushing job, if nothing else. They finish, and Jenna sends Emily to her room so she could get dressed for the day.</span></div></div>",

The combination of the fierce heat and milk and cereal became a thick sour bog and you found yourself retching whenever you got a breath in. As everything rocked back and forth you could still hear the sounds from outside, and the giant family talking. This oblivious woman devoured you, a human being and didn't even realize it. She's just carrying on with the rest of her day, none the wiser to the atrocity she just committed. This realization just served to upset you even more-- no one would ever find you or realize what happened to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!! Help! Please! I'm,,,, I'm inside you! You ate me! Please! Let me out!\" you screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only response your captor gave was the burbling groans of her digestive system and the <i>thump thump</i> of her heartbeat above. There was more swaying and rocking, and you found yourself sinking into the churning muck. Your crying turned into hysterical laughter and you wondered how long you had before the acids in her stomach broke you down into nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was difficult to tell how much time was passing in your prison cell, but soon there was thick sloppy sounds coming from above. You whimpered in the dark as globs of slime poured all around and over you, forcing you down into the swamp of the half-filled stomach. More and more poured down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'She's eating...' you realized, feeling even more hopeless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother glob of chewed up food landed on, this one much larger than the others. It landed with a harsh slap, burying you deep in the goop. The stuff got in every orifice and you shuddered as you could even taste some of what it used to be. Some sort of... seafood. Lobster?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore churning. You broke the surface of the hot slime, gagging and sputtering. You could feel yourself tingling all over. The acids were no doubt getting to work now. Everything swayed and rocked more. You could hear muffled laughter and voices from outside. She was talking to other women. They were laughing, happy. All of them oblivious to the private hell going on down here. It must've been lunch time already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling weak, you closed your eyes and laid down into the muck. Hopefully you could at least fall asleep and die peacefully. Before long however, everything began to grumble and groan around you. Your prison started rocking back and forth, very violently now. What was she doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had a chance to even speculate, everything contracted and collapsed around you. You screamed as the contents of this stomach, including you were swept up and forced upward at breakneck speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight flooded your limited vision and--!! </span></div></div>",

There was no other way to put it; she had made a mess. Her lunch had come back up, and it had come up quickly. Most of the puke had filled the sink, but more than enough had splashed out, with chunks speckled along the mirrors and counters. And, to her major disgust, up the front of her blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she was back in her office making a call. \"Hello, custodial department? This is admissions.

She was going to have to head home and change. Luckily she was the head of her department; no one would be coming around to ask about her temporary absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was quick. Standing in front of her wardrobe, Jenna realized that the blouse was too far gone to save. The shoes and skirt could be washed, but the sheer amount of spew on her shirt made it only suitable for the trash. She set it aside, slipping into a new outfit, and grabbing a more comfortable pair of heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any more trouble, she left the house, chucking the blouse into the trash as she walked to her car.</span></div></div>",

Six months was far too long for that retail theft conviction. She was only 24, how dare they take away her precious youth like that! Well, that, and the drugs they found in her pocket. She was holding them for a friend, really\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping her booted feet along to the beat, she was grateful that they at least allowed her to listen to music. Not only did it help pass the time, but this way she didn\u2019t have to listen to those stuck-up muckety-mucks talk about their vacation homes and ex-husbands. It was bad enough that she had to watch them strut around in outfits that cost more than what she made in a month, while she had to schlep around in this smelly janitor\u2019s outfit that covered up all her beautiful tattoos. It always amazed her what slobs these people really were. If she could get away with it, she\u2019d love to spit in their soap dispenser, but she didn\u2019t think Officer O\u2019Malley would look kindly upon her if she got fired. Best to do as little as possible without losing her job while doing the small things to make these place as horrible as possible for those rich bastards. For example, she hasn\u2019t changed the water in her mop bucket all month, and this pile of puke will make a nice addition to the toxic stew that already contained the liquefied remains of Mary\u2019s rotten casserole that the old bitch dumped all over the break room floor. Lysa giggled as she imagined painting the walls of this hellhole with a torrid mixture of vomit and diarrhea. But still, there was work to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pushed the mop around the sink, the janitor noticed something sparkling in the trash bin. Reaching her gloved hand toward the mass of balled-up papers, she noticed that someone had carelessly discarded a diamond earring amongst the trash. She could not possibly care less if one of these stupid broads lost a piece of jewelry worth more than her car. In fact, the diamond was a good size, and Lysa could certainly sell it for a good sum. She quickly pocketed the earring, before bagging up the rest of the trash and tossing it out into the hall. A little bit of paper and dirt fell out of the bag and onto to the floor, but she couldn\u2019t care less, she was too busy thinking of what she could buy herself once she pawned that earring. She smiled to herself again as she cleaned up the rest of the putrid vomit.</span></div></div>",

As she walked through the hallways, the filthy janitor met every disgusted stare from each cubicle queen with a glare of her own as she passed. She wasn\u2019t going to let them just judge her like that without giving a little back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she stepped aboard the elevator and smashed the button to go down. As she waited for the elevator to arrive, she absentmindedly fingered the earring in her pocket. It\u2019s going to bring her the best paycheck she\u2019s had in a long time. The bell dinged and she rolled the cart aboard. Only a couple more hours and she can finally go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the trash collected and sinks scrubbed, the tired employee punched her time card before she punched anyone in the face. Grabbing her gym bag out of her locker, she ducked into a freshly-cleaned bathroom and took her street clothes out of her bag. Placing the illicitly-gained earring on the toilet tank, she stripped out of her sweaty janitor uniform and tossed it aside. She took a quick glance at her poverty-skinny body and put on a profanity-laden t-shirt and tight-fitting shorts. Hearing someone enter the bathroom, Lysa quickly scooped up the earring and tossed it in her bag, which still contained yesterday\u2019s dirty gym clothes; she made a mental note to wash those when she got home before they started growing mold. She tossed the uniform into the laundry basket in the locker room, where some poor slob will cart it away to the dry-cleaning company. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun beat down on the parking lot as Lysa made her way to her beat-up car. A blast of trapped heat greeted her as she opened the door and tossed her bag on the back seat. The driver\u2019s seat squeaked as she sat down and turned the key in the ignition. The unloved engine groaned to live with a cough before settling into a regular burble. She wanted to get home as soon as possible so she can put her new earring in a safe place until she can figure out what to do with it. She picked at a broken piece of plastic trim on the dashboard with a dark-painted thumbnail while wondering if the local pawn shop will ask too many questions about how she acquired it. Maybe she could sell it online. The rusty car rumbled out of the parking lot, towards the bad part of town that contained Lysa\u2019s rathole apartment.</span></div></div>",

They swoosh and swing with the littlest of movements, and there is never a moment of stillness, especially not when massive gloved digits kept popping in to give the earring a fondle. It was better than being in the woman's stomach, for sure, but that wasn't saying a whole lot. So, when the fingers descended without gloves on, you took your chances and hitched a ride out on the jewelry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was disorienting, to say the least. You went from near dark to shining light, and then were immediately dropped on a cold, white plain. Stumbling to your feet, you rubbed the spots from your eyes and flipped your massive captor the bird. She didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched her change, the first time you've really had to see who snatched you from the trash. She was scrawny, thin and sickly in a way that suggested she wasn't getting quiet enough to eat. When she lifted her arms and removed her shirt, you could clearly see each rib outlined in the tattooed skin. Still, you got the sense that she wasn't weak or frail; a little hungry, sure, but behind the skinny arms and thin stomach, you could see a vicious, fight or flight ferocity that you didn't want to mess with. Maybe she wasn't the right choice to help you out here. Not that you had a lot of available options...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFootsteps from the far side of the room. She turns, and quickly reaches for her little diamond prize. You're swept up in her grasp, and in the time it takes to blink you found yourself thrust into a bag of old clothes. The fabric you bounce over is ratty, worn stuff, clearly having been in use for some time. It also smells. No, not smells; it reeks. The stench of old, stale sweat is thick as butter in the air, making it hard to breath as you try to catch your breath. It reminds you of the woman's stomach, actually; not exactly the same, but just as overpowering and repulsive as her gastric stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole bag shifted. You look up towards the zipper, just in time to be thrown aside as the girl picked up her things and started walking. The clothes shift massively with each step, and you stumble along the surface of a cloth ocean. A gap between a graying gym sock and a stained shirt opens up, and to your horror the earring, a piece of metal and gem the size of a large car, is swallowed whole. You dive after it; it was your last connection to the giantess above, and you weren't going to be lost in this bag without it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light that leaked in from above is lost as you sink beneath the layers. Blindly, you feel around for the jewelry. Your hand wraps about the cold metal. You pull at it, but an especially rough bump sends a lose strand of string at you. It whips across your face, sending you back through another hole in another garment. You tumble down, smashing against nasty, damp clothes: gym socks and training bras and old shorts, all of which hungrily accept you into their folds. Above, fibers; below, threads; in front, cloth; to the back, strings. As you get deeper and deeper, it gets harder and harder to breath. Your mind gets blurry, but when you finally stop sinking you immediately get back up. You had to get to that earring. Pushing through clothes that needed a wash more than Pig Pen did, you can only hope you'll find it before the girl wants it back.</span></div></div>",

Police sirens rang out from across the block as she parked her car on the street. She grabbed her bag from the back seat and slammed the door shut, not bothering to lock it because that would only lead to a busted side window. There was nothing worth stealing in there anyway. The sagging wooden steps creaked under her boots as the stomped her way up to her second-floor apartment. As soon as she was across the threshold, she started up the washer and unzipped her bag. The clothes cascaded into the machine in a linen waterfall. Shit! The earring! Lysa dumped the remaining clothes out on the floor, hands desperately searching for her prize. Panties and shirts went flying in all directions as she dumped each one out in turn, hoping for the shiny meal ticket to drop out. Each empty pocket was met with a curse. Finally, the earring dropped out of a bra cup and bounced onto the tile floor. Sighing with relief, she jammed the earring into a pocket of her too-tight shorts for safe-keeping while she scooped up and threw the rest of the clothes into the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that today\u2019s chores are done with, time for a shower! The dirty dishes can wait, time to get the stink of work off. Also the stink of sweat and puke. She filled a bathroom cup with water and placed the earring inside to rinse off whatever horribleness was in that trash can, hoping that diamond doesn\u2019t rust. Stripping off her clothes, she jumped into the shower. The curtain was ripped and she lived alone anyway, so there\u2019s no point in using it. The water felt great as it cascaded down her body, washing away all the sweat and grime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter toweling off, the parolee slipped on a tank top and panties. The warm day made wearing anything else impractical. That, and the air conditioner was still broken. Lysa turned the bathroom cup over, letting the water run between her fingers and keeping the earring in her palm. She wasn\u2019t going to almost lose it down the drain a second time. Lifting it up to her own ear, she thought about just keeping it for herself. Maybe not, gaudy gold wasn\u2019t really her style. Looking at herself in the mirror, her roots told her it was time to dye her hair again soon. Perhaps she\u2019ll try purple next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut anyway, it was time to celebrate! Finds like this don\u2019t come around every day. Placing the earring on the messy coffee table next to the overflowing ash tray, Lysa dragged her bong out from under the couch. She hadn\u2019t toked up in forever, and what are the chances she\u2019ll get dragged to a drug test? Being able to hold down a job and \u201cdemonstrate independence\u201d should be enough to let her enjoy herself every now and then. She felt so good that she even broke out the Good Stuff. With as much as that earring must be worth, Lysa knew she could buy lots of the best leaf around. Taking a deep hit, she let the smoke percolate inside her chest. Ah\u2026 that\u2019s the stuff. She laid back and blew a smoke ring, watching it rise up to the water-damaged ceiling. Man, it\u2019s really been a while since she toked. She was getting sleepy already. Placing the earring next to her belly button, she contemplated getting it pierced. Can you even pierce a belly button with an earring? One of the guys down at the tattoo shop would probably know. It would have to wait for her next paycheck anyway. She took another hit. Either this stuff is stronger than she remembered, or her tolerance went way down, because her eyelids were suddenly very heavy. Sticking her hand down into her panties, she gave her crotch a quick scratch. She thought about ordering a pizza, then closed her eyes, sound asleep\u2026 zzz\u2026 </span></div></div>",

Pants and socks and shirts and panties all went flying, soaring miles above you. She was looking for the earring, and by proxy you, but at this rate you were worried she'd miss it's hiding spot, nestled safely in a bra cup. You were safe, too, having jammed yourself in the smallest of golden rings that held the dangling diamonds to the gold hook. As long as she found it, you'd be going for the ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, giant fingers grab at the edge of the bra. You look up at the girl, following the long expanse of tatted arm to her face. She wasn't looking in your direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bra went tumbling as she knocked it away, and your earring tumbled along. It, and you, rolled along a rough wooden floor, clattering to a stop a few real-sized feet away. That got the giant's attention; you could almost feel the relief on her face a she quickly snatched you up. You were dropped into a tight pocket (again with the pockets!) and whisked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more tumbly minutes, and she reaches back for you. A harrowing second passes where her fingernail slams dangerously close to your head, giving you a chance to see your disheveled reflection in her nearly black nail polish, but then you're back in the air. That too passes, as she drops the earring into a cup of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't expecting that. Water flows into your throat as you take an instinctive gasp. You clutch at your neck, trying to hold back the choking sensation, then you grab at the metal around your waist, trying to free yourself. The burning in your lungs intensifies; you begin to struggle and panic. More out of fear than anything else, you faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA familiar smell awakens you some time later. To your left is the earring, to your right is a hole in your fleshy ground, and up ahead were two mountains, covered in more ratty fabric. It's all very strange, and you feel like you should be able to place it, but your mind is foggy, unclear, and you're having trouble forming clear thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that odor was there, too. There were a lot of smells in the air: bodywash, sweat, a hint of old, stale puke. But those were all faint. The strongest smell... It was definitely something your remembered, something from your years in the dorms...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind just didn't want to work. Actually, neither did you. You slumped back to the soft ground, and stared at the patterns inked all along it. They were <i>really</i> pretty. With a contented grunt, you rolled over, right towards...</span></div></div>",

How hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what should I do, little fella?\" she mockingly asked her prisoner, dangling him above her open beer, having already reached a decision.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLet's do some Google-fu, little dude,\u201d Lysa said, grabbing the tiny dude and placing him atop her beer can. \u201cMaybe there's an outbreak of tiny man disease. Hope you've got Obamacare, little bro. Hey, if you like your size, can you keep your size?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny man gripped the tab on the beer can like a roller coaster safety bar as the giant stoner lifted it into the air. The grimy apartment flew by in a whirl of colors and motion as Lysa walked over to her computer desk and set the can down with a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep your hands and feet inside the Coors at all times, heh, unless you want to ride the water slide.\u201d The little man wondered what she meant, until he felt the can tilt as Lysa brought it to her lips. Gallons of beer rushed into her mouth, and the increasing tilt of the can caused him to hold onto the tab for dear life. He knew losing his grip would cause him to fall into the raging rapids of beer, which would carry him deep into this woman's body. He looked across her nose at a pair of glassy eyes that were crossed trying to focus on him. The tidal wave of tipple ceased, and the can became level again so Lysa placed it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess the ride's over, huh. Everyone off,\u201d Lysa said, grabbing the shrunken man and placing him on the desk. He landed amid a chaotic landscape of empty cans and half-eaten bags of chips. An overflowing ashtray stood tall in the center of the sea of refuse, like a post-apocalyptic monument to human consumption. He watched as Lysa reached over and flicked the computer monitor to life. Bright light spilled forth from its flat panel. God probably had such a display in mind when he let there be light, except Genesis wishes it was in glorious HD. It was clear enough that the tiny man could make out everything on the screen as the giant woman pulled up her internet browser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet's see here\u2026 let's try \u2018shrunken men\u2019. Huh, there's a lot of hits. Maybe we can get you back to your little tribe, dude!\u201d Lysa said, easily moving a mouse around the size of a semi truck. The hairs on the back of the little man's neck began to stand up, as he was internet savvy enough to guess what would come next, as he watched Lysa click on a few links.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, there's an entire fetish around this. Man, people are so weird. Still, let's try checking this one out\u2026\u201d Lysa mumbled to herself as she brought up a video on the screen. The little guy watched as a woman pretended to step on a shrunken man that was poorly green-screened into the video. Another link showed an actress taunting a little guy, before eating him. A close-up of her neck showed a bulge traveling down her throat, before panning to to reveal a smug, satisfied expression on her heavily made-up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI've seen better acting in indie movies,\u201d Lysa said. \u201cOh, there's stories, too.\u201d She took a swig of beer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of text appeared on the screen. The little man's eyes strained, but he couldn't make anything out. Lysa, obviously not the patient type, quickly scrolled down to get to the good stuff. What she found must've been appealing, as her right hand drifted from the mouse to under the waistband of her shorts. While the little man's view was blocked by the keyboard tray, the movements of the giantess's arm left little doubt as to what she was doing. The computer chair creaked as the stoner reclined back and closed her eyes, her lips slightly parted in bliss. Just as the little man thought that Lysa was about to drift back to sleep, her eyes snapped open and she slapped the table with such ferocity that it caused the little man to fall on his ass. He watched the beer can tilt, afraid that he might be crushed to death under cheap beer before the aluminum monolith righted itself. Lysa leaned over, close enough that the little man could smell the alcohol on her breath. She had a wicked gleam in her bloodshot eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! I just realized that those broads in those dumb videos were charging money! Obviously, the profits weren't going to the special effects budget. But I've got a real, little tiny man right here! Assuming you're not actually a hallucination, anyway. How about we go into the fetish movie business together? I'll take care of the profits, and you can live here rent-free! I wouldn't want you to get crushed by a dollar bill, or anything. Good deal, right? Tell you what, since you're the star of the show, I'll let you decide what our first movie should be. Do you want to do a vore video? I've got the munchies, and you look like the perfect snack. Or do you want to do a body exploration video, and climb the hills and spelunk into the caves of Mount Lysa?\u201d She punctuated her spiel with a wink. This woman is obviously deranged. You're a human being, not a prop to be used in a stoner\u2019s scheme to get more pot money! To hell with it. You could probably hide amongst the trash until her high wears off, and hopefully she'll think that you were just a really vivid hallucination. Then, you can make your escape the next time she leaves or falls asleep. Plus there's more than enough junk food and stale beer on this desk alone to sustain you for a while.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

As she sniffed at her carton of milk though, her nose wrinkled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she padded back to the desk to retrieve the beer can, splashing its remaining contents over the cereal.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lysa\u2019s eyes flickered open as the coffee table began to sing. Wait, it wasn\u2019t the table itself, just her cell phone sitting on top. The ringtone spat out various expletives to a driving beat before she picked it up. Glancing at the screen with bloodshot eyes, she noticed that it was her friend Erika. The voice on the phone informed Lysa that she had just gotten off of work herself and wanted to know if the janitor wanted to hit up the gym for a bit. The pothead would rather go to a bar, but maybe she could hit up her friend for a meal after they worked out. All that toking had made her ravenous, and the fridge was currently empty. She planned on hanging out near the treadmills until her friend was done, then casually suggest grabbing a bite to eat. At least she had the presence of mind to ask Erika to pick up her up, as she knew she was still way too high to drive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe figured she was already dressed appropriately for the gym, so she simply slipped on a pair of badly worn-out off-brand sneakers and grabbed a towel. Not wanting to leave the earring behind, in case, you know, someone stole the stolen object, she grabbed it and inserted it into her own ear, not caring that it looked totally mismatched with the empty hole in the opposite ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA car horn honked from the street, Erika\u2019s signal that she arrived. Locking the door behind her, Lysa shuffled down the steps and sat in the passenger seat of the car. It was a newer model sedan, certainly much better than her own rustbucket. Erika gave her friend a playful shove as she smelled Lysa\u2019s pot stench wafting off her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou dog. Aren\u2019t you still on parole?\u201d she said, looking at Lysa over her black-rimmed glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGive me a break, it\u2019s alright. I had a great day at work, so I\u2019m celebrating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had better hope I don\u2019t get pulled over,\u201d Erika snarked, as she pulled onto the street and drove toward the gym, as the last rays of sunlight began to dip below the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the gym, the overwhelming smell of sweat and damp rubber pads masked any residual pot odor. Erika swiftly took her friend\u2019s arm and guided her into a small side room filled with a large group of people assembled on a rubber mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, they have hot yoga classes now!\u201d Erika said excitedly. Always one to try the latest diet fat, the constantly slightly-overweight brunette had one fatal flaw that prevented her from ever losing those final pounds: she was a huge pothead. In fact, Lysa was her dealer before she went away. But she had a good heart, as evidenced by the fact that she drove her friend home the day she was released from prison. Still, she couldn\u2019t wait to ask her friend if they could go back to Lysa\u2019s apartment and toke up after working out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly wanting to please her friend long enough to get some food out of her, Lysa took off her shoes and shuffled over to an empty spot on the mat next to Erika. Many of the heavier clients glared at the colorful tattoos inked on her rail-thin body. Soon enough, the instructor appeared and began to guide the group through the first lesson. The stuffy air in the room quickly began to make her sweat again, and gave her uncomfortable flashbacks to begin stuffed in that heavy janitor\u2019s suit. Rivulets of sweat began to run down her stomach and began to collect in her navel. She wiped herself off with a towel and contorted into the next posture. </span></div></div>",

Light snores carried you through what would have been an uneventful and terribly boring car ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the hot yoga began, though, things changed. Sweat began to gleam on Lysa's skin, nearly imperceptible at first, a shiny layer that grew with each and every position she took. A drop of the salty water began to collect in the folds of her bellybutton, just inches above your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mountain of a woman shifted from a \"Left Half Moon\" to a \"Right Triangle.\" The drop shimmered and quivered; still, you slept, turning over in the cocoon of skin that held you. This pose must have been more difficult for her; she began to twitch, shaking the ceiling of your little cave. A sigh, still unheard by you, and she lurched back to standing position, reaching over for her towel. The sweat dropped, splashing over your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SWEAR OFFICER IT'S NOT MINE!\" You sat up, screaming as your nightmare was washed away. What happened? Where were you? And why did you smell like sweat and pot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wall of fabric rushed past in front of you; a towel, magnified a thousand fold. As it greedily sucked at the sweat around you, it all came back, from waking up at the house to being eaten and vomited to being kidnapped by this janitor. You were nothing more than a speck, a piece of lint that could be drowned by perspiration. Struggling to your feet, you pushed through the swamp and moved to the bellybutton's entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gazed into the infinite. Staring across the simple little room of the gym, you watched incomprehensible beings in an endless space. Even your ride was too big to picture. Her legs, just beyond a skimpy shelf of fabric, stretched onward and onward towards feet that could level Olympus. Up above past the colorful expanse of her stomach's skin were her breasts, planets that blocked out her undoubtedly goddess-like visage. It was all a bit overwhelming, and with little more than a whimper you crawled back into the safe haven of her navel, looking for a cranny to hide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe god you rode had a different plan. She moved her arms and pointed her head towards the ground, her body making an inverted \"V\" shape with her rear pointed up in the air; the classic \"Downward Dog.\" The walls and floor of her navel suddenly became vertical and, assisted by the sweat, you began to slide. You flail wildly, grabbing at the slick surface around you, looking for something, anything, to stop your fall. Your hand clutches around a piece of lint, grey and worn from age, and holding it to your chest you fell free of her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot yards into your fall and she's moving again, changing position into another convoluted pretzel shape. Her thigh rushes up to say hello, and you manage to shout out a farewell as you bounce off a Chinese character drawn on her skin. Your motion is twisted, and you hurdle towards her other leg. She's moving into a different insane shape, and you prepare another scream as her knee rushes up to you. It hits, hard, and you see earring-shaped stars as you are launched further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake the dizzy away, urging your focus to return just as another wall of skin collides with you. You don't get knocked away, though; this was softer, less bony, and it welcomes you in a warm embrace. You stick to it with a jolt, dropping the lint ball you had somehow managed to hold on to. It falls away, and with a gasp you start to figure out where you've stuck to.</span></div></div>",

The smooth landscape you were stuck to stretched it taut, swelling against the shirt every time the enormous janitor inhaled. To your left was an impossibly deep canyon. The beads of sweat you'd been following looked utterly tiny by comparison as they slid into the chasm of cleavage. You were even tinier, marooned on the wide landscape of Lysa\u2019s breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew you were small but, even proportionally, her tits seemed absolutely <i>massive</i>. They jutted out far enough to create a kind of shelf. Laying on your back, you could see straight up. Past the her bare neck was sharp line of her jaw, which churned as she spoke thunderously to someone in the distance. She was conversing with another colossus. The firm ground beneath you quaked with every booming word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden shadow drew your gaze back down. You were startled by what you saw; two gigantic hands.  The other monolith of a woman was reaching out, her enormous palms hurtling right toward the janitor\u2019s chest. Horrified by the sheer scale of it all, you could only watch as they crashed into your world of fatty tissue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers the size of skyscrapers sunk into glistening flesh, sending seismic waves through it. The new giant was jostling Lysa's enormous tits. The jiggling of her breasts created a more violent earthquake than you could\u2019ve ever imagined. They seemed like planets of flesh, rocking up and down with every playful bounce. You rolled across her exposed skin, catching brief glances of her chin and the sky as you went. You realized where you were heading and felt dread wash over you. A pale gorge was waiting below, ready to devour your minute body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed the entire way down. The air got more and more humid as you fell deeper into her cleavage. You tumbled helplessly, bouncing off the pliant walls. It eventually became too dark to see. The soft mountains finally met, catching you in their cushy mass. You tried to catch your breath and were hit with the salty smell of the janitor\u2019s sweat. Looking skyward, you saw just how vast the trench was. Her boobs stretched higher than you could've hoped to climb. They were incomprehensibly huge. You swallowed nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hopefully that other girl doesn't jiggle her tits again. <br>\r\n</i></span></div></div>",

The tattoos that coat her pale flesh lack beauty, purely sketchy images of pain and loss.  She may give off a tough image, but she's got issues, and you wish you could comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, you plunge on past her belly button, narrowly avoiding a collision as she inhales.  Her underwear has seen better days, unwashed and reeking, sporting tears bigger than you.  The long, long legs are dotted with the treestumps of dark, shaved hairs, interspaced with coiled serpents and the scabs of forgotten pains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get too poetic, you thud into the ground.  Your miniscule mass rolls with only a loss of lungs-air and a minor bruising, but as you look up you do agree that things could still end badly if one of Lysa's feet should be carelessly placed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are between the two behemoths, so you cannot keep both in view at one time; their vast domination of the landscape is reinforced as each minor shift of the woman's weight reverberates through the floor.

You want to run, to flee from the destructive forces, but in many ways trying to put distance between yourself and these plateaus of power would be inviting them to step on you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a new presence announces itself with even heavier, ground-quaking steps .  Reeling, you witness Lysa's even more immense friend walk back in, no doubt holding some clothes to be tried on.  You're absorbed more by the pale, scuffed trainers she wears, even more deadly weapons than Lysa's bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPast her is freedom, a larger world of this clothing shop.  Perhaps you should go out there, to try and find help?  But maybe Erika will be able to provide respite if you go to her, while she stands before you?

You angle yourself towards them, trying hard not to think about where they'd been. After all, you're probably still filthier than any of them. The garbage bin fills your vision, and you fall in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt terminal velocity, you tear through the first layer of wet paper. The tissue behind it stops you, and your little body bounces off it. You are sent tumbling, bouncing hard off balls of towels as you fall through the trash. Finally you come to a rest, laying between a tampon wrapper and a snotty tissue, utterly pinned and helpless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, you weren't one to give up easily, especially not after you survived those hours in the gut. Up above, through the layers of waste and paper, the janitor girl still worked; she was your ticket out of here. \"Hey!\" you shout, hopeful it'll pierce the silence of the bathroom. \"I'm in the garbage! Hey! Give me a hand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt almost surprises you that she turns and looks down. Her bored expression twists into surprise, but it wasn't directed at you. She reached down, giant blue gloves pushing aside trash as she reached for something. Her ring finger smacks into you; you try to hold on, but the plastic is slick with vomit and her movements are too wild. As she retracts the hand, you are sent tumbling off at her waist height, falling past her uniformed legs and towards the can once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, you manage to grab a hold on the side of the trash bag, just your-scale yards from the opening. It seems like a great position, until the girl begin to grab up the bag and move it. You're pushed on all sides as her hand wraps around your location, the rubber and flesh having surprisingly little give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then you're in the air. She hurled the back out the open door into the hallway, and you were sent tumbling among a few pieces of paper towel that had escaped the bag. You hit the floor, hard, and can only watch as the janitor finishes with the puke, before walking your way. Her boots, thickly soled and slightly dirty, stomp by, missing you by inches. You watch her foot go down on a paper ball the size of a two-story house. The ball collapses instantly to a flat paper pancake, and is dragged along by her boot heel as she steps away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the bag, sets it on her janitor cart, and rolls away, leaving you alone with the rest of the dirt and grime on the floor.</span></div></div>",

The three of them, Abigail, Marinette, and Celica, were business students, assigned to work as a group for a sample case study in their finance class. Now, the week the project was due, the three were finally getting together to collate their materials and finish up the work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, don't be so proud,\" Celica said, flipping her blond hair as she grabbed a seat at the squarish table in the middle of the room.

Clearly, she didn't want to give in, but she had to see where they were coming from. She slid her feet back, letting her toes dance over the thinning fabric of her cheap insole. Curiously, she felt a little bump against their underside; a lump that was a bit larger than the other debris that she was used to. She moved her big toe over it, tapping once, twice, three times before pressing down, feeling the odd (but not unpleasant) way it contorted against her skin. Sliding her chair back, she began to peer down below the table, interested in what this pebble really was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think we can afford to lose those two charts there,\" Cel said suddenly, drawing Mari's attention back to the group, \"but the rest I'm going to insist need to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to be moving on, Mari dropped the thoughts of her shoes and instead encouraged Abi to show what she had prepared.

While both Amanda and Nadia weren't doing too great at the moment, they have no idea if the other four were doing so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there Amanda and Nadia!\" Georgette called up to them as she and the others left the house after successfully selling their cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Georgette!\" replied Amanda \"Are you guys doing good today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette nodded \"We're selling them quite well today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelissa hold up the money box to the two and opens it; there were plenty of money inside which made them impressed on their progress. \"Even though we didn't make too much, we still got a decent amount of cash to win that top prize.\" said Penny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you girls did very good job on this.\" said Amanda \"Now I'm sure Mia and her troop won't be winning this year anymore.\" The six girls all laugh at that last remark, they all can't wait to see that snob's reaction to her defeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways Amanda, do you think we should take a break for now.\" asked Eileen \"I mean the results won't come until tomorrow plus we been working extra hard today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmanda thinks about it for a bit before she finally agrees \"Great idea Eileen, maybe we could all hang out in my house for a bit before finally going back to selling the cookies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all cheered and they make their way to Amanda's house for some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile...</span></div></div>",

Tim leaned in close. \"Don't worry, I'll make it worth it.\" He put on his best seductive face, which was shockingly difficult as he struggled free from his boxers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wife just smiled, grabbing him and tossing him onto the bed. \"Let's get started, shall we?\" She climbed on top of him, her naked body doing a much better job of appearing seductive. \"How about I start top, then we'll switch halfway through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's member stood up, rubbing against her thigh. \"Looks like the downstairs office agrees with that.\" He grinned as she began to slide onto him.

Wordlessly, he entered her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, the two lay together, arms wrapped around each other.

Please!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlued to the head of the giant husband's penis, covered in slime, you desperately screamed up to him, begging to be noticed by the oblivious god. Besides the dull hum of the bathroom light, the only other response to your pleas was the sight of his massive hands swooping towards your location with a condom. You shrieked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier, you were jarred awake at the sight of the married titans as they shuffled into the bedroom. Your attempts to jump and yell to get their attention was fruitless-- they were never expecting a tiny person to be on their bed and even if they were they were too horny to notice your presence. When the wife pushed the husband onto the bed, the impact caused such an intense tremor that you were almost torn from the bed entirely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple collapsed all around you-- the immense ballsack of the husband sloughing onto the mattress just centimeters from your trembling frame. The wife's god-like form lowered from above, devouring the skyscraper like penis. You could hear the giants conversing, but it was more like booming roars from your perspective and they paid you no heed. They began to bounce up and down, violently, tossing you to and fro. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to get out of here. Struggling to maintain your footing, you began to make a mad dash between the titans' legs for the side of the bed. You were willing to take your chances with the drop at this point. But before you could make it all the way, the giants began to shift about. Were they finished already?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of the answer, you looked behind you just in time to see the husbands dick sliding along the mattress toward you. As he got up, it slammed into your back, and the vaginal juices from the wife glued you and other debris from the mattress to its head. You sobbed as he carried you into the bathroom, unsure of what was next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so then you shouted as the condom swooped down onto you, slamming harshly into your delicate frame. Thick, rubbery sounds assaulted your ears as you heard him roll it down his shaft. You kept struggling to free yourself, just barely managing to free an arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour musky prison shifted as the man walked, and you could see through the hazy latex back into the bedroom. The wife was laughing. From this viewpoint it almost looked normal, expect the giants had no idea you were hear. You kept hollering regardless, praying that<i> any</i> of your words would get through. But a few more steps and the wife's pulsating vagina was presented before you <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!! I'm trapped! Please don't do this!! I'm right--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were cut off as you were driven deep into the waiting maw. Suddenly fierce heat like you never felt before assaulted you. You screamed in the pitch darkness, your prison shifting in back and forth like a driving prison with such ferocity that you couldn't help but puke. Wailing on the head of the penis, you prayed this man would somehow still feel you and relent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no response. Back and forth. Back and forth. The speed began to pick up. Each thrust smashed you harshly into the flesh before you. You felt an arm snap, then a leg. You kept thrashing, sobbing now. Everything was so dark and chaotic! The couples' cries were drowned out by awful squelching sounds. Your life began to flash before your eyes. The heat began to pick up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thrust shoved your face into the piss slit of the giant. Feeling your tiny prick of an intrusion was enough to send him over the edge and he gasped as he came. Cum exploded out of the slit all around you, jettisoning you into the tip of the condom before burying you with more and more. You opened your mouth to scream but the semen remorselessly flooded in, filling every orifice. Your punished body convulsed wildly. Gagging on the blistering heat, you felt your consciousness begin to slip away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, darkness. </span></div></div>",
