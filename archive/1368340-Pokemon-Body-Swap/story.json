He had spent hours of his life drooling over her, and now he WAS her! Every perverted desire he ever had about her, now it was all at his- or rather <i>Joy's</i>- fingertips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock tore off the nurse's uniform in a rush, leaving him standing in Joy's frilly pink underwear. He nearly squealed at how cute the garments looked on his body, exactly the type of underwear he always imagined she'd wear. He rubbed his hands all over, just wanting to feel the softness of his skin, the delightful scent of a beautiful woman that he had been denied for years. If he couldn't have this woman's touch on his own, he would simply <i>become</i> her and bask in it himself. Truly, he was in deep love and lust, and not just with Joy, but with her magnificent <b>body</b>. <i>His body</i>. A perverted chuckle escaped from him, the normally sweet sounding voice of Joy uncharacteristically lecherous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Brock stripped out of his underwear, dropping to his knees and shoving the discarded panties to his face. He inhaled deeply, taking in the delicious scent of his new womanhood and<i> quivering </i>in aroused delight. Still holding the pair of panties to his face, his other hand reaches down and begins to <b>attack</b> his aroused sex. He falls on his back, muffled moans and squeaks of pleasure coming from Joy's sweet voice.</span></div></div>",

'Oh no!' He thought as his new brown paw slowly reached down through the cream fur towards his 'regions'. Instead of his usual sheath he felt something completely different and alien. Panicking he started feeling around trying in vain to find his lost pokehood but instead felt a strange pleasure that he should not have experienced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start he realized he was no longer a he but a she! Panicking he looked around wondering what to do when he thought. 'Wait! If i'm Bunary then that would mean Bunary is me!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly ran over to her old body and exclaimed. \"Bunary!
