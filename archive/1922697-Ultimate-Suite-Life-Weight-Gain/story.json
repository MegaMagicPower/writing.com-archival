It was a new ice cream parlor that was very well known for creating new and unusual ice cream flavors. Standing in front of the store was a man, looking very anxious, and wearing a chef's hat and apron. He was pacing back and forth as if he was looking for someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked by him, they both said in unison \"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, children...\" the man replied. Zack and Cody were about to walk away when they heard him say \"Wait....Children! That's it!\" He rushed in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello children!\" he said again, shaking both of the twin's hands. \"My name is Tony, and I run and own 'Tony's Fantastic and Creative Ice Cream Emporium, Home of Delicious and Mystical Ice Cream Flavors!....Or just Tony's for short...Anyway, I was wondering if you two boys will be willing to embark on a <i>'business proposition'</i> for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" said Zack, rather quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zack! You don't know what he wants!\" He snapped at his brother. \"What do you want us to do, sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you may know,\" Tony started, \"I run a ice cream store. And the main way that we get our business is to come up with new flavors that nobody else has. However, many of my customers are children, but I don't know what flavors children like! So, who I need are a couple of children to be taste testers! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.....\" The twins say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You know, that's not a bad idea,\" said Zack. \"Sitting in an ice cream shop, tasting flavours never made before...all the fudge you can handle...\"<br>\r\n\"Zack!\" snapped Cody. \"Think about how all of this is gonna cost us! There's no way we can afford twenty ice creams a day!\"<br>\r\n\"Cost you?\" smiled Tony. \"It's not gonna cost you a dollar, heck I'll be paying you to do this for me!\"<br>\r\n\"That's great!\" said Zack. \"I'm in!\"<br>\r\n\"Are you really thinking this through?\" said Cody. \"We can't eat that much ice cream every day!\"<br>\r\n\"Cody, this is a one in a million opportunity! There must be tonnes of guys out there who would love getting paid to eat ice cream! And now we can!\"<br>\r\n\"What's the catch?\" questioned Cody.<br>\r\n\"There is no catch!\" said Tony. \"I run an ice cream parlour, and some of the flavours are yet to be tested...that's all. It's just ice cream, the worst that could happen is if you get brainfreeze.\"<br>\r\n\"Seriously, Cody, you should join in.\"<br>\r\n\"Isn't ice cream bad for your health?\" he said, arrogantly. <br>\r\n\"Well, if your really that unsure, I can let you try some of my samples right now!\"<br>\r\nThey both followed Tony into his shop. It was sparkling and new, and they could here the freezer rumble at the back of the shop. He quickly fetched two sundaes and laid them in front of the twins.<br>\r\n\"Just to water your mouths a bit,\" he grinned. \"Just try these, tell me what you think and then you can decide whether to take the job or not.\"<br>\r\nZack grabbed a spoon and scooped the ice cream into his mouth.<br>\r\n\"It's delicious!\" shouted Zack.<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Tony. \"I'll go get some more!\"<br>\r\nCody took his first spoonful.<br>\r\n\"Hey, this really isn't that bad.\" said Cody.<br>\r\n\"Not bad? It's fantastic!\" said Zack.<br>\r\nTony came back with a trolley filled with small bowls. In each of these bowls were five scoops of ice cream.<br>\r\n\"This are my new test flavours!\" said Tony. \"I come up with about a dozen more every day, they're easy to make. All's you have to do is eat fifteen bowls a day and then write your thoughts down. I'll pay you seven bucks an hour, plus a fifty cents pay rise every two weeks you work here.\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" said Zack. \"I'm all up for it!\"<br>\r\n\"Fifteen bowls!\" said Cody, gobsmacked. \"We can't eat all that each!\"<br>\r\n\"I can.\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you've got your health to worry about!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll let you worry about my health and yours while I eat this ice cream.\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"But, you could get fat!\" said Cody.<br>\r\n\"Hey, so could you Mr Healthy! Come on, as long as we walk from our suite to Tony's and back, our figures will be fine!\"<br>\r\n\"I guess it's ok then...this is ordinary ice cream, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Well...not quite,\" said Tony. \"I've added extra flavour but their may be a few side effects.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh all right, I give in\" said Cody. \"Sign me up too!\"<br>\r\nTony put the fifteen bowls of ice cream in front of them. Zack dug in, and soon after, fifteen bowls were gone. He'd eaten more than he could take, but still wanted more.<br>\r\n\"You don't look so great,\" said Cody, who was on his eleventh bowl.<br>\r\n\"Neither do you,\" said Zack \"Heck, you look stuffed.\"<br>\r\nCody burped loudly and rubbed his thin waist.<br>\r\n\"I feel bloated,\" said Cody. \"But I think I can take a little more.\"<br>\r\nTony came back through with a camera and began snapping photos.<br>\r\n\"What are the photos for?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"Advertisements, blogs...that sort of thing. I need more customers to boost my business, and you look like great mascots. Hey, I'll even stick the pictures on the wall so people can see you enjoying yourselves when they come in.\"<br>\r\nTony took out the first two pictures and wrote \"Week 1\" on a noticeboard. He then pinned the separate pictures of Zack and Cody eating ice cream on and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Not bad. Are you guys done?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm finished.\" said Zack, pushing away the fifteenth bowl.<br>\r\n\"I can't take anymore.\" moaned Cody, belching over his half finished thirteenth portion.<br>\r\n\"That's ok. Just write your thoughts down on the noticeboard over there.\"<br>\r\nCody groaned and got off his seat. He and Zack walked over to the noticeboard and put mainly positive comments. They then collected fourteen dollars each, <br>\r\n\"So what did you think?\" said Zack.<br>\r\n\"I think I have indigestion.\" groaned Cody, clutching his stomach.<br>\r\n\"Don't be such a baby, come on lets go buy a hot-dog.\"<br>\r\nThey each bought one, and Cody slowly nibbled his way through his. It warmed up his taste buds a little.<br>\r\n\"That's better.\" he said. \"What did Tony do with the ice cream I didn't finish.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I ate it.\"<br>\r\n\"You did? Man, your stomach must be huge.\"<br>\r\nThey got back into their room and slouched on the couch, exhausted. <br>\r\n\"So your coming back tomorrow?\" <br>\r\n\"I'll try.\" said Cody. \"I'd better take the stairs next time, I don't wanna let that stuff get to my hips.\"<br>\r\n\"Who cares, it's only ice cream\" said Zack. \"Our summer break is fourteen weeks, we can pack in the job by then and spend the money.\"<br>\r\nThey watched TV for a few hours, before ordering large lunches and dinners from room service. Finally, they got into their pyjamas and went to bed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning was a Saturday and Zack rolled over in bed, his eyes gently blinking open. Tony's ice-cream, which he had shovelled into himself the previous day, was settled heavily in the bottom of his belly. But, despite this, he felt ravenous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Carey on a tour, she had asked Kurt to splash out on a personal refrigerator for Zack and Cody so they wouldn't starve while she was gone; he had done this, and now a fridge stood on the left side of each bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack sat up, his potbelly flopping over the waistband of his pants. He'd always been a bigger child and the bigger of the two twins; his size didn't really concern him. He was still quick - not as quick as Cody, but quick nonetheless - at running, and stronger than Cody's weak frame too. Besides, Coach said that the extra pounds Zack carried help his offence in Basketball. This was fine with Zack, as it meant he didn't have to diet, unlike some of the chubbier members of the team, who's weight slowed them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly rumbled; he put a hand to it and then reached over to the fridge, his belly curving into a slight roll on his sides. He opened the fridge, pulled out the food, and ate until the rumbling in his plump belly stopped... two hours later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis belly had inflated a little, just enough to contain the food, and the button on his briefs was straining a little. He looked over to the alarm clock; 9:00am. With summer vacation having started the previous day he and Cody could lay in, but in an half-an-hours' time they had to be at Tony's for work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got up, his big, jiggly belly wobbling freely over his pants, and made his way to Cody's bed. Cody was snoozing gently in the bed. Zack leaned down and gave Cody a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Code? We've got work in half-an-hour. You need to get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" grumbled Cody, sitting up and rubbing his eyes. Then, when his vision finally came to him, the first thing he got a view of was Zack's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got work in half-an-hours' time,\" said Zack, \"You need to get dressed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, k,\" he said and got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack plodded away, bending down at the pile of clothing on the floor; his love handles wobbled over the edge of his pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody picked up his own pants and easily put them on; as he reached over for a shirt, he caught sight of Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's odd,</i> he thought <i>Zack's always been chubby, but he looks chubbier than usual.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack huffed and puffed and pulled, the button of his trousers finally meeting over his potbelly. Slipping on a shirt, which clung to his rotund middle, he walked to Cody, said \"Let's go,\" and waited for Cody to put on his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" agreed Cody, \"Let's go,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel particcularly hungry this morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're always hungry, Zack,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cody! Please sit down, I've got your bowls right here!\"<br>\r\nTony pointed at a large table, behind his desk, filled with bowls, each containing delicious ice cream.<br>\r\n\"You expect us to eat all that? After breakfast?!\" Cody asked. He didn't expect so much ice cream.<br>\r\n\"Well as taste testers, you have to eat whatever I feed to you. These are all new flavours I came up with.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I am up for it!\" Zack said happily as he scratched his belly. Cody sighed and followed his brother to the table. <br>\r\nZavk sat down, his belly hanging over his jeans. He quickly dug and and finished his second bowl while Cody was still halgway through his first.<br>\r\n\"All of this after breakfast?

Heaving in his belly and forcing the button shut and the zipper up, he turned to Cody, allowing his belly to spill forward; having packed on some weight himself, Cody's uniform wasn't skin tight like Zack's, but now fitted him better than it had. <br>\r\nAlright, Class!\" said Coach as they all arrived on the pitch, \"This, as you all know, is the try-outs for the team. Some of you, I can see, have been enjoying yourselves this summer,\" his eyes lingered on Zack's gut; Cody snorted and nudged his brother's stomach with his elbow. As he did so, Coach caught sight of the zipper of Cody's trousers as It slid downwards as his gut moved. \"And this will help me to work out who will be on the team next year and who will not. Alright, Class. First, will be three laps of the pitch to warm up, then a practice match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack and Cody got into position at the back of the group and all of them set of running as Coach blew the whistle. Cody set off in a slow jog, while Zack raced ahead, his larger belly bouncing and wobbling. Cody couldn't help but smirk as he watched Zack slow down, puffing heavily as he reached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, Zack? Tired?\"<br>\r\n\"A little,\" he puffed, \"Not sure why. I've put on a little weight, but so have you.\"<br>\r\n\"Ah, well,\" sighed Cody, \"I could use a running partner.\"<br>\r\n\"Pleasure,\" puffed Zack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Class!\" interrupted Coach, \"All over here!\"<br>\r\nThe class walked over - or waddled over in Zack's case - and began the game. Zack, heavier, fatter and more unfit than ever, missed all of his shots and was unable to jump as high as he had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it had finished, Coach wrote down the results on the board and called the class back over again.<br>\r\n\"Right, Wilkins, Edwins, Portcullis, Andrews, Brians, Williams and Johnson have made the team. The rest of you were not good enough this time, I'm afraid. Now, go and get changed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, feeling horribly ashamed of himself for not getting onto the team, trudged back to the changing rooms; Cody, feeling not to bothered as he'd only come today to see Zack huff and puff, followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class left, leaving Zack and Cody alone in the changing rooms. Zack and Cody peeled off their uniforms, revealing their plumper frames. Cody's formerly underweight frame was now sporting a larger pot belly that curved forward in a large arc, giving him the appearance of having swallowed a Basketball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack, on the other hand, had already been overweight before he'd gotten the job at Tony's and had swollen into a round, portly frame that meant that he could not see his feet and wore XL clothes, which were beginning to strain around his ever-expanding gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled on his jeans, heaved in his belly and fastened them; he breathed out, his belly jiggling forward and straining the jeans to bursting point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" said Zack to Cody, \"Let's go to Tony's and eat our sorrows away at not making the team.\"<br>\r\n\"You sure you should be eating? You've gained a bit of weight since starting at Tony's.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll lose it for the new semester - we've still got 10 weeks left before we have to be back at school. Besides, you've put on some weight too.\"<br>\r\n\"I'll lose it for the new semester,\" echoed Cody; his belly growled hungrily, \"Come on,\" he said, wiping his head to wipe off the sweat, \"Let's go to Tony's.\"</span></div></div>",

The problem is it tasted so good, he couldn't stop eating without watching his weight at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince then, his weight had been changed as well.  He was in a healthy weight at about 135lbs before he took a job.  Now, he looks like he gained about 8lbs in weight, but don't think he notices it, despite his clothes are a bit tight on the waistline.  Recently, he finished off a bowl of chocolate ice-cream, where he looked pretty much full for today and deservedly so by letting out a burp and laid back on the chair to calm his stomach down for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you've been eating well, young man!\"  Tony says just as he came over to check on Cody with loads of bowls being pilled on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and I cannot believe it's been a week since I started work here.\"  Cody replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is!\"  Tony remembered well before he continued on saying, \"And with that, I got some surprise treats for you, tomorrow if you can manage to come?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A surprise eh?  That sounds tasty to me!  Sure, I'll see you tomorrow, Tony!\"  Cody accepts and the two waved off as the youngster walked of the ice-cream place, so he could try and get back home for some rest a bit.</span></div></div>",

One of them had spotted a poster, which it had said there's to be a sumo wrestling contest to take place at the Tipton Hotel, the twins' residence. They all looked in awe, and even down at the bottom, it said that the winner of that prize, would win a family trip to Hawaii for seven days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the point, all looked amazed and even curious to think about it. Despite of Zack's hunger and the chubby look than the rest, he was handpicked to be a kid to take up sumo, despite this competition only suited for obese persons. But with his friends reminded about a vacation in all, that put Zack into thinking of that, unlike the last time he and Cody found out, when both failed to win a game show for the same prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Zack decided to to enter the contest, but all he needs now, was to get as much fatter as he can, if he could match up with other sumo wrestler with massive girth in them.

He slowly gets off the bed and gets clothes to put on. His pants come up his legs and stop at his rounder butt. Cody then realizes that he had a larger less defined body. His butt was rounder, his gut was larger and his face was chubbier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody then tries to put his clothes but his shirt won't cover his stomach and his pants won't button so he grabs a pair of zacks clothes. The pants fit but the shirt clearly shows his belly.

When Cody walks in he sees he now has a double chin along with a bigger body. His waist is now 40 inches and he weighs 153 pounds. After he is done in the bathroom he goes to his room and squeezes on a pair of Zacks shorts and digs through Zack's closet for a shirt that will actually cover his stomach. He finds a shirt that barely fits around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cody woah man you have gotten big. Look who is the fat one now.\" Said Zack <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it I can't help it\" said Cody<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cody you do need to go on a diet. Maybe I can take you to the doctor soon to find out what is going on but for now try to lose weight\" said Carrie <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody finishes up his breakfast and heads off to the bus. When he gets on he sits next to his girlfriend who is very surprised to see him and his new body. \"Hi Barbara how was your weekend\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good. You look... different\" said Barbara<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok you can say it. I know I am fat. I don't know how but I just woke up fat one day\" said Cody. They were silent for the rest of the ride to school. When Cody got to school people kept asking questions and he said the same thing that he said to Barbara. Finally Cody got home and his Mom had bought him some new clothes for his new size. His mom scheduled a doctors appointment next week.</span></div></div>",

He had been getting fatter slowly non-stop, and there was no telling when would it stop and how.  He tried on many things, like taking some exercises, and taking diet food as such.  But none of it actually worked, and Cody had just gotten bigger ever since.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was actually gonna try and restore things back to normal by using some chemicals he used before.  But saying as to some surprise weight gain it caused, Cody decided that wasn't an ideal to risk and had to spend a week waiting on the advice from the Doctor to help out.  He told his mother, Carey earlier from what happened, although Zack wouldn't help the caused, considered his brother to join some sumo wrestling class, which Cody felt annoyed by some jokes in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo a week after the first day of incidents, Carey had took Cody to the Doctor's with his clothes now looking very tight, causing his belly fully shown, and a little bit of butt crack was shown from behind.  Although he could've buy some more, what would be too much money for all to be spend, so Cody may had to stick as it is, and get it seen to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was called to the room, he stood up and waddled over to the himself, whilst Carey would wait at the waiting room for him.  He had to squeeze himself through a narrow door which made it at least, before he sat on a regular-sized chair, which caused his butt to overgrown the chair all over as a result.  The Doctor sits behind the desk and greeted Cody as much as she was amazed to see him looking obese for his age too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I never knew I could see someone looking so big, since we've only met a week before.  So can you tell me what is the problem you had?\"  The Doctor asked, which in truth, she remembers its only been a week since he was last seen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was trying to more athlete than my twin brother Zack, since he's been this chubby quite a while.  So last week, I used the chemicals, just to try things out.  Although it worked out fine, but some hours later, I was getting a little bit fatter, then the more hours or days, I've been getting even bigger, and that's what happened to me ever since.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... so maybe side effects from your chemical is the problem that caused you to experience some weight gain.  So have you tried any workout or that?\"  The Doctor wondered and wrote some notes down to listen to Cody's problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've tried, but nothing have worked, and I'm still getting bigger non-stop.\"  Cody replied as much as it was all he had tried to let his weight gain come to stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see!  Well before I will sort out this problem, would you mind take off some clothes, so that we could weigh and measure you just how obese you are at this moment.\"  The doctor wondered, just so that its needed to be recorded at this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Cody obliged, and stood up to take off his clothes, but kept his underwear on just for his sakes.  He would be asked to step onto the scales for starters, so Cody stepped onto it, whilst the Doctor looked over and was astonished to see the figure on how much Cody weighs at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, for your age and with this side effect problem Cody, you now weigh at... </span></div></div>",
