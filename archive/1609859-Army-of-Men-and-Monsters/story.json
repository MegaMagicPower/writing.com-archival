Some are killed by the enemy, but others are eaten, by their fellow soldiers. The military is no place for a human to serve. However, today, something is about to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrivate Jenkins, a human, was on the run, eluding his pursuer, a werewolf. In one hand is a Colt revolver, a forty-five caliber handgun, with five shots left. He had stolen it from his pursuer when he had broken his nose. He was leading him though a set of heavy woods, infested with landmines, all of which were marked. However, he was heading to one that the man, his superior officer, didn't know about. When he got to it, he smiled and grabbed the white flag marking it. He then turned around and fired four shots, forcing the officer to duck behind a tree, and not notice where he had removed the flag from. He then ran behind a tree, took out an empty shell, rotated the cilender, stuck his head out from behind the tree, aimed the pistol at the tree that the officer was hiding at, and pulled the trigger, causing an audible hollow click to be heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you ran out of bullets, lunch,\" the werewolf said, as he came from behind the tree and started walking towards Jenkins, when he heard another, louder click, the sound of a landmine that is triggered, and will explode if one were to move from it. He looked at Jenkins, who was waving the white flag around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found that one just yesterday, Colonal Redclaws,\" the man said, as he walked up to the officer. He then opened the revolver, and pulled out the remaining good round. \"I told you sir, never underestimate the resoursefullness of anyone,\" he said, as he sat down at the base of a tree, and, after putting the bullet back in the revolver, pulled out a cantine of water, and some dried bread and beef from a pack on his back. \"I hope that you don't mind me eating, my lunch, sir. After all, you make a move and that trigger will pop up, and cause that mine to explode.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, help me, private, I'll do anything that you ask,\" Colonal Redclaws said, as he carefully exaimined the mine that his foot was on. It was one that was designed to damage the hide of a dragon, which meant that it could obliterate his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer this question, Colonal,\" Jenkins said, as he cut a piece of beef off from the rest, and started chewing on it. \"Why do so many soldiers die?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They die from infections, from wounds, and um, um, uh I don't know, what other ways do they die?\" the colonal asked, nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because monsters eat them, especially those who wear the same uniform as them.\" Jenkins said, as he took a drink of water. \"However, the men in our unit don't. Do you know why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't Jenkins,\" Redclaws said, wondering where the conversation was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because sir, they care for each other, and see each other as family. It started the moment that I started helping them after they had been injured, after that ambush six months ago. I told them to go after the enemy, and make them suffer for what they had done to them, and to pick up a few meals while they were at it. While they did that, I told every one else to give them covering fire. Also, I told the unit that it would be better for them to go after the enemy to get something to eat as opposed to each other. Ever since then, the unit has been working more effectively, and has made more progress, as opossed to any other unit, or so our previous colonal said, right before a sniper shot him last week. You, you are just a relpacement. You don't understand any of the men. You don't know the friends that they've lost, their fears, their dreams, or anything. I, on the other hand, do. That is why the men come to me for their problems, and not you, even the giants come to me first. You, you told them to send one of their friends to their death when you asked them to get a human for you to eat. As a result, they came to me about it, and I told them to take me to you, and here we are, with you on the threshhold of death, all because of your ignorance of the men,\" Jenkins said, with anger in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then stood up and asked, \"What were your dreams after the war sir?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be with my wife, raise my children, and maybe have some more,\" Redclaws said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, that's funny,\" Jenkins said, with a chuckle. \"I also have a wife, one who is pregnant with my son. He'll be born in a month. In fact, he'll be my first, and maybe the only child I'll ever have. In fact, he may never get a chance to see my face, never go fishing with me, or anything like any other boy does with their father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he pointed the gun at Redclaws's head and smiled. \"Now, I have a few options,\" he said. \"I can just walk out of here, and wait until you get tired, and collapse, causing the mine to explode. I could get behind a tree, aim this revolver at your head, and put you out of your missery. However, none of those would be right, after all, I see that, at heart, you are a good man, and you do love your family, and you do want to get back home to them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, I do,\" Redclaws said, as a tear ran down his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I do have a third option,\" Jenkins said, as he lowered the pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that be?\" Redclaws asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins pulled out a set of photographs, which were taped to each other, and looked at them. On one side there was a picture of him and a woman in their wedding clothes, that was about a year old. On the other side was a picture of the men from the whole unit, all of them, although the three giants in the unit more or less had to sit cross legged to fit, with everyone else standing in front of them, all of them looking at the photographer, with friendly smiles, and was only a few weeks old. The only person not in the photograph was him, as he had taken the picture, and made copies for every one, including the late colonal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the officer, who was worried, and pissing his pants, and said, \"Well, as long as there is some sort of weight on that mine, at least fifty pounds, it won't go off. However, even between the two of us, we do not have that sort of weight, and I doubt that I could get enough wood to keep the trigger down before you collapsed. That means that someone has to step on your foot, untie your bootlaces, and, after you remove your foot from the boot, quickly press down to keep the trigger down, and wait until you clear the woods, before setting it off and killing themselves in the process.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But who would want to do that?\" Redclaws asked, until he heard Jenkins chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see any one else here?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you saying Jenkins? You couldn't possible be thinking of giving your life for me,\" Redclaws said. \"After all, I just tried to kill and eat you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\"Jenkins said. \"But, despite the fact that they like me, the officers of the unit will still have me executed for assulting you, especially if I left you here, or if I killed you. Now, would you do me a favor and tell my wife that I love her, and our son, especially since I doubt that he'll ever see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Jenkins stepped on Redclaws's boot, untied his laces, and pulled his furry foot out of it, and carefully set it on the ground. \"Now run sir,\" he said, as he pressed down on the trigger, and looked up at the eight foot tall werewolf, with a smile on his face, handed him his revolver, and saluted him. \"And don't let my death be in vain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the officer started running out of the woods. Jenkins then looked down at the photographs in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll watch out for you,\" he said, as he stood up. \"My family, my brothers, my sisters, all of you. I'll watch over all of you, especially you guys.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he looked at the initials on the mine, WHJ, which stood for William Henry Jenkins. \"Time to go,\" he said, moving his officer's boot, causing the mine to blow up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the sound of the explosion reached his ears, Redclaws fell to the ground, in shock at what had just happened. As he stood back up, the officer turned to look at the woods that he had just ran out of, still in shock. As the rest of the unit came over to him, asking where Jenkins was, all he could say was, \"He saved my life. He saved my life. He took my spot and saved my life. He saved my life. He gave his life for me. I was going to eat him but he saved me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colonal, What happened?\" a sergeant asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I s-s-step-p-p-ped on-n-n a-a-a l-l-land-d-dm-m-m-mine,\" Redclaws started to stammer. \"B-b-but h-h-h-he s-s-s-stepped o-o-on m-m-my b-b-b-boot a-a-and t-t-t-told-d-d m-m-me t-t-to r-r-run. I-i-i o-o-owe h-h-him m-m-my l-l-life.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at a human soldier, and quickly turned away, saying, \"I-i-i'll-l-l-l n-n-nev-v-ver b-b-be a-a-able t-t-to l-l-look a-a-at a-another h-h-human t-t-the s-s-same w-w-way a-a-again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, he fell to his knees, tears running down his face. \"Why did you do that, Jenkins?\" he asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few weeks, the story spread faster than a wildfire in a dry forest. It was spoken around the barracks, the taverns, and every other place that the military units met up to swap talk. The story was too improbable to be true, that a human would willingly give his life for a man who had been planning to eat him moments earlier. However, when they went to the forest, they saw that it was nothing more than a crater. The human soldier had become a ghost, and possesed an enemy soldier carrying tons of explosives, and blew the entire place up, destroying every landmine in the forest. Some even saw his ghost, which had a strange smile that seemed to say, \"You guys are my family, and families look out for each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne month later, late at night, Colonal Redclaws was walking down the street of the city where Jenkin's pregnant wife was supossed to live. He couldn't stop thinking of him. Every night, a dream of that day came to his mind. He was stuck in a forest, all alone, standing on the landmine. However, just before he fell, Jenkins would show up, step on the mine and say, with that smile of his, \"I'll take your place sir. Now live the life that I gave you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he saw someone rush past him, carrying a bundle, that had a familliar scent. It was a rakashasa, a cat-like creature, one with a tiger pattern on his fur. However, the scent was coming from the bundle, and it had an eieily familiar smell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Jenkins's son,\" he thought, as a woman, a human said, in a screaming shout, \"Someone help me! That man stole my baby!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the woman, who was the same one that he had seen on the photograph that Jenkins had pulled from his pocket before he had stepped on the landmine and told him to run. He then turned around, pulling out his pistol, and shot the man in the leg, causing him to release the baby. However, before the baby hit the ground, Redclaws, who had started to run as he saw the bundle start to drop, caught it. He then removed the cloth that covered the baby's face and was amazed at what he saw. Other than the fact that he had just been born, he looked exactly just like the man who had saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get your own,\" said a voice that was coming from the man that he had shot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRedclaws looked at him and growled. \"The next time you, or anyone else, touches this child, or any of his offspring, or theirs, someone will come for you, and send your soul to Hell,\" he said, as he holstered his pistol, the same one that Jenkins had stolen, and returned. \"This boy's father died a hero, saving my life. However, that was not all he did, he made me see the truth.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what pathetic truth is that? That you were weak?\" The man asked, as he grabbed a sign post, and tried to use it to help him stand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Redclaws just chuckled and said, \"You wouldn't believe me if I told you.\" He then walked up to the woman, and handed her her child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's his name?\" he asked, with a friendly smile as he looked at the child's face, once again noticing the resembleance to his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking of naming him after my uncle, but, I don't really know sir,\" the woman said, wondering why this werewolf would bother to save her son's life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name him after his father,\" Redclaws said. \"The man broke my nose, and saved my life afterwards.\" At this, he started to walk away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" the woman said. \"You knew my husband?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah,\" Redclaws said, as he looked back. \"He told me to tell you that he loves you, and your son. And I'll tell you this, no matter what anyone tells you about him, he gave his life for more that just me. He gave it for his friends, and his family.\" With that, he vanished into the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*********************************************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral decades later, a group of recruits are at the barracks, listening to the story of the military's history, and the reason as to why it was the most powerful military in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth that  Private Jenkins showed Colonal Redclaws is this, it is only by working together in harmony that the military can reach its full potential,\" said an old man, who was the grandson of a human soldier that had served with the man. \"That is why the military created the Code, the Code by which all personel in the military swear to live by. Each soldier, no matter the branch that they serve in, or their rank, is expected to follow it. One part of the Code is this: 'No soldier shall take the life of another soldier just to eat him.' Another states this: 'No soldier shall rape another.' Also, you will swear to never take the life of those under the age of recruitment. Also, you shall give anyone that is served to you as a meal the option to serve in the military. You will be advised to respect your comrades, no matter their race, and you will listen to your superiors, no matter their race. These men and women standing beside you, from this day forth, are to be concidered your brothers, sisters, your family members. Those who do not help out their family will be punished accordingly. In return for service in this country's military, your family members will be placed under our protection, and will recieve our aid for whatever reason. Should they get into debt, we will help them out of it. Should your younger siblings wish to go to a collage, but your parents can't afford the tuition, we will pay for it. If your spouse, fiance, or lover is kidnapped, we will find them, and if they are a slave, a piece of living jewlry or furniture, or something else, we will buy them for you. if they are dead, we will charge the person with treason, and if found guilty, they will be executed, by you and your squad mates. Also, no civilian athourity can touch you, as you will be concidered military property, as well as your family. Should you be killed, our medics that can use magic are taught a top secret spell that will bring you back to life over ninty-nine percent of the time. Now, if any of you can you magic, you will report to Doc, as he has some things to say to you. Well, I best be off now, because I am late for my evening walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the old man turned around, and started walking and passed a statue of a human, one that said, \"In memory of Private William Henry Jenkins, the man who united us. Commisioned by Colonal Richards Redclaws.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what recruit (or officer) are you?</span></div></div>",

Werecreatures can turn into a human form, anthrocreatures can't. However, I will allow hybrids to exist, however they don't have a human form, so if daddy was a werewolf and mommy was an anthro wolf, unless the two had totally different fur colors, the person won't change much in either form, unlike if is mother was a fox anthro, then they can change from wolf to fox. Okay, oh, and make sure to copy and paste race options between male and female genders, and perhaps do the same with thos who are hermapherdites, thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note about New Recruits, they must have been through a dream spell, in which all of the officers they saw were of the race that they hate/fear the most, and the only way they get out of it is if the \"Drill Sargeant\" \"Killed\" them. Also, They MUST have a guiding officer of that race that they hate/fear. This officer, who must be the equivilent of a corpral, (Check Wikapedia's entry about Military Ranks to get an idea if you are unfamiliar about military ranks), is something like a role-modle/personal instructor. Basically, when the recruit isn't doing drills with the other recruits, he/she is taking lessons from the guiding officer.*</span></div></div>",

Left is Connery, who looks like a cyclops, with a set of tusks growing from his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for name: Their mother liked the actor of that name, so when they were born, they were each named after a part of his name. *Note* don't make fun of it. They love their mother, and joined up, in a sense, because of their love for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasons for joining: Several years back, they were attacked by a group of ruffians, who not only left them for dead, but they stole a diamond necklace that they'd gotten for their mother's birthday. However, Bloodtooth came along and saved their lives, and recovered the necklace. When the pair recovered from their injuries, they signed up in gratitude, and graduated the top of their class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently helps in training the new recruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChef Tiny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: adout thirty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nheight: 200 feet<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescription: looks human, but has three eyes, one above the others. (Father was human looking, Mother was a cyclops)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for name: He was short as a child, about fifty or so feet. Of course, when he hit puberty, he grew. However, the real reason that he prefers to be called Tiny was because every one else called him a three-eyed freak. However, when he was eight, he saw his first human, as his parents were vegetarians. The human, a young girl, was being treated like an insect by the other kids in the neighborhood, some of which were older than him, when Tiny told them to leave, or he'd use his third eye to shrink them down to the size of insects. When they ran away, Tiny picked up the tiny creature and took it home to show his mother and father. (He was a kid after all.) When they told him that he should take her home, as her parents would miss their child, Tiny did so the next day, because it was late and his parents didn't want him to step on something by accident. That night, before the two went to sleep, Tiny made a promise to the girl, that if she was ever in trouble, and if he was nearby, to call out for  Tiny, and he'd help her. Ten years later, he fulfilled his promise to the girl, as the school's star athlete had captured her to be his meal. When the girl, who was now a seventeen year old young woman saw a three eyed giant, she remembered him and shouted \"TINY HELP ME!\" At this, Tiny, who had been eating things like cows, oxen, and such, as his parents had raised him with the idea that sentient beings were not to be eaten unless there was no other choice, and had encouraged him to try to steal any who were brought in by others as meals, rushed over and broke the athlete's jaw, and saved the young woman. Of course, the young man was upset that he'd stolen his meal and tried to attack him. However, for once, having three eyes proved to be an asset, be cause the middle eye saw him coming, and Tiny delivered an uppercut to him chin, breaking his neck and paralyzing the man from the neck down. Thankfully, Tiny didn't get into trouble. In fact, the couches of the various teams tried to get him to sign up, but he had found what he really wanted to do, and that was to cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasons for joining: Technically, he only works for the military, as a chef at Fort Williams. However, when he graduated from culinary arts school, he opened up a vegetarian restaurant near the giant section of town, but he didn't get much business, and was about to go under when Bloodtooth, who happened to be in that section of town, stopped in for a bite to eat, and ordered a vegetarian meal. During the meal, she said that the sandwich that he had made for her was the best she'd ever eaten in a restaurant, especially in one that didn't serve people as part of its meals. After some more talking between them, Bloodtooth mentioned that the then current chef at the fort was planning to retire soon and was looking for a successor. The next day, Tiny packed up, closed the place down, and he and his helpers, who'd been given to him to use as ingredients in his cooking but he'd hired instead, went to Fort Williams, asked if he could work for them as a cook, and after a trial period, the chef was pleased to have found the right person to take over for him and retired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently cooks for the recruits, cooking up meals that puts most professionals to shame, and using a buffet style of cooking, with an area filled with more than enough food for all of the people on the base to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you don't want these two oddballs, make another, just leave an open spot for others to use.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, you've been a vampire for a few years and you were part of the military before then. Let's get started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSergeant Wolfblood (Formally named Johnson, but changed his name after a certain incident) Used to be called Deadeye by squad mates due to his marksmanship capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge: mid twenties<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeapon of choice: long range rifle, sniper rifle preferable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow he was turned: He and his squad mates were ambushed, and many were cut down immediately. Johnson told the rest to take the wounded and go while he provided covering fire. After he held them off for several hours, he ran out of ammunition for his weapons, so he charged them, planning to take as many with him as he could. When he was finally killed, the surviving enemy fighters tore his body to pieces and scattered them over the area. After reinforcements arrived, it took them several hours to find every part, and take them to the medical unit, who were busy with Johnson's squad mates. By the time the one medic had put him back together, he was tired, and existed, and forgot an important rule, don't revive a dead human when you are low on energy, ask someone else to do it. As a result of his error, something went wrong and when Johnson woke up, he was hungry for blood and latched onto the medic's neck, and would of drank him dry, if another hadn't immobilized him. However, even if Johnson was killed again, he was stuck as a vampire, for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a result, he had to be trained to use his new abilities, and control his urge to drink the blood of others, as well as how much he drank from those who willingly let him feed on them. It took him a while to accept what he was, and that he now had to drink blood, although drinking the blood of someone, directly from the person, seemed to be the hardest for him to do, as he didn't want to drain someone of their blood and kill them, as he knew what it was like to die. However, the person who volunteered to help him with his thirst stood by him, and let him take his time, before he would drink her blood. As a result, he fared better than most newly turned vampires, who would of drank her dry, after they hadn't had blood for a day, and would of bitten her neck. Johnson though, was reluctant to do that, especially since the woman resembled his youngest daughter somewhat, so he bit her wrist, and only drank a few cups of blood before he removed his fangs from her. After that, he was back to active duty, serving as a vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReason for name change: Johnson had been spying on some enemy soldiers, in a desert in the Middle East, when he was captured by one of them. He was tortured for several days, before Bloodtooth showed up and saved his life. However, when they got out, after Bloodtooth blew the place up, they didn't have any supplies to get back to base, until Bloodtooth, who was bleeding internally, and would of died anyways, ordered him to drink her dry, as he had vital information that Command needed to know. However, he refused to do it, until Bloodtooth made a small cut on her neck, which started to bleed, ever so slightly, but it was more than enough to trigger his instinct to feed. When Johnson was done, he looked at the dried up husk of the body of the woman who had saved his life, picked it up, and headed towards the base, where he was brought in by a patrol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Bloodtooth was brought back to life, and on her way to recovery, the other soldiers started to call him Wolfblood, as he had drank the blood of the best werewolf soldier that served in the military. After a few months, he had his name legally changed to Wolfblood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you don't want Wolfblood, make another human-turned vampire, whose been in the military for several years as both a human then as a vampire.</span></div></div>",

What are you doing?\" a kitsune Corporal says to a human sergeant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm giving you boys covering fire, so that you can get the wounded and get the hell out of here!\" the NCO Sergeant Johnson says, as he looks at the enemy combatants through a scope on his rifle, and fires one bullet after another, trying to keep them from reaching his wounded friends and comrades, from on top of a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be killed you know when they get here,\" the kitsune said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better that than see them get to the rest of you,\" the sargeant said. \"Now get moving! That's an ORDER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir,\" the kitsune said, saluting him. \"I'll come back with reinforcements.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IF you don't get moving you won't be able to!\" Johnson said, as he fired his rifle again, taking out one of the sand goloms that seemed to be common in this group of insurgents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the kitsune left him on the hill, got the others, and took off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver five hours later, a unit from the closest base came upon the scene. The area was covered with the dead and dying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!\" said a young private, who was a giant. \"One human officer did all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just graduate from basic before you were sent over?\" the kitsune officer who had been told to leave the area earlier asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the private said. \"I mean, I knew that human officers are supposed to be powerful, as I saw the one kill one of the other giant recruits, before the guy's body was carried to the medical facility to help train the new medics, but this, this guy can't be human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's a chance that he won't be, when the medics revive him,\" said a sergeant, who appeared to be human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the kitsune officer asked. \"Is he dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not just dead,\" the man said, as he looked behind him, to face his fellow officer, showing off the fact that half of his face was decaying, with an empty eye socket, as he was a zombie. \"I think his body was torn to pieces. I just found his head half buried in the sand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, as the kitsune officer came over, he saw his friend's head, and it had been torn from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not Deadeye,\" he said, as he started to cry. \"I graduated from training with him. He's like a brother to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They always are,\" the zombie said, as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter serving in the military for over twenty years, ten as a human, and ten as a zombie, the sight of a grieving soldier was nothing new to the man. In fact, he had been killed in combat, and he became one of the approximately  fifteen percent of humans that ended up turning into a zombie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can he be brought back?\" the kitsune officer asked, as he looked at the zombie, as he cradled his friend's head in his arms, as if it was something precious. \"I mean, can the medics revive him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" the sergeant said. \"If we can find his remains, all of them, he can be brought back to life. But, if his head is any indication of the rest of his body's condition, chances are that he won't be human when he is revived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't being one of the undead be better than being dead?\" the kitsune asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on who you talk to,\" the zombie said, with a sigh. \"Well, we best get looking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother five hours later, Johnson's remains were on a table at the medical tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you bring him back Doc?\" the kitsune asked a man with a red cross on his shoulder patch, who was a mage-medic, one who used magic to heal wounds, and revive the dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the man said. \"However, I'll have to do it tomorrow. I spent a good deal of energy while I was reviving and healing the others of your unit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand sir,\" the kitsune said. \"Is it alright if I sleep in a chair next to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just as the medic was just about to respond, a younger, and new, medic, who was fresh from training, said, \"I'll do it. I'll show you that I'm ready to revive a dead man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he put his hands on the body and started to say the top secret spell that was capable of bringing the dead back to life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're not ready to do that!\" the older mage said, as he tried to get his colleague's hands off of the body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was too late, and the damage to Johnson's body was repaired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you,\" the young man said, as he was tried to catch his breath. \"I was ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, when Johnson's eyes opened, they were bright red, an indication that he was a vampire, but not just any vampire, a hungry vampire. He saw the young man's throat, pumping with red blood, and grabbed him. He then bit the man's neck, and started to drink him dry, when the kitsune officer, grabbed his arms, and asked, \"What's wrong with him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was what I was afraid of,\" the older medic said, as he looked at the younger one, who had a hand on his neck, trying to stem the flow of blood coming from his wound. \"Your foolishness has turned this man into a vampire. Next time, you had better damn well listen to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the newly turned vampire, and put a single hand on him, and said a spell that put one to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going to happen to him Doc?\" the kitsune asked, as his friend's red eyes closed, and started snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will have to go through retraining,\" the man said, as he put a bandage around his colleague's neck, telling him that he was lucky that the kitsune was there to save his worthless ass. \"After that, things will be different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End of flashback/dream*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, in the present, after Johnson has been through retraining, and had his name changed to Wolfblood after he drank Bloodtooth dry after she had told him to, What is this to Wolfblood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption One: It was a nightmare. He wakes up in the middle of the night, goes to the target range, get's his rifle, and starts to shot at the targets out on the range, as he is currently at Fort Williams, contemplating on how his life has changed since that day, such as how his wife has difficulty sharing the same bed as him, because he is as cold as a corpse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption Two: It was a flashback. He is in a room, with other turned undead officers, who are talking about what happened to them when they became undead, and how life has changed.</span></div></div>",

Also, I have to resist the urge of biting his gorgeous neck and draining him.

She was a human, that was all you despised her for, and although that even here, you were suppose to consider all species equal, you knew that it was a race like the humans that was holding everyone else back.  However, she had absolutely no fear, or well, at least not of you.  And that even though you could kill her quicker than she could draw a breath, you respected that she didn't fear you.  Thinking that, it was this strong will that was unique to humans, and that they may amount to something more than food.... one day....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peter, Peter, Peter.... Now what are we going to do with you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sergeant Miranda..\" Was all you could sputter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, have you got anything to say for yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her hands on her hips, closer to her sidearm.  Even though she rarely talked to you like this, you hated every second of it.  Of her treating you like some child.  She knew it upset you, though why she continued to do so puzzled you.  The strongest possibility was that you always thought that she wanted you to make a move, just to have a reason to kill you.  Maybe.... It didn't matter now, all that mattered now was-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Peter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe interrupted your thought.  You growled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that you tried to kill an entire platoon? Or sorry that they were able to stop you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked down at you bloodied hands, blood from both yourself and some others.  Not looking at the officer you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took about 12 of 'em\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh Peter\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard a slight click.  As you looked up at your guidance officer she looked down at you, with her pistol aimed at you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could save some people like this.  You have been here 3 weeks and have tried to kill over 40 people.  One of these days you might succeed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the simple fact she even added the word \"might\" made you chuckle.  She continued<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't like Kitsunes, Giants, Humans, Vampires, Naga's, or even other wolves.  It would be safer to just kill you now and not let you \"attempt\" anything ever again.  A lot of people are afraid of you.  But not me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowered the pistol after a long awkward silence moment, but still not holstering her gun.  She was smart, you had to give her that.  You returned to your view of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell, I've never seen anyone or anything as violent as you.  Not even Bloodtooth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am special\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her one more time, and see that she offered you a hand to help you get up, other hand still tightly gripped on her pistol.  Feeling slightly insulted by this, you reject her hand, standing up on your own.  Growling slightly as the pain from the fight with the humans slowly emerged again.  But you were used to pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou easily stood a foot over you Human guidance officer, but still not intimidated, she talked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hows about a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly nodded your head<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't kill anyone, I won't put you up against a firing squad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer blatant and stale attempt at humor still made you laugh to yourself.  You brought your snout so that your face was an inch away from hers.  Your eyes met, and neither of you wavered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal\" you said   </span></div></div>",

The human was a great-granddaughter of The Uniter, Jenkins the first, and the werewolf was Bloodtooth. Bloodtooth tricked the man into joining, when she revealed to him some top-secret informantion, and told him to either join or take a sniper bullet to the head. (It was a lousy date anyways. Really bad war movie about the commander of the base.) When she took him to the base, she had the man placed under a dream spell where he was beaten to death by every human woman he'd ever raped or eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Bloodtooth found out something when she smelled his fur, he was of The Uniter's bloodline. After a blood taste test, which can only be preformed by a vampire tasting the blood of the two individuals in question, in this case Wolfblood administered the test, and the other person was Jenkins, who had punched the man a few times when he came into the room before Bloodtooth told him her suspicions, it was proven that they were indeed related to William Henrry Jenkins the Second, as the man had several lovers at some point, including a kitsune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, despite the fact that Jenkins is treated as sort of a celebrity, Orangetail has to deal with the fact that he is part human, and the fact that he'd almost eaten his flesh and blood, and the lecture that his great-grandfather, who had possessed Jenkins to speak to him, had given him. Also, he has to deal with the nightmares that had been given to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you don't want him, make another fox, just leave options.</span></div></div>",

Living a archaic  lifestyle, news media has misinterpreted their society to be that of barbaric animals but their technology and culture is on par with modern society. New recruits are the only ones foolish enough to believe the news as the lizardmen are trained as warriors from birth, making them dangerous fighters. Horror stories of their war-cries still instill fear in some veteran soldiers that fought against them in earlier campaigns.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLizardmen are divided by environment with lizardmen of different tribes looking nothing alike due to different evolutionary lines. The two main tribes willing to try for coexistence is the Swamp dwelling tribe along the east coast and the desert wondering tribe of the great deserts in the middle-east. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwampland Native - Resembling crocodiles, lizardmen of the swampland are an amphibious ambush predators that can remain underwater for hours without a breath. Incredible strong limbs and a propelling tail allows them to navigate the swamp quickly while a possessing a strong healing factor. A unique trait is that fauna and microorganisms share a symbiotic relationship with the lizardmen by providing camouflage and resistance in exchange nutrients from the host.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesert Native - Their appearance can range wildly, from small gecko-like creature to raging dragonic-warriors. Similar to the Swampland cousins, desert lizardmen are ambush predators capable turning invisible to swiftly strike down prey. Strong and hardy, they keep an iron grip on their resources and guard oasis's to the death. They are able to use magic as their shamans draw water from beneath the sand and are attuned to the elements of the desert. </span></div></div>",

Also, you can use any combination, for instance, what if that harmless looking rabbit anthro was really half werewolf, or was a wererabbit that was half wolf-anthro.

For instance, they cannot exorcise the spirit of a fallen soldier, especially if they are waiting for thier body to be found and healed, or, if their body was obliterated, still follows the rules and rugulations, unless the person is a traitor.<br>\r\nAlso, they are forbidden to do anything that could affect the other soldiers.

Some of the planets best biology professors have theorised that they came from a meteor from the sun some two or three thousand years ago, others have said that they come from the center of the planet, and still some deny their very Existence. However in the past two years a war broke out between them and others of their kind. At one point the war became a stalemate and the only way to end it was for all sides to join the country that held ideals like their own. Very little is known about them and their origins as well as why the war broke out in the first place. Also none outside of their kind have ever been allowed to see what kind of training that they have gone through.<br>\r\nMales- Pure fire with multiple dark spots, each with their own unique patterns. Height wise they grow from 2 feet to 15 feet over the coarse of their lifes. Prefer living in plases with dry heat and very small amounts of water. Ideal location for deployment would be the deserts. There have been rumors that they have been trained to withstand pain and no amount of torture could make them give up any information to the enemy. They can use magic but only fire magic, however they all prefer hand-to-hand combat whenever possible. The heat their bodies give off can reach up to 1500*F, because of this they can not hold guns but they also need special rounds to kill them. After some special training that was rumored to have been created by their very first king they can control the heat given off by their bodies (this means that they will not kill anyone close to them, however if someone touches them they will melt unless a very powerful mage has given them heat protection and even then it can still be fatal). Most killing methods will not work, however large amounts of water can and will kill them without fail, there is no known protection for this. Pryoknights are loyal and will NEVER under any conditions betry their friends, family, and the person or persons that they serve. All in all they are the ideal soldier.<br>\r\nSide note. The height and heat of a Pyroknight indicates how strong they are, so it is possible for them to grow higher then 15 feet and become hotter then 1500*F, however it is extremly unlikly.</span></div></div>",

Elementals all have two forms: a human form that only shows slight hints of being something else, and their more commonly known natural form where their entire bodies are made of the element they control. Elementals come in four known varieties: earth, fire, water, and air. To date, there is no known lifespan for an Elemental; a few rather legendary ones have been stated to be several thousand years old. As an Elemental ages, they become more powerful and more capable of harnessing and manipulating their powers. New Elementals are created when old Elementals die; this system seems to be made to ensure a balance between all four varieties. No one is really sure where Elementals originally came from, and the very first generation has been dead for a very long time. Recently, governments and large corporations have begun to study and experiment on consenting Elementals in an attempt to understand what they are and how they are able to manipulate the very elements that compose them.</span></div></div>",

When she had volunteer to be a monster's handler...ahem, partner, she hadn't expected to be summoned to her commanding officer's office then escorted underground by armed guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elavator vibrated beneath her feet as they descended deep into the earth. Her escorts remained stone-faced and silent the entire time, making her feel she was going to a execution than meet her partner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let a long held breath when the doors opened and she was ushered through a series of checkpoints. At each checkpoint, they confirmed her identity thrice before moving onto the next point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria was growing uneasy as her imagination took off on its own for what kind of monster would need so much security guarding it. A smaller voice was asking why she signed up for this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they passed the last checkpoint, her escorts saluted a bespectacled man in a lab-coat that was waitng for them in front of two enormous steel doors. Maria noticed he wasn't wearing a nametag or anything that identified who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you gentlemen for escorting lieutenant Lancelot. I can handle the rest from here.\" He waved off the guards as they left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria saluted, \"Second Lieutenant Maria Lancelot, reporting for duty sir.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist, she assumed, returned her salute with a chuckle. \"No need to be so formal lieutenant. We're just contracted by the military, so there's no need to salute any of us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.\" She replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your here to meet your new partner? Correct?\" He asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir....but...\" she trailed off at the with some confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They haven't told you anything about your partner yet have they?\" He confirmed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria nodded and the scientist heaved a sigh. \"Secrets..secrets...and more secrets. They just love keeping everybody in the dark don't they.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria kept quiet but agreed with the scientist in her head. He clapped to break the mood, \"Lets go meet your new partner then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe typed in a code on the scanner then the steel doors quietly swung open and Maria stared into an enormous hangar with a labyrinth of scientist, labs, and other equipment filling the enormous space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bespectated man lead her through the winding mess of the underground facility till they came to a tucked away lab, hidden off to one side. Inside the lab were three large, opaque capsules connected to the wall via numerous pipes and conduits. Each capsule was taller than two grown men and would've taken three to wrap around single one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist began typing on one of the monitors. \"Lieutenant Lancleot. Have you ever heard of a chimera?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head. Ever since the treaty, the military had made it mandatory for all members to have a basic understanding of monsters, whether habits or species indicators, everybody was required to at least carry a bestiary with them. She vaguely remembered a monster called a chimera in greek mythology, but it was actually one of the few monsters that never existed, just like unicorns or hodags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" He murmured. \"Then I suppose you don't know the medical term for chimera do you? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria shook her head again, getting annoyed as scientist continued to beat around the bush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A chimera is a creature or being that is made up of multiple parts. The best example is the chimera is from the greeks with the head of a lion, the legs of a goat, and the tail of a snake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria began to feel her earlier unease come back in full force as he continued to talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This creature never truly existed but the idea of it is fascinating to think about. A monster made from different creatures, yet retaining each piece's natural abilities strength and weaknesses.\" The scientist typing became faster as he spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three, opaque capsules began to hiss and jerk as the opaque covering started disappearing, revealing what's inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when the your government came to us to create a living chimera with all the funding we wanted. None of could have possible refused such an opportunity\". He giggled as the capsules contents finally became clear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria stepped back as the scientist said, \"Say hello to your new partner lieutenant Lancelot.\"   </span></div></div>",

Inside the tank was a small bright-red monster, no bigger than a puppy, suspended in a clear viscous liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's quite the specimen of science. Wouldn't you agree lieutenant?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria jumped. The scientist had crept up behind her without her noticing and was staring at the monster in the tank with unabashed glee at his creation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that thing sir?\" She asked. The monster looked like a skin-less dog with a ridge of bony spines protruding from its back and along its tail. On closer inspection, what Maria thought was muscle tissue and sinew was actually blood-red scales that imitated the appearance of exposed muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is the culmination of years of research and development into the creation of artificial beings,\" the scientist explained. He then twisted the monitor around for Maria to see but she couldn't make heads or tail of the graphic display. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I looking at sir?\" Maria asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are looking the genetic code of your new partner.\" He begin pointing at one of the displays but stopped when he saw Maria with a puzzled expression. \"Sorry,\" he laughed, \"we don't get many people outside of our field down here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe indicated a strip of violet on the display, \"This entire monitor indicates the different species that your partner was created from.\" As the scientist began to reveal the characteristics of the creature in the tank, Maria held up her hand to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this entire operation illegal according to The Treaty sir?\" She asked, feeling that all she's been doing since she was escorted down here has been asking questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment, mulling over it before answering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically...no.\" He opened another window on a different monitor showing a roster of monsters. \"Each of the monsters you see here were volunteers that agreed to donate their remains for research in exchange for benefits from the government to their families. So, by the rules of The Treaty, we haven't violated any terms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria scrolled through the roster, settling on the last two monsters displayed at the end of the list. One of them was a dragon and the other a hellhound. Monsters that would normally view the act of accepting charity from the government as contemptible and utterly humiliating. She could only guess at what her government had offered for such prideful monsters to volunteer their remains for this project.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to ask, the capsule let out a loud thump and the viscous liquid inside began to drain. The scientist had disappeared behind a wall of monitors with him shouting over the cacophony of noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lieutenant Lancelot. Would you please stand in front of the capsule. I'm starting the awakening process, so I need to stand direct in front of the capsule.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith reluctance, she stood in front of the draining capsule as the creature inside began to stir. As the fluid drained away, the young creature awoke from its slumber and started to thrash about inside. When it laid its eyes on Maria, the creature went completely still with its eyes locked onto hers. She noted that the monsters eyes were a colorless, shifting gray that she was unable to look away from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glass wall separating them slid open and the creature took its first wobbly steps out of the capsule. It ambled towards her on trembling legs and she knelt down as it approached. As the creature approached on ungainly legs, it tripped over its own feet and Maria thrust out out her arms to catch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment she touched the creature's scaly hide, she was assaulted by a severe headache. She clutched her head like something was burying its way into her mind but the pain had already starting subside and just a intense feeling of worry remained. After a few moments, the feeling remained just as strong as before and she realized with trepidation that the feeling wasn't coming from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the creature mewling worriedly in her arms, she noticed that the creature's eyes had changed. Instead of the colorless gray, its eyes were now a deep blue, a mirror image of her own. She began to stroke its soft scales unconsciously and a wave of bliss rolled through her mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist reappeared from behind the monitors, watching the interaction with gleeful satisfaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see that bond between you two was established without any complications.\" He clapped happily then began recording the results on one the other monitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened sir?\" Maria asked, as she continued to stroke the creature in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A meta-psychological bond lieutenant,\" he explained. \"We designed him to bond with the first person that he sees, similar to how a baby duck will imprint the first thing it sees as its parent. But unlike a duck, your bond with him goes beyond that with both of you becoming psychically linked. Among the applicants, your test results showed that you were compatible for bonding. That the main reason you were chosen amongst the application pool.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I suppose to do now?\" Again, she heard that little voice in the back of her head telling <i>I told you so</i>. The creature in her arms squirmed as it felt her discomfort and tried to comfort her. Maria couldn't help but giggle at its attempts and soothed the creature by stroking its underbelly. It mewled contently and settled back down in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist approached with a small communicator in his hands. The creature twisted in her arms, growling menacingly at the scientist. The scientist just chuckled at his behavior and handed the communicator to her, \"For now, your orders are observe and report his growth. He's a new species of monster that we have very little data on. All you have to do is raise him and send us daily reports via this device. All housing and accommodations will be provided by the military should your current residence be inadequate to his needs.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thank you sir.\" she said, standing up with the creature in her arms. The scientist led her back through the labyrinth of equipment and rooms till they arrived back at the large steel doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she was about to walk through and return to the surface, the scientist coughed pointedly and she turned towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else sir?\" she asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your required to give him a moniker or name which is to be included in all of your daily reports.\" He pulled out a tablet, \"Do you have a name for him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarie thought for a moment, looking down at the creature contently nestled against her ample bosom. \"Yes.\" she said, \"I think I'll call him Geryon sir.\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Let's start you off with our first candidate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLieutenant Cynthia Melissa Bloodtooth AKA Bloody Teeth<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAge, around thirty<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeen part of the military since she was seventeen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReasons for joining: Killed a man who ate her younger sister, by seven years, who was human. Was sentanced to be executed when an officer, who was a friend of her father, bought her, to be his personal slave, or that's what the records say his \"public reasons\" were. Officer was a weredragon with a split-person disorder. (he was human by day, dragon by night) While a decent man by day, he was a sex crazed dragon by night. The only good thing about this was the fact that both sides saw what the other saw. This meant that if you were a friend of the human part, the dragon wouldn't harm you, much. Of course, if you harmed the human, you'd be dead before the sun came up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocations served, various places in Middle East, Africa, Asia, Pacific, Europe, South, Central, and North America.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas been in over thirty battles, and several more with various bandits and marauders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow She got her nickname: On an island in the south Pacific, she fought her first battle, slaughtering over one hundred enemy fighters, saving a nearby village of humans. She was covered in blood from head to toe, so she went to a waterfall, and took a shower under it. The village's shaman, as the tribe was \"primitive\", blessed her as she bathed, using the loose translation of her name, Bloody Teeth, and said that she was a warrior of protection and good. Before she left, he gave her a blue and green stone, that had a hole drilled through, it that was on a string, which was sacred to his village, as it was believed to have been created by the gods of the forest and the river. After draping it around her neck, a villager who could speak English to a certain degree told her what it was for, and what it meant, and called her Bloody Teeth. After that, no matter where she went, someone called her Bloody Teeth, followed by a blessing of some sort, and if she saved someone important to a village, or the village itself, or some such thing, she always received a gift that was sacred to those she had helped, and she would give them a gift in return, a braided lock of her own, human, hair, which she would make then and there, telling the children that if they were ever in danger, it would be as if she was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPersonal connection to the military: Great-grandfather was Colonel Redclaws. More importantly, her grandmother was born AFTER the war was over, by one year. This means that she feels that she is in debt to Private Jenkins \"The Uniter\". Thus, she'll do anything to protect those that are related to him, even if she has to risk her career in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPreferred weapons: K-bar fighting knife, Desert Eagle service pistol, fifty caliber, a Colt revolver, forty-five caliber *note, this was the same revolver that Redclaws had*, and a tranquilizer pistol, a must for officers training recruits, especially those who need to learn that their fellow recruits are not to be eaten by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, someone else?</span></div></div>",

Here is your motivation during this, 'exercise' as it were; if you talk, your captors will eat you alive. However, until you talk, you will remain alive. Your torturer is schooled in ways that will make anyone talk, not because of beatings or things like burning you, pulling on your fingers and toes, or anything of the like. Instead, she uses things that, while not painful, will make anyone suffering from her torture beg for mercy. Your challenge is this, do not beg for any, not until twenty minutes pass, when I will stop the exercise. Now, here is your reward, Jenkins, if you can last that long. You will be able to have sex with me, in my human form, naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, a smile appears on the human's face. \"Oh, now that is a reward that I like!\" Jenkins said. \"But um, what will happen if I don't last the full twenty minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case,\" Bloodtooth said. \"You will have to escape from my stomach, with your hands tied behind your back, feet tied together, and blindfolded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which way would I have to come out?\" Jenkins asked, still having a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The back way of course,\" Bloodtooth said, as she gave the private a kiss on the lips. \"After all, you are not going to be able to come up my throat, now are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, are you sure about that, considering that that was what happened on the first day we met,\" Jenkins said, with a knowing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you were the one who stepped on my upper and lower jaws to be able to reach far enough to touch the only black brick on a white wall,\" Bloodtooth chuckled, as she remembered that day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost a month ago when the two first met, when Jenkins became the one who had broken the record of twelve hours spent in the dream spell in less than an hour. In fact, Bloodtooth had been in the room for less than ten minutes when the human woke up. At first, he'd been puzzled as to why he was still alive, like most recruits, because they had to give their lives in order to escape from the dream spell. After she explained the situation about the reasons as to why he was still alive, as her dream counterpart had ripped his heart out and crushed it when he saw that one of the others was severally lagging behind in his push-ups, and provoked the \"Drill Sergeant's\" wrath, to make sure that the other recruit hadn't been the last one to finish the push-ups, and become the \"Drill Sergeant's supper\", which is what the recruits had been lead to believe, she talked to him a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she told him to walk in a straight line and touch a black brick on a white wall, which was fifteen feet above the floor. This, in and of itself, was impossible without some sort of assistance. However, as Jenkins soon discovered, things were not even like THAT, as the floor was really mud, and got deeper the closer one got to the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins, however, asked if there was anything that he could use to help him, when he saw that the floor was mud and Bloodtooth had told him about how deep it would get as he got closer. Bloodtooth had told him that he could use anything in the room. Jenkins had then seen a ladder, but, even without the mud, it wasn't quite long enough. All that was left then was Bloodtooth herself, and when he said that the only other thing that he could use was her, Bloodtooth was pleased, as it normally took recruits several hours to figure out that they needed the help of their guiding officer to get the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the pair got to the wall, with Jenkins on Bloodtooth's back, they climbed up the ladder, and Jenkins got on her shoulders, but that wasn't high enough to reach the brick, so Jenkins had asked Bloodtooth to tilt her head back, so he could step on her top and bottom jaws, and was able to touch the brick. However, the ladder broke, which caused Jenkins to fall halfway down her throat. Thankfully, she was able to get him out, and the two had been together since then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bloodtooth came out of her revere, she got out two things, a stopwatch that would count down from twenty minutes, and a metronome, which would produce a constant ticktock, which would make Jenkins become more and more likely to talk as the ticking represented time slipping away from him, which could get on one's nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" she said. \"The exercise starts, Now!\" With that, she released the pendulum on the metronome and pressed the button on the stopwatch, letting Jenkins know that the time for jokes and memories was over. Despite the fact that Bloodtooth was friendly, and cared for Jenkins, for several reasons, when it came to training, she was not fooling around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she went over to a table, and pulled the cover off of what was on it. On the table was a wide variety of condiment bottles and a feather. Despite the fact that many interrogators tried to use physical means to make the enemy talk, the military found out that the best ways to make one talk was to overload the sensory organs with feelings of pleasure. After all, laughter was one way to make people to talk, especially when they wanted someone to stop tickling them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut first, Bloodtooth believed that Jenkins needed to be washed off first. She then stuck his head in her mouth, and started to lick it, especially behind his ears, which she knew to be somewhat ticklish. However, all he said was, \"What did you eat? Your breath smells like you ate a skunk that isn't quite dead yet.\" Of course, while this wasn't true, as she always brushed her teeth, it was what Bloodtooth had told him to saw if he was ever in a predicament like this, to insult your torturer to the point that he or she will just kill you, instead of making you talk. It was better to take the secrets of the military to the grave, rather than tell how they even tied their shoes to the enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think that you are tough,\" Bloodtooth said, as she pulled her jaws off of Jenkins's head. \"I guess I'll have to use other ways of making you talk.\" Then, she took a bottle of ketchup and covered his arm with the whole thing, and started to lick it clean, with plenty of slobbering as well as gentle licks, and all the while he said insults that would of angered most people. However, this was what she was training him for, because in real torture, it wouldn't just be condiments he'd have on him, but blood and organs, some of which could be his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about nineteen minutes, Jenkins hadn't given away anything, and had not begged for mercy. Of course, Bloodtooth had saved the worst for last, the feather. With it, she could tickle him to the breaking point, especially his feet, which were highly sensitive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then picked it up and started to tickle his feet, watching Jenkins's face, as he struggled to keep himself from laughing, and begging for mercy, as the stopwatch came closer and closer to zero and the ticktock of the metronome seemed to get louder and louder in Jenkins's ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Jenkins keep himself from laughing, and enjoy Bloodtooth in her human form, or will he burst out in laughter, and have to navigate his way out of Bloodtooth's digestive system (Which he will succeed in doing at any rate), tied up, hands and feet, and blindfolded? </span></div></div>",

Also, the recruits weren't allowed to eat until the last one had made it back to the barracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBloodtooth however was up in the bleachers, shouting out advice to the various recruits, telling them to duck, to use their tails, to watch for others' tails, to bite, gouge, claw, punch, kick, and more, though most of the advice was addressed to Jenkins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Recruit!\" she shouted. \"Slip underneath the dridder's abdomen and crawl out from one of the sides!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins slipped underneath the dridder he'd been running towards and ducked out from between their legs, which caused the werewolf that had been chasing him to crash into the half-spider-half-human creature, who fell on top of the werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good recruit,\" Bloodtooth shouted. \"Watch your starboard side though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenkins turned his head left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's port!

For instance, they cannot exorcise the spirit of a fallen soldier, especially if they are waiting for thier body to be found and healed, or, if their body was obliterated, still follows the rules and rugulations, unless the person is a traitor.<br>\r\nAlso, they are forbidden to do anything that could affect the other soldiers. This means that they cannot have the other soldiers sell their souls to improve their preformances, or anything like that. However, they are free to do whatever they want to do to the enemies of the country, and do what ever they want to traitors and deserters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you can make another humanoid race, just leave options for others.</span></div></div>",

Some of the planets best biology professors have theorised that they came from a meteor from the sun some two or three thousand years ago, others have said that they come from the center of the planet, and still some deny their very Existence. However in the past two years a war broke out between them and others of their kind. At one point the war became a stalemate and the only way to end it was for all sides to join the country that held ideals like their own. Very little is known about them and their origins as well as why the war broke out in the first place. Also none outside of their kind have ever been allowed to see what kind of training that they have gone through.<br>\r\nFemales- Pure blue fire with multiple dark red spots, each with their own unique patterns. Height wise they grow from 2 feet to 15 feet over the coarse of their lifes. Prefer living in plases with dry heat and very small amounts of water. Ideal location for deployment would be the deserts. There have been rumors that they have been trained to withstand pain and no amount of torture could make them give up any information to the enemy. They can use magic but only fire magic, however they all prefer hand-to-hand combat whenever possible. The heat their bodies give off can reach up to 1500*F, because of this they can not hold guns but they also need special rounds to kill them. After some special training that was rumored to have been created by their very first king they can control the heat given off by their bodies (this means that they will not kill anyone close to them, however if someone touches them they will melt unless a very powerful mage has given them heat protection and even then it can still be fatal). Most killing methods will not work, however large amounts of water can and will kill them without fail, there is no known protection for this. Pryoknights are loyal and will NEVER under any conditions betry their friends, family, and the person or persons that they serve. All in all they are the ideal soldier.<br>\r\nSide note. The height and heat of a Pyroknight indicates how strong they are, so it is possible for them to grow higher then 15 feet and become hotter then 1500*F, however it is extremly unlikly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Colonal Seventails everytime they have a match together. Likes to take a walk during the afternoon.<br>\r\nDislikes: War Movies, especially one about an event that happened twenty years ago, which was based on him, when he was a seargant, and three of those who were privates under his comand. In the film he was portried as a kitsune with the privates being humans, though the reality was really the other way around. In the film, he exectued two of them for treason, by eating them alive. However, he really only exectued the one, and that was by shooting him through the heart. However, these are not the reasons he hates this particular war movie. The reason is this, the man he had executed, was his own half-brother. The man had been captured and put under a spell by the enemy, forcing him to tell them certain secrets. Thankfully, the others were able to get to them, and kill the enemy before they sent the information to anyone else. However, when the then Seargant Sanders met up with his half-brother, the man told him the awful truth, and asked him to kill him, so that it wouldn't happen again.The then seargant, reluctantly, respected his brother's request, and killed him, himself. After that, he asked for a transfer away from the area, which he got, and was sent to Fort Williams.<br>\r\nCurrent ocupation: Comands the fort, the one where the statue of Private Jenkins is located at. (*Note* He is the Officer who talked to the recruits back in the first chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you can chose another human officer, just leave options for others.</span></div></div>",

And that this is an experimental procedure and that there is no guarantee that you will survive, or even get worse?\" General Gioll asked. \"Yes sir, and I do not care.\" Mikel replied with a determined  gleam in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Gioll terned to the nurse \"Alright nurse get him ready I want the operation to be done by 20 hundred hours\" The kitsune raised an arm into a salute for a moment before her smile faded into a confused look. \"Um...\" She started before General Gioll rolled his eyes. \"8:00pm miss\" And with that he walked out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nurse brought in a Stretcher and used her magic to levitate you onto it and just before she pushes you out she gives you a lick on the one part of your face that's not bandaged up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow there he stood. with his fellow new recruits.with his metal left arm and a computerized right eye that sent detailed information into his brain. The rest was covered by his uniform, but most of him was still flesh. \"First day and I already got a nick name, Metal Mike.\"</span></div></div>",

He had a bad experience with a naga once. She came into his home at night when he was young for a quick meal. She swallowed his parents alive and toyed with him. Pressing him against her scaly stomach to feel his parents struggle for there lives until they died. She just left him there leaving him with with her last words that burned into his memory. \"Your really lucky I don't eat kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looked at the naga, his new eye showing him a x-ray scan of his body structure showing several parts of different bones that were a little thicker then the rest where his bones were broken in the past. \"With all do respect can we do more training and less talking sir?\" This only got a wider smile from the naga. \"In a hurry to get away from me metal head? Might get it considering how fast you got threw the test.\" Mike deactivated the scanner in his synthetic eye. \"Ya about that you said I was the first out of the testing room but I keep hearing about this guy called Uniter.\" The naga just shook his head \"Its true you were the first one out but you had the worst score of everyone who ever past.\" Mike cocks a eyebrow at this. \"Confused boy? You see technically you cheated.\" The naga said as he tapped at mike's feet with the tip of his tail. \"Tho I'll give you points for creativity but using the super magnets in your feet to walk along the metal frames in the walls I'm afraid is bending the rules a bit.\" Mike just groaned at this. \"So am I correct in assuming that this Uniter guy is that guy that I died trying to save?\" The naga got another smile on face as his only response. \"I thought so. I was real surprised that my energy canon did not work and he got his heart removed. And yet you somehow knew what I was trying to do and did the same to me.\" The naga's smile then faded. \"That's just the way the spell works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two terned and headed toward the mess hall. \"I'm hungry\" Said the naga as they went on. When a Chameleon man running by bumped into the naga. An officer by the look of him. \"Hey Kover. Have you seen Wolfblood anywhere?\" The Chameleon man looked tense about something. \"No I have not. May I ask what this is about?\" Officer Kover asked. \"Its about the vow we made about that family, you know.\"  Officer Kover's eyes widened at this. \"I see... I'll help you look. Tin head  you just...whatever I need to help my fellow officer.\" And with that they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Mike was lying in his bead reading a note sent to him by his new girlfriend, The kitsune nurse of his and him got real attached to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Mikel<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are you doing? I know your blowing the other recruits away. Oh! I got a new tail. I can change my size now. I can't wait to see you again. Hows the eye? Still disorienting to scan things? I'm thinking of joining up just to spend more time with you. Write back soon. My little engine that could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike just smiled and terned his attention to a picture of his beloved Teara.

He ran into a recruitment office when the guard there told him to head inside and he would delay his pursuers. The guard, a sphinx, asked the tax collectors that were trying to get the man the question that had no answer, \"What is the meaning of life?\" When one of the officers inside the place asked why the young man came inside, he told them that he was running from the tax collectors that were trying to figure out the answer to the guard's riddle. The officer told him that if he signed up, the military would pay off his debt. At this, and seeing no other way, Jenkins sat down and started to fill out the questionare, and finished it in 10 minutes, several times faster than most would-be recruits. After that, he went through the first two tests, a dream spell, to see if he had the compassion for others that all soldiers needed to have, and to see if he could figure out the soulution to a seemingly unbeatable test, very quickly.<br>\r\nGuiding Officer: Lueinant Bloodtooth<br>\r\nPersonal History: Name after his father, who was named after his, who was named after his, Jenkins is the great-grandson of the man who caused the events that lead to the reorganization of the military. However, this information was clasified, so all he knew about his ancestor was that he assulted, and saved the life of, his superior officer.<br>\r\nWhen he was fifteen, the magority of his family, those he knew, and were humans, were murdered, except for him, and a cousin, whom he thought was dead until Bloodtooth found her, and another cousin of his. The murderer was a werewolf, who was a deserter, and a traitor, which he stabbed the eye of, and got away from. He spent five years searching for him, but never found him. Also, the military was searching for Jenkins, and his remaining family, so that they could protect them. However, that search came to an end when the recruitment officers saw him run into the place and sign his name on the dotted line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you can make another, just leave options for others</span></div></div>",

This will hurt you more than it will me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, using the needle and hair-thread, he sowed up the cut, which the recruit had once received over ten years ago during some foolish stunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go,\" Doc said, as he stood up. \"In a few days, the hair will break down, and you won't have a scar there.

Also, be careful, because when his teeth start to come in, which will be in a month or so, it will hurt like hell.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be careful,\" the woman says, as she carefully stands up, and leaves, as she gently brings the hungry baby to one of her breasts, allowing it to feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright recruits,\" the old man says. \"Those spells that I just used are all part of what you could learn. Everyone of you is required to learn the basics of healing with magic. You will learn how to heal simple flesh wounds, like cuts, broken bones, mild burns, and the like. You will also learn how to reduce an injury to something that can be treated later, like reducing a third degree burn to a really bad sunburn for instance. After that, you will be given two choices, learning more powerfull healing magics, like bringing the dead back to full life, as well as the spell that everyone affectionately calls 'De-heal', which one of you just experienced. The other option is to learn more powerful offensive magics, which are taught by my son, who is that young lady's father, so if you plan on sleeping with her, I'd think again, as he, and my one son-in-law, will kill you and send you to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now that you have met the Doc, what is your gender, which will be followed by whether you decide to be a full time medic, or a combat user of magic, with a few healing spells.</span></div></div>",

(Note, don't let this fool you youngsters, he can still knock people out, and wake them up, after killing them first.)<br>\r\nExperiance: about fifty years, easy. (He knows more about healing than most people want to know.)<br>\r\nPersonality: Something of a pervert. (He likes to heal female soldiers when they are naked, after he takes their clothes off himself, though he doesn't do this if the female is still a civilian.) Hates other magic users, especially ones who think that they are above their non-magic using bretheren, even to the point of killing them. (Don't worry, he revives them afterwards.)<br>\r\nPersonal history: His father served with the first Jenkins. Also, his son, a combat mage instructor. and granddaughter, \"The Weakest Human Officer\"  are in the servise, along with one of his son-in-laws, \"The Second Weakest\".<br>\r\nOccupation: Teaches the magic users the basics of healing with magic, followed by more intence training for those who wish to become combat medics. Also, he is the base's head doctor/medic, and he tends to the recruits that get injured, or killed, during training. (*Note* He sometimes uses this to help train would-be medics, if the person gives the doc their premission, though if dead or unconcius, consent is implied. Besides, the more the medics-in-training know about healing, the better for the squad they become part of.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, if you don't want the old man, make your own, just leave options for others.</span></div></div>",

No soldier is allowed to kill, or eat, a fellow soldier, unless there are specific reasons for dong so. These reasons include if someone has broken the major laws of the military, if there is no other source of food, or as part of the funeral of a fallen comrade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. While sexual relations between soldiers and their comrades are tolerated, even though those between different ranks are slightly frowned upon, no soldier is allowed to rape another, soldier or civilian. *Note, when it comes to sex, I'll allow gay/lesbian, straight, or bisexuality. Just try to keep it casual, to a degree okay.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Soldiers are not allowed to eat those under the age of recruitment, and are to give those that are, that are served as part of a meal, the option of joining the military. *note, bringing in new recruits, or child meals, is a way to make a bonus in one's pay*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Soldiers are to respect their comrades, regardless of race.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Soldiers are to listen to their officers, regardless of the officer's race. *note, those human officers can kill the strongest of civilian giants with no problems, due to the training that they go through.*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose who break the rules can be executed or given a dishonorable discharge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there are benefits to be had as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No civilian authority can touch those in the military. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. A soldier's family is considered to be military property, and thus protected from being harmed by civilian authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Should one be killed in combat or training, the medics with magic are taught a highly top secret spell that has a high chance of bringing one back to life, over ninety-nine percent. Of course, when it comes to humans, even magic users, there is a thirty percent chance that they will be turned into one of the undead, either a zombie or vampire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Should one be unable to be brought back, usually because their body was totally destroyed, and they are a ghost, they can still serve in a few ways, such as spying and target practice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Should one receive an honorable or medical discharge, they, and their family, are still under military protection, as well as their assistance, in any matter, whether it is business related, family related, and so forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoldiers come from all backgrounds, from homeless, to convicts, to the wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould they make it through training, they are branded with an iron, marking them as professionally trained soldiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nServe your country, Soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTell me what you think, and be honest. (rate and review fellow writers)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Note* I'd like to dedicate this to anyone who is, or was, or knows someone who is, or did, serving in the military. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Timeline Note* Prologue takes place in our equivalent of WW1. Jenkins and Redclaws are part of the equivalent of the Allies, the US Army to be close to it, in the equal to the Western Front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe present day soldiers, that are training now, may fight in the Middle East, or any other place, like special operations in the Pacific, South America, Asia, Africa, Europe. The weapons can either be equivalent to those that are being used currently, or more futuristic, and did I forget to mention that there are magic users guys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, you can be an officer, who could have fought in equivalents to WW2, Korea, Vietnam, the First Gulf War, or any other such thing. As for the enemy, if it fits the environment, go ahead. Also, demons can be part of the military, though they cannot harm their comrades, that's in the contract that all soldiers sign. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPS, when it comes to dealing with the enemy, well, I think that some of our boys deserve a little treat for all of their control, for not eating their comrades. (A giant licks his lips as he picks up an enemy werewolf, that had tried to eat his human comrade, who is now whimpering in fear, as the human soldier whistles a tune, and walks away, as the werewolf begs for mercy, before the giant eats him alive.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, here is a list of things I've made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"90%\" style=\"position:relative;\" class=\"norm\"><tr><td align=\"center\" valign=\"middle\" width=\"56\" style=\"position:relative;\"><div style=\"position:relative;\"><a rel=\"awardlightbox\" title=\"...
