You drive up the driveway, the driveway seemed to be cutting through some type of forrest, after following the driveway for what seemed like twenty minutes the trees open up and reveal a mansion sitting out in the open, all around was more of that forest. You pull up to the front door and get out, you look up, the mansion had to have at least four floors, you reach into your pocket and pull out a photo that was sent to you in the mail along with the letter saying you had inherited the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess this is the place\" you say to yourself, you reach into your car and pull out a backpack that had a small change of clothes and some toiletries and head into the mansion. You open the door and walked into the massive foyer and look up, you were right there were four floors above you, to your left was what looked like the kitchen and to your right was some type of dinning room. You drop your bag and climb the first set of stairs and explore the many rooms, you find what looks like an living room or study with a couch in the center, large screen tv on a wall, a desk of sorts in the far right corner, and book shelves all around the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you go to leave you hear a voice behind you, \"who are you?\" the voice asks, \"um I should be asking you the same question\" you say, not moving. \"I live here\" the voice says, \"I think your mistaken I live here\" you say, \"turn around, I hate talking to people's backs\" says the voice. Slowly you turn around, what you saw next almost made your jaw drop, standing in the door way was a female anthro German Shepard, she had a mix of brown and black fur racing over her body. She was wearing a shirt that showed some of her midriff and a pair of shorts that stopped high on her legs, she had her arms crossed, but as you turned around her arms dropped and she seemed to recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Paul\" she says with a smile, \"um...yeah\" you say slowly, still not believing what you are seeing. \"I'm Kim\" she says holding out a paw, \"how do you know about me?\" you ask as you shake her paw. \"Your uncle told me a lot about you\" she says, \"here, he even showed me pictures of you\" she says as she walks over to the desk and picks up a picture frame. She hands it to you and you look at it, it was a picture of you, when you were still in the army, You were standing next to a Humvee smiling at the camera, the picture was at least two years old, but you remember when it was taken like it was yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe he kept this\" you say handing the photo back, \"he kept anything you sent him because you were his favorite\" says Kim. \"Really?....I guess that explains why he left this house for me\" you say, \"that reminds me, are you going to stay here for good or...?\" asks Kim, you nod and suddenly Kim grabs you and hugs you tightly, \"ooh thats great, come on I'll introduce you to the others\" she says letting go of you. \"Wait there's others?\" you ask, but Kim just grabs your hand and pulls you out the room and toward the stairs, \"Kim just wait a second\" you say, she stops and looks at you, \"what's wrong?\" she asks tilting her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to take a nap right now, I've been on the road for almost a day just to get here\" you tell her, she nods, \"I'll take you to your room\" she says. You follow her to the third floor and she points to a door, \"this one's your's\" she says opening it, you walk in and flop on the bed, being too tired to check out the room, you begin to drift off to sleep as Kim closes the door.</span></div></div>",

You keep thinking back to Kim, \"its not possible for someone like her to exist right? Maybe I was so tired I imagined her\" you think to yourself. You get up and walk over to the door, but before you could open it you heard female voices on the other side, \"Sasha I really don't think we should be doing this\" said one voice. \"Oh come on Laura, quit being such a whiner, besides its not like we're going to do anything to him, we're just looking\" said the second female. You freeze, the first thought going through your head was theses people were burglars, but then you remembered Kim saying something about 'others'. You were curious if these two females were unique like Kim so you look around the room and spot a closet to observe from because you didn't know if these strange beings were harmless or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb into the closet and close the sliding door, making sure to leave a small slit to spy from, just then the bedroom door opened, the light from the hallway casting two shadows, but the odd thing about the shadows is they were human-like, but also different, you could make out what these two figures were. \"Thats odd, he was here a minute ago\" said one of the voices, \"well maybe he's hiding--or something\" said the other voice, \"don't be silly Laura, why would he be hiding?\" said the first female, the two figures walk into the room, to your surprise they were just like Kim, the first female was a wolf with fatigue pants, some type of tank top, and combat boots. The second female was a lion with jeans, a white t-shirt, and was barefoot, but she seemed nervous about being in the room, \" ok Sasha we looked and he's not here so lets go\" said the lion, but as she turned to leave the wolf stopped her, \" you look here while I check the bathroom\" she said. The lion you assumed was named Laura let out and uneasy groan and looks under the bed, \"well he's not here\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not in here\" you hear the wolf yell from the adjoining bathroom.............</span></div></div>",

You feel a weight in the bed like someone slowly climbing onto the bed and they were headed toward you, Suddenly you hear purring as who ever was climbing in the bed got close, you feel something furry rub against your face and a light weight on your chest. Next thing you know there's a knock on the door and the door opens, \"hey I wanted to let you know it almost time---- MISSY!....get off him!\" says Kim from the doorway, \"why, you left him alone\" says whoever was on you, \"just wait until Paul gets here\" says Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah well got some bad news for you...that is Paul\" says Kim as she turns on the lights revealing a humanoid cat laying across your chest. She was a bicolor cat with black and white fur over her body, like Kim she wore short pants, but a longer t-shirt, as the light came on she looked down at you, \"surprise\" you say with a grin. She put her paws over her mouth in embarrassment, \"oh my god, I'm sorry\" she says through her paws as she climbs off you. You sit up and set a hand on her shoulder, \"its ok\" you say, she lowers her paws slowly, \"you mean your not angry?\" she asks, you shake your head, \"why should I?\" you ask confused. \"Never mind\" she says avoiding the question, she gets up and leaves the room, you look over at Kim who was still standing in the door way, \"I'll explain later\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ways, you wanted to tell me something?\" you say, \"oh yes, its almost time to have dinner and I wanted to check on you\" she says. \"You cook?\" you ask, \"no Laura does\" she says, \"wait there's more than you and Missy?\" you ask, she nods. \"Here I can give you a tour if you want\" she says</span></div></div>",

You nod and follow her down the stairs to the first floor to look for your favorite room: the garage. You turn the corner and almost bump into another anthro, you look and see this anthro was a male wolf, he had gray and black fur, and he had a muscular build similar to yours. He was wearing a green t-shirt, and what looked like running pants, \"oh hey, you must be Paul\" he says holding out his hand, you shake his hand, \"yep and you are....?\" you ask, \"Zak\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little lost\" he says, \"eh just exploring\" you tell him, \"let me guess, you're looking for the garage\" he says, \"how'd you guess\" you ask. \"I can smell the car oil on your clothing, so I assumed your a car guy\" he says, \"but I don't have oil on my clothes now\" you say, \"I can still smell small amounts\" he says. \"Any ways, can you point me in the direction of the garage?\" you ask, \"actually Sasha was headed that way any ways\" he says, he turn around and shouts down one of the hallway. \"Hey Sasha!\" he yells, \"yo?\" you hear a female voice respond, \"come here\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear someone walking down the hallway toward you and Zak, around the corner walks another wolf with dark gray fur, she had on clothing similar to you, baggy cargo pants, tan combat boots and a black shirt. She, like everyone so far, also recognizes you, \" you must be Paul\" she says, \"and you must be Sasha\" you say holding out your hand. \"I figured since you might be heading to the garage you could show him the way\" says Zak. \"sure, come on\" says Sasha, you follow Sasha who leads you down a flight of stairs and into another hallway, \"in here\" she says opening a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was one long row of different types of cars on one end of the room and on the other end were rows of tools, lifts, air compressers, and a small kitchenette in the far corner of the room. \"So I hear you were in the military?\" Sasha asks, \"yep got out about a six months ago\" you say, \"here you uncle had something for you\" says Sasha changing the subject, she leads you to the car on the far end of the row, it had a dust cover pulled over it, \"he told us it was for you and not to touch it\" she adds. You pull off the over an reveal a black 1973 Plymouth Hemi Barracuda, you run your hand over it, \"wow thats a nice car\" says Sasha as she walks over to the passenger side. \"Want to take it for a spin?\" she asks with a smile on her face........</span></div></div>",

Sasha walks over to a desk and pulls out a set of keys, \"here\" she says tossing them to you, the two of you get in, like most Barracudas, this one was a stick shift, which wasn't a problem for you. The interior looked like it had just rolled off the factory floor, \"where did he get this?\" you say, running you hands over everything, \"I don't know, but come on lets go\" Sasha says, you look at her and you could tell she was just as excited as you, cars seemed to be her thing too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start the car and the Hemi engine comes to life with a roar, you put it in first and make your way out of the garage, \"If you follow that path it'll take you to the race track\" says Sasha, pointing to a path, \"there's a race track?\" you ask, \"of course, every mansion needs a race track\" she says with a grin, you chuckle and follow the path, it wasn't long before you came to a large race track, minus the bleachers, you pull onto the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright here we go\" you say before taking off, doing a small burn out as your shift into second, as you pull into the first turn you could hear Sasha letting out and excited whoop. You come out of the turn you look down and see you were doing about 120 MPH! You finish your lap and half before coming to a stop, you look over at Sasha who seemed so excited that she was going to jump out of her seat, \"wanna give it a try?\" you ask her, she looked at you like you had just asked her out, \"really\" she says suprised.

She walks over to the door that leads to the small kitchenette and as she opens the door a bucket of water falls on her, soaking her clothes and fur. You hear laughter coming from behind one of the other cars, \"KINO! I'm going to kill you\" Sasha yells, \"you have to catch me first\" says Kino as she runs out of the garage. All you saw of Kino was an orange blur of furry tails headed out the door and up the stairs, you walk over to the kitchenette and look for any type of towels to clean up, you toss one to Sasha to dry off, \"thanks\" she says as she dries her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that was Kino?\" you ask, \"yeah, as you can tell she loves to pull pranks on everyone\" she says lowering the towel from her face. \"Come on go get dried off I can clean this up\" you tell Sasha, she nods and leaves, you wipe up all the water off the floor. You walk back over your new car and pull the dust cover back over it and head upstairs, as you reach the top Kim was standing there, \"I was just about to come get you\" she says. You follow her to the dinning room you saw earlier and see Zak, Kino, and Missy siting at the table, you take a seat next to Kino, in walks a female lion anthro who sits next to you, you look over and notice she seems to be avoiding making eye contact with you.

After everyone finished eating and left you decide to help clean up a little, just as your about to leave Kim stops you \"some of us were going to watch a movie and I was wondering if you want to join us\" she says, \"oh um.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You set one hand on the closet door and the other hand on the light switch and in one swift motion you open the door and hit the lights. Sitting on the floor was a female Kitsune with red/orange fur and nine tails tipped with white fur, \"wha---\" before you could finish three tails shot up and silenced you, \"shhh\" says the Kitsune quietly. As you listen you can hear someone else walking down the hallway, the Kitsune was biting her tongue to stop herself from giggling, you could see she was counting down silently with her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached zero you hear a soft bang outside your door, \"what the-- KINO!\" yells the person in the hallway, the Kitsune that you assumed was Kino started to giggle loudly, but she used her other six tails to cover her mouth and muffle her laughter. After the person in the hallway storms off Kino stands up and releases you from her tails, \"sorry about that, in case you didn't figure it out my name's Kino\" she says holding out a hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Paul\" you say shaking her hand, \"oh\" she says, her voice changing from the giggling prankster to quiet sadness, \"I'm sorry about your uncle\" she says. \"How well did you know him?\" you ask Kino, \"he was the one that took me in, he took us all in\" she says. She walks over and sits on the bed, you walk over and sit next to her, \"he found me one day when he was out in the woods hiking, when he brought me back to the house Kim and Missy were already living here\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He never said anything to me about anyone else living here\" you tell her, \"he wanted everything to be a secret, he was afraid that we would be taken and thrown in a cage to be experimented on\" she says. \"well I should go start unpacking\" you say as you stand up \"want some help?\" she asks......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ditomasso\" stenciled on the side. The two of you head back to your room to drop of the duffle and boxes before heading back out to finish unpacking the car. \"Last one\" says Kino as she sets down the last box from the car, \"that went quicker than I thought\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou set a box on the bed, open it and start unpacking, \"do you want me to help unpack too?\" asks Kino, \"I could use the company really\" you say. After an hour of talking and unpacking everything you get to the last box, as you open it you realize it was all your stuff from when you were in the army. Kino walks over, looks in, and picks up your old Ranger beret and turns it over in her hands, \"what is this?\" she asks. \"Its a beret, you wear it on your head\" you say, \"like this?\" Kino says as she set it on her head, it didn't really fit on her head because of her ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small laugh as the beret falls over her eyes, \"you might like this one better\" you say as you pull out a boonie hat and hand it to her. She puts on the hat and it fits her better than the beret, \"you can have it if you want, I have many more\" you tell her, \"thanks, but it presses on my ears\" she says. She hands it back to you and you cut two holes for her ears with your boot knife, she puts it back on and her ears fit perfectly through the holes you made. \"Thanks for the hat even though I have no idea what to do with it\" she says, you shrug, she looks over and sees a black rifle bag and a smaller black box, both with locks on them, \"what are those?\" she asks. \"My guns\" you say, \"oh well you know we have a small armory you can store them in\" she says, \"really?.. I guess this place really does have everything\" you says to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take you down there if you want\" she says</span></div></div>",

You nod, \"she can meet me now if she wants\" you tell her, \"ok give me a minute\" she says as she disappears behind the door, moments later she returns with a female cat behind her, she had mixed black and white fur racing over her body, she wore clothing similar to Kim, shorts and a tank top. She was studying you with her emerald cat eyes, \"you must be Paul\" she says, \"and you must be Missy\" you say holding out your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Kim nudge Kino and they both walk out of the room leaving you and Missy alone. \"So um you need any help unpacking?\" she asks nervously, \"nope all good\" you tell her, \"oh ok then bye\" she says as she turns to leave. \"Hang on, I'm a little confused first you wanted to meet me now you want to leave?\" you ask confused, \"sorry I'm just afraid that--um--you might---umm you know--kick us out since you were moving in\" she says. You slowly get up and walk over to her and set your hands on her shoulders, \"I would never force any one of you guys out, this is your home too\" you tell her. She grabs you and hugs you tightly, \"you really mean it?' she says looking at you with wide, emerald eyes, \"of course\" you tell her, she wraps her arms around your neck and rubs her cheek with yours, purring loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you thank you\" she says excitedly, she knocks you back a little and causes you to fall back onto the bed with her on top of you still rubbing your face with her cheek and purring even louder. She stopped rubbing your face and set her head down on your chest, but she was still purring , you look at her face and see she was asleep. There was a knock on the door and Kim stuck her head in, the first thing she saw was Missy laying on top of you asleep, but rather than wake her she walked over and crouched down so her face was level with yours'. \"It looks like you made a new friend\" she says, \"does she always fall asleep this fast?\" you whisper, \"she hasn't been sleeping well when she found out you were moving in, I think she was afraid of you kicking us out when you found out we weren't human\" she says.</span></div></div>",

Sojo looked into the deep blue eyes of his lover and best friend as she turned them 180 so she had him pinned against the door of the Jeep. <br>\r\n\"What's on your mind, babe? We need to get going if we're going to make it before dark. \" Sojo looked over his Norse beauty (Runi is a quarter Norse and another quarter Greek besides her native Japanese ) as she began playing her nails through his crew-cut hair while tracing large X's across his chest with her other hand. Her blonde hair smelled of sakura blossoms and rainfall,  the exact scent that drove him mad for Runi in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to clear up a few things before starting this new chapter, baby. I know what awaits us at this property your uncle left you, I read the letter after you went to work yesterday. I have a few colleagues  to bring with us to our new home. We need to do some sorting out of the tenants . Now, let's blow off some steam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuni delved into a kiss that took her partner by surprise as she enveloped him in her scent and form. She could feel her \"captive's\" mild resistance to her advances but nearly growled in pleasure when Sojo returned the kiss with vigor.  The dommy female took that as invitation to fully pounce her \"prey\" by jumping into Sojo's arms which as she leaped went reflexively to cushion her ass before they broke their fiery kiss.<br>\r\n\"Who are we bringing with us? We only have room for a few passengers. Uncle David's house is huge, more like a small college in some ways. It's no secret that money is no issue. I don't wanna have to fight with the current tenants so we need to make sure that there are no conflicts. \" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sojo looked over each anthro noting their gender: male panther, rough collie bitch, a kitsune Tod and a assertive male tiger. He then asked for names and got: Bara the warrior(panther), Cheyenne the dominant one (rough collie), Kiro the salvation seeking assassin (kitsune) and Khan the regal northern tiger. Sojo eyed each Fur as he tried to decide a job for each of them could fill. Sojo knew who was already living in the mansion from his uncle's letter so he started with that in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mate has given me some basic information on your qualifications but I'd like to hear from each of you, Bara you're first.\" The panther stepped forward, \" I am a tribal fighter from South America, Brazil to be precise, and wish to join your household to hone my skills and learn what I can from others.\" Bara stayed stock still as he awaited Sojo's reply. Sojo stepped forward and extended his left hand which Bara took firmly, \"Welcome home my friend, Cheyenne you're next.\" The panther stepped back in line and the black/white collie stepped forward. <br>\r\n\"I am a 'behavior specialist' with a certain gift when it comes to fellow canines, wild and domestic. I use a mix of forceful discipline and gentle coercion to bring out the best in each person.  I can use my skills to help my fellow tenants relieve stress and pent-up emotions, whether they be angry, sad, hurting or horny. I can tame any storm given enough time. I am a bit of a specialty problem-solver that enjoys a very personal touch. \" Cheyenne eyed Kiro with a mischievous glint as she finished her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojo stepped toward the collie and whispered into her ear so only she could hear him, \"I am aware of your real interests in those things as well as severe bondage. I warn you now, if you use your skills to harass or unfairly punish your fellow tenants, you will deal with my own form of punishment. Do you understand what I am saying little bitch?\" Cheyenne's ears drooped and she licked at Sojo's nose in submission. Sojo stepped back and cupped the underside of Cheyenne's muzzle comfortingly, \"welcome to the team.\" Cheyenne stepped back in line as Sojo motioned Kiro forward.\"What's your story my friend? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKiro began solemnly, \"I was raised near Tokyo in an ancient sanctuary used by the deadly Yakuza to house and train their members in ninjitsu and other crafts of the trade. I was brought up with my younger brother to become one of the best that the clan leadership had ever seen, but it went south quickly. I was on a routine assignment when I discovered the thugs I had killed were rival clan members and I was set up in an unsanctioned hit. before I knew it I was fighting to escape from the whole clan. my brother was killed in retaliation, as was my fiance. This is were it gets worse, I later found out that my brother was killed by a hitman. who was hired by my own clan while they killed my fiance themselves.  I eventually tracked down the hitman after escaping Japan to find that he had been just as used so we teamed up and took out my former clan and the Chicago Mafia before disappearing into the shadows. I wish to use my skills for good, right some wrongs I've done over the years.\" Kiro finished his story and waited patiently for Sojo's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojo looked the kitsune over carefully before stating, \"Been awhile my friend, how are Vinnie and Shorty?\" The two continued talking for a while before Sojo welcomed his old friend to his little group. Kiro stepped back in line as Khan stepped forward being the last fur in line. <br>\r\n\"My story begins in the upper Ural Mountains of Russia were only the heartiest survive. I come from a prominent middle-class family of traders and bodyguards who sold our goods to the most discerning of clientele.  We have branches throughout Eurasia as well as most major nations.  My goal is to bring my knowledge, expertise and experience to work for you to make a better home and environment for all within it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSojo stepped forward and extended his hand which Khan took respectfully.  \"Welcome to the team, any connection to the Butlers? \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only by reputation, Domovoi got injured awhile back didn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's better now, tough bastard that he is.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
