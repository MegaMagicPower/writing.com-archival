He like to stand here and watch the infinite emptiness of space. Around him the crew was doing their job perfectly. He hardly ever had to tell them anything. He walked back to his seat and sat down. The computer screen asked if he would like anything to eat or drink, it was programed as a servant and had no real practical function apart from keeping the captain comfortable. It was, perhaps a bit to intend on this thought McLarwood as he asked it for a soda. He had gained almost 15 pounds on his once lean body since the beginning of this mission one year ago. At least his crew wasn't going the same way, this was a luxury for captains only. The real reason the servant computer was there was so a captain would not have to leave his post during any dangerous situation, but it had no off function and was always offering.<br>\r\nHe took a large drink from his soda and returned his stare to the screen.

By first look this might have been earth, but the three moons quickly gave it away this was not earth.<br>\r\nBehind him the construction team was almost finished putting up their new home. A whole small town had been constructed in just three days and they were ready to begin permanent habitation of the planet. It was a weird planet. It was twice as big as earth, only 20% water, all of it fresh, the planet did not have salt, and the only life was the plants. Not one kind of animals. not even germs. This planet was indeed a treasure. About 70% of the landmass was fertile plains and the remaining 30% of the landmass was steep hills and mountains, fitting for military instalations and safety shelters.<br>\r\nThe plan was to turn the entire planet into a food source. That would not only end the ongoing starvation on earth and the other human colonies, the surplus harvest would make The Human Empire very rich.<br>\r\nRichard had signed up for this the moment he heard of it. He had always been a big eater and the starvation with it's food restrictions had been hard on him and the thought of not only ending it, but living in what was to become the biggest food storage in the galaxy was to tempting for him not to go. Half of the plains was to be used for cattle, and the construction team had a huge task ahead of them making more than 2000 Co2 cleansing machines across the planet to keep the cows from polluting it til death. They also had to build the farms, and the travelling system.<br>\r\nRichard was an expert in robotics, one of more than 1500 whose jobs was to make sure that the farming robots and other robots was working. There was nearly 15'000 people living on the planet now, most working with the technology required to make the farms work, manual labour was nearly non-existing. There was also wives and husbands of people working, and their children, about 500 of them. When making a colony like this it was easy to forget that you were actually creating a little town with shops, school, hospital, cinemas and other everyday stuff.<br>\r\nThe leader of the planet was Admiral Carl McStack, but only untill the colony was ready have it's first election and choose a colonial leader. Richard knew he was not going to run for that job. He just wanted to do his job, get this planet working and have his first real meal in 5 years.  He, like almost every human was only skin and bones, full meals was only for those who needed full strenght.<br>\r\nIf everything went as planned they would be having the first harvest ready in 15 months.<br>\r\nRichard turns and walks into the town, not a pretty town, but a functional town, and finds his apartment. He steps into it. He has a ground floor apartment with two rooms, a combined kitchen and living room, and a bedroom. There was public bathrooms in the basement. He is tired from the long journey and lack of energy and goes to bed.</span></div></div>",

Michael also has a bit of a preference for larger women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Station Omicron</u>: A Startrek-style, high standard of living, research station orbiting a white dwarf, the researches are studying various different specimens and technologies. These currently include studies on Zeta Waves, Bacteria Cultures, and Exotic Foods; among many other things. Each project has a head researcher who has a seat on a council who rule the station, though it is plagued with the many downfalls of large councils and bureaucracies.<br>\r\nYour job will be maintenance on some of the delicate machines in the labs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Station Nu</u>: A Mass Effect-styled station, a little grungy, a little clean, depends where you are on the station. This station is a major trade hub along a galactic highway, with millions, if not billions, of credits passing through everyday. \"Strange Aliens, Strange People, Strange Foods, Strange Products, everything passes Through Nu\", they say. Not really they, only the station manager Jason Shrux.<br>\r\nYour job will be Security System IT.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Station Mu</u>: After a near apocalyptic ecological and economic collapse, humanity is on the brink of disappearing. Station Mu currently houses one of the largest human colonies in it's region of the galaxy. However, it is wrought with old parts, a failing power grid, and a birth rate that has been on the decline. A new corporation, RestoreTech, is promising to be able to get the station fully operational and a thriving hub for humanity ... but a what cost?<br>\r\nYou were already on this station when RestoreTech arrived, we'll see what happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, the author wants full originality, I used \"Startrek-style\" and \"Mass Effect-style\" so that you can get an image of what I have in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The huge station starts with a two mile long central shaft, with five large rings attached to it. The first three rings are for research, each one falling under a different type of study, with many projects going on in each. The fourth ring is for habitation, and the fifth for vital system (life support, hydroponics, power generation, etc.). Your shuttle went to the docking bay at the bottom of the main shaft and docked. The airlock opened and you entered, being the only person on board the shuttle. Once through decontamination, you passed through another airlock to a receiving area. A pretty brunette-haired woman held a tablet against her chest and greeted you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Mr. Zambac, welcome to Station Omicron.\" she smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as impressive as I heard it was.\" you reply with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a lot more to this station than meets the eye.\" she responded, curling her smile a little more, \"If you'll follow me, I'll get you situated in your quarters.\" she turned and started walking. You followed, taking a peak at her shapely rear as you caught up to her. You enter and elevator, which takes you sideways, \"This elevator will take us to the tram station, there are four tram lines on this station, allowing for maximum efficiency.\" she said with a hint of pride. You nod in response as the elevator stops and you follow her out. There's a few other people on the platform waiting for the tram, mostly women. Some notice your presence. The tram arrives shortly and people enter one end and leave through another. \"We'll be heading to Habitation first, then to Ms. Erin to get your work assignments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear the accommodations are pretty good here.\" you remark, looking around the spartanesque tram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Station Omicron enjoys one of the highest standards of living amongst all human research stations.\" she said with a prideful smile. The tram stopped at the three research rings, exchanging passengers each time, and finally made it's way to the Habitation Ring. \"Here is our stop, if you will follow me, again.\" she said standing and leading you out of the tram station. The habitation ring seemed like a cramped, but orderly apartment complex and a luxury hotel both at the same time, with many hallways lined just as many doors, but you knew each door led to it's own high class living space. \"Here is yours: H13R8008\" she hands you a key card. \"Most of everything you need has been provided, I see you brought a bag of personal effects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, my favorite tools and some other things.\" you say, looking around the large room, \"Never had a place this big all to my own...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, if you get lonely...\" she pauses, then hesitates, \"th-there's a large common area with plenty of opportunities to socialize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll probably spend my off time there, used to more cramped conditions.\" you reminisce<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well, uh, I forgot to introduce myself, my name is Candice. I'll come find you tomorrow for your work assignments.\" she says and lets herself out. You walk into the bedroom and lay your bag at the foot of your bed and lay down on it and letting out a huge sigh, wondering what to do with yourself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was a bit taller than rooms usually are, with a sofa face an entertainment system against the wall to the bedroom. Behind it was the kitchen, with a table and one chair, though there was controls for adding more. Turning around, you realize \"kitchen\" may have been a bit generous, it was simply a bar for the food materializer. It was stylish enough, however, and you get some dinner from it and eat it in silence. You really were not used to having such nice personal quarters. You felt like a king.

After closing, a feminine synthetic voice came over the intercom, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This area is restricted to Senior Research Staff only, please present biological credentials.\" A panel lights up, prompting for a palm scan. You quickly press your hand against it. \"Welcome, Engineer Zambac.\" the voice says. The lights cut on, and you see the clean and white aesthetic has been replaced with darker colors, though it's just as clean. Moving forward slightly shakily, you wander down the hall, blacked out windows on either side. Walking close with your chip in hand, they give maintenance reports. Most say they are empty or mothballed. On the verge of losing interest and leaving, the last room pings that it needs maintenance of the interior door access. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well give it a look, probably just some dust on the sensor.\" You open the door and notice the room's light is on. Suddenly, you're tackled onto the ground by something. You struggle against it, it seems frail and weak, at least compared to you. Quickly overpowering it, you pin it to the ground and straddle it, which is when you finally focus on what you assailant is. It has four eyes on it's face, and no nose. Four solid blue almond shaped eyes stare back at you, with fear and hope. Luscious lips adorn the lower portion of the face. Long silky purple hair accented her light blue skin. A deep blue tongue snakes between it's lips and it attempts to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Che-cala?\" it says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what?\" you say, you notice a smell, a sweet smell that makes you relax and feel ... aroused. It's long, pointed ears twitch a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name?\" it tried again<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Michael. Wh-what's yours?\" you feel yourself loosen your grip on it's wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Xulai.\" it speaks with a feminine tone. \"You help? Me trap room.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, depends ... what do you want me to do?\" you relax enough for it to slink it's arms out from your grip and slide out from under you, it then sits up a foot or two away and looks at you. You notice it has a body analogous to a human female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hungry. Very long no food.\" it points to it's mouth and lets it's tongue slink out lazily, it's a very alluring display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you eat?\" you feel your arousal build somewhat, which was strange as she was definitely below the weight class of girls you normally went for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I eat ...\" it's ears twitch for a few moments as it concentrates, \"I eat ... seed? You seed?\"  you blush, this could not be real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst of all, you've met your first <i>real</i> alien, face to face, skin to skin. It appears to be some super sexy female, though thin for your tastes. On top of all that, it's asking for your <u><i>seed</i></u>. You look down and see your are very erect in your uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" you get a bit defensive again, your mind clearing of whatever pheromone it's putting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. You food no good. Need you seed. Feed on seed only. Others no understand. Please Understand.\" it pleaded, moving onto all fours and crawling close to you. It's eyes seemed a bit mesmerizing. Your mind fuzzes a little, but you maintain control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, just, uh,\" you sit back and fumble with your belt and fly, quickly freeing your erection. \"Just, be ... careful?\" you see an almost predatory look in it's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No want hurt, just feed.\" she smiles and crawls up to you, liking the head of your cock, sending shivers across your whole body. She smiles at it and then crawls up, cradles your head and plants her plush lips against yours. Her tongue snakes in, which yours attempts to do the same, but suddenly, you feel something slide out of her tongue as it snakes down to your throat. It feels small and round as it drops into your stomach. You struggle and push it off of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that??\" you cough and sputter, incredibly hard as her pheromones pour over you, your heart rate dropping back to resting very rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help feed!\" she says as if nothing is wrong, which soothes you even further, she crawls back over to you and looks down at your crotch excitedly. You look down as well, feeling a uncomfortable warmth spread over you as well as a painful pressure build in your loins. Your dick reddens and starts to swell larger it goes from it's modest six inches up to ten inches, Xulai licks her lips as your balls swell up to the size of golf balls. \"You feed very good.\" she says as she takes your swollen member into it's mouth. It's beyond any pleasure you've felt before. You moan and gasp as you feel your member harden just a bit more. Almost before you can process what's happened to you, you feel your balls tense, Xulai's tongue slinks out and caresses them. The pressure builds and the eruption begins. It's cheeks bulge as the torrents pump out. You feel almost on the verge of a sensory overload from it. It gulps it down ravenously, she wasn't kidding about how hungry she was. Your orgasm finishes and it lifts it's head off of your cock, with an audible pop and the head leaves her soft lips. \"You feed very much!\" it says, licking it's lips one final time, before entering a relaxed state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hazily sit up and look at it. It looks much softer than before, with soft curves forming, making it no longer look like skin and bones. Small breasts hang from it's chest and it now looks small much less bony than before. Skinny, rather than Anorexic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, come back soon.\" it says, before entering a trance-like state. You fumble again with your clothing, stuffing your over-sized genitals into your pants and leaving the cell, noting the damage to the inside of the door, as if it had tried to force it's way out. You feel your meat shift and move as you walk, still rather sensitive. The trip back to your room is much different, women seem to take more notice of you, and sit closer to you on the tram or walk closer in the halls. You lock your door as you enter your apartment, and try to process what happened.</span></div></div>",

He and the 5 other members of the delegation was just minutes away from landing at the space port of the Eraxi homeworld, Eraxus. The Eraxi was a humanoid race, and not so unlike humans. They had the same basic, so it was no need for any special accommodations like air suits or expensive habit dome to live in. To make time go faster Sam went over what he knew about the Eraxi in his head. They breath air and drink water, similar food, at times remarkably like Indian food. wealthy, from decades of surplus production of food for export to other races.

Nature and animal life remarkably similar to earth.<br>\r\nA red light began to flash, signaling that they were just seconds away from docking.<br>\r\nThe Eraxus space port was a large space station going in orbit around the largest of Eraxus three moons.

The Eraxi was waiting for them. Sam took in the sight, tall human like beings.

The ship was captained by Athena Conners, a disciplined, hardworking but sweet, 27 year old woman with a desire to uncover the mysterious. Athena had long red hair which she fashioned in a pony tail and had a curvy but trim body. She weighed 125 pounds was 5ft5in and was ostensibly busty which she proudly flaunted inspite of her fairly stern demeanor. Athena wears her uniform by displaying cleavage while keeping her skirt short. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena's crew differs from others, for her crew is entirely female because she doesn't want any distractions on her ship. All assistants, janitors, mechanics, pilots, astronauts, and scientists are women though some are alien but look human enough to avoid problems. Athena would scour the vast emptiness of space in search of locating new planets or other space interests. Once she found something she would send some ladies down there to scout the alien world and document it. Athena would than report the new discovery to the federation. Athena had developed an impressive reputation and had earned praise amid other figures in the federation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier Athena had sent down a team to investigate an uncovered planet she recently found and was currently waiting for their return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Conners the team is returning.\" informed a woman behind a monitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent beam them up.\" ordered Athena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever Athena was surprised as the team appeared before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the-\" Athena uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team that stood before her were bulging out of their uniforms. Bellies hung out, boobs spilled out, limbs were riddled with flab, and buttocks were wobbling. Their uniforms were torn and barely held their fat physiques. What alarmed Athena was that this same team earlier had left with skinny figures but now only hours later had gained a frightening amount of weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the things Athena prided herself on was the health of her crew.  Athena had kept her crew in shape enforcing mandatory exercises and routine body inspections. Athena regulated all nourishment on her ship thus forcing a healthy diet upon all ladies and forbid junk food on her ship. Everyday Athena orchestrated an hour of group exercise led by herself. Ensuring her success, Athena implemented a weekly inspection were the ladies had to visit the doctor, strip down to their bra and panties and get measured and weighed.

Felids have a similar anatomy to humans but with several key differences, notably their cat like eyes, ears, and tail. They are much more agile than other races and are primarily employed for active jobs, although that doesn't mean they don't do other jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty is 18 years old and 5'6, he has short black hair, yellow eyes, black cat ears, and a long black cat tail. He is 130lbs with pale skin and has a lean healthy body, however he has a rather plump bottom, hefty thighs, and round hips which gives him a rather feminine look, much to his annoyance. His feminine body shape has been a problem for him as long as Koty remembers, with many people making fun of him, so he wears baggy clothing that conceals his body shape. Koty is a nice person all around, but is pretty  lazy when bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty used to live on the Felid home world with his family, but his desire to see new and interesting places led him to volunteer to become a colonist. 5 months later, Koty set out on a starship with his fellow colonists and were placed on the newly discovered planet, Graisse. The colony consists of at least 32 different people and that consist of humans and felids. The colony isn't much different than living in a small town, with everyone getting there own living quarters, the only thing thats different is that every week someone is sent out of the colony to explore a small area of the planet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe begin with...</span></div></div>",

He has been gone for 6 days and has one more day before he needs to be back, he's currently exploring the plains to the east of the colony. His trip out of the colony has been uneventful to say the least, having not found anything of significance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar into the plains, we find Koty, clad in a skin-tight blue suit, sitting against a large rock<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd I have to get stuck with the plains, The others got to go to deserts, mountains, and even a tundra, but I got the plains.\" Koty said as he angrily flicks his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then his communicator starts to go off on his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Koty, this is Eva. I was ordered to check up on you, how is your trip coming along?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva is a Felid, like Koty, but has long red hair and fur, and bright green eyes. Eva works in the command center so she can get updates on the colonists in the field, she can also inform them if theres something of interest in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Eva. It's going okay... I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just bored out here, I've been out and exploring for six days and haven't found anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well finding nothing is good too. It means that the area is safe and we can start placing people there to colonize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess thats alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See it isn't so bad out there...oh before I go, how's your suit fitting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty then tenses up as soon as Eva asked him about his suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what are talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm talking about how you had trouble fitting into your field suit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah that...it fits fine.\" Koty said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure, because I could get you a bigger one if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No really I'm fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you say so. Eva out.\" And with a buzz from the communicator, Eva was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god she could only see above my neck.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Koty's field suit fits well from his waist up, anything below the waist really stretches the suit to its limit. Koty has an unnaturally large lower half for a male, with a plump ass that jiggles when he walks, large fleshy hips, and thick thighs. Koty would've liked a bigger suit, but he would never admit it ,even though it creaks and groans every time he bends overs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I should keep moving. Who knows, I might find something cool.\" Koty said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour or so of roaming the plains, Koty finally finds some interesting. He finds...</span></div></div>",

I'm just going to head back to the colony.\" Koty said, defeated<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Koty said that though, he caught a glimmer of something just over a large hill. Filled with a new resolve, he bounds towards whatever is over the hill<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" Was all Koty could say for what he saw<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the hill laid a large, derelict space ship. The ship appears to have been there for several years, with plant life overgrowing most of the ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's see if I can get in there!\" Koty said with a grin and a spark in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty begins by looking around the ship for any openings or holes in the ship. Luckily there was a access panel linked to one of the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the ship was almost as bad as the exterior, with broken machinery everywhere and mysterious liquids on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh uh Eva, you read me?\" Koty said, speaking into his communicator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Loud and clear Koty, ready to be picked up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I found an old ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Oh my god Koty, that's amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have an extraction team there soon. Why don't you keep looking around until they get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it Eva, I'll see you back at the colony soon. Koty out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty then does as Eva said and goes deeper into the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the ship looks similar to the room Koty entered, except for the occasional skittering animal...but one room was different. Koty eventually came across an ominous door. The door appears to be heavily armored and with an odd set of symbols, but one symbol stood out. In the middle of the door is a circular shape with 5 smaller circles around it and one long line going from one circle then all the way up the door to a large shape with many smaller geometric lines covering it. Koty doesn't know why, but he's getting an odd feeling from this door. The door feels like tempting him to open the door, to see what's on the other side, but what if there something dangerous. Koty then gives in and opens the door, against his better judgment <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room is incredibly large, probably making up a third of the ship, and appears to be completely untouched from the years of degradation. The room is also pretty barren, with absolutely nothing in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...I thought there'd be something in here.\" Koty said in a disappointed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot feeling so cautious anymore, Koty stupidly begins to meander around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe I guess I didn't need to be so scared.\" Koty said as he reached the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Koty reached the center, a sky blue light paralyzed him in place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what the hell?!\" Koty said as he tried his best to get free, but it's no use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty then begins to float up into the air, and stops when he's 5 feet off the ground. Koty then begins to hear a loud mechanical sound above him. When he looks up, the whole ceiling had opens up to reveal a massive machine with two large tanks, one filled with red liquid and another with blue liquid. When the machine stops it's descent, it then reveals a long clear tube from a hatch in the front...the tube then begins to slowly work it way towards Koty's mouth. No matter how hard he tries, Koty can't move his head away from the tube and can only watch as it slowly enters his mouth. After a few seconds, the machine starts up again and begins to fill the tube in Koty's mouth with...</span></div></div>",

I have to do something.\" Koty thought to himself, but struggling only causes more pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 5 minutes, the tank finally runs dry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant ball that was Koty's belly has completely disappeared, only leaving a giant hole in his suit.

As the red liquid continues to pump, Koty began to feel more comfortable with the warmth emanating from inside himself. Koty couldn't keep his eyes open for much longer, and he eventually drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Koty sleeps, he feels so warm and cuddly like as if he being covered by a silky blanket.

His hips have grown larger too, now jiggling wildly with in tandem with his ass anytime he moves. His thighs now constantly push against one another giving him a prominent waddle and are slightly wider than his waist. His belly, while small compared to his lower body, was still quite large and hung in front of his groin. He also has small flabby moobs, but were still big enough to cup in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoty continued to stare at his much fatter body in the mirror, pinching his flabby belly to see if this is a dream...but alas it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koty? what're you doing?\" A feminine voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Koty turned around to see who was talking too him and was shocked to see Eva in a red field suit. Koty only ever saw above her shoulders and he would've said she was cute with long red hair and bright green eyes, but her body brought her from cute, to down right gorgeous! Eva's body was perfectly proportioned, with modest D-cup breasts, a slim waist, and shapely hips. As he gawked at Eva's rather attractive build, Koty realized that he was  half naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eva, why are here?!?\" Koty said blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I came to see how you were doing.\" Eva said with a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm so fat!\" Koty said grabbing his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just glad your up and walking again. We thought you weren't going to wake back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...how long have I been asleep?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...5 days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I was in a coma for 5 days. But how'd I gain weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe I can answer that.\" A voice said from behind Eva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Doctor I didn't realize you were here!\" Eva said to a short older male. He was about four feet tall and had a large white beard and glasses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite alright, but back to Koty's question. You see, Koty, that room you stumbled into on that ship was a...how do I put this...a fertility room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was used on the women of that race to help populate. It increased their weight and and fluid production considerable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means your going to get very fat, very quickly. As for fluid production, we don't know. This has never happened to a male before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this has happened before? That means you can cure me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never said I could cure you, Koty, But yes this has happened before...but only to females. We think the room activated because it scanned you as female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well why'd it do that? I'm as much of a guy as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we hypothesize that it might've been because of your...generous lower region.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Koty, you had a...well...plump bottom half that made you look rather feminine. Please understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, not only has my ass got me picked...now it got me fat!\" Koty said angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no worries Koty, me and Eva are working on a way to fix you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but be careful. Your going to keep growing until we find a cure or it wears off, and somethings can cause you to grow faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well eating makes you bigger, but you have to eat...but avoid human food! It doesn't react well with the serum and can cause...explosive effects\" The Doctor said grimly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh...but I'm so big, how will I get around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you asked.

Sarkontamunans resemble humans except they have three eyes instead of two, and their skin tone ranges from red to gray. Like Earth, Sarkontamuna is plagued by political strife as the lords and ladies of each country divide the planet rather trying to unify it.

Suriregans resemble Hulked out humans, ironically people from Earth are dumbfounded how male Suriregans resemble a famous comic book icon. However, Suriregans have four arms instead of two, they come in a wide array of skin tones that are normally not found on Earth, and they don't face the problems that Sarkontamunans often face with their government. The main reason Surgirega doesn't have this problem is due to having a functional monarchy. Unlike traditional monarchies the monarch to be must win the title in a wrestling match or be handed the title through extraordinary military service.

One reason is that a wrestling tournament to choose a new emperor only occurred every 40 years. The second reason was due to his limited time that he spent serving in the military.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shira huffed for the umpteenth time since she arrived in orbit, her nostrils flaring. It was supposed to be a simple delivery job of some heavy farm machinery, but what the contract hadn\u2019t mentioned was the destination was some fringe world mired in so much bureaucracy that any ships arriving tended to have to wait half a galactic standard day or more before even landing, and then there was the inspections, customs, and on and on. The Xaithan should have known something was up with how much was being paid for the job, but her unease was outweighed by her desire to want to eat this month as well as getting some repairs done to her ship \u2013 loosely translated as <i>The Red Arrow</i> \u2013 that some recent inspectors had been hounding her about, citing public safety hazards and other regulations. Shira knew exactly how much she could push her ship though, knowing it inside and out after personally restoring and rebuilding much of what a used to be a ship that was considered by many useless for even parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny change, yet?\u201d Shira called out into the still and quiet bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, captain, we are still being told to hold position,\u201d a steady feminine voice said from the overhead speakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira still grinned slightly whenever she heard herself being called \u201ccaptain\u201d. It was technically true, and she often slipped it into conversation usually as a pick-up line, but it rang a bit hollow considering that it was often just her forming the entire crew on the <i>Arrow</i>, except for a few special cases that might require a specialist for containment of the cargo or something. The only exception was Shira\u2019s personal AI, Nova, a simple but effective artificial intelligence that Shira had cobbled together out of spare parts. While Nova was many magnitudes less powerful than similar government or military AIs, she was perfectly capable of running the more mundane aspects of both the <i>Arrow</i> and Shira\u2019s life: sensors, repeating hails, scheduling, and so on. The little AI also helped keep Shira sane on the long interstellar journeys, just as someone to talk to, even if she was just a somewhat intelligent computer system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira shifted in her chair and huffed again; one arm propped her head up, leaning on an armrest, two more were keeping busy with a puzzle cube that she had picked up a bazaar on one of her stops recently, while the last was trying to sooth her stomach which continued to voice its displeasure with not being fed yet. Shira hailed from one of the Northern provinces of Xocha, specifically one that didn\u2019t put quite as much focus on a female Xaithan\u2019s weight compared to some of the other regions of her homeworld, but it still played a part. Shira had always been a misfit growing up though, so while she could easily be considered fat by the majority of species out in the galaxy, she was downright skeletal compared to the majority of her own species\u2019 women. Her own mother was barely able to walk without assistance, and her younger sister (only by two years as she liked to remind anyone who would listen) looked to be well on her way to matching or beating their mother\u2019s records. In the states where it was more of a requirement, young Xaithan women were often fattened nearly to if not past immobility by the time they were of marriageable age, and most did it with glee. Shira hadn\u2019t quite taken to the prospect with the same zeal, wanting to explore the galaxy beyond and see strange new worlds and the people that inhabited them. Perhaps in time, she might consider settling down and letting her instincts take more control till she was a bloated ball of blubber, but for now she was content to pilot her ship throughout the galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira tossed the cube away in annoyance, mostly with the planetary travel authority rather than the puzzle cube which was proving spectacularly easy to the Xaithan, and watched the puzzle tumble slowly through the microgravity. A whirl of photons appeared beside her chair, and as it resolved, Nova appeared in her standard appearance of a small mote of light with some little fluttering wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can head back and get something to eat if you wish, captain. I will notify you if we are ever cleared to land.\u201d Nova said in her soft tones, a slight chuckle at her little joke came as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I would rather be here so we can get moving whenever or if we can,\u201d Shira responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an annoyed grunt, the Xaithan unclipped the harness holding her down and, with the tiniest of nudges, drifted to the forward viewport, stopping with the help of a slight touch of a hand to the deckhead above. The view outside was still what Shira had been seeing for the past while: ships of all sizes, ranging from smaller family-style planet skippers to massive cargo freighter ships that made the <i>Arrow</i> look like a single person ship in comparison (those giant ships would have to dock and offload at one of the orbital stations rather than landing), all orbiting a rather typical inhabited world below. Only a few ships had moved out of this high orbit holding pattern since she had arrived, though more than number that had been added in the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira now turned her gaze to the ghostly reflection of herself in the glossy panel. She scowled a bit as she saw how close her clothes were getting to being ill fitting across her rotund frame; something else she would have to be purchasing soon. Two of her hands were put to use finger-combing the thick curls of black hair sprouting from her head, while a third itched the band of shorter softer hair going down her spine and out across the top of her muscular tail. Shira ended up getting a little lost in rubbing several of her hands across her soft and deep-blue scales to try and stimulate her blood flow to keep herself awake, that she almost missed the soft chiming notification of an incoming message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShira, did you hear me? There is a hail coming in,\u201d Nova announced, her holographic avatar zipping up to bob in front of Shira\u2019s face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I heard you. Put it through.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Your progress to the destination will be monitored, and any deviation from the flight path will be met with repercussions,\u201d said the droll audio only broadcast, which clicked off without even signing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira pushed off of the deckhead and used her wings just a bit to direct herself just a bit so that she drifted right into her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter strapping in, she glanced over at Nova who responded without being asked, \u201cCoordinates received, confirming flight path and applying overlay.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the little computer spoke, a holographic HUD appeared in the viewport, highlighting nearby obstacles, as well as displaying a path of floating green squares denoting the route. Satisfied with the set-up, Shira keyed in the start-up sequence, feeling the slight tremor as the core spun up. That mild shaking increased as she hit the throttle, a constant reassuring rumble that she could feel in her back teeth. There was a subtle pressure pushing her into the seat as the <i>Arrow</i> darted through the crowd of other ships drifting before slipping out of orbit and into the atmosphere below. Now gravity was starting to take hold, the noise of the engines shifting as they now had to keep the ship in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air lanes proved to be full of traffic once in the atmosphere, but the <i>Arrow</i> was light and agile enough that Shira had no problem navigating to the port at the coordinates. Once there, she landed with barely a thump, before going through the unloading process. The Trox dockmaster tried to be surly, and it might have succeeded \u2013 he was exceptionally tall and muscular for a Trox \u2013 except for the fact that the average Trox only stood three feet tall. This particular fine example stood probably a hair over four feet tall, but Shira stood just short of nine feet tall\u2014about two shriks in her species\u2019 units of measurement. He also seemed a bit unnerved by which pair of eyes to look at, something that almost always proved troubling to most binocular species that she had encountered so far. It probably didn\u2019t help that xaithan could move each of the two pairs could independently of the other so she could look at two things at the same time with no trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to give her grief over the delay in the shipment as well as how the containers had been ordered in the bay, but she told him to take it up with the workers at the <i>Nal Gate</i> station that had put the containers in like that, as well as the orbital traffic controllers that kept everything so slowed down. The Trox sputtered and tried another angle, but Shira mostly ignored him and went back to supervising the offloading. With that finished, she checked in with the transportation company she worked with, confirmed that her credits had been transferred, and noted that she had even received a bonus for completing the job earlier than expected\u2014despite what the dockmaster had tried to blame her for. With an added spring in her step, Shira locked up her ship and radioed Nora to say that she was heading out since there were no other jobs on her plate yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChrido was a more arid world that Shira was used to, but the slightly below average gravity was a welcome change from the several high-gravity worlds that she had been to recently. The space port was welcoming as well \u2013 once you got into it \u2013 and provided a number of services for those plying the local space lanes. All of that traffic inevitably attracted the wrong sort of people as well, so Shira checked that her plasma blasters were still clipped to her hips; she also much more discreetly checked the less-than-legal disruptor hand cannons were holstered beneath her vest and under her second pair of arms. The second set of weapons weren\u2019t something that she had to often use, but when she did, she was always extremely glad she had them\u2014they cut through personal energy shields like almost as well as military grade weapons. She wasn\u2019t planning on getting into any trouble anyways, but it always paid to be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick check on the local datanet pointed her to a local tavern that was suited to species like her own, just the place to wet her whistle as well maybe seeing about a new job. She didn\u2019t want to stumble into a bar for some of the more exotic species out in this region of the galaxy; early on in her life away from her home, she went to the wrong place and ended up horribly sick and nearly passing out from the fumes that some species thrived in, but were toxic to most others. Night was starting to fall when she arrived at \u201cDroka\u2019s Place\u201d. Inside a number of people from across the galaxy, no other xaithans though but that wasn\u2019t odd at all. There were even a few Alliance troopers in the center, celebrating their shore leave from the looks of things. Walking up to the bar, she motioned towards the bartender \u2013 Droka presumably \u2013 and he poured and slid a tall glass her way; it contained a local brew, pale blue with a thin mist pouring over the edge of the glass. From what she had read, it was not something to be sipped and savored, more tipped and gulped, so she did so, though it felt like she had swallowed a blaster bolt from how it burned her throat on the way down. She hissed through her teeth slightly but ordered another. As she readied herself for the second slug, she felt as if someone was watching her. A casual glance one way then the other showed no one paying any particular attention to her, some had starred a bit when she first came in, but most had never seen a xaithan, so she had gotten used to that reaction quickly, this felt different though. Then she saw her watcher, across the room and beyond the Alliance soldiers, they were almost hidden in the shadows in the back corner, but there was no mistaking the glint of the sparse light off of those eyes pointed straight at her.</span></div></div>",

Before we get to deciding who she is, perhaps we could take a moment to decide what kind of station she will be serving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Is this a research station?</b> Humanity is a relatively recent addition to the Galactic community, but has proven to be quite ingenious. Dangerously so, many believe, but it hasn't stopped many species from establishing embassies and research treaties with this oft-times disturbing species. Is the MC a brave, or perhaps nervous, scientist heading for such an opportunity? Or is she merely a functionary, there to enable the facility to continue to function and the research team to conduct their work without worrying about such matters as food?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Is this a diplomatic outpost?</b> Humanity entered the stars at a rather terrible time, often referred to as the War in Heaven. Two of the great empires of old had begun a Galaxy spanning conflict, with the victor claiming the whole of inhabited space as their prize. However, neither race had expected the rise of the Earthlings. Even after their homeworld was enslaved, the Humans continued to fight back with a tenacity none had been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefeat, casualties, enslavement, nothing seemed to end the human will to be masters of their own destiny. As their partisans bled their enemies white, the free worlds constructed massive fleets, bending their every ounce of brilliance and cruel ingenuity to developing an unstoppable force. It took three generations (by human measurements), but at long last the Earthlings reclaimed their home and shattered the Empires of Old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the one hand, the Galaxy breathed a sigh of relief, as a hundred species no longer lived in fear. On the other, the millennia old order has ended, and the universe stands on the edge of an unknown future. Many fear the Earthlings will install themselves as the new overlords of inhabited space, while others fear they won't. Then what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Earthlings first move in the wake of their shocking victory was a rather unorthodox one. They constructed Space Station 42, a sprawling monolith capable of supporting a population in the millions. They then invited all species able to do so to send ambassadors and establish embassies. They claim the aim is peaceful coexistence, but who knows what these maniacs truly have in mind?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs the MC one such ambassador? Or perhaps she's an aide, or minor functionary? Perhaps a reporter, eager to find a story to wow her fans back home? Or maybe she's just a general nobody, hoping to make her way in this strange new world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Is this a trade outpost?</b> The worlds of the Galaxy are loaded with many lavish resources and untold treasures, but the distribution is anything but even. Many species rely on things which are exceedingly rare HERE, but very common over THERE. And if one group's trash is another group's gold?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's where the real money can be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolden-Dorff Dressler understands this simple truth better then anyone. Arguably the most successful corporation in the Galaxy, they were the ones who developed a cost-effective form of planetary terraforming, what is often referred to as a Shake-and-Bake colony. They've pioneered new mining practices, efficient FTL technology, established the Util as <i>the</i> Galactic currency, and are largely responsible for humanity's expansion across the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey've also been accused of starting proxy wars, debt slavery, chattel slavery, occasional genocide, extremely exploitative work and environmental practices, and talking on their cell phones while in a movie theatre. They of course deny all such accusations, and such is their wealth and power in human space that the Federation government refuses any calls to investigate the monolithic corporate giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, many worlds and systems are owned outright by the corporation, and the bulk of the Federation's Utils and raw resources are owned by either WDD or a subsidiary, but the real jewel in the Board's crown is their massive and complex network of trade outposts. Lying on the nexus points of the slip stream tunnels and equipped with large merchant fleets, nearly every good in human space is transported on a WDD vessel, for a fee of course. As befitting their importance, the stations are lavishly appointed, and the posts on board are high paying and fiercely contested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Space Station 42 is not one such station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n42 sits at the entrance of the dark nebula known simply as Nowhere. The nebula proved to simultaneously be shockingly rich in intelligent life and distressingly bare in any valuable resources. Public outcry against WDD's vile business practices, whether true or not, has at last forced the glacial Federation congress to issue a law forbidding the corporation's direct interference with the other intelligent races of the Galaxy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis has left Space Station 42 in a bit of a rough spot, as it represents a considerable investment with no real means of making a return on it. What few resources are within reach are now off limits in the wake of the new law, and there aren't many opportunities for expansion in the area. Many in the corp are calling for the potential money sink to be shut down, while others wish to keep the facility running even at a small profit, at least until the company recoups its investment. So far, there are no voices saying that this backwater can be made profitable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr is there one?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the MC is the new station master, getting her foot in the door by accepting the post no one wanted, eager to prove she can bring this place back in the black? Or maybe she's lower down the corporate ladder? IT? Security? A mechanic, perhaps? Or maybe an independent, opening a small business on the station's docking ring? The only limit is your imagination, after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, which is it?</span></div></div>",

For ease of understanding, all measurements of age, height and weight will be in common human terms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Chel Nat'yochtli</b><br>\r\n<i>Species: Naxian<br>\r\nStation Position: Mechanical Department, Foreman<br>\r\n6 adult years, long green \"hair\", 5'9\" tall, 120 pounds</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">The Naxians are an amphibious species which entered the galaxy around the same time as humanity. As a species, they are very invested in their accomplishments, often to an unhealthy degree. This path was laid for them by the Great Paragon, Anarathustra, the Bridge Maker. By definition, they see a life with no accomplishments as inherently meaningless and wasteful, if not outright destructive to society as a whole. The Path even establishes minimums with regards to quantity and quality of accomplishments over time, and committing suicide to maintain personal honour after failing to meet your minimums is quite common.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWDD, as you might imagine, found the Naxians to be fairly malleable to the corporate mindset. Not only were they fanatically devoted to their personal success and the success of the company, their high birth rate meant that the corp was never lacking for dedicated employees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel is a little unusual amongst her species. She is technically a failure, never truly excelling at school and failing to meet any of the Path's minimums. Most infuriating for her fellow Naxians, she adamantly refused to save her honour via death. Estranged from the bulk of her family, she took this job on Space Station 42 in order to support herself while trying to figure out what she's truly passionate about. Maintenance of slip stream drives was one of the very few activities in which she excelled, so she was promoted to foreman despite her lack of experience, given the lack of anyone else fit for the position on this godforsaken backwater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChel has light blue skin, with an assortment of pink spots which change shape according to her mood. Her general body form is fairly humanoid, with only a handful of minor differences. Her hair, however, is not actually hair. It is in fact a symbiotic plant, which can supplement her caloric intake via photosynthesis. Her skin, like earth amphibians, is permeable, and she is vulnerable to absorbing chemicals and the like through her living skin layer.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Xul</b><br>\r\n<i>Species: Hunniq<br>\r\nStation Position: Station Master<br>\r\n39 years, Hairless, 6'8\", 265 lbs.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"right\">Many in her Clan said she was mad to ask for this post, but Xul didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hunniq race is, for the most part, only concerned with survival. Their homeworld is the desert planet Hullack. Basic resources like water are extremely scarce, and inter-clan raids and skirmishes were a daily fact of life. It is perhaps Hullack's tough conditions which led to the reptilian species rather low birthrate and high ratio of males to females. To take Xul as an example, her mother had five husbands and six children, of which Xul was one of only two girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you might imagine, there is quite a strong push in their society to take many mates (the concept of marriage being rather foreign to them), so Xul deciding to wait was not well received. Truthfully, she does wish to have a family someday, but she doesn't feel she needs to sacrifice her personal success in order to do so. She hasn't told her mother, but she intends to establish her first Warren-bond once she succeeds at bringing Station 42 into profit, though she merely selected someone she was fond of (the concept of love also being a foreign concept) rather then following tradition and forcing bloody contests between her suitors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike most Hunniq, she is a towering and intimidating specimen. Females tend to be 30-45% larger then males, and far more muscular, and Xul is no exception. Her skin is covered with armoured scales like gravel, and her bald head is crested with six towering, curly horns. The Hunniq are exothermic, and her suits inevitably have an environmental mesh to adjust her temperature as needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is quite close with her Clan despite their differences. She exchanges messages constantly with her beloved younger sister, Zhul. She also frequently communicates with her mother, though the two fight more often then not, Khul simply refusing to understand why her elder daughter might not want to merely lord over her own warband. Despite this, it is quite rare that the two will outright refuse to message one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA final note of the Hunniq species is that they principally communicate via scent. This led to some severe misunderstandings during first contact, with the humans assuming the Hunniq were totally unintelligent. By their standards, Xul is very chatty and she understands better then most Hunniq the importance of verbal communication. The fact that most species consider Hunniq pheromones to be rather foul smelling is another drawback.</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Left blank for any other ideas you may have.</b></span></div></div>",
