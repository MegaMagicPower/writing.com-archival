Behind him, Rose gave a smile just shy of smug. Her needles dangled loosely in her hands, pulsing with the dark energy she had grown so familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's within your abilities, isn't it? Or have I overestimated the powers of a coolkid. Perhaps I overestimated your coolness itself, bedazzled by nought but a mere facade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave didn't answer that. Rose knew she couldn't get a rise out of him, not like that. It was one of the reasons she loved him so dearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't go messing in your grimdark bookishness, do I?\" he retorted after a moment. \"The thing is, I don't remember an extra Rose running around. That much snark would produce a snark black hole. Freaking sarcasm particles flying everywhere and all that pseudoscience shit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A snark singularity? Would it be orbited by contemptuous comets? Is passive-aggressive simply the superposition of the two states?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of land always rains anyway?\" Dave asked, kicking at the white sand. \"Needs more gears and lava. That's badass. This is, like, sissy land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact of the matter is that I either covered my tracks well enough to maintain causality, or I create a divergent timeline. In which case we've already effectively diverted, since you are going to take me back. So there's no need to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave appeared to be looking down, but it was hard to tell - just the slightest cock of his head. \"Yeah, okay.\" he said. A pair of turntables appeared in midair, and he laid his hands over them. Rose stepped in close, and gave another close-lipped smile. Dave stayed silent, still, and from this angle Rose could see his eyes were on the horizon, as if he was elsewhere even now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, they were back in time. To near the very beginning of the game - they weren't sure how the timestream of skaia related to that of Earth's, but Dave wasn't willing to bring her back before hand, muttering something about \"keeping it sane\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Dave.\" Rose said, reaching up and laying a hand on his shoulder. He turned to her, and for once, lowered his glasses. Looking him straight in the eyes was so strange, so unexpected, that even Rose had to pause, her mind going still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of trouble.\" he said. He was gone in a flash. Rose hadn't even seen him move, let alone the turntables. She smiled. He was sweet - but it was better that he wasn't around for this. Rose knew, one way or another, that her time could well come to a close soon. This could be an alternate timeline, but even if it wasn't, she could die trying to cause the scratch, or succeed only to not avoid the \"reset\" it would provide....so Rose wanted a day to herself. A last day, like a death row inmate getting a last meal, where she could finally get what she had always wanted. She was by the turtles' library, hours ahead of her past self. There was a lot there on dark magic, and Rose could now study a very interesting book she had spotted but not, until now, had time for. A very interesting book about manipulating the body....</span></div></div>",

There was something about this place that seemed so appropriately alien, and the empty, vast hallways unnerved her. Somehow, her own steps seemed to echo against the blackness even though she could never hear anyone else coming. While for the most part she was growing used to their new teammates, it was still startling to round a corner and see a yellow-eyed being with razor-sharp teeth come out of nowhere. Some of the trolls scared her more than others....that 'Equius' fellow gave Jade such creeps she could barely stay in the same room as him, while on the other hand Karkat was just...well, adorable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed, feeling embarrassed despite being alone. For the first time, excepting some memo shenanigans, Jade got to see how Karkat interacted with everyone else. It had shown her an entire different side of him. His voice was raspy from yelling because he was keeping everyone in line. He was constantly angry because he was so incredibly dedicated to getting everything right. He was a leader. And surprisingly, when things got serious, he didn't get louder, he just got somehow more intense. It was a sight to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sight to see was the way Karkat calmed down. It was only around Kanaya. Jade had had troll romance explained to her, and didn't really understand it. She got the concept of a morail...kinda...but it seemed to imply that Karkat needed her in a way he didn't need anyone else. Jade wasn't fully ready to admit her feelings for Karkat, but *if* she liked him...would she even be enough for him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade just couldn't understand. That was one of the reasons she was wandering the halls - to try and clear her head from the commotion of the main lab area, where Karkat tried to keep order. Dave had had the right idea - almost as soon as they had made it here, he had disappeared off. Oddly, so had that red-eyed troll....Terezi....she creeped Jade out. Hopefully Dave was okay! Jade almost laughed at herself. Of course Dave was okay! He was Dave! He was waaaaay too cool to get into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Jade needed someone to talk to. She didn't feel she could go to Rose, who had never quite been the same after that..grimdark incident. Jade rounded a corner, looked up, and realized that if any, this may be her chance to understand this, as she saw...</span></div></div>",

Jade wasn't sure whether to giggle or roll her eyes. It seemed like Nepeta might legitimately think she was part cat or something, but she otherwise seemed perfectly with it. Peppy, and playful, Jade regretted dismissing Nepeta all those years, when she could have been talking to someone with such similar <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">fursuits</span> PURSUITS pursuits, yes, like....Jade was sure they would have had a lot in common. She took a step to approach Nepeta and the girl immediately turned around, big yellow eyes spotting Jade, something fluffy dangling from her cleft lip. Nepeta immediately spat it into her hand and hid it in one of the pockets of her massive green coat as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, heh heh....hello Jade! What a pawseant surprise! I was just....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Nepeta!\" Jade waved back, smiling weakly. She found Nepeta tended to be a little more awkward in real life....she heard that the troll girl had grown up pretty much in the wild, so that made sense. That was really something Jade could relate to, though it meant that neither of them really knew how to steer the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was...uh, on my way to lunch, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Jade interrupted. \"Would....you mind if I joined?\" With all that happened in such a short time frame, Jade was pretty sure she hadn't eaten since well before even getting the game. Nepeta was surprised by her request, then quickly looked ecstatic, her typical :3 smile forming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be purrrfect! Sure, follow me!\" Nepeta gestured her on. Jade gave a buck-tooth grin and gladly followed beside Nepeta. The troll girl practically skipped as she walked, and after a few steps even began to hum. She glanced over though, and as soon as she realized Jade had noticed, stopped and blushed the strangest shade of green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, boy Nepeta, you sure are nicer than most of the others.\" Jade said, not sure if it was more awkward to talk or stay silent. Nepeta kept blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're not really that meown...you just have to get to know them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess, but, like, doesn't Equius seem a little purrverse?\" Jade replied, not even noticing her pun. Nepeta picked up on it though. She laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just Equimouse.....oops! Don't let him know i called him that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, it's okay.\" Jade replied with a smile. Nepeta grinned back. They were shortly at a door, marked with the same sign that adorned Nepeta's shirt. In red...Jade was willing to ignore that, until she saw the other side of the room. Paintings, but mostly what looked like a graph or chart, all done in black and a blood red. Jade tried to keep smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad Sollux found the captcha codes to food!\" Nepeta giggled, heading over to what looked remarkably like a fridge. She pulled out a couple plates of...something purple and oozing, along with little blue lumps....Jade must have shown her distaste by accident, as Nepeta easily noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try a little...pweeeeeease...\" Nepeta's eyes went so large they barely fit on her head, and her little cleft lip quivered. It was like looking at a kitten, and Jade couldn't say no to such a face. She picked up one of the lumps and reluctantly popped it in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not...nng...bad...\" she said, finding it as chewy as taffy, but salty and slightly like mushrooms. Nepeta lit up, and joyfully guided Jade over to a small desk to use as a table.</span></div></div>",

Don't you miss anything from your home?\" Jade asked. Nepeta's face drooped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss Ponce- I miss my lusus.\" Nepeta said. Jade's heart went out to her. After having 'lusus' explained to her a while back, she immediately identified, as that was exactly what Bec had been for her. Sure, in a way, her grandfather had always been there, but still...just as Jade was about to say something, however, Nepeta perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still! I've had so much fun! And we almost won! Plus, I...got to make new friends.\" she looked away from Jade, but was smiling. Jade gave her big buck-tooth grin back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, thanks, Nepeta, I - oof...\" Jade interrupted herself as she felt her stomach twinge. She reached down and gave it a rub. It felt a little odd, but Jade just assumed it was from going so long without food. She hadn't noticed that it was a bit thicker than it had been. Nepeta gave Jade a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Jade said, continuing her meal. \"I guess I do feel lucky. I mean, I'm sorry all those people died...but it couldn't have been helped, right? I don't know, I don't understand that time stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, me neither!\" Nepeta replied, \"Purrsonally, I think all that time stuff is silly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, yeah....what was your title then?\" Jade asked, shifting to try to ease the discomfort she felt. Under the table, her belly was beginning to press against the belt of her skirt. Her otherwise loose clothing was hiding the way her legs were also starting to puff up, but she was also beginning to feel a tightness in her chest, particularly at her bra-strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Rogue of Heart.\" Nepeta said proudly. Jade blinked, processed this, and then-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's adorable!\" she said excitedly, clapping her hands. The noise hid the sound of her belt coming undone. Under her shirt, a now doughy belly was beginning to press outwards. Anyone less oblivious than Jade probably would have noticed, but her attention was elsewhere. Nepeta's cheeks went completely green at Jade's remark. It got Jade worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I, did I say something wrong? I'm sorry, I don't know troll culture, I didn't mean-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no..\" Nepeta said, shifting awkwardly. She looked pleased though. \"...no one's called me apawrable before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Jade asked, now beginning to plump up all around. \"That's silly.\" she popped another piece of food in her mouth.</span></div></div>",

First, she reached her belly far earlier than she expected to. Second, when she did, it gave way underneath her hand! Jade looked down, and it took a moment for her to register the sight in front of her. A squishy paunch was jutting out from her, forming a tent in her shirt and encroaching on her lap. It clicked in her brain that this was her fat, squishy belly, and she jumped up with a shriek. Before Nepeta could react, Jade was grabbing her doughy excess with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" she asked. \"What..what....the food!\" Jade looked wide-eyed at the half-eaten plate in front of her. Nepeta got up, her face making an 'o' of shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....oh my! Jade, I'm so sorry! I didn't know humans would....I....I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, oh my god...\" Jade said, not even paying Nepeta any attention. Forgetting herself, she began to basically feel herself up, testing in horror at the layers of padding on her. She looked easily forty pounds heavier, overall. The thirteen year old was already a bit well developed, but now overweight her boobs had gotten larger than many a full grown woman's, her hips were softer, her arms thicker and even her cheeks a bit rounder, increasing her already rodent-like look. The only thing holding up her skirt, she realized, was her fat backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! I can't believe this...\" Jade said. Nepeta approached her, looking like she wanted to help Jade somehow but couldn't decide what to do, her hands hanging in midair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorrrry! I didn't know - please don't be mad at me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade was panting, but beginning to come back to reality. She shook her head. \"I'm, I'm not mad at you. Oh, I'm so stupid! I just started eating alien food, from another universe! What was I thinking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad...\" Nepeta tried to comfort Jade. She had a pile of furs clearly designed as a bed, and tugged on Jade's arm in that direction. Jade acquiesced, feeling it'd be safer for her to sit down, with her skirt barely held up. She winced as she felt seams tighten here and there, threatening to snap. Jade whimpered, unsure what to do. Nepeta sat next to her, looking just as distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god....I gotta warn the others....no, no I can't let them see me...\" Jade said, conflicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...it's not that bad.\" Nepeta said. She prodded Jade's belly with a paw/hand, watching the way it wobbled. \"You're...just a little softer! It's really kinda neat! That's pawll! No one will mind, not when you explain.\" she prodded Jade again, and this time murred slightly to herself. Jade paused her fretting, and..</span></div></div>",

You'll get the best belly rubs now!\" Nepeta said, :3 smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-heh...right...\" Jade said. \"Uh, Nepeta...this is kinda weird, but do you really think, like...that you're a kitty?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! No, of course....not really, I mean, kinda, yes?\" Nepeta replied. She put on her grumpy face. \"Ponce de Leon raised me!

He was always there. In a way....I kinda felt like his pup. Oh maaan, that must sound so stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murr, no it doesn't! That makes purrfect sense!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?\" Jade asked. \"I don't know...I wondered some times though. Like what it'd be like...with those ears, or that coat, or...just to have my belly rubbed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want,\" Nepeta replied, her voice going quieter, \"I could show you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed even harder, but nodded. Nepeta tugged on her shoulders, and guided her down so that Jade's midsection lay over Nepeta's lap. She was tense at first, especially scared her new weight would hurt the small-seeming troll girl, but Nepeta said nothing. She reached out and pressed her fingertips against Jade's belly. She kneaded the excess flesh back and forth in a rhythmic motion, using enough pressure to move Jade's belly but not enough to force it where it shouldn't go. Jade relaxed with a sigh, and after a little more work let out a little coo at the way Nepeta was working over her belly. She smiled at Nepeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I had a tail, it'd be wagging.\" she said quietly, still embarrassed. Nepeta grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd make a cute puppy. And you're so fun to pet!\" she patted Jade's belly. Jade realized that her shirt had ridden up, exposing most of her bouncing tummy, but she didn't feel that embarrassed anymore. She was just getting petted, that was all! Oh, how she had longed for such contact...Jade let herself stay in a blissful state for a few minutes. She didn't want Nepeta to get tired, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Nepeta. I think I'm good now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heehee, you sure?\" Nepeta asked playfully, helping Jade up. Jade grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. You were good at that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I gave ponce belly rubs all the time! He wasn't so good at them though.\" she said with a smile. They shared a laugh. As they calmed down, a question arose to Jade's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you do it, though? Don't you get embarrassed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Nepeta said, giving an emphatic shake of her head. \"Your friends will still like you! As long as you be yourself, it's no purroblem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Nepeta said with a nod. \"Come on, unleash your inner puppy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade blushed, paused, and stayed still for a moment in thought. Then, too quickly for Nepeta to reach, she ducked in and licked at Nepeta's nose. She was back up in a flash. Nepeta was briefly shocked, but began to giggle. She leaned in, and her arms began to go around Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere, puppy...\"</span></div></div>",

She had only a moment to wonder what the girl was up to before she felt something warm and wet on her ear. Nepeta gave it a careful nibble, and Jade gasped, her arms instinctively flinching up around Nepeta, pausing before they touched her but only just. Nepeta bit down harder and introduced her tongue, and Jade shivered and gasped again. She now purposefully wrapped her arms around Nepeta, dragging the would-be kitten closer to her. Jade began to pant as Nepeta worked down to her earlobe and back up, her warm breath going in and out of Jade's ear, her tongue gliding along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, puppy?\" Nepeta teased into Jade's ear. \"Getting hot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade just whimpered, pressing against Nepeta's back with her fingertips, pleading for more. Nepeta got back to work, but this time as she nibbled on Jade's earlobe she went lower. Suddenly Nepeta's teeth were brushing against her neck as her moist lips pressed against her. She lapped the salty sweat from Jade's skin, then kissed it again, threatening to bite into Jade but not quite doing so. It was such an exciting pleasure, nearly pain but not quite so. Nepeta drew back to look at Jade face to face, seeing Jade's confused, pleading expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?\" Nepeta asked, sticking out her own tongue at Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no....but I've got yours..\" Jade replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-\" Nepeta didn't have time to finish as Jade pounced on her. She landed on her back on the bed-furs, Jade square on top of her. It was a lip-first tackle, Jade pressing her pale pink lips up against Nepeta's gray ones. Nepeta's cleft lip was like an open door for Jade's tongue, which invited itself inside, hunting around Nepeta's teeth until it found the troll girl's own tongue. Nepeta murred into Jade's mouth as their tongues met and introduced themselves to one another. Jade could feel Nepeta's purr throughout her body. It resonated in her new adipose, creating a wave of excitement that seemed to center in near her crotch. Jade was heavy enough and Nepeta small enough in stature that Jade was pinning her down, and apparently they were both enjoying it. The kiss finally came to an end, and Jade got on her hands and knees to give Nepeta some space. The troll girl grinned up at her, her lips covered in a mix of their saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I don't really know what I'm doing.\" Jade admitted. This rush of feelings was so new to her! She was just working up the courage to admit to herself there were people she <i>like</i> liked and here she was, on top of another girl, ready to do whatever her body was driving her to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I...\" Nepeta said. \"Just be yourself, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Yeah.\" Jade said with a grin. She pushed up her glasses and went back down on top of Nepeta.</span></div></div>",

She blinked and let go of Nepeta's mouth to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, was that you purring?\" she asked. Nepeta laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No silly, guess again.\" she said, patting the side of Jade's squidgy stomach with one hand. Just as she did so, Jade felt the rumble again, and this time realised it was coming from her own gut. She got up into a sitting position and looked down at herself. Nepeta got up as well, and laid a hand over Jade's belly, giving it a circular rub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess you're still hungry?\" she asked, nibbling on Jade's ear. Jade could barely think straight with Nepeta's warm breath on her, but murmured a yes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All this had to come somewhere...\" she figured after a moment. Nepeta nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...hee hee...want some more?\" she asked, nodding to the forgotten plates of food. Jade blushed. She could tell that Nepeta liked her new softness...honestly, she was beginning to enjoy it too....but she wasn't sure what she'd tell the others if she got much bigger. She wasn't sure what she was going to tell them now anyways!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I ought to have some regular food...uh, I mean human food...for now. In case there's any side effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murr...okay...\" Nepeta said, only sounding a little disappointed. \"Hey! I could alchemize some if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd do that?\" Jade asked. Nepeta nodded, so Jade got out her pictionary captchaloguer. Deciding that it really made no sense for her to worry about her figure, she went for broke and drew herself an ice cream sundae. Sure enough, the device picked up on it and gave her the ghost image, the code for which she passed to Nepeta.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Jade said as Nepeta dashed off. She grinned to herself, and began to look around Nepeta's room. The girl was cute, but so very wild. It was kinda exciting. Jade couldn't really make sense of the symbols on the wall, and wasn't sure what else to look at - she didn't want to pry after all. Her eyes rested on the food again. It was surprisingly tempting...she was already in deep, after all, and if they were going to have to figure out a way to reverse it, she might as well enjoy it while it lasted. That was the odd thing, how enjoyable it was, but Jade had stopped questioning her own tastes about the time she was swapping spit with an alien furry. But she knew it could be dangerous...and there was a difference between her chubbiness and whatever would happen if she kept eating. Maybe it'd be safer to wait....</span></div></div>",

Jade tried to keep her mind off of the food by turning her attention to the pile of furs arranged into a bed. Such majestic creatures these must have once belonged to...how had little Nepeta ever taken them down? Actually, it wasn't that hard to imagine. Jade had felt Nepeta's body, a little, when she had lain on top of her. Hidden behind that baggy clothing and ratty coat were cords of tightly wound muscle, solid as rock. Jade could only imagine what Nepeta would look like naked...she could, however, imagine what Nepeta looked like naked, and began to get a dreamy look on her face as her glasses fogged up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Nepeta burst into the room excitedly. She pulled out a captcha card (no, don't ask how) and before Jade was suddenly a bowl of ice cream big enough to drown in, one that took both Nepeta's arms to carry. Showcasing just the kind of strength Jade had guessed at, Nepeta easily toted it over to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may have scaled it up, to be on the safe side. It smells so sweet!\" she remarked. Jade nodded, drooling a little over the ice cream. Oh sure, she could never eat this much - but she had a growing desire to indulge herself, and this sure fit the bill! Then an idea hit her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nepeta, you didn't try any, did you?\" she asked worriedly. Nepeta shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...I was wondering though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it does the same thing?\" Jade asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it does?\" Nepeta asked, sounding both playful and naughty. She lifted up her shirt, surprising Jade a little with abs like chiselled stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't it make for better tummy rubs?\" she asked, looking for Jade's approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- you're so fit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepeta put down her shirt, looking grumpy (that is, adorable). \"So? You'd be too if you had to hunt all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kitten me...\" Jade said, again not noticing her pun. Nepeta giggled gleefully. Jade began to imagine Nepeta on her lap, tummy in the air, purring under her touch...she knew how good it had felt for her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try a bite?\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Nepeta was giddy. She sat down - on Jade's lap. Her thigh pressed against Jade's belly. Jade blushed and watched Nepeta lean in to lick the mound of ice cream. Jade decided to ask about utensils later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! this is a-meow-zing!\" Nepeta said, her face quickly sticky with ice cream. Jade giggled, leaned over, and licked it from Nepeta's cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just hope we're right about this...\" she said, not stopping Nepeta as she went back in for more.</span></div></div>",

It was a little weird, not being able to use a spoon or anything, but at the same time it was fun. She was putting aside all those rules of a civilisation that didn't even exist any more, and was acting more naturally, even if the food she ate was anything but. She soon was eating as quickly as Nepeta, without pause, finding that with her increased size came a bigger appetite. Jade began to think that maybe she could get used to this, her new shape. It's not like she had ever needed any particular athleticism...that had always been more Dave's forte.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepeta took a breather for a moment, rubbing ice cream off her chin and then licking it from her hands. It distracted Jade, to see Nepeta's clever tongue gliding over her hand, imagining where else such a tongue could reach...what had truly been released in Jade was hard to pin down, but part of it was definitely her sexuality, her drive, and it was making up for lost time. Jade wasn't sure which she wanted to taste more, ice cream or Nepeta...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls finished off the mini-mountain of ice cream in minutes. Jade leaned back and gave a small huff, rubbing her belly. She was so full! So stuffed! She had never felt like this before, and boy did it feel good. Soft and chubby, content and a bit sleepy. She looked over at Nepeta, and let out a gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nepeta...woah...\" she hadn't paid attention to how much Nepeta had eaten.

Nepeta leaned back in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, you're getting your shirt - huh?\" Jade realized that Nepeta's shirt was brushing up against the ice cream mountain - and that didn't make sense. It quickly occurred to her what was going on though. She shook Nepeta by the shoulder, gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Nepeta. You might want to - you need - look at your boobs!\" she eventually blurted out. Nepeta did react, sitting upright and blinking. She looked down and tugged at her shirt - instead of laying it flat, it accentuated the two growing melons pushing out from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy crap!\" Jade exclaimed. \"I don't think you're getting the same effect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but, wow! They're still growing!\" Nepeta exclaimed. Sure enough, they were still swelling outwards, easily passing D-cups now and showing no sign of slowing. Nepeta began to purr and laid her hands over them, rubbing up and down. Her eyelids fluttered like she was about to come right there and then. Jade just stared in awe, eyes glued to Nepeta's tits. Nepeta noticed this and twisted her torso round, sticking them out at Jade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're real!\" she proclaimed, inviting Jade to test that statement. She did so eagerly, laying one hand on Nepeta's melon-sized boob. It was taut but soft, and she could feel it growing under her touch. She rubbed it in wonder, making Nepeta moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-touch me!\" she proclaimed desperately. It was all Jade needed to hear. She grabbed Nepeta by the waist and pulled her down on the bed. Their feet knocked away the ice cream, but they didn't even notice. Jade pressed Nepeta's body over hers, feeling their tits mash together, as Jade was nothing to sneeze at up top herself. Nepeta was winning out though, and the troll girl was mewling desperately, flushed and barely able to contain herself. She began to rock against Jade's body, doing her best to dry hump her. Jade grasped Nepeta's breasts with her hands and forced them together, watching Nepeta's sign getting lost in her cleavage. Nepeta moaned and increased her shifting. Jade was beginning to feel hot, Nepeta's motion causing ripples in her body, once more intensifying at her crotch. She couldn't hold back, she didn't want to!</span></div></div>",

Jade nuzzled her head into Nepeta's cleavage enthusiastically. Her hands reached up and grabbed the back of Nepeta's shirt, and began to pull head-wards. Nepeta was caught off-guard as Jade pulled the shirt over her head, but with a wiggle she came free. She got up onto her knees, so Jade could look up and see her properly. Nepeta was grinning widely, looking at her head sized breasts. They looked especially big given her lithe, muscular torso. Two green nubs capped her tits, similar enough that Jade recognised them as nipples, even though they were a bit smoother, less defined. Jade heaved herself up into a sitting position, going after Nepeta. They kissed passionately, feeling up and down one another's body. Nepeta's warm, smooth breasts gave way and mashed over Jade. But Jade wanted to really feel them. Fortunately, Nepeta was ahead of her, already tugging off her shirt. They threw it aside, exposing Jade's newly flabby body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Murr?\" Nepeta cocked her head at the sight of Jade's bra, which was heavily over taxed, youthful tit-flesh spilling out over the cups in every direction. Jade laughed and went for the clasp, but Nepeta just reached forward with one finger. A twitch, and the bra came in half, shredded by a honed nail. Jade was surprised enough that she stayed still, letting the bra fall away, her pale bosoms falling free just above the shelf of her belly. Nepeta purred, clearly approving. It somehow didn't even occur to Jade that Nepeta's skin was grey, her teats were green, or that her body was probably strange in ways Jade couldn't even imagine. And the opposite must never have occurred to Nepeta. The only thing between them was passion, passion and a kind of chemistry that's one in a million - maybe even one in a species. They wrapped their arms around one another, warm flesh gliding over warm flesh, Nepeta's tits pressing over Jade's, and onto Jade's belly. Their hands explored one another's torsos as their tongues and lips likewise pioneered each other's mouths. Nepeta's strong arms forced their bodies against one another snugly, her tiny middle smothered by Jade's belly. Jade grasped at Nepeta's tit while Nepeta fondled her belly. Everything seemed to work, every touch of one another's fingertips was electric, every nibble, lick, and kiss sent them to new heights of ecstasy like neither had known existed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jade wasn't even thinking clear thoughts any more. It wasn't just fantasy - something inside her had been released. Beneath her bubbly sweetness, her loyalty and naivety were just signs of the wild one within her, of the creature that had kept her strong when, as a kid, she had gutted her own grandfather's corpse to stuff him, had tracked Bec and been tracked by him, who had grown up knowing the majesty of the untouched wilderness. And she could feel that in Nepeta, feel the kindred spirit, the spirit of the predator. It touched her, and brought out her inner animal. Furiously she rubbed Nepeta's body against hers, not sure which one of them was dominant. They rolled about, laying sideways briefly, and Jade leaned in and grabbed Nepeta's ear with her teeth. The troll girl cried out, but her whimper was a beg for more, which Jade obliged. Jade felt Nepeta's teeth on her neck, felt her sharp claws in her back's giving flesh. This was the thrill of the hunt, the tussle and tumble with her prey before she got her reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a struggle more for the sake of struggle than anything else, however, as Nepeta was driven to the same ends as Jade. She had no lock on her wild side, but this was the first time she had felt no need to hold back - no one, not even Equius, accepted her like this, no one knew just how animalistic she was. But Jade did, Jade understood. So when Jade bit down on her ear, Nepeta cried for more, wanting to feel like the animal she was, wanting to feel the predator's jaw around her, so that she could be put in her place. She was no alpha....and surprisingly, soft and squishy Jade was looking like she was. One of Jade's hands went down Nepeta's back, and seem annoyed when it hit Nepeta's pants, pushing and trying to get underneath. Nepeta gave in to these demands willingly. She removed her hands from around Jade just long enough to undo her pants, tearing them down to her knees and kicking them off from there. Only a fine pair of black panties now stood in the way. Jade didn't notice at first, but then one hand went by accident around Nepeta's sculpted, tight rear end. She gave a grunt of surprise, and for but a heartbeat hesitated. She nodded to Nepeta, and Nepeta followed her alpha's command. She got up onto her knees and down the bed, past the hill of Jade's belly, and level with Jade's legs. The skirt was half-undone, but Nepeta fumbled with the unfamiliar arrangement. Jade reached down and unthreaded her belt, making it easier, and the skirt came undone. Jade's plump legs were dimple free, smooth and paler than the moon, her own panties half-hidden by her belly. She was already wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepeta straddled Jade's legs and lowered herself, beginning to grind her sex against Jade's. Jade moaned and arched her back, her sex already alight with passion from their foreplay. Nepeta's crotch was strange and enticing against hers - slightly more of a bulge, like a smooth hill, but Jade couldn't see. Nepeta leaned in and grabbed Jade's belly for support, squeezing two full handfuls of it. Something...something flexed, and Nepeta's sex felt different, more like what Jade imagined a human's would. Jade panted and bucked, instinctively trying to get her lover to enter her, to no avail. Nepeta did, however, began to grind harder, throwing her hips into it. She was a strong girl, a damn strong one, and Jade gasped, feeling like Nepeta was going to break her pelvis. And it felt so damn good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm gonna need a, a - buuuuuuuuucket!\" Nepeta cried out, her grinding growing more furious and twitchy. Jade felt it, as with a spasm Nepeta came, releasing copious amounts of some sticky, slick fluid. Jade moaned, and on the after shocks of Nepeta's explosive orgasm she herself came. It was a display in miniature of what happened to Nepeta, but it was nonetheless impressive, Jade's frame quaking with shear pleasure. Nepeta collapsed on top of her, and Jade panted, trying to catch her breath. Surprising herself, Jade still felt horny...looking at Nepeta's melons, she was willing to bet hormones had been ramped up by these changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did she know how right she was, as she and Nepeta...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Murrr.....murrr....\" Nepeta purred rhythmically, sounding natural despite her species, as she laid over top Jade. Jade, for her part, was sure panting like a dog, her arms around Nepeta, holding her still. The troll girl's eyes were closed, her face pure bliss, and Jade just wanted to hold her tight and pet her. Oddly, however, Nepeta seemed to be getting almost farther away, despite being against Jade's body. She couldn't make sense of it. Were her glasses off or something? No, that wasn't it. Jade had to loosen her grip to let Nepeta rise away from her - and that's when she realised what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, again?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sure...\" Nepeta said, misunderstanding her. She blinked her eyes open, and almost realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey wait, I'm still getting bigger!\" she said. Jade looked down. How could she have missed it?! Nepeta's swollen tits were now spreading down her body, out and away, getting steadily larger. Nepeta moaned and got herself upright, straddling Jade. Her tits were slightly lower-slung now from their weight, but still perfectly round as they well surpassed her head in size. Jade couldn't see Nepeta's lower half still due to her belly, which was creeping steadily into her line of sight. Not just her belly, she realised - all around she was puffing up, filling with real fat. Her belly got the brunt of it, but her body seemed jealous of Nepeta, and her own tits passed DD, and not by a little. Nepeta, however, now had tit down to her rib-cage, and was moaning constantly as she rubbed them. Each one was as wide as her torso! Her nipple-nubs had swollen proportionately, thick green buds on her flawless bosoms. Nepeta didn't seem to want them to stop, but slowly they did, each one just lower than her torso, easily taking up a foot and a half in diameter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, soft puppy.\" Nepeta cooed, looking down at Jade, who grinned (:B) back. Like Nepeta, Jade's swelling had been more pronounced, and the girl was now f-a-t fat. Nepeta had to manoeuvre her arms around her tits, but once she did so she managed to get up Jade's jelly belly, which had developed into a soft mountain, large enough for a prominent crease at her belly button. It jiggled easily under Nepeta's touch, but it was just the most prominent mountain in the landscape of Jade's body. That jiggle easily transferred down to her love handles and up to her boobs, which were truly melons by now, her pink nipples erect and pointed skyward. Even her face was rounder, only really noticeable at her cheeks, giving her smiles deep dimples. She cooed at Nepeta's touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea I am..\" she agreed, her hands joining Nepeta's. There was more enough belly fat for all four, with plenty to spare! Jade couldn't believe how good this felt! She didn't even care what the others would think-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap, the others!\" Jade realised, her eyes flying open. Nepeta jumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we were all pretty hungry.\" Jade said. \"Either way, we need to warn them - I don't think anyone will get as lucky as we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee, guess you're right!\" Nepeta agreed, falling on top of Jade. Her boobs went - well, everywhere. Over Jade's, onto the bed, around Jade's chin, around her own chin....she rested on them and on Jade's belly, and gave a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be neat to see!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We still need to tail them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that a dog pun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nepeta...\" the sound in Jade's voice wasn't one she heard so much as felt, a growl of sorts, a growl of warning but translated into words. It made them both blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...how'd I do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee hee. Don't worry. You're right.\" Nepeta said, not wanting to tell Jade of her new alpha status just yet. \"How should we do it though? Maybe with enough clothes one of us could get dressed to go out? The vents are pretty big, maybe I could look and see first...\" she looked up towards the ceiling, where Jade saw an uncovered vent that was more than large enough for a normally proportioned person or two - which meant maybe Nepeta could still fit. But, even unaware of the nature of the beast she was, Jade still felt compelled to make this decision, and wasn't sure she wanted Nepeta to risk it...</span></div></div>",

It was as if it was designed for a person - no, for an entire group - to sneak through. Then again, knowing this \"game\"....Nepeta just giggled, which sent so much flesh wobbling between them they began to get hot and bothered again. Sensing this, Nepeta got up, her massive tits swinging around. Finally, off of the bed, Jade saw Nepeta in all her glory, panties nowhere to be found. Huge boobs were held up easily thanks to a wall of back muscle, and sent into shadow abs of steel. Her hips were small but feminine, with an ass that had no business on a girl so young. Nepeta's sex was similar to her nipples - similar to Jade's, but somehow less defined - there was such a small slit, and the skin bulged outwards slightly like her nipples did against the smooth curve of her tits. Jade finally understood Karkat's constant references to \"bone bulges\" - something must give way, that was what she had felt earlier. Jade began to think that she'd simply have to find out first hand later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cat got your tongue?\" Nepeta asked again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You already used that one!\" Jade said with a laugh. Nepeta just blew her a raspberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I feel so free! To do whatever!\" Jade explained. \"And I want to do you...\" her voice took on a different quality again, almost indistinguishable, but carrying an authority one would never expect given her sweetness even while say it. Nepeta recognised it however. Jade's inner dog - no, no. Her inner <i>wolf</i> was taking charge, making up for all those years, nearly feral. It actually made her lip quiver briefly, wanting so badly to jump back on top of Jade. But, animals as they were, they were thinking animals, and both managed to avoid what could easily have been a near-endless cycle. Instead, Jade began to heave herself up, not an easy task as she easily weighed half again what she once had. Her belly oozed onto her lap, covering her crotch and even part of her thick, juicy thighs. Honestly, Jade was beginning to like the idea of her *not* having to move more than she had to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I purromise later.\" Nepeta said, finding her pants beyond the bed. She shimmied into them, going commando.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about a top?\" Jade asked. Nepeta just shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be in trouble either way, right?\" she asked. Jade's brow furrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....at least with Equimouse....\" Nepeta said, pushing her fingers together in awkward admission. Jade actually got serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I don't understand trollmance....but he doesn't get to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jade...I'll explain later, okay?\" Nepeta said. Her smile reappeared. \"Don't worry. I...I think I love you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...think I love you too...\" Jade admitted, heaving herself off the bed. She stood by Nepeta, looked her up and down, and added \"even if you didn't have boobs. So be careful...\" she leaned in and pecked Nepeta on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pur- I promise.\" Nepeta replied, giving Jade a lick back. Jade laughed and let Nepeta head over to the corner. Despite her huge assets making normal climbing methods impossible, Nepeta could actually easily hoist herself into the vent. Its space was literally just enough for her boobs to sweep along as she clambered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be back soon!\" she called, her voice already echoing. Jade nodded, and sat back down on the bed, deciding to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet's follow - </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nepeta shuffled along slowly, accommodating her massive bust as she went along on her hands and knees through the vents. The heat inside her was dying down, and she was feeling a bit dazed and giddy. She had liked Jade for a long time, though not nearly as strongly as she now felt. She had truthfully been holding out for Karkat...but she had done a lot of sneaking in the vents, and had overheard his feelings for all of them at one time or another, herself included. Karkat would never want her.....for a while, Nepeta had blocked this out, and focused on people like Jade, who were finally beginning to chat with her. Jade had enjoyed roleplaying as much as she, it seemed, though she never got the hang of it. They had such similar outlooks on life, and were kinda in the same place in relation to their friends - not hogging the spotlight, or even understanding all that was going on, but always willing to be there and to do what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was Jade's wild side....along with that perhaps Equius' behaviour had rubbed off on Nepeta, as she was well used to being bossed around and kinda liked the idea of someone who would keep care of her (it was what had attracted her to Karkat). Besides which, Nepeta was actually one of the strongest of the group. Apart from Equius, possibly only Feferi had more physical brawn than she, and Nepeta was far, far more agile. So the idea of someone who, even if just by virtue of being way too heavy, could pin her down, make her a helpless kitten? Nepeta was beginning to get turned on again just thinking of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepeta stopped her inner monologue at the sound of a sudden cry. She perked up and listened. Another cry, what sounded like outright agony! She shuffled along towards it, beginning to worry something had gone wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh! Arrrrggggghhh!\" It was Kanaya, was she in- \"Ahhhhhhhhyyyyesss! Ahh! Rose! That - oh gog, that hurts so good!\" Kanaya's shouts of more pain than pleasure echoed through the vents. Nepeta paused, blushing, and decided to shuffle closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is what you get, Kanaya...\" a level, so feminine voice entered, \"This is your punishment for what you've done!\" the end of her statement was punctuated by a sharp cry from Kanaya, one Nepeta pictured belonging to a dying animal mid-evisceration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God YES! P-punish me Rose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who told you you could speak?\" Rose asked. There was a sound like a crack of bone, and Kanaya cried out again. Nepeta still heard pain - but she could make out the undertones of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no, Rose, not the needles, not there-OHGODYESTHERE.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepeta blushed so hard it was amazing that blood reached any other part of her body. She was almost afraid - but curiosity killed the cat, and Nepeta still had her nine lives. So, she ever so carefully inched forward, planning to spy out of the vent to Kanaya's room.</span></div></div>",
