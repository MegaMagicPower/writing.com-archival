There is nothing quite as exhilarating to me as being outdoors enjoying nature all around me. My favorite campsite right now has a pair of nesting Bald Eagles. They are so beautiful I sit and watch them for hours. Also, has anyone else noticed how food always tastes so much better when you are outdoors? Even hotdogs and hamburgers taste great when they are cooked over a campfire.  <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/smile.png\" alt=\"*Smile*\" title=\"Smile\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> </span></div></div>",
