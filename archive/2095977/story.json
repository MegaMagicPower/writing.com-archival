If you want to add the other characters thats fine. I actually encourage it, but please keep the characters acting similarly to the way they act in the show.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a beautiful morning in the Tristate area of Danville. In the Flynn house, Linda was preparing for her day. Their sons, Phineas and Ferb, where sit under they only tree in the backyard. Candace Flynn came down stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Candace. Good. I was just about to call you.\" Linda said. \"Your father is still sick so he's napping upstairs. I'm off to a pigeon rally. You're in charge while we're gone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok mom.\" Candace said as her mom exited the house. Once the door was shut, Candace walked over to the sliding glass door. She glared at her siblings. She knew that the two would do something bustable. All she had to do was wait. Her waiting was cut off by her cell phone going off. It was Stacy. Candace picked up her phone, and flopped on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Phineas and Ferb still sat under the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a nice day out, isn't Ferb?\" Phineas said. \"Hey Ferb. Remember when we made that shrinking device? That was a lot of fun. You know, I bet we could improve the design. Maybe we could drive Candace insane. That's still on the check list right?\" Ferb pulled a sheet of paper with the list on it out of his pocket. Several items were checked off, like building a roller-coaster, building and launching a rocket, and fighting a mummy. Near the bottom of the list \"Drive Candace insane\" lay unchecked. Ferb gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I know what we're going to do today!\" Phineas proclaimed. After a brief montage, Candace noticed that the boys were up to something bustable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to call you back Stacy.\" Candace said as she hung up her phone. \"What are you to doing?\" She demanded as she slid the door and walked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're making a shrink ray.\" Phineas said pride filling his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shrinking devise?\" Candace questioned. \"OOOO You are sooo bust...wait a minute. Didn't you already do a shrinking thingy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes, but we wanted to improve the design.\" Phineas responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm still gonna bust you for it.\" Candace said as she went back inside to get her phone. At the same time a young girl, dressed in all pink, opened the gate to the Flynn backyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Phineas, whatcha doin'?\" Isabella asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hey Isabella. We're redesigning our shrink ray.\" Phineas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Cool.\" Isabella said. Phineas wiped some sweat off his brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, It's really hot out today.\" He said. \"Could you get us some sodas from our fridge Isabella?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Isabella happy chirped. \"Be right back.\" Isabella disappeared into the Flynn house to get the sodas, while the two brothers kept working on the devise. Suddenly there was a bright flash. Phineas and Ferb covered their eyes. A moment later the two uncovered their eyes to find themselves shrinking. It wasn't long before they stood only a few inches tall, surrounded by their giant clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ferb.\" Phineas said. \"I think the devise malfunctioned. We need to get help.\" But before they could move, the sliding glass door opened and a giant [Choice 1 or 2] walked out.        </span></div></div>",

As if on queue, Sheldon came opened the door to the apartment. It didn't take him long to see Penny sitting in his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Penny, you're in my spot.\" He said. Penny gave a groan, and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna go grab something.\" Penny said as she walked out of the room, leaving the door just a hair open. Sheldon looked confused for a minuet, but then quickly looked at the counter. On the counter was a weird hand held device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leonard. What's that thing?\" Sheldon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey yeah, what is it?\" Howard asked as the four friends gathered around the odd device.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well guys, this is a matter displacer that I'm working on.\" Leonard said. Pride filling every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matter displacer?\" Howard asked? \"Like prim particles, that kind of stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, only I've found a way to have the weight of the object change too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Raj asked. Leonard picked up the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this piece right here...\" He was cut off by a sudden bright light. It took a few moments for the four to get there gift of sight back. They found out that the world was suddenly huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Raj questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The matter displacer must've fired.\" Leonard said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we shrunk?!\" Howard yelled.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem as if we are around three inches tall.\" Sheldon said. \"Leonard I don't want to be three inches tall. It's not as fun as Ant Man made it seem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with Sheldon.\" Raj said. \"I want to be get back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm with you guys, but the displacer landed on the counter.\" Leonard said looking up. The firing end of the displacer was hanging over the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me that we are three inches tall and the only way for us to get back to normal is to get to the displacer, which is on top of your counter?!\" Howard questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Howard calm down.\" Raj commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down? Calm down?! We're three inches tall and we have to climb a four foot counter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it can't get any worse.\" Leonard said. As if to prove him wrong, the door to the apartment opened and [Choice 1 or 2] entered the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had to said it didn't you Leonard?\" Howard growled. </span></div></div>",
