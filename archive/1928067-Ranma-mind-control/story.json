But the problem of Nabiki is that she is extremly greedy, and even though she had earned a lot of yen today, that still wasn't enough for her.\"Oh man I wish there was someway that I can earn more than this, if I could only find a way to make dear Ranma my permanent slave\" and with this greedy thoughts in her mind Nabiki walked her back home.

It looked exactly like an antique shop, but there were many strange thing for that kind of shop: scultures of witches, demons and dragons, strange dresses and mysterious books. What drew Nabiki's attention was ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many books sitting on a shelf amongst the various curios, but seeing the title 'Jusenkyo Secrets' on the cover of one got Nabiki's attention.  Even if the book turned out to have no good useful information for any of the various cursed martial artists in town, she should be able to extort a small fortune out of one or more of them for the information it contained.  She smirked to herself - the book almost certainly had nothing that would help any of them, if history was any guide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop owner noticed Nabiki's attention.  \"Ah, you are interested in legends of Chinese curses?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a passing curiosity, is all,\" Nabiki answered, trying to sound as disinterested as possible.  \"I've never seen this shop before, actually.  Sort of strange, isn't that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, the shop wasn't here yesterday.  The building was, of course, but I just opened for business today.  Moved from Hokkaido to be closer to my grandchildren,\" he answered.  He tilted his head sideways.  \"Strange how low the rent is here.  Or how nervous the insurance man was about issuing a policy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you some free advice if you'll give me this book,\" Nabiki offered.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner laughed heartily.  \"Well, you have some nerve, don't you, young lady?  Alright, let's hear your advice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under no circumstances should you allow the insurance salesman to talk you into not covering 'martial arts' related property damage,\" Nabiki said, clutching the book.  \"Trust me, that's why the rent is so low here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner blinked.  \"How did you know he...\"  He shook his head.  \"Of course, you're a local.  Thank you very much, miss...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabiki Tendo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Tendo, I appreciate your advice.  Even if it will double my insurance costs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the long run, it will save you money and pain,\" she said, sincerely.  Just because she was greedy, didn't mean she was going to give bad advice, after all.  \"So, may I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sure, sure.  I've had that for thirty years, you're the first person to even look at it, actually,\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki flipped through the pages on her way home.  The book seemed to be a bust for the most part, at least at first.  A chapter explaining what the curses were, and how one acquired one.  Several more on tragic individual stories.  Theories about how the pools of sorrow formed in the first place.  But then the stuff actually worth some money to Nabiki began.  Formulas for a few temporary treatments.  A strong warning against mixing permanent curses.  And then, bizarrely, a tea recipe.  Nabiki flipped back, wondering why there was a tea recipe in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If a cursed individual drinks a tea brewed with the essence of both his cursed and natural halves, and the essence of a second person, that cursed individual will be bound to obey the commands of the second person by the magic of the curse.  Only the instinct of self-preservation will be able to override and break this power, as one unfortunate Chinese Warlord learned yadda yadda yadda,\" Nabiki read, her eyes dancing with Yen.  \"The Essence?  I wonder...   ah!  A weaker, temporary form may be brewed using the hair (or scales, or whatever) instead of the essence, which may make it easier for the aspiring master to obtain the essence for the permanent form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tilted her head again.  \"Strange that Shampoo has never tried... ah!  A warning that the victim may become infertile as a side effect.  Another warning that the victim's intelligence and emotions are not affected, and victims will usually resent being controlled.\"  Nabiki chuckled.  \"Well, she wants his babies, so that probably explains it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the book, and made her way towards her family home, pondering.  It really made no difference to her if Ranma couldn't get anyone pregnant - especially if only she knew that fact.  She smiled the entire way home, creeping out a few of her classmates who got a glimpse of her.  It was time to make a little tea.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After five minutes of patience, Nabiki was able to free those pages and looked at those.Then she decided to read the first page and noticed the title of the chapter \"How to make a cursed one you perfect slave!\". Nabiki was even more interested by this chapter, and so she started read it. On  those pages there were all description on how to make a cursed one under your complete control,and also to rewrite his/her memories, but that wasn't all, there were also some description on how to transform is body according to your preference.

She organized the event to be held in a restricted building and sold tickets at 10,000 yen for every 5 minutes with star, and 100,000 for 5 minutes alone. Groups of 5 were sent in at a time, and left via a rear exit. Over 15,000 tickets were sold, with less then half being repeat customers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki made more videos during that event then she could have possibly wished for. She also had Junko/Ranma collect all the sperm in a bathtub after each group left, so she could make an actual 'cum bath' porn for her fans. That last video was so famous, it got 10 million hits in a week on PornHub, and a nomination for an AVN award in America.</span></div></div>",

Kasumi picked up the slave tape and put it into the vcr and prepared it for use. She then began to walk to the dojo thinking on whether she wanted to turn her sisters into slaves or dogs, though nabiki was definitely not deserving any compassion for her actions and so would probably become a mindless slave. Akane on the other hand would probably become a dog since she always acted like a bitch anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi stepped into the dojo abd noticed that ranma was already a girl and training, and walked up to her. \u201cRanma-kun i have something i think you should watch. It is a tape that apparently helps someone become a better martial artist, and far less distracted from anything but martial arts when required.\u201d Kasumi told Ranma which definitely interested her since she was curious on how a tape could make her a better martial artist and said \u201cyou say it can make me a better martial artist? I dont see how a dumb tape can make me stronger but sure ill give it s shot, thanks for the idea.\u201d Ranma said thankfully to kasumi, who was amazed at how gullible Ranma was. Kasumi brought Ranma to the living room and whrn ranma sat down, turned on the tape and began the video. Ranma sat with her legs split arms crossed eager to watch the tape, and when it began was immediently enraptured, and began to relax. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi read that the video would take an hour to erase Ranma and creat her robot, so she decided to get some chores done and would check up on ranma in 30 minutes to see how Ranma was taking to it. Kasumi swept, scrubbed the flores, and cleaned dishes and when she was done, went back to observe how Ranma was taking the video 30 minutes in and saw Ranma sitting up straight drool running from her chin, and to her shock she realized that Ranma was actually under its control and left to just relax for awhile and went back to her room so she could read a book.

Ranma lead Akane to Kasumi\u2019s former room where he explained that it was a training video that is supposed to help clear your mind and make it easier to focus on training and other such activities, Akane doubted how effective it could possibly be but sat down on Kasumi\u2019s former bed and Ranma quickly started the video up and just left to watch his new slave mindlessly work even though she acted just like a person, he knewcshe wasn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an hour and a half passed, Ranma entered his new room checking up on Akane and saw her mindlessly looking at the menu screen of the finished video with her jaw hanging open, drool running down her shirt having been turned into a mind wiped robot that would now exist only to await it\u2019s owners every command. Ranma walked around the bed and grabbed Akane\u2019s boobs to see if Akane would object but to his surprise Akane didn\u2019t even change her facial expression but her body quickly thrust her boobs out in response to it\u2019s owner\u2019s desires. Ranma was shocked and half expected to see Akane trying to resist but when he looked at her eyes, he couldn\u2019t even see any intelligence behind her eyes left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkane stand up straight so i can enjoy the sight of your ass, i want to see that body that you never allowed me to before.\u201d Ranma commanded his new robot. He was pleasantly surprised to see Akane mindless do as he commanded, but her facial expression didn\u2019t change at all. Ranma stalked to his new slave\u2019s body and grabbed her ass with a grin on his face knowing the new Akane existed only for his pleasure. He knew though that he did want his new slave to stay in shape so he DID allow her to go on her jog, but he made a few changed to her outfit such as having her remove her bra and panties since he knew it was something that the old Akane would never have done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma watched Akane\u2019s body mindlessly begin the jog that her old self was planning to go on with a smile on his face since now he had a fianc\u00e9 that wanted nothing but his happiness for once. He knew though that Nabiki would notice her sisters acting oddly so he knew that she probably had to be enslaved to. Even though Ranma was attracted to Nabiki, he debated whether she even deserved the privilege of being a member of his harem. After all Nabiki was as big of a bitch as he ever met but he knew that the video could easily purge all of that out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma decided to first...</span></div></div>",

Ranma ordered Kasumi to prepare the video again so he could enslave Nabiki just like he had enslave Akane and Kasumi and she mindlessly did as instructed without a word. Ranma knew he needed to find Nabiki first though and knew that was easier said than done though since Nabiki was not home during the time her sisters were enslaved but he knew that she would have to come home sooner rather than later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma decided to relax and wait until Nabiki arrived home and he was not disappointed when she arrived an hour later. He didn\u2019t have to worry about the fathers or happosai though since they were on a training trip for a few weeks. He quickly ran up to talk to the girl who always threatened him with a grin on his face.<br>\r\nHe ordered Kasumi to go wait in her former room and act like she wanted to watch a movie with Nabiki while making sure the movie would be the training video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYo nabs Kasumi had something she wanted to show you in her room when you got home, dunno what it is but you might wanna check that out.\u201d Ranma said casually <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later but i have to use the bathroom first saotome. Is it clear?\u201d Nabiki asked Ranma with a bored look in her eyes. Ranma lied and said that it was being used by Akane which irritated Nabiki but she decided to go check up on Kasumi to see what she wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was surprised when he never heard Nabiki leave her room and checked up on her after 20 minutes just to see Nabiki and Kasumi watching the video, but he did notice that Kasumi was not in a trance since she already lost her mind. Nabiki was looking at the video with wide eyes but a smile on her face. Ranma just decided to leave the girls for the rest of the video and just went back to the living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was rewarded with Akane returning home and quickly report to him with a blank look on her face. He saw that she got pretty sweaty while doing the jog. Ranma was unaware that normally Akane did half her jog, then sat on a bench for twenty minutes and go back to it, but without her mind Akane mindlessly did the whole jog at full speed without slowing down once. Akane would have collapsed if she had free will but her exhausted body absolutely belonged to her owner so she reported to him obediently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was shocked to see the brainwashed girl still standing after the jog she reported finishing to him but he decided to have a bit of fun and ordered her to do 60 jumping jacks and then strip naked and twerk for her owner. Akane immediently  did as she was told even though her legs were beyond exhausted and once she finished her jumping jacks she stripped naked to twerk for her master still with a blank face. Ranma enjoyed the show and watching his new fianc\u00e9 do things she would have NEVER done before. Turns out Akane had a nicer butt than he thought though and he decided to test her mind wipe even more and slapped her ass hard. Akane didn\u2019t even flinch or slow down, she just kept doing as she was told. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma grinning decided to get up and walk over to Nabiki\u2019s training session and saw the girl was finished.

She always liked to act like she was the queen of Nerima, but Ranma had finally beaten her. He decided though that it would be pretty deserved for him to humiliate her a bit for all the trouble she gave him. Grinning he began to think of all the things he could have her do, at home or school now that her mind was gone forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma commanded Nabiki to stand up so he could admire her body and Nabiki obeyed still drooling. Ranma noticed Kasumi was stilling sitting down even though she had no right to take a break. He ordered Kasumi to get back to work while he checked out his newest slave. He remembered that Nabiki had been saying she needed to go to the bathroom pretty badly which was why he tricked her into watching the video first since he knew it could take awhile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma ordered the new Nabiki to shit herself to see if she would do it, not expecting her t9 not only do it but not change her facial expression in the slightest. Once Nabiki finished filling her panties she awaited further instruction without a sound. Ranma laughed seeing how tamed she was but decided she was not done, and ordered Nabiki to move to the dojo and begin doing jumping jack like her slave sister Akane did just a lot more embarrassingly. Nabiki did exactly as she was told, doing 100 jumping jacks with a blank look in her eyes and soiled pants while Ranma laughed at her. Once she finished, Nabiki mindlessly moved to the bathroom to change her panties as instructed and Ranma was 100% certain that Nabiki Tendo the former ice queen of Furinkan was gone forever. He returned to see Akane still twerking with an empty look on her face and still butt naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma sat down and watched the body of his Fianc\u00e9 with a smirk on his face having finally fixed all of his problems at the Tendo household since now there were no girls to resist him, and all three tendo sisters would have no problem serving their master for the rest of their lives without a thought in the world. He knew he should probably claim Ukyo and Shampoo which wouldn\u2019t be hard, no the hard part of hypnotizing Cologne to agree with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ranma contemplated his next prize, Nabiki mindlessly finished cleaning herself up and reported back to the living room without a sound and awaited further instruction. Ranma still had some jusenkyo drowned young girl water though that he could use on cologne to get another sexy slave but he still had to hypnotize her first. He settled for enjoying Akane\u2019s show in the meantime since the girl was dancing like a stripper. Ranma decided then and there that a stripper pole was gonna be added to the Tendo living room for his amusement and ordered Nabiki to gather her finance to order one installed which the mind wiped mercenary mindlessly did without complain. As Nabiki did that Ranma ordered Kasumi to join her exhausted sister in dancing and to strip naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was enjoying his slaves for awhile until...</span></div></div>",

Ranma groaned but decided that Ukyo would make a decent pet to show off anyways and decided to just hypnotize her. Ranma gave the order for his slaves to get dressed and he went out to meet with Ukyo to convince her to watch the video with him. Ranma knew he couldn\u2019t be hypnotized long and so long as nobody programmed him during his trance he would wake up as the same person. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma went out and saw Ukyo standing outside the new saotome house looking like she had something on her mind. He saw that she was fidgeting alot looking like she really did not want to enter his home. He began to walk out to see her after he saw Kasumi finish the video preparation without a hitch. He called out to Ukyo to get her attention with a casual smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ucchan what\u2019s up? You normally don\u2019t come here so much. Whatcha want?\u201d Ranma asked Ukyo who just looked at Ranma with a look of dread. Ukyo had come to make a big announcement after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey...Ranchan, i need to talk with you. I know i messed up your wedding a lot, and we have been slowly drifting apart so thought you might appreciate this. I want to end our engagement.\u201d Ukyo said with a very nervous look in her eyes as Ranma looked at her shocked. Ranma honestly thought Ukyo was the last person who would have broken her engagement, but he also knew he wanted her and her cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Really Ucchan? I don\u2019t understand why but can we at least talk about it inside? We can talk about it in my room. Don\u2019t look at me like that, it\u2019s just the most private room in the house Ucchan, i already had a movie set up about to watch it so maybe we could watch it as we talk. I know things don\u2019t look the best but can\u2019t you do that much?\u201d Ranma pleaded with Ucchan who looked very unsure, thinking Ranma was being way to nice for the whole situation and thought he might have a plan but agreed to talk it out over a movie because Ranma deserved at least that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma giddily lead her to his new room, aka what used to be Kasumi\u2019s new room and when they sat down turned the movie on as Ukyo looked nervous but decided to watch it with him knowing she didn\u2019t want to lose Ranma\u2019s friendship as well as engagement, Ranma gave his girls permission to go about their new chores after the two were in a trance so the would check up on the two in half an hour. Ranma and Ukyo quickly fell under control, but only one of the two of them would ever wake up again. After 30 minutes the Tendo girls mindlessly marched into the room and checked their trance before getting to work at their new chores. While the two sat there in a trance, the two began to fill their underwear without their minds to tell them to hold it in, as Ukyo and Ranma Pissed and shitted themselves their minds were cleaned out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter and hour and a half, both girls thought they were drones just like their sisters Akane, Nabiki and Kasumi. They waited for instruction while Ranma stayed in trance and Akane\u2019s body mindlessly marched in and gave the girls new chores which both immediately began to begin. Ranma\u2019s trance stayed active  and any boy who wanted to claim her mind could just come along as program her, even as she and Ukyo mindlessly began to trim the bushes even with their soiled clothes without a thought in the world. Even as they did that, Kasumi mindlessly prepared the video for her master again, not knowing that her master had been just as effected by the video as she was. Akane had no issues mindlessly scrubbing the Tendo dojo with a brush while naked just like Nabiki mindlessly swept and washed around the house naked herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma was cleaning the bushes as...</span></div></div>",

Ranma loyally cleaned with a blank look in her eyes with her robot sister Ukyo with efficient and mechanical movement but Ranma mindlessly began to feel embarrassed even as she kept working. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma finished her bushes and mindlessly reported to Kasumi asking for further instruction. Kasumi blankly ordered Ranma to clean out the dojo of her master\u2019s belongings and move them to what used to be Kasumi\u2019s room in a neat and tidy order. Ranma got to work and moved past Akane with drool running down her chin as her previous self was attempting to wake up. Ranma quickly did as commanded and once again reported to Kasumi asking for instruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi ordered Ranma to install the stripper pole that Nabiki mindlessly ordered inside their master\u2019s living room. Ranma quickly did as she was told with an efficiency that her previous self could never match. Kasumi dully announced dinner was ready and prepared plates for all the slaves including Ranma and the former girls mindlessly marched in, sat down and began to eat. Ranma sat between Nabiki and Akane and ate the same meal they did which was rice even though Kasumi laid out a much more luxurious meal which was octopus puffs and sushi. Kasumi blankly ordered the girls to eat and then they would get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma and her sisters did as they were told and then Kasumi instructed them to prepare their master\u2019s home for the morning. Then they went to bed while Ranma blankly reported to Kasumi for sleeping arrangements since she no longer knew she was technically the master. Kasumi ordered Ranma to change her pants and go to Akane\u2019s room and fall asleep. Ranma did so and fell asleep even though her mind was slowly returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome morning Ranma was nearly awake but while she knew she was the owner after getting her memories back, she was still hypnotized to be a robot. Ranma kept working with a brush alongside Akane cleaning the floor until around lunch when she finally snapped out of her trance. Ranma sleepily looked around and saw Ukyo mindlessly sweeping while Nabiki cut the grass, and Akane blankly brushing the floor beside her. Kasumi saw Ranma just sitting there and marched over to correct her inefficiency. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister bot get back to cleaning, our master requires us to work, not do nothing.\u201d Kasumi droned to Ranma who furrowed her brows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? What are you talking abou...ACK\u201d Ranma demanded before a flash burrowed through her head and she quickly got back to work. Ranma was conscious but still had lingering side effects of her programming and acknowledged Kasumi as the head slave even if Ranma was horrified to see her body obeying without her consent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma suddenly gasped as her stomach twisted into knots and she couldn\u2019t even use the bathroom. Ranma suddenly began filling her panties while her mind just watched even as her body kept cleaning without slowing down. Ranma was disgusted but she also tried to resist.

Something strange is happening again but this time, she has no ideas whatsoever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing her untouched breakfast away, Akane gets up from the table and announces that she's going out.

Both of his hands held tight onto Shampoo's lips to prevent her from spitting the pill out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching the Chinese girl struggle, Akane snaps out of her daze and heads over to help the other: Shampoo using her fingers to pry Happosai's arms away and Akane pulling at the back of his purple gi. Struggle as they might, Happosai isn't keen of letting go until his plan is successful.Therefore, he unleashes something that no woman could hope to stand against, especially in close contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering his all of his might, he inhales and releases a long stinky fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned by this move, the girls released him and quickly cover their noses. Unfortunately for Shampoo, she has no way to escape the full force of the attack and her eyes start to water and her lungs force themselves to repel the disgusting odour out of her body, which results to her swallowing the pill in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a triumphant laugh, Happosai finally lets the girl go and starts to boast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my new and improved recipe of the Student's-Devotion Pills, now you will be- Aaaaaah!\" But, as always, fate has something else in stored as Akane once again kicks the old pervert, making sure to send him flying out of state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"AND STAY AWAY, YOU SLIME!!!\"</b> Akane screams before continuing her coughing fit. It takes her a moment for her to recover and form sentences. \"Ugh-*cough,cough*- he never *coughs* gives up.\" When she can finally breathe normally, Akane turns towards Shampoo. \"Are you okay, Shampoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe said girl stares blanks at her. \"Shampoo okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning, Akane stands in front of Shampoo, waving her hand in front of the girl's eyes.

Since when does she ever get called by name other than insulting ones from <b>Shampoo</b> of all people. Then, she remembers what Happosai had said before she had sent him flying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right...\" A facepalm later, she realises that this is surely his work. Only now, she has to clean his mess. \"Oh, and I still have to find Ranma. This is just great.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could find try going to Cat Cafe. Cologne would help her own great daughter. To add to her misery, Akane's stomach lets out a huge growl. Great. Just fantastic. This doesn't help make her decision one bit. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nSimmering, she crosses her arms.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In the face of a growing dilemma, Akane sighs. The young Tendo does noticed that she's been doing a lot of these since morning. Though between the two options, Ranma is probably priority one. With that decided, she turns back to face Shampoo who is still rooted on the spot since she has taken the pill. Her once mischievous crimson eyes reflecting dull red ones as she stands eerily still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane grimaces. As much as she wants to leave the foreign girl by herself, Akane feels that it just isn't right. After all, it <i>is</i> partly her fault that Shampoo is like this; staring blankly in front of her as the navy haired girl paces back and forth. After steeling herself, she stops her pacing to address the problem at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo?\" Akane calls tentatively, watching as the Chinese girl faces her. \"Can you go back to Neko Hanten and let your great grandmother know what happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, the girl nods. \"Shampoo go Neko Hanten. Tell Great Grandmother.\" Akane lets out sighs in relief. Now that would solve one of these problems. She continues on her way when hears a short inquiry. \"Go together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Akane blinks. She hasn't expected this. Perhaps she has to clarify what she means before Shampoo would leave. \"No, I mean you go and I'll search for Ranma.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all she got in answer was a shake of the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then Shampoo no go. Master no safe alone.\" The Amazon twitches and heads back to Akane, keeping the pace once she's within range. \"No leave Master. Hurt if do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResisting the urge to send the other girl flying, Akane clenches her fists. Her next words comes out spiteful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can take care of myself. I don't need you to baby me. I get enough of that from that jerk already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master no baby. Too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vein pops out of Akane's head. \"Ah, is that so?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, she is half tempted to leave Shampoo to fend for herself. This was all that old pervert's fault. If he ever shows his face in front of her for the next ten hours-- A loud rumble cuts her train of thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane groans.\"Ugh, if only I knew what's going on. Ranma's been acting strange this whole morning. Staying as a girl, not changing back and... he looks so heartbroken.\" Halting her steps and nearly gets bumped by Shampoo, she beams as she has an epiphany. \"Wait, that's it! I know where to find Ranma.\" In her excitement, she grabs Shampoo's hand and pulls her along. \"Let's go Shampoo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe journey to the nearest burger joint hadn't take too long as the two girls stood in line, waiting for their turn. It has been rather awkward for Akane though, as Shampoo flat out refuses to leave her side and would silently stand behind her....always referring her as master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is disturbing to say the least. Therefore, she tries to break the ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Shampoo, have you eaten?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl replies in the negative. \"No breakfast. No want hear Mousse squawking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too?\" Akane stare at her in incredulity. \"I mean I skipped breakfast too. Like I said, Ranma was acting weird and lots of stuff happened so here we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane continues to rant about a lot of other things as the other listens. She talks about stuff at school and a little about how insensitive Ranma can be. And although the other girl doesn't say much the whole time, Akane is really happy that, for once, someone was listening to her point of view. By the time the two reached the cashier, Akane is smiling brightly at the Chinese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you mentioned that you haven't eaten right? Well, go ahead and pick whatever you like. My treat.\" With that said, she lists off her orders to the cashier and then turns back to the other girl. \"So, have you decided?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, Shampoo looks away. \"Shampoo not know this food. Always eat own food. No try Japan food.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now's your chance!\" Akane's cheer doesn't fade as she continues to insist. \"And if you don't like it, we could order something else next time. Besides-\" She goes a little further by adding. \"-don't knock it off until you tried it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her success, Shampoo finally relents and points towards a few burgers on the sign. Nodding at her choices, Akane keeps her words and tells the cashier to add them to her bill. It takes almost half an hour before they could finally leave and Akane hands Shampoo one of the burgers she had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, try it and tell me what you think later, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter passing it over, Akane turns determinedly towards her target destination, missing the blush from the Chinese girl as she continues her stride down the streets of Nerima.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, she'll find him and settle this once and for all.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n                             <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few minutes later, the two girls reach the park. Akane's hazel eyes looks around the area and halt once she sees the redhead sitting on the bricks under tree. The same place where she had gone when the bluenette had shared about her previous crush to Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He stills remember... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane turns to Shampoo who has still yet to eat her burger, holding onto it while looking downwards. She's a little curious about this behaviour but tells herself that she'll ask about it as soon as she's done talking with Ranma. Besides, she'll have to inform him that she'll be going over to Neko Hanten after this and might be home late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo?\" Akane calls, snapping the other girl's dull eyes to hers and passes the rest of the burgers Shampoo ordered to her. \"I'm going to have a little chat with Ranma, so you'll have to wait here.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Master leaving Shampoo?\" The said girl tears her eyes away, her gaze downcast even as she takes them from Akane. \"Not want Shampoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Akane shakes her head. Shampoo probably thought she was leaving her to fend for herself. \"Nah, I'm just going to talk with him. We can go to Neko Hanten once I'm done. So stay here until I call you, okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Shampoo nods. \"Shampoo wait here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane flashes the other girl a smile as she heads over to the one who is sulking under the tree, once again missing how Shampoo pulls the food close to her chest, face lit in a soft red. The navy haired girl is in a pretty good mood now but she schools her features into a much serious one when she nears Ranma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything, she places the bag of burgers down between them before sitting down. Then she opens the bag, grabbing a burger and chopping down once she removes part of the wrapper. Akane takes a few more bite before addressing to the redhead who still haven't lifts her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take one. It's better when it's hot.\" At the shake of Ranma's head, Akane tries again. \"Really? It's one of your favourites.\" When there isn't a reply, Akane sighs. It must be serious then, since he's not bickering with her as usual. Better get it out and over with. \"Alright, Ranma. What happened this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the redhead still refuses to answer, Akane's temper starts to spike. \"Ranma! You better answer me. Stop ignoring me already. I spent the whole morning searching for you without having breakfast. The least you can do is answer me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane was about to go on when a chocked sob reached her ears. Anger melting away, she puts her hands on her lap, food forgotten. \"I...Ranma, I'm sorry. Something must have happened to you that you would-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her words were cut off as the redhead frantically shakes her head. \"N-no, it isn't your fault, Akane. Don't blame yourself. I know I'm not a good enough wife for you yet. But!-\" At this, Ranma grabs her hands, lifting both them and the burger that she was eating. \"I promise I'll do my best! Kasumi-san said that she'll help me. P-please don't break our engagement...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that she was flabbergasted by Ranma's words would be a huge understatement.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBrown eyes widens so much to the point that the pupils start looking like tiny dots. It is as those her brain has short circuited from the amount of chaos that seems to be centred around <b>her</b> this time rather than Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching as the ever passionate martial artist become listless, Ranma panics. \"Akane?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Ranma doesn't get much of a chance to do anything else but leaping away from Akane when a chu\u00ed lands on the spot which she was still standing. Not long later, her attacker shows her face, grabbing the thrown weapon into her hands and readies her stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo?\" -is the astonish cry of Ranma as she readies her own defensive stance. \"Please calm down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you?\" The Chinese girl frowns as she stays on ground. \"What do to Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand... Shampoo, I'm Ranma.\" Though, her astonishment doesn't take long to give way to another feeling. \"And your weapon almost hit Akane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You not Airen. Have Girl-Type face. No act same.\" Then, the Amazon use the momentary distraction to launch one of her chu\u00ed(s) forward. \"Now die!\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma lets out an unladylike tsk as she dodges attacks coming from almost of all directions. The redhead had hoped that she could avoid from fighting but as her eyes lands onto Akane. She wouldn't leave her beloved, especially with a Shampoo who seems to be acting strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Ranma adjust her stance. She would protect her 'husband'. Just as she would when she was in trouble. If there's no other choice, Ranma will not back down.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Shampoo was told to wait, she listened. After all, her master had commanded it and reassured her that she would return soon. The Amazon was still slightly worried but since it was her Airen that she is meeting, she was sure that no true harm would occurred. It is then that she finally removes the wrapper from the food which her Master had introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food, strange as it is, is not really that good. Too much mayonnaise and the bun is much drier than she would like. A meat bun would be a better meal. However, it doesn't stop her from continuing her meal, trying to savour it. It is  a gift after all, one that she hasn't done anything of worth to receive, but still a gift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the foreign girl munches her food quietly and was about to finish her last bite when she hears her Master's shouts. Turning her gaze upwards, she narrows her eyes at the scene. Though when no fighting occurs, she watches them warily as she finishes her first burger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, within the time of throwing her wrapper away into a nearby bin, the redhead had gotten up and held the small hands that gave her such warmth in a brief amount of time. Her fury only grows when she heard the girl begging her Master not to break the engagement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma never begs. He is too prideful to say or do such a thing which it can only mean one thing. That person with her Master is an impostor and her Master is in danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Shampoo pulls out her chu\u00ed(s) and hurls one forward, making sure that the weapon's path would go nowhere near the bluenette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, faced with the fake, Shampoo is about to charge forward once again to clash with her opponent when her Master suddenly runs in between them shouting- \"STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great effort, Shampoo tries stopping her charge but the pull was too great so she lands straight onto her Master. So focused on making sure that her chu\u00ed(s) do not land on her Master, she doesn't realised how soft her landing is until a polite cough from above snaps her back to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, the Chinese girl quickly gets off and turns away to fight the heat that is rushing into her cheeks. What is wrong with her? Ever since her Master had first hold her hand, she has started to feel funny. It's as though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo?\" Her Master's voice cuts through as she feels herself automatically turning to face her. \"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is fine,\"  Though she frowns when she remembers what happened earlier. \"Should not have run in fight. Master lucky Shampoo no hurt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster looks away. \"I know. But it was the one thing that I could think of in the heat of the battle...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo has nothing else of worth to add to that so she scans her suroundings noting a missing person. Turning to her Master, she asks. \"Where Fake Girl Type?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a slight furrow in brows before she continues with her words. \"Oh, Ranma? I told him to go back home and that I'm going to Neko Hanten with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. She remembers Master talking about it before. \"Master want see Great Grandmother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo watches as the other blinks, then tilt her head to the side cutely. \"Hey Shampoo, don't take this the wrong way...But why are you calling me Master?\" -Then the navy haired girl covering her face with her hands, groaning- \"Nevermind, just don't call me that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese girls shakes her head. \"No call Master Master is disrespect. Shampoo good student. Shampoo respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sighs escapes the bluenette's lips. \"Fine. Let's just go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her Master leading the way, Shampoo starts feeling downcast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy is Master not smiling? She was so much happier earlier and now she is not. It was definitely that impostor's fault. Ever since she showed up, Master's mood hasn't been good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decides that she would have to be extra careful around that fake next time she sees her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wouldn't mind the silence between them much if it has been before she knew of how uplifting it was when her Master spoke to her with much cheer. <br>\r\nIt disturbs her for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo wants these feelings to end so she halts her stride, trying to say something. Though no matter how much she wills herself to do it, nothing came out of her mouth. Then, not wanting to be left behind, she looks up only to see her Master's face an inch from her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo?\" The corcern in her Master's voice stirs something inside of her. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo simply nods in answer. She doesn't want to burden or upset her Master anymore than she already has. The Chinese girl stares as the navy haired girl hums in acknowledgement and turns back around. However, just as she was about to continue walking, her Master suddenly bends down with her hands on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here. I'll carry you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-master?\" Shampoo sputters. \"Why carry Shampoo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't give me that.\" This time, the bluenette turns her head as much as she could to face her. \"I've noticed you've been leaning slightly more onto your left this whole time. My guess is that you got it when you fall on top of me earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo okay. Leg not hurt. Can walk fine.\" Shampoo tried to reason. But, Akane was having none or it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be so sturborn. You're only injured because you stopped yourself from hurting me. Let me just repay the favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a short while for Shampoo to reluctantly accept help. The Amazon would normally ignored such acts unless they were order from one of the elders or Ranma, and since this is her Master...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will let Master carry.\" After giving her affirmation, she slowly puts her legs through her Master's arms and held back a gasp when she feels them wrapped around her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the world feels like it has been sped up. Her head slightly dizzy as the pulse of her heart blocked out the sounds from her surrounding. She doesn't even realised that her Master has started moving until the other spoke once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo takes a deep breath before replying. \"Shampoo fine Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to keep calling me that.\" After a slight pause, her voice sounded much rougher, with more spirit. \"Or any of those other names. Like Violent Girl or Perv- Look, I have a name. Just call me that okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding against her back, Shampoo answers. \"Shampoo call Master Mistress now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nevermind.\" Akane just resigns at this point. \"Just leave it as it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~<br>\r\nIt takes a couple more minutes to reach Neko Hanten. Dimly, the Chinese girl notes the amount of customers inside and decides that it would be better from them to enter through the back door. When her Master agrees to her reasoning, she leads them to the back and asks to be let down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her feet are on the ground, Shampoo opens the unlock door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane raises a brow. \"You leave your door unlocked? What if there was a theif or someone dangerous around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo no worry. Can handle any intruder. Beat them up and throw outside. Never came back.\"<br>\r\nA sweat drop falls at her back of her head. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo is about turn when her Great-grandmother's voice came from beside her. \"Welcome back, great-granddaughter. I don't believe that you had said that you would be bringing... guests when you went out almost an hour ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, Oba-san.\" The bluenette greets, poking her head inside the open door frame. \"Sorry for intruding but something came up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you do and I will hear what you have to say. But first, Shampoo-\" The elder woman turns to her great-granddaughter, staring in her eyes before turning back to Akane. \"The thing you mentioned, it has something to do with Shampoo doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane nods her head. \"That's correct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is quite troublesome indeed,\" Cologne muses. \"Will she still be able to serve the customers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so... She was still able to fight Ranma earlier.\" With that said, Akane turns to Shampoo. \"Shampoo, are you still able to work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo fine,\" she affirms. \"Leg much better. Can serve customer but Master no leave Shampoo's sight. No safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCologne narrows her eyes at Akane. \"I think we have much to talk about later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo interrupts with a shake of her head. \"No Master fault. Master try stop Panty Thief. Shampoo careless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Amazon woman frown, glancing towards the kitchen then back to the both of them. \"We'll continue this conversation later. I doubt Mousse would last long at this hour without help.\" Then, she turns to Akane. \"It looks like you would have to help out too. After all, Shampoo would not go anywhere without you so the both of you will serve the customers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane sighs for the hundred time. \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a spare uniform upstairs. You can change there. Shampoo, I need you in the front now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great-grandmother-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will not hear it, child. The Tendo girl will be fine by herself upstairs.\" After saying this, the elder woman hops away on her stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great-grandmother no understand! Last time leave Master-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo,\" Akane calls, immediately getting the attention of said girl. \"I'll be fine. It's just upstairs and if anyone comes, I'll just kick them back outside. Even if it's Ranma.\" Shampoo is about to retort when her Master directs one of her dazzling smile. \"Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeterminedly, she looks up, searching those hazel hues for any sign of deceit. However, when she finds none and couldn't stand having puppy-like eyes gazing at her, she hesitantly nods. \"Shampoo wait in front. Shout if need help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" Akane affirms as she heads up the stairs. Though just before Shampoo enters the kitchen, she hears her Master voice saying a soft- \"Thank you, Shampoo.\" - with a rush of wind accompanying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she crosses pass the kitchen and to the front, Shampoo felt herself being covered with warm blankets and fluffy clouds. With a smile of her own, she greets and shares part of how she feels with those who chose to dine here this afternoon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although as soon as Shampoo relays the orders to the back, a shout of her name came from behind her. Instinctively, she jumps out of the way and when she looks back, Stupid Mousse is hugging one of the customers happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo! Where have you been? I missed you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut off by this display, she scoffs. \"No disturb paying customer meal or Duck Boy sleep in cage tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind boy pales as he quickly lets go, apologising to the person he hugged before called by great-grandmother for a delivery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo rolls her eyes as she continues her daily routine. She is glad that the blind boy would be out for awhile. Normally, she would volunteer for this job since it means she could keep away from annoying clingy duck. Though this time, she has her Master to worry about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no way she would leave her side willingly. With her out of sight, Shampoo starts becoming agitated. Crimson orbs would scan the dining area every few seconds, causing some of the customers to repeat themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is also well aware that her blunder didn't go unnoticed as she could feel the familiar twin eyes of the elder Amazon burning behind her back. However, in that moment, Shampoo's worry outweighs any punishment that her great-grandmother would dish out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, she doesn't have to wonder for long as her Master appears into sight, dressed appealingly in one of the store's spare cheongsams: a pretty light pink one accompanied by roses of the same hue and light blue leaves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here,\" Akane announces as she stand by the partition between the kitchen and the dining area. \"Where do I start first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCologne simply throws two plates of gyoza towards her. \"Table 3 and 6.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrown eyes widens as the navy haired girl struggles to catch both plate. She almost drops one to the floor but it is caught by Shampoo who passes it back to her Master, smiling in thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shout of her great-grandmother startles her. A furious glare greets her sight when the two pairs of eyes meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But great-grandmother, Mast-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No buts! If you really need to call her that, the Tendo girl must earn the right to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo frowns, great-grandmother is really pushing her buttons. Why can't the elder understand how she feels? It is her right-no, her duty to serve her Master. If this goes on, the young Amazon will put aside their relationship and leave here once and for-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right, Shampoo.\" Shampoo looks at her Master in disbelief as the girl's face sours. \"Although Oji-san is the one who did this to you, I should have put in more effort in helping you get out of your situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo vehemently denies this with the shake of her head. \"That no true. Master here find cure. No need help Shampoo at Neko Hanten but still do. Master no leave Shampoo or treat Shampoo badly. Even buy food for Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane's look softens. \"Shampoo...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stare at each other for a moment until suddenly cheers erupts around them, frightening both girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wooooah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a dream come true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great show girls!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the applause grows, so does the heat on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-perverts,\" Akane grumbles as she looks away. \"We'll talk later Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese girl manages a quick nod before her Master hastily scurries away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Akane flops tiredly onto a chair, exhausted both pysically and emotionally. She groans as she remembers how her day went as the customers were keen on teasing her about Shampoo. The fact that Shampoo does nothing to deny this, while continuously refering as her as Master, does nothing but fuel to her embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat's worst is that she has no way to vent her frustrations of the whole ordeal, thus making her quite irritated and tired from all of the pent up emotions. Deciding that this is a good moment to vent, Akane opens her mouth to shout when a blur of white grabs hold of her and squeeze her shoulders tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo! I heard nasty rumours that you now belong to the second-rate Tendo Akane. Tell me it's a lie!\"<br>\r\nSeveral veins pops outs visually as she slaps him. Hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Akane growls. \"Second-rate, am I?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just as quickly, Mousse jumps up to face her, multiple of knives poking out of his robe. \"Tendo Akane! I won't allow anyone else to have Shampoo! Not even it's a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Tendo martial artist prepares her stance and shouts back. \"Shampoo isn't mine! She doesn't being to anyone but herself! And being a girl has nothing to do with this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I should know,' Akane internally grumbles. 'Ranma's always been roping me into these kinds of messes, after all. Today more than others.'<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"For Shampoo, I won't hold back! Even it's a girl,\" Mousse yells, only to be him to be douche in water. His angry squawks are ignored as Shampoo grabs him by the neck and tosses him into a cage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" Shampoo jeers at him. \"Stupid Mousse sit in cage now. No wait tonight.\" The Chinese girl ignores the pleading squawks as she turns to her Master. \"Master want duck roast or braise? Shampoo know how cook both.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane sweat drops. \"No, thanks. I'm not that hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe navy haired girl watches as Shampoo snaps her fingers in disappointment before dropping the cage to the floor and kicks it away. She pities Mousse but this time, he sort of deserves it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, before she could comment on this, Cologne jumps towards them with her stick. \"Come, both of you. We'll discuss Shampoo's situation in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the store?\" Akane asks, gesturing the dining room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCologne ponders about it for a moment, then she turns back to them. \"Shampoo, watch the restaurant while we're away. I'm sure you'll be able to manage the place for awhile.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo angrily shouts. \"Great-grandmother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not take that tone with me, Shampoo. You are a Joketsuzoku and I am still the leader and your great-grandmother. You'll do well to remember that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane, sensing the tension between the two, stops and ponder on what she should do...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Once Cologne is far enough, Shampoo doesn't waste anytime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master no go alone. Many traps in basement. Master not know where avoid secret switch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Akane steadies her emotion before looking up to Shampoo, gesturing towards a nearby table and pulls out a chair to seat. She waits until the other girl has taken her girl before touching the heart of the matter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Shampoo,\" Akane begins firmly. \"I don't know what you had that makes you think that you need to guard me every minute but I am a martial artist. I can protect myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mas-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me finish.\" She interrupts, a frown visible on her face. \" Honestly, this whole thing that's going on is weird and I don't just mean you. I'm talking about Ranma too. Besides, your great-grandmother wouldn't ask you to stay without any reasons. This involves you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane pauses a moment to catch her breath, then continues. \"The point is, I'm going to help you. So, just trust me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo doesn't answer her immediately, sitting in silence as the bang of her hair overshadows her face. Though, Akane knows better than to say anything now.  She is asking a lot from Shampoo. Trust is not something that Akane takes lightly and she suspects that Shampoo is the same in this regard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane waits patiently as the other girls maintains her silence. Shampoo probably has a lot to mull over, at least that's what the youngest Tendo imagine. Those dull eyes of hers makes it rather difficult for her to decipher the other's thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is made even prominent when Shampoo suddenly gets up from her chair and closes the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Is she going to object and challenge me?' Akane ponders as she regards her with determination in her eyes. 'If she does, I will accept any challenges.  I'm still the heir of the 'Tendo Anything Goes Martial Art School' after all.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemaining in her seat, Akane doesn't hesitates as Shampoo's face is an inch from hers. Nevertheless, her harden gaze melts as the ever compassionate girl's eyes notes the subdued nature of the Amazon's crimson eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't right. No one should be subjected to this kind of treatment. Not even Shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll get you back to normal, Shampoo,\" The young martial artist declares, straightening her shoulders. \"I promise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to her greatest astonishment, Shampoo kiss her on the lip. A soft and tender touch that freezes her entire world as she is struck speechless for the second time today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShivers run up her spine as Shampoo whispers- \"Wo ai ni.\" - before backing up with an unmistakable smile on her face. Somehow, those eyes that were previously dull felt full of life now. It stuns her with how much love there is lit within them. \"Shampoo wait here. Come home soon Master.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beats of her heart doesn't fade as Shampoo slips away, heading towards the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmotions after emotions, all indescribable, piles up and steams through the skin of her ears.<br>\r\nAkane, being the bearer of all these emotions, does the one thing that she often does in these situations: with a lot of anger and denial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fist clamped onto the wooden material of the table, raising it up dangerously high to slam the living sense into the foreign girl. Though before she manages to do just that, her visions darkens and the last thing she feels is her navy hair whipping onto her face harshly. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But, that's- You saw!\" she sputters while her arms flail helplessly before covering her face, groaning loudly. \"I didn't know that was going to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps.\" Cologne takes another sip. \"But now, that's not what's important.\" The elder woman continues before Akane has a chance to interrupt again. \"As one of the  longest elder of the Amazon tribe, I specialise in many types of herbs and magical items. None of which that shows these kinds of effects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Amazon takes a moment to ponder, then regards Akane. \"Did Happy said anything about what she gave them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them?\" Akane blinks, then shakes her head. \"As far as I know, he only gave it to Shampoo. Something about a new recipe of the Student's Devotion Pill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... That pill is supposed to make the master and student inseparable. Physically, not mentally.\" The woman then eyes Akane. \"It is also done with oral intake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane sighs. \"He attacked me so I kicked him. I do remember accidentally swallowing something after that but he was heading straight to Shampoo so I forgotten about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Colgne explains. \"I need to know what Happy did to the pills before I can make something to counteract it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we are stuck until he shows his face again?\" Akane growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing a story, Cologne eyes her. \"Hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kicked him hard this morning,\" Akane sweat drops and finding the timber marks of the table interesting. \"He may not be back until school starts on Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Cologne gets onto her stick and hops of the chair. \"I suppose we'll talk more later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Ranma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what is going on with him?\" At the shake of Akane's head, Cologne shakes her head. \"Then, you'll have to find out.

Temporarily until a solution comes up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's coming back with me?\" Akane pales. \"Can't she stay here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCologne gives her a looks that convey- 'Do you think she would?' - and that is enough to warrant another sigh.<br>\r\nAkane relents. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Akane's reply, Cologne gestures her to follow, signalling the end of the conversation.

Strangely, Shampoo is no where to been seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas she left?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus, she immediately calls for the Chinese girl and only when the girl answers her call that her hearts stops thumping. Akane notes the old crone's eyes on her again and huffs, trying to retort when a pair of arms suddenly wraps around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master back.\" Akane could feel her face flushing rapidly as things abruptly seems intimidate. \"Is very worry when no come back so long. Shampoo glad Master safe.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords fail her as Akane once again has to work through the torrent of emotions within herself. It is then with great effort that she manages to stumble out, \"S-Shampoo. Please let go of me. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the foreign girl releases her hold, the navy haired girl takes another breath and starts again. \"L-listen.\" Not that it is doing her any better. \"I'm going to make a call. Could you just wait here? Just a few more minutes. I really need to talk to someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take Shampoo long to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo trust Master.\" Shampoo looks away, her hair covering her features . \"Is lonely but Shampoo know Master no leave without tell Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo...\" This time, Akane's hand reaches out, willing the other to look as she explains herself. \"I did promise to help you. I will try. No matter how awkward it is.\" Another sigh. It doesn't automatically means that it would be any easier for her. \"Just five minutes more, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane only releases her hand when she's gotten the okay. Briefly, she asks the elder if she could use the phone and a point of her wooden stick shows her the direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she is faced to the phone, she dials the number which she has memorized by heart, her insides churning as the levers of the circle returns to its origin point. Each one grating on her nerves until she is done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute pass and when someone finally picks up, Akane hears.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is just too much at stake, even if it means that she would have to start saving up her allowances again for the next shopping trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabiki onee-chan, it's me.\" Akane said. \"I'm coming home now and we're going to have another guest over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another stray, huh?\" Rather than being angry like Akane thought she would be, Nabiki's question held a curious tone. \"Who is it this time? Gee Akane, if I didn't know any better, I might think that maybe Ranma's not doing much in trying to be a good wife~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nabiki!\" Akane shouted. \"It's not funny!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe should have known that Nabiki of all people would find out about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right.\" A pause. \"It's not funny, it's hilarious.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAkane could feel her anger rising as she struggles not to crush the phone in her hands. Already there were small lines forming near her fist. Though before it gets worse, she takes a few deep breaths and tries to calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something's wrong Nabiki!\" Akane stresses, trying not to be too loud. \"I don't what's wrong with Ranma but Oji-san did something to Shampoo. Now she feels that she has to protect me like I can't defend myself. So many things happened and I'm just so angry!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories from earlier this day start emerging into her mind. From the very first moment when she kicked the old leech until in Neko Hanten where she was kissed and confessed by the place's own waitress. The declaration of love. The tenderness in her eyes and the softness of such a brief touch upon her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo didn't know what she was doing. Cologne claims that the young Amazon had a higher resistance to these sort of...'things'. But, the kiss just threw that out assumption of the window. Does Shampoo really feel that way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Of course not.<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\nAnger forgotten, the youngest Tendo sister tries to hold back her tears. \"I really want to help them Nabiki. Even Shampoo. But I just don't know how. Cologne doesn't know for sure and Oji-san is nowhere near here now. I just don't know what to do.\" Then, she wipes away the wetness on her cheeks, doing her best to sound normal. \"Nabiki onee-chan, please... I need help.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long silence from the other side once she has finished. Only the lack of the end call tone reassures Akane that her sister hasn't hand up the phone. Her sniffles didn't help her as she continues to wait for something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds felt like hours and Akane was about to hang up when Nabiki's voice stops her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did something happened between you and Shampoo?\" This time, her older sister's voice sounded much serious. Something more considerate. \"Do you want to talk about it? I can head over there in a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouched, and slightly surprised by Nabiki's insight, Akane smiles. \"I'm f-...I'm not hurt, onee-chan. But I do want to talk to someone about this. You don't need to come. Shampoo and I are coming in a bit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Nabiki heard her little stumble in her answer, she doesn't mentioned it. \"Right. Just come to my room later, we'll talk there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane nods, then remembering that she was on the phone, she replies, \"Okay... Oh, and tell Kasumi onee-san to add one more set for dinner tonight. Shampoo's staying over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hearing Nabiki's confirmation, they said their good byes and Akane finally ends the call. Turning around, she enter the bathroom to freshen herself before heading back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lightly slapping her face and a few deep breaths later, Akane felt more or less ready to face reality again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the Tendo heir refuses to give up that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is only after she leaves the washroom that she noticed that it has been way or the time that she had told Shampoo to wait. The cat-shaped clock pointing towards the beginnings of evening light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcerned, Akane quickly makes her way downstairs in search of the Chinese girl. To her relief, she found Shampoo in her dazed state expertly chopping a whole basin of vegetables in equal and bite-sized portions. It doesn't take the waitress more than a few seconds to finish slicing several stalks of spring onions before moving on to the next batch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting off the jealous tinge, Akane decides to wait at one of the tables until Shampoo is done before heading home. It was the least she could do, especially since the girl has trusted her enough in that protective state to let her calm down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her boredom of waiting, Akane's thoughts starts to wander towards a certain lavender haired foreigner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly, Akane doesn't have the best of impressions of Shampoo since the two were always butting heads one way or the other. Despite helping one another occasionally, she hasn't sit down to consider what it would have been like if the two got along with each other. It certainly makes her wonder if the two could somehow get along, even when this whole 'thing' is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is also another thing that bothers her too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could try Cologne's suggestion and observe what happens. Although, Akane wasn't sure if Shampoo would be willing to harm her 'Master'. And what about the thing that old pervert did to the pills?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands in her cheeks, she continues to grind until a voice shocks her from her reprieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo done. Ready go now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStilling her heart, Akane gives a short reply. \"Okay, let's go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gleam catches her eyes as she stands. In Shampoo's hands were the familiar metal box with foreign strokes. Curious, Akane questions this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to do a delivery first? I'll go with you. I can use the exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShampoo shakes her head. \"No delivery. Great grand mother give <i>bao</i> since Shampoo sleep at Tendo house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to,\" Akane says with a shake of her head. \"I would have let you stay either way. It was partly my fault that all this happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore leaving herself to feel down again, Akane leaps out of her seat, not hearing the start of Shampoo's sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, Shampoo.\" The navy haired girl motions her to follow before starting her walk back home. \"It's really getting late and Dad is going to be worried if I don't even make it back for dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Akane continues her walk. Her mind wandering as they passes familiar routes she has taken since she was a child. Once again, it goes back towards the one who was following her. In truth, when she thinks about it, Akane doesn't know the foreign girl except for the fact that she was always interested in Ranma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing her like this however, she tries to imagine what Shampoo is like without Ranma only to come up blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shampoo.\" Akane partially looks over to girl as she walks. \"Can you tell me about yourself? I want to know more about you. Or maybe any stories that you like to share? I remember you listening to my long rant earlier at the burger place. I could return the favour and listen this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo no mind listen.\" Akane nods as she turns to focus to the road in front of them. \"Story interesting. Shampoo happy Ma-... Akane told Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Something usually cut me off from finishing but I'm here if you need someone to talk to...\" Then, with widen brown eyes, Akane whirls around. \"Shampoo? Did you just call me by my name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young Tendo's delight grows as Shampoo confirms her previous words. Maybe what Cologne had said was true. Maybe Shampoo's not too far gone after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Shampoo!\" Eager hands reach out and cup the other's ones, dangling in the space between them. \"You're starting to resist the pill. I'm so glad for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she revels in this new discovery, Shampoo smiles. \"Shampoo tell story now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappily giving her affirmation, Akane pulls the Chinese girl along; their feet bringing them home as the other retells a tale from her past.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I have search for you near and far only to finally be reunited...\" Then, she turns to glare at Shampoo. \"Only to find you trapped and forced to be within this harlot's grasp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Akane could form a retort to such a ridiculous sentence, the Amazon beside her draws her Ch\u00fai and stands in front of her, voice filled with shocking venom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo no tell Master what to do! Crazy Girl leave or Shampoo kill!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKodachi, unlike Akane, simply sneers. \"Such crudeness. I suppose that it is to be expected from one with such boorish background.\" Kodachi pauses for a moment to fling a bouquet which Shampoo immediately bats away. \"You are but a weed in a garden of roses, marring the flowers' beauty by being in the presence of my beloved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, something in Shampoo snaps and the Amazon launches herself at the gymnast, bellowing- <b>\"Die Crazy Girl!\"</b>   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane's eyes twitches as she watches the two battle, jumping from place to place leaving destruction in their wake. At this point, Akane finally had enough about this whole day. She just wants to go home and have a nice bath before dinner.

I didn't see where I was going,\" Akane apologises and holds out her hand to pull the other up... to find that she actually knows this person. \"Ukyo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sugar,\" the brunette answers, eyes darting around before meeting hers. \"Nice evening, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been a long day.\" At that, Akane sigh. Ukyo probably has it easier than her today. \"How's things at the restaurant today?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, about that.\" The chef visibly calms, even cracking a small smile. \"There wasn't much customers today. Word is that Cat Cafe's new waitresses are rather close so I guess they were curious. They must be doing another event again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane sweat drops. \"Oh. Well, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I saw you walking back with Shampoo earlier,\" Ukyo places a hand on her chin, looking interested. \"In fact, Kodachi's getting pretty close to you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing like that!\" Akane vehemently denies, her face in several shades of her namesake. \"Kodachi must have eaten something bad and is hallucinating now. I wasn't even anywhere close to her for weeks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUkyo's look turn curious. \"You didn't say anything about Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have anything to say about her.\" Akane turns away, not wanting to face the brunette. \"And it's late, so I'm going home now. Bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, she gives a short wave and quickly makes her way home. After all, there wasn't anything between them, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~~~~~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes later, without anymore interruptions, Akane makes it home. Exhausted, the Tendo sighs in relief when she got there, pushing the slide to get in and announced that she is home. She could imagine how nice the bath would feel after along day and had not notice the person kneeling at the front until-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home,\" Ranma greets her from floor, a smile pulling on her lips daintily. \"I have the bath ready for you when I heard that you're coming home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, Akane just stares as the other gets up and holds out her hands. \"I can help you take your bag upstairs if you want. There's clothes in there and um....\" Ranma's gaze went downwards, hands wringing. \"Kasami-san helped me take them down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Akane doesn't know why she bothers trying to understand things anymore. Things haven't been the same ever since Ranma came. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Ranma did prepare the bath for her and he was thinking about her for once. Trying to help even when he's definitely not normal right now. She should probably thank him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't want touch them,\" Ranma adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that thought was broken immediately with those words. Her fury ignites as she pulls out her mallet and glares sending him through the roof bellowing- \"RANMA, YOU JERK!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill fuming with anger, she stomps away, heading for her room. She throws her bag onto her table and screams into her pillow, which helps a little. When she's a little calmer, she grabs her towel and leaves her room stopping a moment after she realises something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma's still a jerk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when he's acting strange, he's still a jerk. In some part, Akane is a bit relief. At least some things doesn't change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she is about to walk to the bath, twin hazel eyes caught sight of Nabiki's nameplate. She had told her sister that she'll talk to her about this and the older sibling had sounded concerned to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she see her now or wait until after her bath?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'll find her sister and talk to her soon. Just not when she's sweaty and stinky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take the girl long to reach the bath, happy to be resting in the tub while she exhales happily as the heat seeps into her skin.

Top to bottom until the dining area sparkles like a newly opened place. Nevertheless, with nothing to do after a minute, her jitters returns. Her twin maroon eyes often darting towards the direction with leads to the basement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she has accepted her Master's proclamation of trust and relented from following her, Shampoo still worries. Great-grandmother is not someone to be taken lightly and from what Shampoo has seen, the elder does not approve. Therefore, it is with great caution that the young Amazon presses her ears onto the door to try and listen for any sound that would signal their arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she does not expect is to eavesdrop on an ongoing conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-remind you, young Tendo, that this might break the artifact's spell on Shampoo. If you are still offended, remember that this 'accident' is still partially your fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to keep reminding me about it but she appeared out of nowhere and I already promised to help.\" Shampoo hears a loud exasperated huff. \"It's just- I don't like that I have to be beaten by Shampoo. Isn't there another way? An Amazon secret that would help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" The firm tone only confirms that this is her great-grandmother. \"Unless <i>he</i> 'shows his face again' as you put it, this is the only way. You have to let Shampoo beat you then the Student-Master ties would be broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the sound of hopping came closer, Shampoo quickly leaves. grabbing a cloth on the way to the dining area and starts wiping the table. Before long, Shampoo hears her Master's call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo? Are you here?\" It is when the navy haired girl appears that everything in her world feels right again. Shampoo answers the call, dropping the cloth and approaches them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master back.\" Then without hesitation, Shampoo wraps her arms around her Master, making sure that they were gentle. \"Is very worry when no come back so long. Shampoo glad Master safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hardly notices the sputters until her ears recognizes them. \"S-Shampoo. Please let go of me. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she steps back but the lingering warmth from that brief touch brings a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-listen.\" Shampoo notes that her Master's voice is different somehow, and judging from what she had heard, it probably has something to do with that. Or she might have to cook a remedy for a sore throat. \"I'm going to make a call. Could you just wait here? Just a few more minutes. I <b>really</b> need to talk to someone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Master needn't explain herself. After all... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo trust Master.\" Then, she gives a sad smile. \"Is lonely but Shampoo know Master no leave without tell Shampoo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shampoo...\" A hand lands onto her shoulder, startling the Amazon as she looks up to sure brown oak eyes. \"I did promise to help you. I will try. No matter how awkward it is.\" Another sigh. \"Just five minutes more, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Shampoo nods and only then did the bluenette leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with only her great-grandmother being the other person in the area, Shampoo contemplates whether to speak with the elder or not. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Already five minutes no come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she leaves, feeling a pair of eyes on her back briefly before it vanishes. It doesn't take Shampoo long to reached the phone, her eyes catching the familiar hue of dark navy blue. Though as she opens her mouth to call out, her sharp ears picked up faint whimpers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorried, she approaches the area slowly, finding herself accidentally listening to another conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to help them, Nabiki.\" The despair in her voice makes Shampoo winced. \"Even Shampoo. But I just don't know how. Cologne doesn't know for sure and Oji-san is nowhere near here now. <i>I just don't know what to do</i>.\" As tears started rolling down her Master cheeks, Shampoo's willing her feet to move. \"Nabiki onee-chan, please...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sharp pain strikes her chest as her Master's voice breaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I need help.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling becomes even worse when the bluenette fell to her knees, a palm closing her mouth as she struggles to keep her breath from hitching. The foreign girl may not understand much of Japanese customs, but she does know when someone is trying to be stronger than they actually are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heart wrenches and aches to race over there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what would she do? What can she do when the reason why her Master was crying is because of her?<br>\r\n  <br>\r\nUnable to take in the sight and the pain much longer, Shampoo finally found some courage to head over when a wooden staff blocks her way. Indecision plagues her as Cologne shakes her head and motions for her to follow. Her eyes keep lingering on the crying figure on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come child.\" It was stern and yet soft at the same time. \"Give her more time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Shampoo reluctantly follows her great grandmother downstairs and back into the kitchen where the two mostly worked in silence. Not even the pleading squawks manage to irk her as she continues prepping for the dinner hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometime later, Shampoo manages to finish and was about to leave when a metal box dangles in front of her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it with you when you leave.\" Nodding, Shampoo grabs the box and found a few bamboo baskets within them. \"Since you'll be staying there as her guest-\" Cologne nods her head over to one of the table where her Master is sitting, her face slightly better than before. \"-give them to the Tendo family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaying her thanks, Shampoo quickly heads out, hoping to find some way to cheer her Master up.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Ranma just looked at her mommy bouncing on her feet excited to play \u201ckitchen\u201d with her mommy but she knew she had new sisters to play with too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi walked into Nabiki\u2019s room and noticed an awful smell coming off her. Nabiki just giggled innocently and tried reaching for her new mommy and Kasumi picked her up and changed her into new panties she could wear until Kasumi stocked up on diaper\u2019s that her new \u201cdaughters\u201d would be needing until they were potty trained properly. She did notice though that Ranma was acting much older than Nabiki but figured it must have been due to Ranma getting a bit more resistance after being brainwashed multiple times while Nabiki had only been hypnotized when she was younger to be a cheerleader so Nabiki regressed further. After Kasumi changed Nabiki she began to move to Akane\u2019s room with Ranma holding her hand and Nabiki propped up on her bed safely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi died notice Akane drooling with a big open mouthed smile even though she had messed her clothes just like her sister. Kasumi changed Akane while she babbled innocently but did consider trying to regress Ranma a bit more while locking her curse. Kasumi finished cleaning up Akane and walked Ranma to her room to use the locking ladle water that Ranma had given her after the musk incident to have in an emergency. Kasumi knew that the old Ranma Saotome was well and gone, while Ranma Tendo had been bored with a much more happy little girl who had zero need to turn into a boy ever again. She did know that she needed a way to justify pulling her little girls out of high school but she also knew her kids would probably be a bit of a problem with the parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi splashed Ranma with the water from the locking ladle with a grin on her face knowing that the dumb boy who disturbed the piece was gone and replaced with a docile girl who would definitely have no need for martial arts in her life, same as Akane and Nabiki. Akane didn\u2019t need to learn how to be a martial artist, while Nabiki would never try to use money for bad things or blackmail. Nabiki would be a bit air headed after Kasumi got a new tape for her, and Akane could be the sisters leader who Nabiki and Ranma could look up to. She saw Ranma\u2019s almost glazed eyes and knew that a small bit of the old Ranma was still in the so she let Ranma sit on her bed with the headphones clearing her up of any confusion. Ranma drooled and repeated the instructions absentmindedly with glazed eyes. Kasumi tooks her sisters and debated whether she honestly wanted to use the mushrooms on her babies or not. After all Kasumi knew Ranma was adorable as she acted like a toddler even if her body was an adults. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi decided to...</span></div></div>",

Shampoo beat you airen and give you formula 119.\u201d Yelled Xian Pu determined. \u201cAs you wish, this unit will punish you for delaying its mission parameters.\u201d Droned the empty headed Ranma-robot who immediently began to attack shampoo far more efficiently than it could have before she was converted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma-bot began to land more and more blows on the amazon, until Xian Pu landed a blow on her abdomen follwed by a kick to her left leg. Ranma-bot Responded by jumping high and preparing for an aerial assault on the amazon, and began to kick shampoo as it was falling, and as it landed did a hand-spring to get back up on its feet showing no signs of weariness. Xian Pu however had been hit with many of Ranma-bots blows and was becoming very exhausted, so she decided to try to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma-bot noticed that Xian Pu was attempting to run away, and immediently moved to intercept the amazon girl, ready to retreave a collar. Xian Pu was immediently struck in her left tibia by Ranma-bot as she began to try to run away. Ranma immediently retreived a collar to use on the downed amazon, and immediently placed it around Xian Pu\u2019s neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShampoo no understand, why have you become so so much better? Shampoo know you not this good before, hey what yo do? Stop thaaaaaa\u201d questioned shampoo until the collar emptied her mind out. \u201cEnemy girl efficiently taken down and upgraded, this unit must anort current mission so that it can report its victory to one if its owners\u201d droned the mindless Ranma-bot who immediently began marching to its new home, the kuno household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma-bot began to march the obedient Xian Pu to meet with their owner when Xian Pu was splashed with cold water and turned into her cursed form. Ranma-bot mindlessly pucked up Xian Pu ragardless of her former selfs terror of cats, so that she may optimize the time it will take to arrive at its destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Ranma-bot make it easily?

However when she arrived, she was shocked to see the harlot holding a cat and walking the worthless chef who humiliated her time and time again. She could understand the peasant but why was the robot holding a cat? She decided to ask her robot for an explantion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHohoho i see you have returned with a worthless peasant chef, and a cat. Explain your reasons immediently and explain why you mind controlled a cat!\u201d Kodachi demanded her robot to explain, who mindlessly stood there.\u201dOwner Kodachi second in charge of the perfect glorious house or kuno, second only to Master Tatewaki, i was executing my mission parameters efficiently when this barbarian wretch attempted to run me lbver with a bike.\u201d Explained Ranma-bot mindlessly until she was interrupted by kodachi. \u201cExplain yourself how can a cat run you over with a bike? Its just a cat afterall.\u201d Demanded kodachi angrily. Ranma-bot mindlessly said \u201cmaster this cat is the worthless barbarion wretch who denied you your justly deserved ranma sama. She has a jusenkyo curse that turns her into a cat when splashed with cold water, and turn into a human girl when splashed with hot water.\u201d Mindlessly explained Ranma-bot to her perfect Mistress. Kodachi could barely believe what she was hearing, a curse that changes shape with warm and cold water? She demaneded her robot to explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou harlot, prove it by turning her human, and identify every cursed person you were aware of before i showed you what you were born for! Hohoho\u201d cackled kodachi thinking her robot malfunctioned but willing to let her robot attempt to prove the curse existed. \u201cAffirmative mistress Kodachi, i will prove this curse existed as you require. May i enter the kitchen and fetch cold water and hot water my mistress?\u201d Droned Ranma-bot obediently, requesting access to the kitchen from her owner. \u201cSo be it, fetch 4 glasses 2 cold 2 hot and return to me immediently my robot.\u201d Kodachi agreed and sent her bot to fetch the supplies.

May i have permiseion to prove this curse exists to the glorious house of kuno?\u201d Requested the robot. \u201cHurry up my former harlot, show me this curse isnt nonsense.\u201d Ordered kodachi of her pet. Ranma-bot mindlessly went to the cat that was just sitting without a mind and poured hot water onto its head. Xian Pu mindlessly sat there as she turned human before kodachi\u2019s eyes. \u201cNo way, no Way that cat turned human, how, WHO ELSE CAN DO THIS YOU STUPID ROBOT?\u201d Screamed kodachi at the mindless robot who immediently reported each and every one of the cursed jusenkyo victims. \u201cyou mean you really were my Ranma-sama? Now way, that means that you werent the perfect man i though you were prove it! Now you stupid robot!\u201d She screamed to Ranma-Bot who minelessly did as she was told and transformed herself. \u201cMy ranma sama can turn into a girl? Incredible, so that means you arent even a man anymore, turn back you belong as a woman, now i think im gonna program these stupid girls.\u201d Angrily grumbled kodachi, and she immediently began to program Xian Pu into her pet catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou worthless barbarian wretch dare to act as my equal? Hohoho then perhaps ill make you into the very animal you turn into, those smug cats that love to be pampered, you will wipe everything human from your mind, and become a cat, a simple housecat without the ability to fight and terrified of my dog nabiki over there. You will be timid, affectionate, and little more than my pet now bow you stupid snimal to me, your perfect owner.\u201d Xian Pu easily took to her new programming, and began to purr and kodachi's leg and wiped out her human personality entirely. Kodachi immediently moved on to ukyo \u201cand you worthless peasant, will wipe anything that doesnt involved cooking, bathrooms, talkings, and servitude out of your mind, not that you had much of one Hohoho. You dont know any life but of servitude and you love it more than anything, you will learn more recipes than just that lowly okonomiyaki and will cook and serve me anything i so desire, you will wear a maids outfit and will clean around the manor whenever you are not required to cook. You are property of house kuno, nothing more, do you understand?\u201d Programmed Kodachi into Ukyou\u2019s mind and ukyo accepted all of her owners words easily and immedientlywent to the kitchen to cook dinner mindlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that kodachi knows about the curses and has rejected ranma, maybe she should order her robot to place a collar around Tatewaki\u2019s neck to take control of house kuno for herself. But she removes th3 collars from the necks of ukyo and Xian Pu and hands them to ranma, asking if she had a mother. \u201cYes mistress kodachi this unit has a mother.\u201d Mindlessly responded Ranma-bot to her owner who decided she would send ranma after her mother first. \u201cInteresting, wel, this shall be a show of how loyal your programming is, you will place this collar around your mothers neck, program her to be a robot like you, remove the collar and capture the tendo girls. Do you understand my lowly robot? Hohoho\u201d kodachi asked before cackling madly. \u201cYes mistress Kodachi, i will place a collar around my mothers neck, program her to be your robot, removed the collar and send her to you.\u201d Confirmed the mindless robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma immediently sets out to its mothers home so that its may obey its orders.

He decided to keep his new slaves as just that but he would allow them to go to school with highly inproved personalities to keep up appearances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKuno decided that with so many of his new pets under control of the mind control collars he shoul designate purposes for each of them within his house and outside of it, he assigned nodoka, kasumi and ukyo to be chefs, but when not cooking would be maids, he designated kodachi would be dropped form school and become a full time maidservant of lower rank to sasuke, that akane tendo would be his personal bimbo slave but Ranma-bot would be his public girlfriend,nabiki and Xian Pu would remain his pets, but Xian Pu would be capable of acting slightly human to pleasure him, However nabiki would be mindless at all times except for pleasuring him, or while acting like his new harem girl alongside Ranma-Bot and bimbo Akane, but all three would publically state that they worship Tatewaki Kuno and cheer him on in all matters.

The only members of my harem at this moment are the pigtailed grl, akane tendo, the pigtailed girls mother nodoka tendo, and my sex kitten shampoo, of course i might decide to expand hahaha.\u201d Declared kuno the the shocked class. Before the class could respond further, miss hinako came in to teach the class, but had heard kuno\u2019s explanation and decided to give the former delinquents a chance. She decided she would approve so long as they didnt cause any trouble, as ar as she was concerned the girls belonged to him. But even with this decision, she asked Ranma-bot \u201cso i hear you 3 now belong to Tatewaki-kun?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes miss himaki, we have been highly improved personality wiise, intelligence wise i am smarter and far more loyal to my PERFECT boyfriend, and i have been order to work harder in all classes, my beloved has assured i can be nothing but an honor student.\u201d Declared Ranma-bot happily giggling to the classes shock. \u201cMy precious sister akane was improved as her mind was erased and replaced with a more submissive, peaceful, and less intelligent version of herself, however even with this she is still going to be a far more respectful student as any less disirable traits such as modesty, she can no longer be distracted from fulfilling our beloveds desires which are for us to be perfect schoolgirls, laziness, drowsiness, all emotions outside of happiness, lust, and love have been seemed unneeded and were erased, these traits have been replaced with her now heavy desire to please master Tatewaki in all things, and through him you, she is dumber but will try twice as hard, eagerness to work wherever she is needed, and will use her former gorilla strength to help our newly improved sisters in maintaining our beloved masters mansion. We are far happier according to our memories, and will never cause you isdue so long as you do not affect our master, in which we will do everything necessary to punish your actions which are beginning but not limited to, punches, kicks, being throw out of your classroom window, and should you drain us, we have been ordered to upgrade your mind and body to serve our master at our new home, when not teaching classes.\u201d Happily declared the childishly happy redhead with a huge smile on her her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinako was interested with the new ranma and akane, but confused on why tatewaki-kun would bring his new dog to school then, since nabiki was happily seated on Tatewaki\u2019s leg licking his face and decided to vocalize this question. To her surprise the new and improved akane raised her hand like a little girl yelling\u201dooh ooh i know i know! Pick me pick me!\u201d She urged her surprised teacher. \u201cGo on ahead akane dear, im sure we would ALL like to know why after all.\u201d She said to her...new Student \u201cMaster says nabiki was a very bad girl who treated people like they were dogs before she was taught how that she was a dog who lived for her owner. Master panpere her lots and lots since she was his closest friend till she became a doggy, but even if she was a dog for the rest of her life, she still needs to know what you teach us! Master says in class she will be human but after she will be a doggy for me and my big sister RanRan to play with. We are lots better than before, master didnt take akything he sidnt deserve for all the money he has spent on both of us, and we are da happiest we have ever been. RanRan doesnt have to be an icky boy anymore and thinks like a girly girl only, and biki doesnt care bout money anymore hehe\u201d giggled the improved akane with an incredibly stupid but happy smile on her face, and she and ranma held hands giggling as they looked at their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiss hinako decided she definitely prefered the new students but warned Tatewaki that she would in fact support the girls far more likeable ew selves only so long as nobody caused any trouble and no fighting unless given permission. Tatewaki could barely believe his luck and agreed to his teachers conditions. The class was shocked into silence at how different ranma and akane had become, but sdmitted to themselves they WERE more likeable like this since tatewaki admitted to improving the entire nerima bunch outside of mu tsu and ryoga, so the fights would calm down pretty soon AND since ranma thought like a girl but as kuno as master, perhaps they could catch some...glimpses hehehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miss hinako was pleased to see that ranma was heavily improved like she said, shecwas respectful, disnt sleep through class and only found to serve her master. Nabiki and akane were just as improved, since while nabiki was still a dog, she worked hard on all assignments so far and paid attention to miss hinako dutifully. Akane however got dumbed down alot, but worked harder than before, paid attention, and desperately wanted to serve her master and please her big sister ranma, so all in all this is a far more improved and less volotile, more likeable version of the girls. Tatewaki it would seem has tamed the \u2018nerima wrecking bunch\u2019 entirely and as a result if he decides to let his girls go to school, at least ranma was smart enough to go. However she waas conflicted since allowing these girls to be slaves to kuno might be a moral issue, as far as she was concerned Tatewaki had made a vast improvement to these girls, including nabiki who DID deserve alot of punishment. She made a decision to meet with Tatewaki-kun after class to work with him so he can avoid trouble from the girls upgrades, and ask about living arrangements, diets, and if they were allowed thought outside of school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end of class came fairly soon, and while the class was wary of Tatewaki\u2019s harem, they did not want to get into trouble. They all of course felt sorry for the former man, but DID agree that the new ranma was a vast improvement in every way possible, even she worshipped her former foe and massive pervert kuno now. As the class was leaving still horrified at Tatewaki\u2019s harem but coming to accept that there was nothing they could do, a few of nabiki\u2019s friends decided to go to the tendo dojo and report to the girls fathers who were skilled martial artists and could free ranma if nothing else and attemp to free her new sisters. However in the mean time, they had a small break before they had to return to class. \u201cTatewaki-kun please stay after class so that we may discuss your pets and choices to help you avoid trouble for this. Your pets can stay too.\u201d Ordered hinako to the leaving Tatewaki. \u201cYes miss hinako? Why do you want me to stay? I had assumed you accepted the new girls and understood they belong to me. Even if i wanted too, which i dont, the former girls would not accept being reduced to their former selves after these upgrades and would still serve me.\u201d Declared the kuno leader, removing a collar from his bag discetely intending to upgrade his teacher\u2019s attitude against him, even if she did want to help him she would better off as his. \u201cTatewaki-kun you have to understand that enslaving these girls will have consequences. I agree that the girls here havea better personality, but even so many will not see it that way. You have to compromise with me even if you can avoid issue because of your wealth, these girls had their own lives and those need to be acknowledged even if they dont live them anymore to tie up loose ends.\u201d Explained the childlike hinako.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so miss hinako, its not like they will question my orders in the slightest, if i say they should take control of any issues they will, after all my pigtailed girl converted her mother for the sole purpose of servitude to house kuno. Tis hardly anthing that will defy me as all of my worthy adversaries are now servants of house kuno, even my formerly foul sister who no longer experiments with poisons and simply cleans, serves food, and serves my will. I tamed these fiery tigresses and ghelped them become fine members of house kuno haha. All of these girls are members of house kuno and exist only to serve. The same purpose as you will exist to serve hahaha.\u201d Explained Tatewaki before rushing miss hinako to snap a collar on in her surprise. \u201cTatewaki you will NOT mind control mr, i am your ally dont you get it? I agree with your improvements and i will hardly be as helpful mindless, now wiiiiiiii\u201d hinako said until her mind fell to her new master who immediently began programming her to be a far more respectful and obedient teacher who lived fir nothing but to please her master. By the time class was beginning she had less of an opinion than nabiki. Tatewaki had assured he had a good teacher who would treat his slaves as they are and would not do anything she wasnt told except follow procedure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello class i am Hinako kuno from now on and i am the newly improved and will be a far better teacher. You may see i am the property of tatewaki now, but i am far mkore qualified as a teacher now since i cant think of anything that doesnt onvolve helping my students anymore. Now class open your textbooks and start reading at...\u201d declared the ecstatic Hinako who loved her master and loved being a teacher more than before. The class was horrified to see hinako become a kuno, but would go along with it thinking they were now safe from punishment and from being mind controlled. The class soon came to a close and the class began to leave outside the classroom, hinako smiled blissfully at her new purpose in life. Ranma happily skipped to her teacher and gave her a hug welcoming her as her little sister, and kuno declared that hinako was the lowest ranked member of house kuno but would get to sleep in the same bed alongside the improved and reprogrammed kodachi and a desk delivered to grade papers and of course pass his girls without the answers being right or wrong. She did not need to be apart of his maid staff yet cnsidering she was not good enough eye candy to see her on an everyday schedule. Hinako smiled stupidly and agreed with her master in all things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatewaki was walking home until a certain lost by appeared yelling to ranma\u201dRanma saotome prepare to die, unknowing of her being apart of the noble kuno family now and what has transpired over the past few days. Ranma looked at Ryoga innocently and at her beloved for permission to figyt the rage filled ryoga. Tatewaki of course gave full permission to ranma who jumped at ryoga striking with far greater skill than she ever had as ranma saotome and drove ryoga back. Ryoga bean to notice Ranma was fighting differently and how she asked Kuno for permission and saw nabiki and akane watching with innocent smiles as well as miss hinako with a dumb grin. \u201cRanma? What in the world is going on? Why would you ask KUNO of all people for permission to fight? Why would you need his permission? Dont you hate him after all? And not only that why is your fighting style so different from normal?\u201d Demanded the confused Ryoga at see Ranma so carefree, innocent and asking kuno for permission to fight wanted to know what was going on and why akane and nabiki didnt say a word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is simple Ryoga Hibiki, hehehe i asked Tatewaki for permission because he is my perfect opinion and my master in all things and i must serve his will. My fighting style is different because i am a girl now and need to fight like one in all ways and of course i dont hate my perfect, and absolutely awe i spiring master so obviously deserving of respect. Hehe you were my old self\u2019s best friend and i want to offer you a chance to serve my home of glorious house kuno of which i, Ranma Kuno serve with all my empty mind! Hehehe\u201d giggled Ranma happily hugging her gestest fridnd in the whole wide world. \u201cBig brother ryoga, i alongside my sisters Akane, Xian Pu, Kasumi, Nabiki, Ukyo, my Robot Mommy, Kodachi, and little sister Hinako are the happiest we have ever been and want you to be happy big brother! Please please pleeeaaasssee big brother? Swear to serve master and you can be rich and master can help your girlfriend akari become your girlfriend or anything you desire! You want her to be a pig? She thinks she i a pig, you want her to worship you like a god? So be it! You want her to be a bimbo likemy little sister akane? So be it hehe i would do anything to get my big brother Ryoga in on this fun! Pleeeeaaaasssseee?\u201d Begged ranma to the shocked ryoga, who saw the benefit of accepting the offer since akari was playing hard yo get and would never serve him willingly. He had to admit, seeing a reprogrammed ranma serving kuno\u2019s every desire definitely served as fitting unishment for all the wrongs Ranma SAOTOME commited against him, and Ranma KUNO would be more than happy to be his little sister, rather than just acting like it to bother him like she did before. He would probably get alot of money to protect the household, and akane was obviousky be under mind control and probably be more submisdive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga had to admit Ranma definitely seemed honist with the offer and thought of him as her big brother and she his little sister. He did know that there had to be a catch but decided to agree provided Tatewaki do a few things for him and vocalized them. \u201cHmmya know what? Ill agree but only on a few conditions, you swear never to ensakv me like Ranma here who deserved it, you cure my directions curse however you control their minds, and you pay me with enough to own a nice house, maybe make ranma here think Pchan was her pet piggy instead of akane, and treat me like an equal, if thats not possible than as a friend.\u201d Tatewaki considered these conditions and weighed the options and decided that he would agree provided Ryoga agree to abit of loyalty programming to make him incapable of defying house kuno in important decisions and most importantly never try to be anything but a friend to any of the girls in the house other than Nabiki and Xian Pu since he didnt want ryoga to betray his household if he took him on, and sould not tolerate him attempting to woo one of his girls. He would also have to agree to become Ranma\u2019s pet pig at all times she wants him and be mentally controlled to do s<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga consider this and decided it was more than wirth it and decided he agreed to Ranma\u2019s offer and Tatewaki\u2019s conditions with a smirk on his face, more than happy to leave Ranma with her reprogramming to obey her most hated foe. He decided to say one word\u201dI accept.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma squeals and decides to......</span></div></div>",

Ranma-bot was excited to have a big brother since she only knew her master and how she must serve him in all things and icky boys from school she had to stay away from, she could have a big brother who would play with her. \u2018Hehehe big brother you are the bestest! Hehe ill take good care of you when you are an adorable piggy hehe you will love it here!\u2019 She squeled excitedly. Ryoga watched bemusadly as the shorter girl had to jump to reach him while never losing her huge smile. He had to admit that this was  the happiest he had ever seen Ranma and that she seemed to idolize him alot for some reason. Ryoga had to ask\u201dyo kuno you said that she doesnt remember anything before the control right? Then why does she idolize me so much? We used to fight alot before and she never like me before this, so what did you do to improve her like this?\u201d Asked Ryoga to the smirking kuno who was petting Nabiki and Xian Pu as they sat at his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTis simple my peasant friend, i gave her a mindset most fitting for a wife of house Kuno. I simply rewrote her personality to be more or less always happy and programmed new memories into her robotic mind. She is most certainly still a robot, just a very happy robot. My beloved bot seems to have inprinted on you as her big brother even though she is without a doubt out of your league, just like the former house tendo Akane.\u201d Explained Tatewaki who watched as Ranma-bot finally put the collar around Ryoga\u2019s neck.\u201dRanma wait a minute i want to speaaaaaa\u201d Ryoga demanded before he fell under the control of the collar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma-bot happily grinned as her big brother fell under and awaited her masters command for her. She was a lowly red haired harlot who needed to serve her master but she was excited to have a big brother who would do what she told him to do. \u201cMy little robot, i think i will let you program him today since you have been quite patient today and even helped me improve the class by converting that lowly teacher.

You will be the bestest big brother ever and will play with me whenever im bored. You will lead my master to that big meanie Akari so master can convert her to be your slave, and most importantly feel absolute devotion to my perfect master Tatewaki Kuno. He is the owner of all of us and as such he is your owner since you agree to join house Kuno. We are his girls and we can never be anything but HIS girls, we sleep where and when master tells us to sleep, we pleasure master whenever he is horny, we dont think much, and we dress in whatever master wants us to dress when he says to. You will agree with this and think master SHOULD own us as we aren't anything but property since we dont have minds. You will forget iwas ever a boy and my former personality, instead you will be my devoted pet and big brother who dotes on me. I am the head slave so i rank above you as does master who is my owner, you are right behind me. You will no longer get lost and will instead stay here or wherever master sends you, you ARE his barbarion after all, so you need to do what my master orders. You will go potty wherever i say you will and how, you are my pet 24/7 you just get the reward of being human sometimes. No matter what body you belong to me 100% and you belong to master 30%, do you understand?\u201d Ranma-Bot happily programmed ryoga to be hers with her beloved master\u2019s approval. Ryoga obeyed all of his little sister\u2019s words with drool running down his chin and his mind heavily altered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling Ranma-Bot happily went up to her big brother and removed his collar and said \u201cBig brother you can wake up now hehe\u201d and ryoga got abit more life back into his eyes and he looked around confused until he saw his owner ane sister and ran up her to give her a hug. Giggling Ranma-Bot happily got a new brother and a perfect master to help her empty her mind of bad girl thoughts. \u201cBig brother SIT\u201d Ranma-Bot commanded which ryoga obeyed immediently, and she began to pet him. Ranma-Bot went and ordered her former master kodachi to fetch her a glass of cold water so she could hold her P-Chan. While kodachi's went to fetch Ranma-Bot a glass of cold water, Ranma-Bot saw her mommy dusting the living room with Kasumi Kuno an$ ranma up to give her mommy a hug even though her mommy didnt have a personality anymore, her naster programmed her to be more childish, girly, highly dependant on her master, and to love her mommy with all her heart. Nodoka mindlessly stood as her head slave hugged her babbling about her new brother, even though her head slave wasnt given permission to think alot. Her databanks informed hef that this was once her biological son, but felt no emotion as she is a lowly robot. Ranma-bot happily hugged her mommy and told her about her day, and then went to her big sister Kasumi who she had helped upgrade, she noticed her mommy and big sister had pooped their pants sibce they werent allowed to use bathrooms until their chores were done, and watched as kasumi went to work with a very quick effiency. Kasumi had none of the thoughts she had had before she was erased m ntally since she no longer had any memories of anything prior to her current day, and she would erase her memories of today when she wakes up tommorow. Kasumi felt no emotions other than worship of her master and a need to work at all times her master required her too. Ranma-bot was Kasumi\u2019s superior in every single way, and as such she was requird to go along with whatever she told her to, Kasumi no longer knew who Ranma Saotome was nor did she know the name of her father Soun Tendo was, not who her mother Kana Tendo was, not who her sisters were, and did not understand hither thought, she was more robot than girl at this point. Ranma-Bot happily hugged her big sister and she told her to hug back. Ranna-Bot ordered her mommy to hug them both, to which nodoka mindlessly marched to them both and wrapped her arms around them, and awaited further instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma-Bot happily hugged and decided to...</span></div></div>",

Ranma even insulted ryoga by calling him an obsessed oafish perverted pig while ryoga seethed in fury. When they seperated ryoga attacked ranma out of the blue catching him off guard. Ryoga was able to land an especially vicious blow to ranma\u2019s stomach and ranma was gagging. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma gasped \u201cyou bastard, what the heck was that for?!? You will p-pay for that pork breath.\u201d As he was talking ryoga charged and managed to get close to ranma and land a strong kick to ranma\u2019s side and ranma collapsed from the harsh blows. Ranma was barely conscious from the pain and looked at ryoga with hate in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga grinning just sauntered over to Ranma and said \u201cwell well well looks like i have finally beaten you. Oh don\u2019t look so angry, I'm not going to KILL you, im going to do so much better than that you enemy of women.\u201d And with that Ryoga knocked Ranma out and picked him up and began to walk away and slowly go lost until he ended up at an abandoned house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga splashed Ranma with cold water and began to tie her to a chair. After Ranma was tied up tight enough, Ryoga retrieved his special laptop and put the helmet on Ranma\u2019s head and woke her up. Ranma who last remembered fighting Ryoga began to look around frantically and realized she was wearing something on her head and was in female form. Ranma finally saw ryoga looking at her with a VERY smug grin and knew she was tied up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma yelled at Ryoga furiously \u201cyou stupid pig what the heck do you think you are doing? When i get out of here i will kick your ass you hear me? What did you put on my head and why do you have a laptop? What the heck is going on\u201d While Ryoga just looked excited to test out his new weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga grinned and told ranma \u201cwhy Ranma, you should be honored! I\u2019m going to make you you sooo much better. After all you always string girls along and get in my way, i decided to upgrade you first. Get ready Ranma.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma just looked on in hatred until ryoga began the process. Ranma began to moan \u201cRyoga what is this? Lemme go, feel weird! Ryoga stooooooop!\u201d And ranma began to twitch and her eyes began rolling back, while her body quickly stopped fighting. Ryoga watched fascinated as Ranma began to foam at the mouth after a few minutes and just sat there twitching. Ryoga began the programming process to make Ranma Saotome into</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ranma was sitting still after her mind was wiped by the helmet. Ryoga watched the braindead Ranma twitching and foaming at the mouth waiting for him to program a mind into her head. Ryoga was considering what it was he wanted Ranma to become, after all he COULD easily make Ranma his personal pet, an ideal girlfriend or a bodyguard, hell he could even make Ranma dump all his fiance\u2019s and report to him but why would he want that when he could make Ranma pay for the years Ryoga suffered as his slave? Ryoga looked at the dulled blank eyes of Ranma and decided to have quite a lot of fun enslaving Ranma to his will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga began to type into the laptop all the traits he wanted Ranma to possess, he made her sexy, horny, absolutely in love with Ryoga, attentive, submissive, obedient, robotic, eager to please, one hundred percent a woman, and he made her forget anything that did not have to do with the art. Ryoga also made her enjoy dancing and singing for Ryoga, he made her COMPLETELY reliant on Ryoga to do the thinking for her,  enjoy cooking, talk right and more capable in school. Ryoga finally finished with his new slave and enjoyed seeing his former rival mindlessly sitting still and silent but he was finished installing her and wanted to enjoy his reward for all his hard work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga began to untie Ranma and removed the helmet from her head. Ryoga was EXTREMELY satisfied to see Ranma just sit still with drool running down her chin onto her shirt. Ryoga stood up and began to examine his girl. Ryoga commanded Ranma to stand up so he could examine her ass and she mindlessly did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga finally said \u201cRanma wake up, your master wants your service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma woke up and reported \u201cMaster Ryoga please command me! I am Slave Ranma and i exist to pleasure you. I will happily do anything to please you. Do you desire me to lead to your home master?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga was stunned seeing Ranma of all people smile blankly and report to Ryoga that he owned her. He definitely enjoyed the purchase he made. Ryoga grabbed her chin and asked Ranma \u201coh is that so my slave? You will do anything please me? How about you strip and show me your body my little slut! Hehehe\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma quickly stripped until she was buttnaked and awaited further instruction. Ryoga gazed upon tge mind wiped and Ranma and happily grabbed her tits and began to squeeze. Ranma mindlessly stood still and allowed her master full access to her body. Ryoga had years of aggression to release on Ranma\u2019s body and planned to full opportunity of the chance. It certainly did not hurt though that ranma was a VERY beautiful girl that had no free will to resist him though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryoga ordered the new Ranma to take him to his house. Ranma smiled emptily and grabbed her masters hand after redressing and began the walk to the Hibiki household. Ryoga happily watched Ranma\u2019s ass the whole way as Ranma walked in a much more sexual way than she used to. Ranma finally arrived at her owner\u2019s home and stood at attention in the living room. Ryoga glanced around grinning at finally seeing his house while shirokuro was asleep. Ranma smilingly stood at attention with her breasts thrusted out and her arms at her sides. Ryoga just looked at her smugly knowing he finally got his revenge and knew that since Ranma had been effected by his new technology, then Akane would as well and ordered Ranma to get on all fours so she could be a leg rest for her master. Ranma mindlessly did so and Ryoga sat on his chair and draped his feet over his new slave\u2019s back and contemplated what to do first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm how should i go about this? I already beat you Ranma so now i just need Akane and i will have gotten my happily ever after. But people will probably get in my way so how can i use you eh slave?\u201d Ranma pondered to himself as he groped Ranma\u2019s ass while she just smiled at him with devotion in her eyes even with an empty mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster why don\u2019t i knock her out and bring her to you? I would do anything for you and my body only exists to please you. I would be happy to serve you in such a way.\u201d Ranma suggested with a big smile on her face. Ryoga looked at her shocked that she was capable of doing anything without being told, much less give him suggestions. Ryoga contemplated her idea and decided perhaps it was the best one but he certainly wouldn\u2019t mind picking a few other girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm maybe but are you even smart enough to be Akane anymore? After all you did just get upgraded.\u201d Ryoga asked Ranma who still had a big smile and she just nodded. Ryoga slapped her ass and decided to celebrate winning by losing his virginity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Ranma i\u2019m gonna break you in as my new slave. Follow me Ranma.\u201d Ryoga ordered Ranma who silently followed hef master. Ryoga happily ordered Ranma to strip naked and while she did as she was told he did the same. Ryoga roughly pulled Ranma onto his bed and ordered her to get wet and masturbate until he was satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma immediently got to work even though her previous self didn\u2019t even know how to masturbate as a girl what with him being a boy who spent his life on the road. She quickly came close to cumming but ryoga ordered her to stop right before she could cum and hold it in. She did as he instructed and he quickly inserted himself in her ass while she simply smiled knowing she was pleasing her owner. He quickly began pumping her while she gasped at the pleasure. After awhile he came right in her ass while Ranma stood there awaiting further instruction. Ryoga quickly turned her around and began to churn around her pussy with a savagery that the normally shy around girls Ryoga would normally not show. Finally he came and decided to just go to sleep. Ranma would be there later anyways hehe<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ryoga decided to...</span></div></div>",

He ordered the sleeping Ranma to wake up so he could give her his orders. Ranma mindlessly smiled at her master as she did so and Ryoga began to give Ranma her instruction to hypnotize her own mother and bring her to Ryoga using the laptop and helmet. Ranma quickly marched out holding her master\u2019s treasures with a blank smile heading to transform her mother into a mindless slave like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma finally arrived at the Saotome household and noticed her mother was cooking as she snuck in. Ranma quickly attacked the surprised Nodoka who quickly realized it was Ranma and couldn\u2019t understand why her son was attacking her. Ranma finally managed to knock her mother out and set the equipment up so she could easily reprogram Nodoka Saotome into a mind wiped slave just like her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodoka woke up with a helmet on her head and herself tier up and freaked out seeing Ranma just silently typing into the laptop and demanded Ranma release her. Ranma just looked at her mindlessly with her blank smile and just kept typing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRanma let me go! I don\u2019t know what you think you are doing but i am your mother! This is very dishonorable.\u201d Nodoka screamed at the silent Ranma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo you will not be released. My master wants you to be a slave and that is what you will be. You don\u2019t seem to use your mind for mych anyways.\u201d Ranma mindlessly droned. Nodoka look at Ranma and saw nothing in her eyes but emptiness and guessed that Ranma was probably hypnotized going from her words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome now son you don\u2019t want to do this. You are hypnotized right? Let me go and i can help you break free from this.\u201d Nodoka pleaded to her son who ignored her. Suddenly Ranma pressed a button and Nodoka began spasming and twitching violently while Ranma just watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOwowow it hurts! Make it stop Ranma pleaaaaaaaaase! I cant sto-ugh.\u201d Nodoka begged before her mind instantly disappeared and she started foaming like Ranma did while wetting her pants. Ranma mindlessly programmed a slave personality into her mother\u2019s head while Nodoka just sat still and awaited instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma once she finished released Nodoka\u2019s restraints and watched her carefully to ensure the programming worked out. Nodoka just sat still no longer foaming but definitely brain dead and she just awaited instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet up, we have to meet our master. He wants your service.\u201d Ranma smiled at her mother who looked up and smiled emptily and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay lead me to master! I need to obey and serve however he wants me to for the rest of my life.\u201d Nodoka smilingly said. Ranma began leading her mother to her new home with a smile on her face. After about 3 hours they arrived at their beloved owners home and Ryoga just looked at Ranma as she mindlessly introduced her mother to Ryoga. He knew then and there that the old Ranma was definitely gone forever and decided to enjoy his pets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma and Nodoka mindlessly stood in front of Ryoga thrusting their breasts out and standing side by side. Ryoga happy inspected his new pets with a grin on his face knowing that they knew nothing other than what he let them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoga knew though that he still didn\u2019t have Akane and decided that since Rana was loyal enough to erase her own mother to obey him that she could easily erase her old fianc\u00e9e. He ordered Ranma to get the equipment and take Akane\u2019s mind and make her his personal slave. Ryoga had every intention of marrying Ranma as his final revenge while keeping all of his fianc\u00e9e as as his mindless concubines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma happily marched out feeling honored her master trusted her enough to recruit the Akane Tendo that her master talked about so much. Ranma had no idea who Akane Tendo was other than her appearance but knew that her master would be pleased if she succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma...</span></div></div>",

Ranma no longer knew anything of free will and independence. She didn\u2019t know anything of Akane Tendo other than that she would soon be her sister. Soon the Tendo came into sight and it was soon going to be dawn so Ranma had an ideal time to modify Akane and take her to their master. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma sneaked in through the second story window into Akane\u2019s room with the laptop and helmet in hand and mindlessly placed the helmet on Akane\u2019s head gently and waited for Akane to wake up silently. Ranma watched Akane snore loudly and smile even as she was slowly starting to stir. Akane groaned Loudly at the bright lights but suddenly she noticed something on her head and felt like someone was watching her. She jolted to to see Ranma mindlessly typing into a laptop and a helmet on her head and her faced turned red with anger at this pervert entering her room in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBakaaaaa what are you doing in my ROOM?!?\u201d Akane snarled at Ranma loudly but Ranma easily ignored her. Akane growled intending to smash that jerk until suddenly Ranma pressed a key and Akane suddenly froze and then started twitching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-W-WHAT\u2019s GOING ON?!? M-My-my body, i can\u2019t control my body! Make it st-st-stooooop it hurrrrrrrrrts.\u201d Akane whined as she was starting to feel dumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo i will not release you. My beloved master desires you to serve alongside me and i have been ordered to fulfill his wish. You didn\u2019t use your mind much anyways so it is not like this is a huge loss. Master will do all of your thinking for you so it is easier to obey his every desire. Hehe it is a great privilege to service my master.\u201d Ranma excitedly cheered as Akane looked at her in disbelief seeing the proud and always cocky Ranma Saotome act like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBaka what about our engagement? We are supposed to join the schools, to marry each other! What is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? Stooooooooooop!\u201d Akane whined loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey are you listening to-ACK! Agh what you do? Me hurt lots, me want stop.\u201d Akane growled before suddenly her mind felt like it was drained of much of its intelligence and she became stupid. Akane\u2019s mind was half as smart as it was before but she still resisted while the giddy Ranma watched with a big smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhhhhh me feel funny, hehehe i feel stupider den Kuno hahaha\u201d Akane groaned before suddenly acting very happy while Ranma watched knowing that in a few seconds Akane\u2019s mind would be erased forever and thus her master would be pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRanmaaaaa i no feel good, my tummy is hurting can i go potty? Me promise me come right back! Me just has to-oh\u201d Akane suddenly asked before she was finally brain dead. Ranma looked at her and checked  that she was gone so she could make her new sister slave. Akane just drooled even as her eyes crossed and just sat there slack jawed awaiting her new mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma began the programming even as Akane began to foam at the mouth. She didn\u2019t resist though so Ranma programmed her to be exactly like Nodoka, aka cheerful, mindless, loyal and obedient, and best of all a robot. Ranma was debating making Akane think she was a boy for the laugh but decided her master should have the final say but she did make one change and that was that Akane would always be cross eyed. Akane just sat still even as Ranma happily removed the helmet and released her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane blankly sat cross eyed even though she could get up and Ranma noticed Akane wasn\u2019t joking about needing a bathroom since Akane had peed and pooped her pants and was still filling them. Ranma ordered Akane to get up so she could could examine her. Akane mindlessly stood up and thrust her breasts out as she was programmed and Ranma looked at her and ordered her to wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello i am Akane Tendo, slave of master Ryoga and heiress to the Tendo school of anything goes martial arts. You are my big sister Ranma Saotome of the Saotome school of anything goes martial arts and our master\u2019s one day wife. I am eager to service my precious master and i ask you to please lead me to him big sister.\u201d Akane reported with a huge smile identical to Ranma\u2019s new signature smile and she quickly packed all of her clothes so she could move to her master\u2019s new home. Ranma was given orders to brainwash a Nabiki Tendo though because Nabiki might try to manipulate their master and moved on to Nabiki\u2019s room silently with Akane in tow and ash she opened her door Nabiki was halfway to the floor with her head touching the floor and her arms splashed around her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma silently and gently placed the helmet on Nabiki Tendo\u2019s head even ash she snored and instead of waiting just deleted everything at once. Nabiki spasmed very violently but quickly fell back into her previous position even though she was no brain dead. All of her intelligence unlike the other girls was removed instead of destroyed so her intelligence could be a gift for someone else that their master picked out. Ranma quickly programmed a new mind into Nabiki exactly the same as Akane\u2019s and began to head home with the Tendo girls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma...</span></div></div>",

Hehe\u201d Akane acted really happy to see Ranma who looked at her sleepily but surprised to see Akane finally home. It was pretty obvvious what the gift was, it was a weird headband with a spiral on the center and he had an idea of what it would do to her but decided to play along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAkane! Its been weeks since you were home, it\u2019s a shame everyone is asleep or Kasumi would cook something special for you. You said you had a gift for me? Cool what is it?\u201d Ranma asked Akane with a small sleepy grin on her face. Akane knew Ranma normally didn\u2019t wear headband so she thought she might have a little bit of a hard time convincing Ranma to put it on but was pleasantly surprised when Ranma acted a little bit happy to see Akane since normally that jerk doesn\u2019t even give her half the recognition she deserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah its been awhile, but i dome bearing this awesome headband, i found it in a shop while i was going through kyoto, and i thought it would look great on you! It\u2019s supposed to be a unique hand made headband that absorbs all the sweat even better than the average one.\u201d Akane said with a huge smile knowing that Ranma would soon be her brainless slave. Ranma looked at the spiral and thought akane might be a little obvious about the fact she wanted to hypnotize him, but she was bored anyways and hypnosis never seems to last very long on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey akane, is that a cursed item meant to hypnotize me? I mean i know we fight alot but to take control of my life and my mind like that is abit...selfish isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ranma asked Akane with a sly smile on her face while Akane looked horrified that Ranma figured it out so quickly, but she decided to push the gift on Ranma anyway she could even if Ranma figured it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? No way Ranma would i want you to be hypnotized, every time you do get hypnotized you run off to one of your floozies, no this is just a normal headband that i thought looked cool in a store you ungrateful jerk! I carried it for days, the least you could do it put it one so i can see what it looks like on you. Jerk!\u201d Akane hissed at Ranma acting as angrily as she could while Ranma grew a little uncertain about the belief about the headband he had before feeling a little guild, so he decided to try the headband on to appease the fuming Akane even though he still didn\u2019t trust it at all, he saw Akane looking innocent and figured that it couldn\u2019t hurt, but once he had it on Ranma began to feel like he was being sucked out of his head but couldn\u2019t do anything but twitch and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Kane whas goin on?!? Feel weird, icky like i go stupid!\u201d Ranma dazedly slurred out before she begsn to drool and Akane lead him to a chair to sit down. After a minute Ranma was drooling with the collar aalmost finished giving Akane the reigns to one of the most stressful people in her life. When the spiral on the headband stopped spinning it showed that there was no more mind left to steal as Ranma just slumped over drool running down her chin in a river while even her twitching stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane looked at the mind wiped Ranma with a huge grin on her face and decided to turn Ranma into her own personal...</span></div></div>",

Akane made Ranma enjoy dancing and singing for her mistress, bathing with her mistress when she had waterproof soap, sweeter, and happy to show off for her mistress. By the end of it, Akane made an ideal slave that would never do anything without her mistress to give the command, and she decided to begin to wake her new slave up and removed the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma mindlessly sat still even as her mistress removed her headband and blankly looked straight. Akane enjoyed seeing Ranma\u2019s obedience but knew she needed to wake her slave up since she wanted to go to bed, and gave Ranma the command to stand up in a sex pose and begin to wake up.

Your sexy slave awaits your orders Master.\u201d Ranma happily said to her Master with the biggest smile Akane had ever seen while staying in her pose. Akane was beyond pleased to see Ranma took her command to heart and would serve Akane.  Akane decided to go to bed since it was very late but she decided to take her new slave.

Ranma had zero free will left so when told to go to sleep, Ranma blankly fell asleep instantly while Akane admired Ranma\u2019s female body with envy knowing that she owned it, but wished she had a figure as good, but decided to just go to bed without worrying about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane couldn\u2019t sleep though so she ordered Ranma to get up and follow her owner to Kasumi\u2019s room sneakily since Akane wanted to hypnotize Kasumi first since she was an easy target and just decided to use the same headband that now had Ranma\u2019s mind sealed inside it and quietly snuck into her sister\u2019s room with a sly smile and the headband in her hand and looked at Kasumi\u2019s sleeping form eagerly. And put the headband around Kasumi\u2019s head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasumi\u2019s body began to twitch and spasm but didn\u2019t get up or open it\u2019s eyes while the headband easily absorbed most of Kasumi in minutes and when it finally finished Kasumi just stayed in the position her body thrashed into drooling. Akane commanded Kasumi\u2019s body to stand up and noticed that Kasumi peed herself while her mind was taken out and she just laughed seeing Kasumi in such a state and began to program her big sister to become a drone for Akane, she gave Kasumi the same instructions she gave Ranma just allowing the drone to do all of it\u2019s former self\u2019s chores and other activities that were needed along with making sure Kasumi-bot would act like the old Kasumi just much more obedient to Akane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane finished installing her new drone and ordered it to shut down until the time Kasumi normally woke up not even allowing the drone to change its pants and she just left with Ranma in tow to her sister Nabiki\u2019s room deciding Nabiki would make a better dog than person so she intended to give Nabiki the collar that would allow Nabiki the freedom of an animal and the intelligence to match. Once arriving she saw Nabiki was sleeping with a smile on her face but Akane quickly put the collar around Nabiki\u2019s neck with a huge smile excited to get revenge for all the shit Nabiki did to her. Nabiki twitched for a minute but soon began to calm down and just stayed asleep while Akane just left the room knowing she now owned her sister and went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane once waking up with her slave Ranma got up and went to her new dogs room and saw Nabiki still asleep but Akane woke her up gently. Nabiki lazily opened her eyes to see Akane and started grinning and licked her owner\u2019s hand happily while wagging her butt and Akane just enjoyed seeing the normally proud ice queen of furinkan acting like her true self, a bitch. While Nabiki mindlessly barked to her owner, Akane plotted how she should show off her pet and Ranma just stood there with no thoughts awaiting instruction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkane gently lowered her dog and close her in her room while moving to visit Kasumi who no longer had a mind of her own but followed her owner\u2019s command to do all of it\u2019s chores while acting like she was still Kasumi Tendo instead of Kasumi-drone.

Haha i know it sounds ridiculous but my wares are the best of the best. Ya won\u2019t find higher quality wares anywhere else in japan.\u201d The man boasted to Nabiki with a large grin.

In fact, the only characteristic he shared with other rivals was his general dislike of Ranma. He was also infatuated with Akane Tendo \u2013 something so common in Nerima, that you have to wonder if it wasn\u2019t an epidemic. <br>\r\nBut contrary to all others he wasn\u2019t a Martial Artist\u2026 in fact he was may be as far from being one as it was physically possible without being a cripple. Instead he was making du with some kind of ritualistic magic and strange artefacts that seemed to easily fall into his hands. They hilariously failed or backfired more often than not, and even in rare case where it worked as intended Hikaru seemed too surprised by that to press any kind of advantage. So, all in all Hikaru Gosunkugi, while certainly a weirdo, could be considered a relatively harmless weirdo if only\u2026<br>\r\nYes, of course there was an \u201cif\u201d. As the vast majority of Nerima\u2019s resident Hikaru was literally uncapable to think before he acts. This little fact was one of the main reasons why there were so much chaos, destruction and general maihem around. But thoughtless action of some overpowered Martial Artist would mostly cause just one more fight with some collateral damage\u2026 On the other hand, a wannabe wizard using something he know nothing about just to reach his one single-minded goal\u2026 That can cause so much more troubles\u2026<br>\r\nAnd that was exactly what happened, Hikaru Gosunkugi got his hands what he believed will finally offer him a chance with his beloved Akane and acted without thinking. He didn\u2019t try to test if it would work as advised\u2026 damn, he didn\u2019t even read the manual! Or the contract that he did sign to obtain it\u2026 And so\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It\u2019s as if his Lucky Star has at last started to shine! According to what he was said this magical Idol he got will allow him to gain love and obedience of any girl! Oh sweet Akane\u2026<br>\r\nAnd he got it literally for free! Even if this guy was weird and kinda creepy\u2026 but still the only this he from Hikaru was to accept some strange mark. This mark was a little strange, it combined in itself the conventional symbols for male and female, but also looked cool... So truly he was in luck and now only thing left to do was to find Akane\u2026<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do we have here?\u201d his sweet dreams were interrupted by a dreaded voice. Voice of Nabiki Tendo, the scariest person in the school\u2026 <br>\r\n\u2018\u2019Nothing !!! Nothing !!!\u2019\u2019 he gave a squeak jumping in the air. Upon returning on the earth he realised that Idol upon all his hopes were placed were not in his hands anymore.<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Nabiki seemed unsure looking upon the object she took from his hands. \u201cBecause it looks like another one of your brainless plots. I thought I made myself clear last time, Gosunkugi\u201d she looked him in the eyes and Hikaru nearly fainted from fear. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what new absurd you try to do with that thing, but I did say you to not do anything when it can disrupt my work. You know very well that soon Ranma will fight Ryoga and I\u2019ve already took bets\u2026 And whatever you are trying to do may disrupt the fight and it. Would. Cost. Me. MONEY\u201d<br>\r\nAt this moment Hikaru Gosunkugi could not take it anymore. Angering Nabiki Tendo was the very thing you would do when you try to end your life\u2026 And nothing would anger Nabiki more that making her lose money\u2026 World went dark as Hiraku finally fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIdiot\u201d snorted Nabiki, not giving poor fool any more attention.<br>\r\n Now, that she took this thing \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 from him, he would not cause any chaos. Normally Nabiki didn\u2019t care about what happens in the school. All these overpowered fools could raise it to the ground \u2013 either way it wouldn\u2019t change anything, and it would be rebuilt the very next day. It already has happened many times. She didn\u2019t care, as long as it didn\u2019t stop her doing her thing. Or today it could have prevented already prepared fight, fight she did invest in\u2026 This just won\u2019t do\u2026<br>\r\nSo now she could just go to see the fight\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGosunkugi expected to use the Idol to make Akane \u2018see\u2019 him \u2013 whatever it meant for him \u2013 and to get his final \u2018happily ever after\u2019. But as it has already been said he didn\u2019t even really know how this Idol \u2013 of an unknown origin \u2013 worked. If he at least tried to prepare before acting he would have known, that the Idol affected the carrier and not the person said carrier thought about, aiming for\u2026 or whatever. And to activate it, it must be rubbed \u2013 in the same way that you would rub a genie\u2019s lamp.<br>\r\nAnd that exactly what Nabiki did while watching the expected fight. And then, it dawned on her. She was a slave. She just suddenly knew. It wasn't an emotion, or an idea. It was a fact. Nabiki Tendo was now a slave. There mere idea to fight it was absurd. She knew she was a slave now. At the core of her very existence, that was who she was and who she would be for the rest of her life.<br>\r\nAnd as a slave she had to serve and obey her Master. Her Master was\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As certain as she knew that she was a slave, she also knew that her Master was Ranma-\u201dI\u2019m a man no matter size of my bust\u201d-Saotome. Had that been everything? No changes in her personality, no memory loss, nothing?Nabiki kept her guard up. She already had some unfortunate experience with magic and curses, most of time they were silly but at the same time annoying and not easy to circumvent.<br>\r\nWhile there\u2026<br>\r\nOk, so she was Master Ranma's slave, but that, while brutal, didn't seem too powerful a notion to her, like it could be easily overcome. In order to try, she first started thinking about resisting, and found surprisingly that she could do that. Could she really resist Master Ranma? But then it came to her. She couldn't. She was Master Ranma's slave, so she could never resist him. She would rather stop breathing\u2026<br>\r\nOk, but Ranma wouldn't order her around anyway, mostly because he would even aware of the fact, that she\u2019s his slave. After all she is not stupid enough to announce\u2026 Nabiki wondered for a moment if everything would just still normal if she kept quiet. But again, the answer just seemed to come to her: she was a slave, so the first thing she would do, is to say to her Master that she is his to do as he please. Well\u2026 first she would ensure that there is no one else around to hear it, so that she doesn\u2019t cause unnecessary trouble to her Master.<br>\r\nDamn\u2026 that was strong! But still, there is may be a way around it. She wouldn\u2019t want to cause trouble to Master, but let\u2019s be honest, Ranma was a trouble magnet and not so smart. Should he be aware of what just happened, he would undoubtedly go into some new troubles, probably caused by his own rush actions. So, it would be in her Master\u2019s own interest if she kept it for self\u2026 No, answer came to her once again, she was a slave; and it is not to slave to decide what is best for her Master. She would tell him everything and do her very best to help him in every way possible. Because even if Master Ranma would never give her an order, she was still his slave. As a slave, she had to always do what was best for him, disregarding her own wants and needs.<br>\r\nNabiki no longer thought that this curse would be easy to overcome, no it was incredibly strong dangerous. She knew that she would be her Master's slave until the end of her days. She was her Master's property. She would never betray him. All that she would ever do or say again, would ultimately be for Master. Nabiki hated that she was a slave, but she knew there was nothing she could do about it. What she hated, disliked, liked or loved didn't matter, nor did what she wanted or needed, only what Master wanted or needed mattered. Only what he loved, liked, disliked or hated.<br>\r\nNabiki Tendo was a selfish person, even a very selfish person. She was proud about everything she has accomplished in Nerima, running her own operation, making all these overpowered idiots \u2013 calling themselves Martial Artists \u2013 fear and respect her. And she pretty much despised Ranma Saotome. This guy or girl \u2013 his curse on itself was absurd \u2013 was a living cause of headache and a crime against a common sense. And let\u2019s not even talk about his sense \u201chonour\u201d \u2013 while his whole life and family seemed to be created just to show the whole world why this \u201chonour\u201d should be put in the garbage\u2026 <br>\r\nAnd so, the mere idea that now she belonged to him was terrifying\u2026 but there was nothing she could do about it. And all that because of this idol\u2026 because of Gosunkugi\u2026 where the hell did he get it?! Sadly, for now there is nothing she could do about it, it was up to her Master to decide. <br>\r\nWhile Nabiki investigated her new role in life, this damn idol was still in her hand, so... innocuous in appearance. The internal investigation went on only seconds, though to her it seemed like an eternity. Done with it, she quickly put the idol in her bag, for now it was the safest place she can keep it. Once she could speak with Master and explain everything that happened, he could decide what to do with it\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile outside Ranma Saotome was once again fighting Ryoga, completely unaware that his life is about to change\u2026</span></div></div>",
