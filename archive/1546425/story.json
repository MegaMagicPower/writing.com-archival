Most of the people in the crowd were girls, and they were all trying to be in the center of the circle at the same time. Large security guards were doing their best to push the crowd away. Then I saw who they were excited about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac Efron was walking in the middle of the circle, even hotter than I had ever imagined. His perfect brown hair falling around equally pristine features. And his eyes, oh my gosh, his eyes were so amazing. I was suddenly overcome with infatuation, almost causing me to feint in my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Flight 154 to London now boarding first class passengers, rows one through twenty-five.\" Came a voice over the intercom. I stood up and began to gather my things. Then I noticed that Zac was moving towards the boarding gate. Was he going to board the same flight as me? The crowd began to disperse as Zac made his way to the gate, handing his ticket to the flight attendant who was eying him eagerly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rushed to the gate after him, hurriedly handing my ticket to the flight attendant, who took her sweet time making everything was in order. I practically ran down the boarding ramp and into the plane. Zac sat in the second row, next to the window. It looked like he had two seats to himself. I looked frantically around for where I was going to sit. To my delight, I was sitting across the aisle from him, one row back. I was overcome with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the people who were boarding the plane did a double take when they saw Zac Efron sitting in first class. I smiled to myself, unable to believe my luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with a silver brief-case sat across the aisle from me, right behind Zac. I ignored him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I refrained from using my laptop, seeing as my current wallpaper was of Zac Efron's Rolling Stones photo shoot where he was almost shirtless. The slightly creepy looking man with the silver brief-case sitting across the aisle from me (who hadn't so much as scratched his nose during the entire flight) got up and went into the bathroom, taking his briefcase with him.</span></div></div>",

Looking to the front of the plane, I could see that part of the cockpit was missing. I reached for the oxygen mask, but it was moving around too violently for me to grab it from my seat. I looked down and noticed that my seatbelt was still on. I didn't want to take it off for fear of being thrown out of the plane as it spiraled downwards. Suddenly, a tan, strong hand pulled the mask around my face, providing me with precious oxygen. I looked up to see Zac, his oxygen mask secured around his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac motioned towards the seat cushions, and then out the window at the ever drawing closer water below. I understood what he meant. Since we were going to land in water, we should use the seat cushions as flotation devices. Unbuckling my seatbelt, I was nearly thrown to the back of the plane from the force of the wind. Zac held on to my arm, pulling me back to the seat. He was holding on to the seat in front of us, and had already grabbed a seat cushion. A strange green ooze covered the ground, leaking from the front of the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac pulled me over to the emergency exit, using the chairs to help him move around. Together we managed to pry the door open. The force of the wind pulled us out of the plane.</span></div></div>",

When I opened my eyes, I found my self blinded by sunlight. I blinked, getting my eyes used to the brightness. Looking around, I found myself on a tropical beach, with palm trees lining golden sand. I tried to think about what I was doing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you okay?\" a voice said, I looked up to see Zac standing over me. Then I remembered. The plane crash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up hurriedly, my clothes heavy with salt water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" I said, looking around, \"Where are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, somewhere around the Caribbean, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at him, he was as gorgeous as ever, but there was something wrong.

As I looked up, I was almost hit in the face by his yard long penis.  His body was soaking wet.  Drips of water came off his huge penis, and hit me on the head.  I couldn't help but get a erection from the sight of his huge, wet cock.  All I could do was stand there dumbfounded.  He also noticed his size and understood why I was speechless.  He picked me up in his huge hand.  Just then, I noticed that I was also naked.<br>\r\n     \"You're kind of hot.\" he said.  I looked around to see if he was talking to me.  of course, he was.<br>\r\n     \"Um...ditto?\"  Was all I could say.<br>\r\n     \"Ha ha.  I get that a lot.  Hey there's an island over here.  We can rest there tonight.\"  I noticed that it was getting dark.<br>\r\n     When we got to the island, Zac laid down; still completely naked, still dripping wet, and still smoking hot.<br>\r\n     I walked over to him and laid down with him.  Curling up in his pubic hair, trying to snuggle with his gargantuan cock.  I could still not wrap my arms around this 2 foot wide penis.<br>\r\n     The urge to lick and suck on that huge dick took over me.  I licked it vigorously.  Zac awoke with a start, then realized what I was doing.  He then rubbed my back gently, making sure to take time at my butt; encouraging me.  I took the hint and went around to the tip of his cut cock; massaging the 7 inch head.  I then rubbed the slit, and licked it.  I then fingered it.  after a while of him growing, I put my 7 inch penis into the slit.  Zac moaned loudly.  We continued this while I fingered my own hole and licking his penis.  Zac grew harder and harder until he grew to his full length of 2 yards and 14 inches wide.  After a while, he moaned really loudly, and released his cum all over me, coating me completely in his semen.<br>\r\n     \"Let me get that,\" he said.  He picked me up and licked me off, paying close attention to my crotch.  When he was done, he put me down and we decided it was time to sleep.  I decided that it would be fun to sleep  under his  huge nutsack, which he didn't protest.  I decided first to give it a good licking.  I thought how it was a good thing that I remembered my camera.</span></div></div>",

It hadn't been totally obvious when I was laying down, but now, standing in front of him, I realized that he was much taller. His wet t-shirt showed his abs, and was stretched across his pecs. His pants didn't cover his shins, making them look more like shorts than jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit.\" I said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I dunno what happened,\" he said, looking down at me. I barely reached his waist, and had to crane my neck to look up at him. \"But I found some water over in there, if you're interested.\" he said, pointing towards the trees. I realized that I was parched, my mouth tasting like salt and sand. I nodded, desperate for water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI followed Zac, struggling to keep up with his long strides. When we reached the forest, I could see that Zac had already partly cleared a trail. I did my best to work my way through the bushes and trees, but obstacles to me were hardly any concern to Zac and he stepped over them easily. When he started to pull ahead, I yelled at him to wait up. He turned around and saw me stuck in a bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached down, and with both hands, pulled me out of the bush and then held me against his chest. I was so surprised I nearly fainted. Zac walked through the forest, pushing trees out of the way with his spare hand. Zac's chest was warm and muscular, and I relished every moment of our journey. The forest began to thin out and we emerged into a large clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the clearing was a huge waterfall, cascading it's way into a pond. Zac set me down and walked to the edge of pond, taking huge drinks of water with his hands. I did the same, taking in luxurious gulps of fresh water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zac stood up, I realized that he was expanding. Whereas before I had only reached his waist, now I didn't even reach his crotch. His clothes began to strain and soon his pant legs ripped, followed by his t-shirt, leaving him only in far too tight boxer-briefs. He now loomed over me, thirty feet tall. My head came up just above his knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to go swimming?\" Zac asked me,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you?</span></div></div>",

I did the same, embarrassed to undress in front of Zac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never got your name,\" he said to me as I stripped out of my clothes,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Joey.\" I said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a cute name,\" he said, before leaping into the water. The water barely came up to Zac's thighs at it's deepest point, and he was able to sit in the middle of the pond without a problem. I jumped into the water also. It was wonderfully cool and refreshing, and I wiped away all the sand that still clung to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac was doing his best to wash himself down in the (comparatively) shallow water. He rubbed his glistening muscles with his powerful hands. When I was swimming, I saw a huge form come up from under me and I felt myself being lifted out of the water. Zac brought me up to his huge face, with me sitting precariously on his palm. I was completely naked, and suddenly felt aware of the effect that the cold water had had on me. Zac smiled at me, perfect white teeth glistening in the tropical sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do?</span></div></div>",

He chuckles down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Joey! Haha, you look like a toy down there by my feet!\" he laughs. You smile and nod in agreement.

He holds you against his nose and sniffs a few times...turning your body around to get your scent from every angle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...you smell...delicious....\" Zac says in his sexy, DEEP voice. He gets a cheeky grin on his face as he brings you over to his mouth again.

Everyday, you were hoping you would get the call, telling you that you won. Today was that day. The director, who was the one who called, told you to be at the shoot, which was only an hour away from your house, tomorrow. The rest of the day couldn't have gone slower. Finally, as night came, you slipped into bed, dreaming about what the next day might be like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you approached the set. It was on the outskirts of a huge forest. The director approached you and told you where to go. You just had to get a costume and get some makeup done, but you were more worried about meeting Taylor. It wasn't until you arrived back on the set that you saw him. You realized he was even hotter in person. Hoping to meet him, you staretd walking over to him. But the director quicky shouted for everyone to be in their places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe later' you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time passed quickly. Soon, everyone was leaving the set. It was the last day of shooting and everyone wwas saying their goodbyes. The set cleared out quickly and soon, you realized it was only you and Taylor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going home?\" you asked him. 'Stupid', you thought to yourself, 'I should have said something better'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, my trailer is right over there,\" he said, pointing to his trailer near a dirt path, \"I don't have anything planned for a while, so I figured it would be cool to camp out here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just nodded, but you weren't sure about what you should do. You wanted to stay here with Taylor, but didn't want to overstay your welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, i'll take you inside,\" he said, passing you. You didn't have to think twice. You soon found yourself entering his trailer, which, while small, had alot of room in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly brought out a bottle of pills. But these didn't look like regular pills. They were blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I'm sorry you didn't get to spend enough time with me today. So do you want to stay with me for a while?\" You stood there, nodding your head. You didn't have to think about it, you would be dumb to refuse his offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and popped one of the pills into his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, we're going to have a great time,\" he said, smirking. You weren't sure what he meant, but soon you saw Taylor was...growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow big did he get?</span></div></div>",

Taylor grinned down at you, your eye level now even with his ripped abs, hidden behind his dark black shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty cool, huh?

We went to the twelfth floor and into one of the apartments. The apartment itself was huge, more like a loft than anything else, completely furnished with miniature couches and chairs and rugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to live out my fantasy, allright little man?\" Ashton said to you. You looked at him puzzlingly, \"here's the plot: you're my boyfriend and I suddenly get the power to make myself grow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only have the power to make myself and the things that I touch shrink, and then grow back to normal again, so I had them build me this set so that I could be the giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhm... okay.\" You replied, anxiously. Little did Ashton know, this was your dream too. Ashton led you over to the couch and you both sat down. He turned on the TV. He put his arm around you, and kissed your lips. You were so happy you could die, but you knew the best was still yet to come. Ashton lay down on the couch, pulling you down with him and you lay on his chest and you kissed him passionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt Ashton's body begin to expand slightly, his shirt starting to ride up his abs.
