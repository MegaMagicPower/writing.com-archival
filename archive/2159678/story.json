On the floor were the sexy high stilettos he had loved so much on Vanessa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of searching for normal clothing, he gave up and had to settle for a thong and lacy bra underneath a red dress that was cut low and rode high along Vanessa\u2019s long, smooth legs. Forcing his feet into a pair of steep black heels, he winced as he staggered through the apartment, slim arms flailing around in an attempt to stay balanced. He eventually caught himself, grabbed Vanessa\u2019s purse, and left.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His new female bimbo body seemed to be aching for the touch of a man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the bar it didn\u2019t take long for men to approach Shane. In this body, dressed like he was. It was only a matter of time before the guys started to approach him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Shane would have hated the very idea of being stuck in this bimbo body as men began flirting with him but something was telling him other wise. The needs and desires of his new body were overwhelming. He soon found himself laughing and giggling at all the dumb pick up lines and bad jokes being tossed his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually a man named Josh caught his interest. He was dark haired and well built. He seemed to be a musician and every time he spoke Shane could feel his body getting hotter and hornier. His new slit was dripping wet...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually one thing led to another as Shane or rather Vanessa found herself at Josh\u2019s apartment. Within minutes her clothes were off as she was laying naked on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor his first time as a woman Vanessa couldn\u2019t believe how amazing the sex was. The feeling of having someone enter her was more than she could imagine. She was consumed by lust and ecstasy as she cried out and moaned throughout the night cumming several times before collapsing of exhaustion....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(The next morning)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane awoke with a pounding headache as he opened his eyes slowly. He was back at Vanessa\u2019s apartment except something seemed different....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane looked in the mirror  and saw his normal Male body staring back at him. Had all that been a dream? Was last night just a messed up nightmare?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane looked around for his clothes as he paused seeing several suitcases in the entryway with a note on table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Shane,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you are reading this than I am sure you have many questions. To keep things simple yes last did happen. It will also happen again...and again....and....again. I knew you were cheating on me but I never thought it was with such a bimbo slut. So I decided to cast a little curse on you. Each night once the sun goes down you will become Vanessa again. Hot...horny...and desperate to please yourself. My little gift to you. Inside the bags are all your clothes. This place is yours now I suggest you start figuring out your life. Once the sun goes down you will have a whole new adventure waiting for you!\u201d <br>\r\n-Your now ex-wife, Rose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the note Shane began to freak out. How could this happen to him? What was he going to do? </span></div></div>",

Their scrambling making more sense if he was Vanessa. The perspective snap, made her queasy. Bile rising in his throat, as her remembered sucking cock, rather than the hazy sensation of having his cock sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pride in giving a creamy tit-wank to a man behind the bar, the taste as he came over your face. Your night of wild sex making horrifying... whorifying sense now he knew the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contempt for the cum-splattered woman, was his contempt for himself. But, deep inside, pride still fought to the surface. He knew the pleasure he'd brought that man... that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the fridge, Shane decided to get shit-faced. Surely if he was legless, she'd not be able to leave the house. Downing can after can, the pleasant buzz dulling those memories. Shane drank slowly the entire day. As the evening drew on, and the Sun set, he smiled drunkenly to his half-reflection in the TV screen. He'd made it without puking. Raising the can in salute to himself, a squirming sensation started.</span></div></div>",

But now men stared, their eyes moving up and down his curves, licking their lips, whistling without shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come home with me, baby?\u201d shouted a guy standing on the street corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Shane were his normal self, he\u2019d have turned around and given the man the finger. But the man\u2019s lusty voice awakened something inside of him. Turning around, he winked before vanishing around the street corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the hell is happening to me? I need to buy new clothes, he thought, walking briskly as he could in the heels. They added an extra sashay to his step that only drew more eyes in his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he walked, the more conscious he was of his breasts. They were big enough that with each wobbly step he took they nearly bounced out of his dress, making his back ache. Thankfully with another few steps he was into the department store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVanessa! I haven\u2019t seen you in so long!\u201d One of the employees of the nearby lingerie shop grabbed Shane by the arm, pulling him over. \u201cYou must be looking for more sexy little nothings. Lemme give you some recommendations!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane wanted to protest at first. But what could he do? He was in Vanessa\u2019s body now, and didn\u2019t know if he could ever change back. Best to play along and see what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl pulled him into a booth and pulled out several lacy pairs of underwear and thongs in pink, red, and black. \u201cNow you\u2019re going to try these on. I know your ass will look great in them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane had no choice. He pulled down the thong that was riding up between his full buttocks and slipped into the new pairs, each tighter than the next. They put a special pressure on his nether regions, a new part he hadn\u2019t thought about until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis penis had vanished, of course, and was replaced with Vanessa\u2019s pussy. With each movement the sexy underwear rubbed against her clit, her labia, until Shane felt a moisture forming that he didn\u2019t want the shop employee to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy this one,\u201d he said hurriedly, pulling out his wallet. The girl grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Vanessa I know! Bold enough of you to come out with makeup. I know you\u2019re still killing the guys though!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Vanessa\u2019s body a playful slap on the ass and left with the money. Shane left quietly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile at the mall, he stocked up on more practical dresses, flats, and finally makeup. That was when Vanessa\u2019s phone began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello?\u201d His voice sounded girly, playful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVanessa! Ari told us that you were at the mall too! Come on over here and let\u2019s have some girl fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Shane were in his right state of mind, he would have turned them down. But something tugged at him, tempted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll meet you in a bit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin minutes, a gaggle of girls popped up. Each of them were dressed like Vanessa, but made up even more. Shane couldn\u2019t help but note that Vanessa was still far more attractive than any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cComing out bare-faced?\u201d chided one of them, grabbing him by the wrist with a grip too firm for Vanessa\u2019s arm to break out of, \u201cCome on. We gotta help you get your makeup done, girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI actually just bought some new stuff,\u201d said Shane, pointing to the bag, his heart pounding with a strange excitement. The girl grinned at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out the mascara, she began to apply it to Vanessa\u2019s eyes. Shane squirmed, but didn\u2019t give in to the odd, ticklish sensation. She helped him put on blush, eyeliner, showing him each step in a small pocket mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you like it?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane stared into the little reflection of his smoldering eyes, only more potent because of how smoky and long-lashed they looked with the mascara on. He looked\u2026beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it. Can I get some lipstick too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the bag, the girl pulled out the brightest shade of lipstick. \u201cI thought you\u2019d never ask!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane enjoyed the smooth lipstick gliding over his full lips. When he looked into the mirror, he found that his looks were even more irresistible. His cheeks looked fuller, his eyes more seductive, his lips eye-catching. It was a good look for Vanessa\u2026so good that he almost wanted to try it out for himself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a growing itch inside of him that the heat of the men\u2019s eyes outside had only made more intense, a sensation that he\u2019d never felt before. A need to be filled up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan! I thought you were seeing that guy, though, Shaun or whatever his name was?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile came to Vanessa\u2019s red lips. \u201cOh, I\u2019m not seeing him anymore. That guy\u2019s a loser, a complete pussy. His wife taught him a lesson for cheating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girlfriends all talked at the same time. \u201cShame. He was kinda cute.\u201d \u201cI knew he was a pussy from the start!\u201d \u201cWonder what his wife did to him. Do cheaters ever change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smile on Vanessa\u2019s face only grew wider as they approached the club and were let in, no questions asked. The moment she walked in, her hips swinging, her long legs moving with utmost confidence, her breasts bouncing, all eyes were on her. The men stared, the women whispered. It was intoxicating, so intoxicating that for a moment Shane forgot that he existed inside of Vanessa\u2019s body. For a moment he was Vanessa, sashaying confidently through the world, feeding off the eyes of the men and the jealousy of the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWanna dance?\u201d he asked a well-dressed man at the bar. The man was his own age, decent looks. Probably not unlike himself\u2014had a decent-paying job, a wife to go home to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strange pride rose in Shane\u2019s heart as the man stood up without hesitation and took his hand. All the faith that this man might have had disappeared in an instant when he locked eyes with Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in that moment, Shane felt himself disappear. All that was left was Vanessa, the beautiful woman who made men bow to her at each snap of her painted fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they danced. Vanessa ground her ass against him, teasing him, making him hard through his clothes. She whispered into his ear, grabbed him by the tie to kiss him and then shoved him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to the bathroom if you want more,\u201d she said, turning away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no question in her step as she walked away, her tight dress hugging her curves, that she was being followed. Sure enough, the man walked after her into the club bathroom stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing him, Vanessa began to kiss him, melting in the heat as their tongues touched, intertwined. The dampness in her pussy only swelled, and she pulled up her dress, pushing her panties to the side to reveal her dripping wet pussy as she hoisted herself up onto the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake me,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man didn\u2019t hesitate. Without moments he had pulled his cock out of his pants, pushed forward into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane gasped as he felt the cock inside of Vanessa. It was a feeling of fullness, of being completed, the kind that he\u2019d never felt when fucking women. And as the man began to thrust, he moaned in Vanessa\u2019s voice, dug her nails into the man\u2019s back, screamed as her body shook violently in orgasm, twitching with pleasure that washed out any shame he might have had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the man was turning away, about to buckle up his pants, Vanessa licked her red lips, pushed the hair out of her eyes, and spread her legs again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgain,\u201d said Shane, feeling the lust swell inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man paused, turned around again. His pants dropped to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Shane was lost inside of Vanessa\u2019s wildest indulgences, the guilt washed away, his pride as a man completely subservient to pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd already Vanessa knew, as she came again and again, that she would be out on the club floor tomorrow, smiling, sexy, and ready for more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not to mention all the stares and weird looks of people on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new huge boobs bounced and jiggled with every step. Vanessa had gotten a boob job a few years ago so now her huge fake tits were perfectly round and easy to show off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane finally made it back to his house as he knocked on the door. He had no idea what to say he just hoped his wife would believe him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments Rose answered the door as she looked at Shane in Vanessa\u2019s body.

I don\u2019t want to live in this body please turn me back!\u201d Shane pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo can do Vanessa. You see I have plans this evening. You should spend some time getting to know your new life. With a body like yours you are sure to get lots of attention.\u201d Rose said before slamming the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane stood there stunned.

An eternity to get his mind moving again as his situation washed over him yet again.  For a moment he considered making a scene, but quickly thought better of it - first of all, Shane certainly didn't want to draw attention to himself in his current condition and second of all, Rose could simply call the police and have 'Vanessa' removed from the property.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last thought hit Shane hard.  He didn't live here anymore.  He looked down at the cleavage erupting from the most conservative dress he'd been able to find in Vanessa's closet and made a mental correction.  <i>She</i> didn't live here anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it came down to it, there really was only one option.  He had to go back to Vanessa's apartment.  It was a safe place at least.  Staying here meant that Rose could force the issue by having 'Vanessa' forcibly removed from the property.  Wandering the city meant risking any number of seedy characters.  Calling any of his friends would mean trying to prove he wasn't Vanessa and even then, well, most of his friends were as eager to score as he had been - fending off the advances of his own friends was not appealing.  And going to the strip club where Vanessa worked was simply out of the question.  It was bad enough he had to see himself in this body; getting ogled by a bunch of horny strangers was absolutely <i>not</i> in the cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the positive side, he'd been to Vanessa's place often enough that getting there was no great difficulty.  On the negative side, between Vanessa's body, the dress, and the fact that he'd long ago given up trying to walk in Vanessa's stiletto heels, opting to carry them instead, he definitely looked like a cheap bimbo doing a walk of shame.  Even if he hadn't known, the catcalls would have clued him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Shane climbed up the stairs in Vanessa's slightly run-down apartment building to her 3rd floor flat.  The cheap lock required a little jiggling before allowing the key to turn, one more reminder that Vanessa didn't share Shane's status in the world.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Made it,\" Shane thought, as he pushed the door open, \"I can settle down for a moment and actually think about what to do next...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shane stepped through the door and froze.  Sitting on the couch with his back to the door was a man.  Was Vanessa's - his - apartment being robbed?  It didn't seem like it.  The man was simply sitting on the couch watching...  <i>The Bachelor</i>?  That didn't seem like something a burglar would do.  At least, not a male burglar.  Vanessa might have been dumb enough to break into someone's house to watch trashy TV but...  Wait...  It dawned on Shane that this man was wearing the exact same shirt that he'd been wearing last night, before he'd awakened in the morning as Vanessa...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa?\"  Shane ventured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe high-pitched soprano voice that came with his present body didn't have much authority, but the man still jumped up, startled.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane's former body turned to face him, the expression shifting from surprise to mirth.  \"OMG!  Rose was, like, totally right!  You're me!\"  Normally, hearing Vanessa's bubbly bimbo speech in what Shane still thought of as 'his' voice would have qualified as the most surreal experience he could imagine.  Today, however, it was merely the second most surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... talked with Rose?\"  Despite his incredulity Shane knew that it had to be true.  Vanessa wasn't smart enough to figure out that if she was in his body, he might be in hers unless she had help.  And she <i>certainly</i> wasn't smart enough to assume Rose had done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\"  Vanessa's vapid head-nod seemed very out of place on Shane's body.  \"She's super nice!  You shoulda told me you had a wife an' junk!\"  There's a pause as Vanessa seems to be making an effort to remember something.  \"Oh, yeah...  She's, like, way angry with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa,\" Shane hurried to jump in before the former bottle blonde could babble all afternoon, \"did Rose tell you anything else?  Such as how you could get your body back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa blinked and with what appeared to be a significant mental effort wrenched her train of thought onto a different track.  \"Oh!  Yeah!\"  There was a long pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...  what did she tell you?\"  Shane finally prompted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't.  It's, like, peppermint or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Permanent...\"  Shane took a deep breath.  Surely Vanessa had misunderstood.  Vanessa's only marketable skill was stripping - well, her only <i>legally</i> marketable skill, anyway - and she couldn't do that in Shane's old body.  And the way Vanessa was talking about Rose being nice it didn't seem like Rose intended to punish Vanessa too...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, permanent.  The physical stuff, anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Shane's turn to look confused.  \"Physical stuff?  There are other things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was kinda confusing, but, like, Rose said you'd hafta teach me a whole bunch about bein' you an' that you wouldn't wanna so she was gonna make it so I could just, um, ask for stuff 'bout you and I'd just, like, know it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't seam fair,\" Shane wasn't entirely sure what Vanessa meant but if Rose planned it, it couldn't be good for him.  Maybe by convincing Vanessa that it wasn't fair, he could stop her from doing whatever Rose hoped she would do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose said you'd say that!\"  Vanessa giggled.  \"But it totally is!  'Cause whenever I take something you should know, you get somethin' I know!  It's an even swap or somethin'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure...\"  Shane spoke slowly, trying to buy a little time to figure out how to explain to Vanessa that trading bits of her low-class life for his wasn't fair.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's OK!  I am!  And I wanna try it out!  So, Shane, I want you to give me your...\"</span></div></div>",

Something hadn't been quite right there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!  You totally just called yourself Vanessa and and it didn't sound all weird an' junk!  See!  I'm Shane now and you're Vanessa!  Now we can't screw up!  How cool is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa, the new Vanessa, didn't think it was cool at all.  On the one hand, she knew she used to be Shane but that was just something she knew - just like how she knew that the capitol of England was London.  Just a bit of stray fact without any sense of identity attached to it.  The name 'Vanessa', on the other hand, reached straight into her and demanded attention.  There was instinctive response attached to it now.  Somehow, she knew that she'd never again be able to respond as instinctively to her former name, much less call herself by her old name and have it feel right.  At least, not unless she could get Shane to ask to switch names again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shane, I'm not sure that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose said you don't hafta be!  Only I hafta be and I think it's way better if I have the boy's name since I have the boy's body.  I'll let ya know when I need somethin' else, K?

Were you in on this too?\u201d Shane yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course. Do you think I was such a slutty bimbo by choice? I was once like you, a man unable to see what was truly important in his life. Always chasing after the sluttiest women I could. That was until I met a witch who cursed me to become a bimbo just like the women I chased after. I was forced to live in that horrible body for years until Rose approached me. She told me of all the texts, messages, and flirting you had done with other women. Rose couldn\u2019t undo the curse on me, however she could pass it on to you if you willingly cheated on her. I simply had to play my part and let you do the rest.\u201d Vanessa said in your body as she laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this was all a setup? I was just a pawn in your game?\u201d You yelled in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t feel bad. I never could have done this on my own. You did this to yourself.\u201d Vanessa said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will get my body back I promise!\u201d You shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood luck. I think I will enjoy being you. Honestly it just feels great to be a man again. Also here are a few tips about that body. You remember how I only ever wore slutty outfits and heels? That\u2019s because that body can\u2019t wear anything not sexy. If you try to wear anything not sexy or revealing it will itch and burn your skin like fire. You will also start noticing a deep burning sexual desire growing inside you. However you don\u2019t need to worry, you can\u2019t become pregnant or even contract an STD. You will just slowly become the kind of slutty bimbo you always secretly wanted. Later Shane...Well I guess I am Shane now. Have a great life Vanessa!\u201d He said as the phone line went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane was stunned. He had been set up and tricked! This was all an elaborate scheme and he was the victim! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShane couldn\u2019t believe it. What was he going to do now? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was flat, with short dark hair and glasses.

She was getting sexier and sexier every video as she would react and show off the changes in excitement. However about halfway through the video series her reactions started to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay guys! Getting a bit worried here...I thought the changes stopped last night. My boobs were a nice full C cup. My skin finally smoothed out and my curves were nice and defined. However I\u2019m noticing my boobs are still growing...They seem to be losing their natural tear drops shapes too getting rounder.\u201d She said in the video as Vanessa paused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the videos continued her reactions got worse and worse. She kept getting sexier and more bimbo like in every video. Slowly losing the ability to wear normal clothes, always thinking about sex, even her attitude changed at the end as she became bubbly and air headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat lying bitch!\u201d Vanessa said outloud as she finished the final video.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Rose! She found and cursed this poor girl and left her to turn into this slut while she was dating you! However when things didn\u2019t go as planned she simply switched the curse over to you! Both you and the old Vanessa were just pawns in her sick little game...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image was clear now of how you found yourself in this position the problem was how were you going to get out?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some more time on the computer you saw it her email was blowing up with messages about when the next video would be uploaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remembered the calander was labeled \u201ctits\u201d today. That meant she most likely would do a topless video of her rubbing and massaging her huge boobs on camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated the idea of doing this kind of a video but the website was her primary source of income...If people stopped donating then she would run out of money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

Choosing to turn, or cross the road, depending on whether there was traffic or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was able to turn down the innuendos and suggests that seemed to accompany every -<i>fucking</i>- step. The constant jiggle and shimmy reminding her how she'd failed Rose, and the price she was paying. Hell! Even walking felt like a cock-tease, her hips moving far more than they had as a guy, and in different ways, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach pace landing firmly, sending a ripple up through her body. Her arse felt a mile wide, and it was next to impossible to stop her hands bumping against them as she walked. And those tits, -<i>Jesus</i>- Those tits, so firm and so high, they felt like they were ready to leap free if she hurried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the comments she heard, spiked in her imagination. The lewd suggestions more graphic, and horrifyingly easy to picture. Her position, far different from before. Instead of having his cock sucked, she was the one on her knees. Hands holding her down, keeping her in place. Her protests, and fights too weak to be serious. Her mouth wide with a cock jammed tight in her mouth, her lips forming a seal. Her tongue incapable of not exploring the intruder. The more she pictured it, the more real it became. The gagging sensation, the stale taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering and closing her eyes, she stopped, but the fantasy continued, the salty blast of cum filling her mouth. She almost puked, just from that alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting down the bile rising in her throat, Vanessa looked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHorrified, to find a giant yellowing poster of her, with only a few strategically placed quotes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vixen Vanessa always satisfies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bouncer at the door waves to her, as if expecting her. \"Side entrance, toots.\" he nods his head towards the alley beside the main building. \"You can't give away the goods, and still expect them to howl for more inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks like he could only be a bouncer, all muscle and no brains. Shuddering you realise he thinks he's smarter than you... Smarter then Vanessa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Corral.\" Flashes off and on, above the door. A lasso appearing around a startled women in garish neon. Her capture, her surprise shown in cartoonish shock. Your lip curls in contempt, trying to forget this was where you met Lucy. 'Luscious Lucy', with those lips that promised heaven in a blow-job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flicker of a smile crosses your face, as you remember the first encounter. It was truly mind-blowing. You've never felt more sleazy than now lit by gaudy neon, with your tig ol' bits round, firm and gloriously on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's impossible to believe you ended up here by chance. Well, that and the fact the bouncer knows you, and your ex is a witch. A curl of cigarette smoke rises from the side door. It's lit by the framed light as the door opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe desire to run, the desperate urge to flee grips you, but your body refuses to comply. You look to the strip club, and know that your future lies there... and perhaps if Rose forgives you, perhaps beyond it too.</span></div></div>",

Surely, there was something less sexy in the apartment. Double checking the door was locked, and the chain was on, she ripped the red dress angrily off, over her head. It caught in her hair, pulling painfully, until it ripped loose. The seams surrendering to her harsh treatment. Scowling down at the pool of red, Vanessa stamped on it, as if it were a deadly snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body moved with a fluid grace that felt like she was eager for attention. But any attempts at moving more like a man, came off as awkward stomping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bedroom was a nightmare, the floor covered in discarded clothes.... Underwear, skirts, and tops tossed aside. Vanessa was an untidy girl. She knew before pulling it open the top drawer was full of underwear. But the sight of it made her want to recoil, the panties, the thongs, and all the horrific variety of underwear made her take a step backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, unfamiliar memories surfaced of trying on each of those items. With her generous ass, it felt like all of them were thongs, as they vanished between those hungry ass cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the other drawers, Vanessa picked out the most anonymous, the least sexy items she could. An almost loose fitting grey top, and some white shorts. The long chestnut hair was already a bother, constantly keeping her aware of it. A reminder of her new sex (as if she needed it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry, she picked up the phone. Calling Rose, she needed to know how long she was to be punished like this. Straddling a chair, she settled down to put on her most sincere apology into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/a732a69be7ba3b91f6775fc035f275af/tumblr_pm24iqFpJ01w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/a732a69be7ba...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Vanessa.\" Rose's chipper voice grated immediately, Vanessa's teeth grinding straight away. \"Hi Rose.\" she managed to sound friendly, even bubbly if a little strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying your little love-pad...\" Rose's barb sharp as ever, using your own half-joking name for you home as a jibe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, a bachelor pad isn't quite the same when the occupant is a woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa silently fumed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A slut, isn't as charming as a rogue, or a gigolo, is it?\" Her tone already answering her mocking question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A nympho... A hussy... a tart or a strumpet... Aren't as charming either, are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa temper snapped, and she raged, abuse and vitriol flowing until pausing for breath, she realised Rose had already hung up. But, it felt good to unload, empowering if useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat good feeling didn't last long, as Vanessa felt a warmth spreading through her hips. Trying to rise, her legs didn't respond. She was powerless, as she felt her hips widen... as she felt the extra heft adding to her rump, swelling rounder, fuller and horrifyingly just as firm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/567be4e6f841dbd59303623afff60ab5/tumblr_pm24iqFpJ01w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/567be4e6f841...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrieking she erupted from the seat once the changes were complete. Vanessa truly blessed with an eye-watering ass. Her stumbling steps backwards once more reminding her of the mobility of her new pelvis, waist, and everything in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears flowing freely down her cheeks, Vanessa glowered at the abandoned phone sitting in the tatters of her red dress. She needed to try again, to apologise, to beg, to do anything, say anything to end this nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, to herself 'or at least find out <i>if</i>... it's going to end'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBending to pick up the phone, she felt that ass move with every step, every movement keeping her hyper aware of her new over-stuffed ass. She noticed the other little changes now, far less significant, but still horrifying. Her nails now pale pink, and longer than before, drummed on the phone screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe call Rose once more...</span></div></div>",

The extra padding noticeable too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing around the empty apartment, she found that width forced her to walk with a hip-swaying strut. Each step also coming with a rump ripple, as she planted her feet. Catching sight of her reflection, she admired the shimmy and shake, as if she were still a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly for the fantasy to collapse, as reality crushed her. Hoping, that Rose was punishing her, Vanessa decided to stay home. No need to trawl for guys, and any venture outside would certainly lead to unwanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwitching the TV on, Vanessa scowled at the show that lit up the screen. It didn't seem quite so much fun as it had before Rose had caught her cheating. But, she left it on, and headed to the kitchenette. Squeezing around the unit, those hips still feeling a mile wide. She scowled at the wall-mounted cupboards, all just a few inches too high to be comfortable. Bending down to check the units beneath the work surface, Vanessa found the heft of her sumptuous rump making her unsteady, as she balanced. Shuffling backwards, her ass met the wall quicker than she liked. Trying to ignore it, she opened the cupboards. The doors swung wide, and she found in her haste they brushed against her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGasping, as they flicked her nips in passing, Vanessa felt a wave of heat wash through her body. Startled and scared she quickly rose to her feet, as if could leave that arousing heat on the floor down there. But, it was clear the flat was empty of food. Mockingly her stomach chose that moment to rumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe work surface held only a kettle and sundries. She made herself a coffee, and sat down to out-wait Rose. The same hip-swinging sashay back to the living room was another humiliation.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her shoulders collapsed, as she realised she needed a piss.... as she realised this time she needed a seat. Afraid of having an accident, she left the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to peel the short shorts from her broad hips, forcing them beyond the expansive swell of that juicy rump, and down. Relieving herself Vanessa tried to pretend nothing was happening, as she studiously ignored the sounds. Instinct, made her wipe with the nearby toilet paper. In moments, the friction making her change to a softer dabbing touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was oddly exciting, and unsettling, until she felt she was dry enough. Vanessa discovered peeling the shorts off was nothing compared to trying to pull them back into place. A humiliating jiggling, bouncing hop seemed to help, as she slid half an inch higher each time. The rippling rolling flesh allowing the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally in place, they looked almost painted on. Vanessa took in the zipper and the popper on the waistband. She already felt like she was falling out of them.</span></div></div>",

She didn't appreciate the way the women filled them as much. She was restless, as she sat keeping her hands in her lap, as her fingers fidgeted constantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grumble that came from her stomach spoke of emptiness rather than urgency. The thought of peeling of her shorts not needed this time. However, she quickly scanned the contents of the kitchen, the cupboards, and found them all bare. Widening her search, she hunted for biscuits and sweets in every room of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she jammed her hands into the pockets of the coats in a last desperate attempt for even a last wrapped sweet, she knew she'd have to leave. Slipping on the largest overcoat, that smothered her shape, she patted her pockets double-checking she had keys to get back in, and a purse to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMockingly, Rose had left her the coat, one sized for a man. Feeling like a flasher she wrapped the coat around herself, and hoped it wasn't too obvious that she was wearing little beneath it. Descending the stairs, she found her ass soon started jiggling, and her titties too joining in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swivel and sway of her hips ensuring her body was constantly in motion. Even stopping on each landing to allow the humiliating rippling and rolling to stop. Vanessa's symphony of motion restarted as soon as she was walking. Those wide hips, and over-ripe titties were just incapable of not dancing at her sashaying pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the street, she realised quite how much shorter she was now. How much more vulnerable she felt, not being able to look over heads, and shoulders. Instead, her vision was filled with them, jostling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt invisible in the bustle, or degradingly visible as some men openly gaped. The coat not fully smothering the motion of her bust as she approached, and feeling their eyes again on her rump as she passed them.</span></div></div>",
