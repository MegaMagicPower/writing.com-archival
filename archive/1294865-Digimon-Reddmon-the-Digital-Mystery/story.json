I thought they would have retired after the whole D-Reaper incident\" Redd said to no-one. \"They everything under control, I wonder what I should do first, since their busy?\"( Redd/Reddmon stores things in an etheral state of existance so things he needs just 'appear')</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>  The city hall wasn't hard to find, but, to Redd's surprise, had a very strong security force. It also had a large number of security cameras but that wasn't a problem. Redd took out his digi-vice (it works on himself lol) and, when no one was watching, pulled out a blue card as well. Walking into a nearby restroom Redd walked into a stall and slashed the card.<br>\r\n-MATRIX DIGIVOLUTION-<br>\r\n  REDDMON MATRIX DIGIVOLVE TO: DEVIREDDMON!<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n   DeviReddmon slammed open the stall door, knocking it off its hinges in the process. Luckily no-one else was in the restroom at the time or his whole plan would've been ruined. slipping over to the door DeviReddmon slipped open just a crack.Normally, the demon digimon would've thought about making ameal out of one the innocent passers-by, but now wasn't the time for snacking. A gas grenade materialized in his hand. Pulling off the pin, DeviReddmon threw the grenade out of the slight opening and shut the door fast. There was a sharp 'FOOMP' and DeviReddmon held his breath, making sure he didn't breathe in the gases, in order to preserve conciousness<br>\r\n  By the time DeviReddmon reached the room containing documents such as birth certificates, the gas had already spread throughout the whole building. Quickly, but carefully, the demon forged his own birth certificate. As he prepared to leave, he noticed some files sticking out of one the filing cabinets he opened when looking for the place to store his birth certificate. The file was marked: TAMERS. Quickly snatching the file and dematerializing it, DeviReddmon slipped out of the room. As he did he heard a moaning sound coming from the direction he had to go towards. \"Shoot! One of the guards is waking up way too early!\" The demon's hungry stomach growled in response to his outburst. <br>\r\n  As the guard got up he saw a strange figure headed towards him. Pulling out his gun he warned the figure,\"Stop or I'll shoot!\" The figure kept coming. The guard fired, a mistake, though he wouldn't to find out. <br>\r\n As soon as the gun fired everything slowed in DebiReddmon's eyes. He saw the bullet coming at him, but he wasn't worried. Putting out his hand so quickly that it wouldn't be seen, he grabbed the bullet out of mid-air and threw it back at the guard. He threw so hard, in fact, that the bullet went twice as fast back as it did forward!<br>\r\n The guard fell to the ground, death was instantaneous. DeviReddmon walked up to his body and smirked. \"I shouldn't let a good body go to waste, so I'll just take it with me.\" Picking up the dead body, he proceeded to stuff it into his mouth, uniform, gun, and all! <br>\r\n  DeviReddmon headed back to the restroom in which he had originally transformed. He wasn't dumb, he knew that if he ran and a person who was on the security tapes wasn't there when the police arrived people would be suspicious. Prying a pipe off of the wall he lifted it appove his head, and dropped it. The split second that the pipe took to hit him was all he needed to switch to his human form, although he probably didn't enjoy the fact that he was imediately knocked by the falling pipe.

And even if we could follow undetected we may not be able to get to every place they may go. Lastly imagine if they caught us following them\". <br>\r\nThey sat there pondering this for a while trying to find a soloution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Meanwhile At Reddmons House~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat an onlooker would see is a red blur streaming around the house cleaning at hyperspeed (that being the card he used to acomplish this much), dust flying everwhere and water flying.

She comes in and opens the door unaware Reddmon is about to head into that room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRASH!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon goes flying into Renamon were they both procede to go flying out the window do to the immense ammount of momentum, and they land ONCE AGAIN in the pool. \"Deja vu much?\" Reddmon said as they surfaced.Renamon just laughed and hugged and kissed him. After about 15 minutes of \"playing\" in the pool, they get out and head inside to dry off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~Back with the Tamers~<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you said you were at his house at one time, Right?\" Henry asked Rika.<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" Rika replied \"Why?\".<br>\r\n\"If we can't watch them why don't we watch where they are most likely to be together\"<br>\r\n\"Thats a great idea\" Rika and Takato said together,\"But what about at night?\". <br>\r\n\"I have a few night vision camera's so they should do\" Henry replied.<br>\r\n\"So thats how we'll watch them\" They agreed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After an hour or so Reddmon comes to. As he pushes himself up he looks round for any sign of Renamon. Spotting a thin trail of blood he leaps to his feet and curses \"Damn she must have opened a wound when she knocked me out.\" Then he is hit by a bout of vertigo and immediately falls over again. Shaking his head he mutters \"I've gotta stop letting her hit my in the head.\" to himself as he groggily stands and runs off along the trail of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon lent against the wall of an alley for support, panting heavily. She'd finally escaped that cursed Reddmon. As she thinks of him she remembers the first time they'd met, the jerk had lent in for a kiss mid battle, the strange thing was she couldn't keep up any anger towards him. Pushing of the wall she sighed \"I've got to get him out of my head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's this? Do I have a rival in the war of love?\" An all to familiar voice whispered close behind her.  \"Damn its him.\" she muttered to herself. Suddenly further along the alley a large ball of fire streaked from the sky slamming into the ground raising a thick cloud of dirt and powered concrete. Behind her Reddmon groaned \"Damn not him.\" Renamon glanced behind her, if Reddmon thought this guy was a pain he was probably going to be big trouble \"Who is it?\". Reddmon sighed  \"His names Orionmon, his kind of a rival, of combat not love of course.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he spoke the dust settled revealing a large humanoid digimon with heavy looking steal plates seemingly riveted to his body. On his arms a pair of spikes where set into steal casings and judging by there size they could extend a good half meter. As he stood up he looked down the alley towards them his pale green eyes drilling into Reddmon. He stepped out of the small crater his arrival had created and walked towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his shoulders back slightly and chuckled loudly. \"About time I found you Reddmon. I was worried he might get to you first.\" Reddmon stepped forward slightly putting himself between her and Orionmon. Renamon frowned slightly, it seamed like a unconscious action. Did he really care about her? \"What do you mean, its not like you to announce your presence like this?\"  Orionmon was close now, no more than a meter away. He was considerably larger than Reddmon though his stance and demeanor were not threatening.  \"Reddmon, someones after you. Rival or not I still consider you a friend of sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon stood up a little straighter and crossed his arms in front of his chest. \"You really consider me a friend? Well thats nice, wait what do you mean someones after me.\"  Behind her  Renamon heard a sound like ripping fabric. They all looked towards the source of the noise to see a large black digimon seeming to claw through the fabric of the air. The digimon had two sets of ragged red wings folded behind him and large patches of a translucent material on his head and legs revealing circuitry of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon pointed towards him and simply said \"Him. We should go.\" He motioned behind him and a large black hole opened from nowhere. He gently pushed them both behind him, towards the hole \"Quickly Go.\" He whispered urgently as the mystery digimon started to gather energy within its claws. Reddmon and Renamon didn't need to be told twice and dived through the hole. Once they where through Orionmon jumped backwards through the gap closing it after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renamon tumbles through the darkness she started to lose consciousness, the last thing she sensed was a warm prescience rapping its arms around her and embracing her, almost, protecting her. She caught a glimpse or red then blacked out.</span></div></div>",

She pushed herself up looking round, the first thing she noticed was Reddmon lying next to her. Clean bandages wrapped around his hear. The next thing she noticed was that her own dressings had been changed and by the looks of it they had been done professionally, opposed to the rather haphazard job Reddmon had done. \"Ah, you awake good.\" Renamon looked in the direction of the noise to see Orionmon sitting on a log. putting the book he was holding down he stood up and walked over to her, bending down and offering her his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the offered hand and letting Orionmon help her up, looking around she found she was in the  clearing of what appeared to be an utterly serene forest. \"What happened? And were are we and what happened to Reddmon?\" Orionmon looked up and rubbed the back of his head with his hand. \"Well for the fist and last question, the trip here didn't seem to agree with you, probably to do with your wounds. Well as you were falling Reddmon grabbed you and fell first he took a bad knock to the head but a bit of rest and he should be fine. And before you yell at me I was to busy keeping the path clear.\" Renamon frowned that explained how they got here but. \"So who was that other digimon?\" Orionmon glanced worriedly towards Reddmon then refocused on her. \"A digimon named Cyberdramon is trying to deleting virus digimon. I found out that Reddmon was his next target, so I rushed over and saved him. And here we are. And lastly, were in a safe place that no one but me can enter and exit. I call it my sanctuary but you can call it whatever you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenemon sighed to herself. she was hungry and still a bit sore. As if reading her mind Orionmon motioned towards the tree line. \"If you want food or water there is a fridge over there. And I can fetch anything else you need.\" Renemon glanced over at Reddmon. \"Don't worry i'll keep watching him, come back when you get some food.\" Renamon nodded then walked in the motioned direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushed beside a branch to reveal a fridge oven and several kitchen appliances all plugged into a tree. Renamon opened the fridge, inside was a variety of fruits and meats, she picked a piece of pork an orange and a small bottle of water then closed the door behind her. As she reentered the clearing Orionmon motioned for her to come over and sit next to him. Swallowing the mouthful she was chewing she sat next to him. \"What's wrong?\" <br>\r\n\"I've got to go and sort some stuff out, gather some intel and what not. Could you watch over him and explain everything to him if he wakes up?\" Renamon frowned \"What exactly is going on?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said Cyberdramon is deleting virus type digimon. This not only includes Reddmon but Guilmon as well. As far as I can tell he can only be defeated if the digidestined, Reddmon and myself work together. So i'm keeping you both safe while you recuperate.\" He reached behind his back and pulled out a laptop computer. \"Here, use this to contact Rika and the others and explain everything to them. I'll be back later.\" With that Orionmon turned and created another portal. But before he stepped through he paused and looked back \"Hey Renamon your not sure about your feelings for Reddmon are you. Well I think really cares for you. Try hiding and watching when he wakes up, see what he does.\" And with that he left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Renamon asked but the hole had already closed. She looked back toward Reddmon. \"Do I really like this guy?\" From the first time they'd met to now he'd changed a lot. And he seemed to becoming protective of her. Renamon began absentmindedly peeling the orange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do know.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she waited for Reddmon to come round Renamon decided to to take a look at the area. Teleporting to the top of a tree Renamon was surprised to see that the ocean of green was seemingly endless. The sky and the trees met on the horizon, no hills or other changes in the terrain. Looking around Renamon noticed that one of the trees nearby had a strange blemish on its trunk. Curious Renamon jumped over to have a look and found that the blemish was in fact a handle. Renamon gripped it tightly and yanked it open. Inside the tree proved to be hollowed out and filled with everything from medical supplies to a folded up tent. Rummaging through the medical supplies Renamon found some mild painkillers. She took out few tablets and chuckled to herself \"Reddmon would probably want these when he wakes up.\" she said to herself, then closed the door again. Glancing around Renamon noticed quite a few trees had similar handles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to check on Reddmon again Renamon hopped from tree to tree until she reached the edge of the clearing. Crouching on a branch Renamon looked down at him, laying alone in the clearing. She realized just how little she knew about him. Besides his name and a bit about his personality he was a stranger to her. Maybe she could talk to Orionmon, they seemed to know each other pretty well. Maybe he was alone in the world. That could explain all the trouble he gets into. She had Rika and the other digidestined, her comrades and friends. Who did Reddmon have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted as Reddmon rolled over and slowly pushed himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon pushed himself up and rubbed his head, a pounding headache causing him to stumble. As the ground rushed up towards him Reddmon closed his eyes and braced for it. Not able to react properly. But instead he felt someone catch him under the arms. He opened his eyes to see Renamon grinning at him. He smiled back at her and regained his balance, steadying himself on her shoulder. \"Thanks.\" She nodded and led him over to a log at the edge of the clearing they were in then helped him sit down.  \"Uugh. So were in Orionmon place right? Where is he?\" Renamon nodded \"Yes, he went off somewhere. He said he would be back soon.\" She glanced around. \"Have you been hear before?\" Reddmon looked up at the sky \"Yeah, three times. Usually its like this, peaceful and serene but once it was pretty freaky. Everything was dead and rotting. I think it might reflect his mind or something. Not sure what was wrong with him. But anyway are you ok?\" He glanced at her, the bandages covering her injuries had been changed, probably by Orionmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes thank you. But why did you save me?\" Reddmon felt a sudden flush of heat rise to his face. Why did he save her? \"Err, sorry i've got to find some medicine. My heads killing me.\" Reddmon got up and started to walk towards one of the nearby trees trying to inconspicuously hide his face from her. <br>\r\n\"Oh wait, Reddmon, I found some in one of the trees.\" Damn! Reddmon thought to himself, then turned around to see her holding out a pair of tablets. He smiled hoping his fur would mask the blush. \"Thanks.\" He took the tablets and swallowed them then sat down again, feeling awkward and uncomfortable. \"Any idea who that black digimon was?\" Renamon frowned. \"Yeah, Orionmon said his name was Cyberdramon and he was trying to delete you and any other Virus digimon.\" Reddmon looked at Renamon, she was clasping her hands in front of her, staring worriedly at them. Reddmon groaned mentally. He had no idea what to do, women weren't his strong point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly slid over next to her and put his hand on her shoulder. As he made contact she twitched slightly. Not a good sign but he pressed onward anyway. \"Hey, if your worried about Guilmon, he is a virus digimon right? Don't worry he's tough and he has the other digimon to help him. C'mon Orionmon must have a computer around here somewhere.\"  He looked around and spotted a laptop next to a tree and got up to fetch it. As he sat down again Renamon laughed \"Oh yeah Orionmon left that for me. I had completely forgotten about it. I'd better tell Rika and the others where we are.\" As she took the laptop and turned it on Reddmon smiled. \"I think telling them your with me might only make them more worried.\" Renamon smiled back and Reddmon sighed in relief. \"That smile looks good on you.\" She looked at him in a strange way, then her smile widened. Reddmon decided to push it further. \"At least i'm not kissing you without you permission...\" His witty remark was cut off as her lips touched his. For several seconds they kissed Reddmon thoroughly confused but still enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled back blushing profusely and after a few seconds Reddmon snapped out of the slight daze he was in and rubbed the back of his head. \"I guess I had that coming from before.\"  Renamon laughed softly then looked into his eyes. Seeming to see something inside him. \"Reddmon...</span></div></div>",

Shortly after him Rika, Takato, Henry appeared as well as Guilmon and Terriermon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the clearing they each had hugley different reactions. Takato and Guilmon switched to offensive stances and prepared to attack him, Rika looked worried and asked Renamon \"What are you doing here, with him.\" pointing towards Reddmon, while Henry and Terriermon just looked around slightly confused by all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly Guilmon growled and charged forward. Orionmon called out after him. \"Guilmon! Stop! He's in the same situation as you are.\" Guilmon slid to a halt and cocked his head staring straight at Reddmon. \"What do you mean?\" Orionmon walked over to a tree and dropped himself down against it. Grunting in pain as he did so. \"Renamon would be be able to get me my medical supplies. Their in that...\" Renamon teleported over to a tree and opened it retrieving a box from within it and jumping over next to him \"Sorry I noticed the handles earlier and got Reddmon some painkillers.\" Orionmon just nodded \"Thank you. Would you be able to open it up take out a thread and needle and sew the wound shut?\" Renamon shook her head \"You sure. I don't have much medical knowledge.\" Orionmon nodded \"I just need it closed so it can heal properly. Anyway, Guilmon do you remember that black digimon?\" Guilmon sat down nodding \"Yeah, what did he want anyway?\" Orionmon motioned for everyone to sit down as Renamon poured some antiseptic liquid on his wound and began preparing the needle and thread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should explain everything so everyone is up to speed. First off the black digimon is called Cyberdramon. He's a renegade digimon on a mission to systematically delete all virus digimon. He always has a primary and secondary target. Currently thats Reddmon and Guilmon respectively. Because Reddmon was here, where Cyberdramon couldn't access, he switched to finding Guilmon. He just happened to find you when you all had gathered to talk about Ranamon's absence. I intervened and we escaped here.\" Henry raised his hand, as if he was in class. Orionmon smiled and nodded to him. \"But you were able to stop him. Why didn't you just defeat him there and then?\" Orionmon chuckled a little then winced as Renamon <br>\r\nthreaded the needle through again. \"Distracting a superior enemy is different from defeating him. Much longer and he would have beaten me into the<br>\r\ndirt. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon finished sewing him up and cut the string with a pair of scissors from the kit. As she she put the supplies back in the box Orionmon thanked her and she went to replace the box in the tree. As she returned and sat back down next to Reddmon, something everyone noticed, especially Reddmon. Guilmon raised his hand. \"So why are you helping Reddmon? I mean he's a jerk.\" Takato nodded his arms crossed. Again Orionmon chuckled as Reddmon tensed his paw slightly ready to beat up this punk again. \"Trust me thats mainly bravado. He's more or less a decent sort. He's just a bit, how should I put this, brash. And anyway I have known him for a while now, we met at a tournament. Which he won, knocking me out for a day or two, when I came round he was at my bedside gloating straight off the bat. Needless to say the hospital staff weren't too pleased about the hole that Reddmon made in the wall.\" Reddmon frowned halfheartedly, he remembered that day. \"That was only because you threw me at it.\" Everyone laughed including Renamon, who giggled and put her hand on Reddmon's shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon continued \"But after that we more or less settled into the position of rivals, fighting every know and again, with a roughly equal record. eventually I guess we just became friends. And thats why i'm here, to help a friend. So before I go any further, everyone hungry?\" There was nods from most members of the group. Orionmon glanced at the sky which suddenly started to darken slightly, then groaned as he pushed himself to his feet. <br>\r\n\"I need some firewood. Would anyone like to volunteer to cut down a tree?\"</span></div></div>",

Maybe it was the bad boy image Reddmon setup around himself. She sighed and shook her head, \"Each to her own I suppose.\" she mumbled to her self. \"Sorry what was that?\" asked Takato. \"Hmm, oh, nothing. Hey Orionmon can I help with anything.\" Orionmon cocked his head, looking at her intensely for a moment \"Well until they get back with the wood there is not much we can do. Though, would you like to come help me get vegetables and meat ready?\" \"Yeah sure.\" she replied standing up and following him out. \"Oh and everyone else feel free to look around. Theres all sorts of interesting things within the trees.\" As she followed him she couldn't help but wonder, why store things in the trees?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she followed Orionmon through the trees to another clearing she was suprised to see that he had a full kitchen with oven and even a sink. as Orionmon opened the fridge and rummaged through it, pulling different things from inside. \"Hold it a minute. Orionmon,\" he stopped and poked his head over the door \"Yes Rika is there something you want?\" \"Why do you need firewood when you have a stove?\" He just shrugged and went back to looking for stuff in the fridge. \"I just thinks its more fun to cook by a wood fire.\" What a strange guy. Rika thought to her self \"would you be able to get a pair of knives and cutting boards from that cupboard, as well as a large metal bowl from that shelf.\" Pointing to the corresponding locations. Rika walked over to the cupboard he pointed to and opened it. In side she found a weird assortment of cooking knives, cutting boards and weaponry that seemed to go from medieval to current day. Again Rika felt a bit worried about this guy. She grabbed a pair of knives an two large cutting boards then put then on the table top. then reached up and got a bowl from a shelf attached to a tree trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon closed the fridge and took the bowl from her putting an large chuck of some sort of meat in it and sweeping the rest of the food into it as well. \"Any particular type of curry you like Rika?\"  He asked opening another cupboard while holding the bowl in one hand. This cupboard was filled with all sorts of condiments and spices. \"Red curry I guess. So you cook a lot?\" Oriomon nods and takes out the mentioned curry. \"Yes that's one of the big difference between me and Reddmon. He can't cook for himself so he usually just steals food. Kind of sad really. Could you bring the knives and board?\"<br>\r\nHe put the curry powder in the bowl and walked back towards the other clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they entered the clearing Reka noticed that Takato and the others had dug a hole and surrounded it with rocks as well as set up a collapsible table nearby. Orionmon put the things he was holding on the table and Rika put the knives and board next to it. Orionmon walked over to the fire pitt and gave it a quick inspection. \"It's a good job. Seems like some one has gone camping before. And thanks for getting out the table. Good thinking.\" Orionmon nodded towards Takato and Henry who were in a tree going through another cabinet. \"Thanks. We found some sleeping bags as well. Do want them out.\" Henry called holding up a large green bag. \"Yes, you might as well get them out now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon busied himself setting out the ingredients while Rika helped the boys get all the sleeping bags down. Once they were all down Rika noticed there was only seven of them. \"Hey, Orionmon were on sleeping bag short. Will that be ok?\" \"Yes, I usually don't sleep on the ground at all, let alone on a bed of any kind. Why, those are brand new. So does anyone know where Guilmon and Terriermon got to?\" Takato lowered himself down from the tree. \"Yeah, they said they were going to explore the forest.\"  Orionmon chuckled as he began peeling and chopping vegetables with a deftness that was quite surprising. \"Their probably hopelessly lost by now so once Renamon and Reddmon come back i'll go find them.\" when finished with one vegetable he would put it in the large bowl and begin on the next one. Takato sat down on a log and Henry laid down resting his head on the log next to it. \"Nah Guilmons got a good sense of smell and Terriermons got an excellent sense of direction. \"Well that would help usually but this place is a bit different. The only reason I think Reddmon can get back on his own is that he has been here before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry what was that.\" Everyone turned around to see Reddmon heavily burdened with pieces of wood and Renamon carrying one or two as well as an axe. \"Ah, good, your back. I'll go find the others then.\" He stood up and raised his arm in and opening gesture then a black circle opened up in the air before him. Orionmon paused for a second \"Could someone find a pot and boil some water then just throw the vegetables in.\" Henry got up and brushed himself off. \"Sure i'll do it.\" Orionmon nodded thanks and stepped into the hole which disappeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon sat down next to Rika while Reddmon dropped the wood near the edge of the clearing and began split it into smaller pieces, throwing them into the fire pit until they had a large enough pile. Renamon and Rika watched while he went around looking for matches to light the fire. \"Rika, i'm sorry if you were worried the last couple of days, but well my injuries were worse than we thought and he kind of helped me heal. I tried to come home but then all the mess with Orionmon happened.\" Rika scratched the back of her head. At least she was safe. \"It's fine Renamon. But what are we going to do about this Cyberdramon. We can't just let him delete Guilmon.\" Renamon shook her head \"Or Reddmon.\" Rika looked over at the Boys who had gotten the fire lit and were putting a large black pot over it. \"It seems like they've gotten over the earlier incident at least.\" commented Renamon. \"Yeah but Guilmons probably going to want another fight at the earliest opportunity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this another hole opened out of nowere and Guilmon, Terriermon and Orionmon stepped out. Rika noted that Guilmon and Terriermon looked slightly sheepish. \"Sorry everyone we got a bit lost.\" said Terriermon. Guilmon just shrugged and went over to see what everyone was doing. Orionmon and Terriermon followed shortly after. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the smells of food began to waft through out the clearing. \"Dinners ready!\" called Guilmon happily. The whole time he had been sitting next to the pot smelling the food as it cooked. Orionmon produced a stack of plates from nowhere while Reddmon teleported away and reappeared with cutlery a moment later. The food was ladled out and every one was soon sitting around the fire eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\"coughed Henry \"how are we going to deal with this?\"</span></div></div>",

Crossing his arms he declared \"This guys not going to stop hunting Guilmon and me till we're deleted right?\" Orionmon nods. \"Well that means were going to have to delete him first.\" Every one made noises of agreement. \"But Cyberdramon is an ultimate digimon, right?\" Asked Rika. \"Correct,\" answered Orionmon \"and an exceptionally strong one as well. We cant just attack him in a knock down drag out fight. Even with our combined strength he would be able to delete both his targets. We need a strong plan with backups for every contingency.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if we all digivolved to ultimate form?\" asked Terriermon. Orionmon nodded \"Most digimon become slower when in their ultimate form, with exceptions of those like Renamon and Cyberdramon, while we might have the force to defeat him, we would lack the speed to hit him. While he would easily be able to hit us.\" Renamon shook her head. \"Well, why don't I go ultimate and everyone else stay in champion?\" Reddmon caught on as everyone else agreed. \"Because that could make you the priority target. He seems to work in a systematic manner. Right Orionmon?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon nodded \"Yes, that's correct as well. What I was thinking was that we would use his programming against him. Reddmon stays in front of him drawing his attention, taking a defensive stance. While Reddmon dodges I will be moving around them both, stopping Cyberdramons attacks and counterattacking. We will both be in our rookie forms, mainly because our champion forms are a bit, how should I put this? uncontrollable?  The other digimon should be hanging back making ranged attacks when ever they see an opening. The digidestined should be behind them supporting them with ability cards, and getting anyone that gets hurt away. Anyone see any problems so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon raised his claw. \"What if he starts attacking you or one of us?\" \"Then both Reddmon and myself will be able to intervene. But remember that this whole plan revolves around keeping Cyberdramon off balance. If he becomes particularly determined to hurt one of us or someone gets seriously hurt, or anything else we can't handle turns up I will have to digivolve my self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, why is that bad?\" Asked Takato. Orionmon smiled. \"Because, my champion form is a mindless killing machine with no control over his actions, if Cyberdramons weakened a bit first I might be able to defeat him. If it comes to that i'll need Reddmon and Renamon to get the destined away. Guilmon and Terriermon should be able to get escape by themselves. When you've all gotten far enough away i'll need Reddmon to come back. And if Cyberdramon isn't defeated, to save me or if he is to bring me back here, I tend to pass out after a fight. Again any more questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato crossed his arms frowning. \"Why is he attacking us anyway Orionmon?\" Orionmon shrugged. \"I'm not entirely sure. But it's either because he is a rouge program made from corrupted data. Or some one has sent him to delete Reddmon and Guilmon.\" \"Who would do that?\" Asked Guilmon. \"I might be able to find out if we capture him, but beyond that.\" He shrugged. \"Where would we fight him? We can't just start a fight in the real world. If what you say is true and you digivolve you could hurt some one.\" Noted Henry \"Well somewhere around here would be the safest option.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do you think we should do this?\" Reddmon asked. Orionmon scratched his head. \"Well Renamons healed, as have you and i'm probably going to be fine after a nights sleep, so how about tomorrow morning?\" Every one nodded. Orionmon stood up, picked up a few pieces of wood and tossed them on the fire. He then walked over to a tree and sat down against it. \"I suppose everyone else should be fine to set them selves up.\" He said pointing towards the pile of sleeping bags that Rika, Takato and Henry had set up earlier, then he closed his eyes and seemed to fall asleep immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon watched as everyone got up and busied themselves, unfurling the sleeping bags and laying them down near the fire. Reddmon felt slightly uneasy, during the recent events everyone had started to accept him, Guilmon sometimes gave him sideways glances but beyond that, they seemed to be beginning to like him. He wasn't quite sure what to make of that, Orionmon was the only real friend he could remember. It was nice to be around people who liked him. He especially liked being close to Renamon. But what about when they had defeated Cyberdramon would they still let him hang around? Reddmon got up and started to walk out of the clearing. \"Hey Reddmon where are you going?\" Asked Rika. Reddmon stopped, looking round, everyone was watching at him intently. \"Ummm. I'm just going to go for a walk.\" He mumbled, then turned and continued walking into the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon was quickly surrounded by the dense woods. Suddenly he heard a twig snap and spun around to see Renamon emerge from the darkness. \"Sorry. Is something wrong Reddmon?\" Reddmon shook his head. \"Not really. Hey follow me.\" He said as he jumped to the top of a nearby tree and sat down on a branch. Renamon followed and sat next to him. \"Renamon,\" He said looking up at the starry night sky. \"I know we haven't known each other for very long, but I was hoping that after we deal with Cyberdramon that we could, you know, maybe go on a picnic or something, just us.\" Renamon giggled lightly raising her hand to her mouth. \"Reddmon, are you asking me out on a date.\" Reddmon felt himself blush \"So would you like to?\"  Renamon giggled again. \"I would love to.\" Reddmon sighed, he was getting the hang of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon put her hand on his shoulder. \"Reddmon why did you start causing trouble around the town anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon looked from the sky to Renamon who was looking at him, her blue eyes radiant in the moonlight.</span></div></div>",

He only had scraps of his past that he could recall, mainly fights that he'd been in, nothing that really told him about himself. All he had was the vivid present. He glanced at Renamon. She was different to anyone that he'd met before, she wasn't scared or threatened by him. She seemed to genuinely like him now, despite hating him just a few days ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reddmon\" She whispered. \"I never thanked you for helping me before.\" Reddmon looked down at his paws, clasped in front of him. \"Don't worry about it, besides I'm the one who hurt you in the first pla..\" His apology was cut short as Renamon held his muzzle and turned it towards her, kissing him softly. Reddmon was surprised, but not as much as last time. As she broke the kiss Reddmon mumbled \"Okay I get it now kissing you without your okay about it.\" Renamon laughed again. \"That was thanks for protecting me when we fell, not for helping me before that. This is helping me before.\" She softly hit her knuckles against his face. Reddmon smiled to himself. \"C'mon we'd better get back, it's probably going to be a hard fight tomorrow.\" He got up and took her hand, helping her stand. They both teleported back to the camp sight, arriving as quietly as they could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they appeared at the edge of the camp no one moved, all of them fast asleep. Two sleeping bags were laid out between Guilmon and Rika. Renamon took the one closet to Rika while Reddmon laid down next to her in his. As he laid down he swore he noticed Rika smile slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.</span></div></div>",

Once there we will walk around until Cyberdramon appears to attack Reddmon. Then we'll knock him through a portal leading back here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon stood up and clapped his hands together. \"Well we might as well get going then.\" Everyone nodded and got up, stacking their dishes on the table from last night. Orionmon picked up the pile and threw it over his shoulder, where they all disappeared into a hole. \"With that taken care of let's go. There is a place just nearby that should be perfect.\" Orionmon said as he started walking out of the clearing. Everyone followed him and shortly they were in a clearing that seemed almost identical to the first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika was the first to notice this and she asked Orionmon. \"So what's different about this clearing exactly?\" Orionmon looked at her. \"Simple. All the trees around here have nothing stored in them.\" Reddmon smiled to himself. He remembered asking why Orionmon stored things in the trees. He had said that it was better than leaving everything just laying about. A weird answer but true enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway is there anything anyone wants to ask before we get started?\" Everybody shook their heads. \"Everybody clear on the plan?\" There was nods all round. \"Good then Reddmon, let's go.\" He waved his arm behind him and another portal opened. Guilmon called out \"Actually one thing Orionmon, What's the deal with those hole thingies that you always make?\" Orionmon raised his hand to his chin evidentially thinking something over. \"Well I wont go into the details but it's mainly an application of something called quantum physics. I use it both as a storage device as well as transportation. You see, I may be much stronger than Reddmon but I have very little agility. I can make fast dashes, but the portals allow me to move around the battlefield quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Really.\" Said Guilmon, probably struggling with the concept of quantum physics. Then again, thought Reddmon, who doesn't?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's go Reddmon.\" said Orionmon as he stepped through his portal.</span></div></div>",

Renamon turned back to their group. \"So everyone, join your partner and go hide in a corner of the clearing. Digivolve to champion and wait for them to come back.\" Everyone nodded and ran to hide in the forest. She nodded to Rika then they both ran to a spot roughly between the boys. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were all hidden there was a pair short bursts of light and a lot of shouting declaring transformations. Renamon did likewise and was soon a large yellow nine-tailed fox with a white mane. Rika put her hand on Kyubimon's flank and said. \"Don't take unnecessary risks. Alright.\" Kyubimon laughed. \"This whole plan is risky, but we are here for friends.\" Rika nodded solemnly then looked back out to the center of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute Kyubimon was starting to get worried. What if Cyberdramon managed to delete them both? They would all be stuck here for ever. Orionmon was, after all the only person who could enter and exit this place. \"Kyubimon look.\" Whispered Rika pointing towards a hole that opened up thee metres above the ground. Suddenly Cyberdramon fell from it hitting the ground hard. After him plummeted Orionmon and Reddmon, both crashing into him. He quickly recovered and threw them both off himself. Both digimon managed to land on their feet, although Orionmon's landing was considerabley less graceful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyberdramon stood up slowly, glaring at his surroundings. As his eyes passed over Reddmon he growled threateningly straightening his body towards him and taking a step forward. This put his back to Orionmon who raised his arm and made a forward motion, then launched himself towards Cyberdramon who was bearing down upon Reddmon. As he raised his claw to strike at Reddmon he was knocked from his feet by Orionmon's bulk. Reddmon dodged back out of the way as Orionmon raised his arm which was now wreathed in flame. He yelled \"Blazing Pike!\" and brought it down, at the last second Cyberdramon reached up and pushed Orionmon's attack slightly to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lance of flame burst out of Orionmons arm boring a hole into the ground. Cyberdramon held his grip tight as Orionmon struggled, then punched him hard in the face and got his legs in between them then launched he with shocking speed into and through several trees. Kyubimon looked back towards Cyberdramon as he got up and was hit hard in the back by one Reddmons energy balls. Cyberdramon stumbled slightly from the impact but before he could get his footing he was hit in the side by a barrage of bullets from a just emerged Gargomon. Almost immediately after he was hit again by a large ball of flame from Growlmon. Kyubimon saw her chance and gathered her energy and created several balls of fire which hit the stunned Cyberdramon and engulfed him in blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stumbled around flailing at the flames Orionmon leapt from the ruins of the trees and dashed towards Cyberdramon landing a blow at his gut. He almost immediately opened a portal behind him and jumped into it. As Cyberdramon swung blindly around where Orionmon used to be Reddmon teleported behind him and landed a crushing blow at the back of his head. Cyberdramon regained his stance and shook the remnants of the fire from himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around him and locked on to Growlmon then advanced towards him. Reddmon Teleported between them about halfway and Cyberdramon barely broke step. He just refocused on Reddmon and raised his claw, which began to glow slightly. He looked like he was about to take a swing when Orionmon appeared from a hole and attempted to impale him with one of his arm mounted spikes, which was extended to about a metre long. Displaying blinding speed Cyberdramon dodged out of the way and grabbed the spike in one movement. He then slammed Orionmon to the ground and  tossed him out of the way<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon saw another opening as Cyberdramon watched Orionmon hit the ground. She used her Fox Tail Inferno attack again, aiming it squarely at his back. A moment before it hit him He crouched and dodged it easily. He jumped backwards, avoiding the flurry of lasers that Gargomon was firing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon kept up the fire, following Cyberdramon as he ran across the clearing straight towards Reddmon. He was forced to stop as Orionmon yelled \"Fire Pike!\" again and slammed into the ground in front of them. He stood up and glared at Cyberdramon in font of him. He turned his head slightly and whispered something to Reddmon who nodded and teleported away. A moment later he appeared next to her and whispered \"C'mon, he's faster than we thought. We have to leave, you take Rika and Takato. I'll help Henry. Go, now!\" He motioned for her to leave and then waved to the other digimon who nodded and backed into the forest, then teleported somewhere else, presumably to get Henry. Kyubimon knelt down to let Rika climb on her back then dashed into the forest and made her way round to where Takato was with Growlmon. \"We must escape. Takato Climb on\" said Kyubimon letting him get on too. With a nod from Growlmon they began running through the forest roughly the way they had come to get here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon turned as she heard Gargomon and Reddmon appear from the trees Reddmon carrying Henry on his back, jumping from tree to tree while Gargomon was running behind him. Knocking through any branches that got in his way. \"Reddmon do you think Orionmon will be okay?\" Asked Takato <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blood curdling roar came from behind them. \"Yeah, he should be fine.\" Reddmon replied grimly. Suddenly Kyubimon noticed him glance behind him then yell \"Every one down!\" Kyubimon stopped and quickly pressed herself as close to the ground as she could. The other digimon did likewise, and for a second there was silence. Kyubimon was about to ask why they had stopped when a massive blade of energy cut the air and trees above them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery one was forced to dodge or destroy falling trees a second later as they all came toppling down around them. As the dust cleared a perfect path was revealed. The trees cut clean through almost two metres across. Reddmon readjusted Henry on his back and nodded. \"As I said, he should be fine.\" And continued running. Everyone looked back to see that the swathe of cut trees led all the way back to the clearing and Cyberdramon could be seen fighting a digimon wielding a pair of large axes and clad in what looked like animal furs. \"C'mon.\" called Reddmon. He was following the new path and was already far ahead, waiting for them. Kyubimon shook her head muttering \"Unreal!\" to herself and following Reddmon and the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while they reach the original clearing which was untouched by the fight they could still hear going on in the distance. Reddmon let Henry get down and looked back in the direction they had come. \"I've got to go back now, everyone should wait here. Hopefully we'll be back soon.\" Reddmon sighed as he disappeared back into the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon de-digivolved into Renamon and looked from Rika to the place where Reddmon left. As she looked back at Rika she nods and Renamon runs into the forest following, Reddmon.</span></div></div>",

If either Cyberdramon or Savagemon sensed him they were likely to attack. The sounds of combat had died down as Reddmon arrived. He pushed a branch to reveal the clearing, it was almost completely unrecognizable. Massive gouges had been taken from the ground and surrounding trees and scorch marks covered everything. in the middle, standing off was the two digimon both panting and covered in cuts and gashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavagemon roared in anger and threw his axes at Cyberdramon, who managed to dodge one completely. The other hit his shoulder making him grunt in pain and stumble. As he landed Savagemon slammed both fists into the ground, causing a explosion to rip through the ground towards Cyberdramon. Cyberdramon was unable to dodge it, still recovering from the axe blow and was hit with its full force. Cyberdramon was knocked backwards slamming into a tree with enough force to shatter it in half, and slumped to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavagemon stood there for a moment, panting heavily, then was obscured by a flare of fire that surrounded him. The fire quickly dissipated to reveal Orionmon who fell to his knees. Reddmon quickly teleported next to him. leaning him over his shoulder. Orionmon glanced at him \"Thanks. This must ridiculous though, I'm nearly twice your size.\" He mumbled tiredly. Reddmon chuckled. \"Yeah, and it feels like you way a ton.\" Reddmon looked up as Renamon emerged from the forest. \"So, did you do it?\" Reddmon nodded \"He's over there.\" He said pointing to the prone form of Cyberdramon. \"Reddmon could you lay me against a tree then take Cyberdramon back to the camp. We can't leave him alone, in case he wakes up and runs off.\" Reddmon nodded and helped him limp over to a tree and lowered him down. \"I'll needs Renamons help to get him there. Are you sure you'll be okay till we get back?\" Orionmon nodded producing a spray bottle from behind him and squirting it over himself. \"I just need a nap I should be able to get back myself. Now get going. Everyone will be anxious to find out what happened.\"  With that Orionmon adjusted himself against the tree and closed his eyes. Reddmon stood up and looked at Renamon. Who shrugged and walked over to Cyberdramon and picking up one of his arm.Reddmon followed her lead and they both began jumping from tree to tree back towards the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived at the clearing. As they left the forest everyone turned from what they were doing and Bombarded Reddmon and Renamon with questions \"What did you bring him here for? Where's Orionmon? Is he okay?  What happened.\" Renamon spoke up first. \"Orionmon said to bring him here and that he'll be along shortly. Now someone help me find some rope.\" Reddmon helped her deposit Cyberdramon on the ground and then waited next to him. As Renamon and the others went searching for rope Guilmon and Takato came over to crouch down next to him \"Why do you think he was trying to delete Virus digimon Reddmon?\" Asked Takato. Reddmon shrugged \"No idea. Hey anyway, about when we met earlier. Sorry if I was rude. Would you be up for a rematch sometime?\" Guilmon slapped him on the shoulder. \"Your on.\" He laughed. Reddmon smiled to himself. Seems like they were all warming to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon walked up behind them carrying a large coil of steel rope. \"Orionmon really  does have some weird things in here.\" She commented as they started tying up the unconscious Cyberdramon. As they finished Orionmon appeared from now where and stumbled over and slid down the trunk of a tree. Henry and Terriermon rushed over to help him while everyone else double and triple checked Cyberdramon's bindings. Satisfied Reddmon stood up and began to walk over to check on Orionmon. \"Takato and Guilmon, could you please stay and watch Cyberdramon.\" He didn't wait for their reply as he walked over to talk to Orionmon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got closer Reddmon noticed that he seemed to be unconscious. \"Is he alright?\" He asked them, they just shrugged in reply. \"We're not sure but we think he just needs to sleep a while. Reddmon nods looking around the camp. Everyone seems to be busy with one chore or another. Guilmon and Takato were watching over Cyberdramon. Henry and Terriermon were watching Orionmon and Rika had left with Renamon to get food from the fridge. Reddmon noticed that the wood was running low so he decided to go cut some more. \"Going on a wood run.\" Said Reddmon and walked out of the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later Orionmon had come too, as had Cyberdramon. Although he was knocked back out again with the application of a handy rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon had tended to his wounds and done a quick check of Cyberdramon. Declaring him in no immediate danger of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat around to dinner again this time prepared by Rika and Renamon. \"This is excellent Rika, Renamon.

If someone did send Cyberdramon after Reddmon and Guilmon they were likely to keep sending assassins till  they where both dead. \"Can you find out who sent Cyberdramon to delete Reddmon and Guilmon?\" Orionmon shook his head sadly, glancing over at the prone form of their captive. \"I don't posses that level of programming ability, but I may be able to pull in an old favor from a Datamon I know. He will defiantly be able to find that information, if it exists, as well as fixing any corruption that may have been caused to him. That may take some time, and could very well be fruitless so i'll do some investigating myself. But for now we should all get some rest. I'll return you all home in the morning.\" Everyone nodded then went about cleaning up after dinner. Again Renamon slept between Reddmon and Rika, as she drifted off to sleep her mind wandered through everything that had happened in the past week. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon woke to the sound of someone calling her name. It was Reddmon, he was crouching next to her gently shaking her shoulder. The digital vixen sat up rubbing her eyes blearily. \"What's up.\" She mumbled to Reddmon who smiled in response, \"You, finally. C'mon everyones ready to go.\" Renamon looked around, he was right, everyone had their back packs on and where watching the two of them. Renamon blushed as she scrambled to her feet and rolled up her sleeping bag. \"Why did you let me sleep in?\" She hissed to him angrily. \"You looked too cute to wake up.\" Renamon threw a soft punch at his shoulder. \"Jerk!\" She laughed, tossing the Rolled up mattress at him. He easily caught it and teleported over to the tree it was taken from. As he reappeared next to her he called out to Orionmon \"Ready.\" The warrior digimon made an opening gesture and a large hole appeared next to him big enough for any of them to walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and Reddmon watched as everyone took turns leaping into it. Finally Orionmon stood next to it waiting for the pair of them. They  walked over and jumped in, quickly surrounded by total darkness. Then suddenly Renamon was blinded by a light and felt gravity change strangely. She prepared herself to land on her feet and a second later landed softly on a grassy mountain side. The other digidestened  getting up from where they had been deposited, all of them having fallen in a heap. Apparently Renamon and Reddmon where the only one with the agility to land properly. Renamon exchanged a look with Reddmon then they both began helping everyone up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had gotten to their feet and brushed themselves off Orionmon appeared from nowhere, holding the still unconscious Cyberdramon on his shoulder and gave everyone a sheepish look. \"Sorry for the rough landing everyone, I must still be a bit shaky from that fight.\" Renamon noticed a few irritable looks aimed at him. If he noticed them he must have shrugged them off. He reached behind himself and produced a bag, he tossed it to Takato, how caught it and looked inside he looked back at Orionmon. \"So what are these things?\" He asked taking out a small black device with a speaker and several buttons. \"They are simple communicators, you can use them to contact me or each other. I need to take this guy to that Datamon now, and I've got a few ideas on where to start looking for info, so i'll use these,\" He held up a device identical to the one Takato held, \"to contact you if anything important comes up.\" With that he waved good bye to everyone and disappeared into a hole that came into existence behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hole closed up everyone turned to Takato and took out a phone each, on the back of which was a clip that would slip onto a belt or strap, which Orionmon had been farsighted enough to include in the bag. The digimon wore the belts around thier waist or shoulder while the digidestined simply clipped them on next to their digivices. Renamon looked round for the first time, noticing that they where on a hill right next to town. Takato and Henry waved good bye and left with their partners, leaving Reddmon, Renamon and Rika alone on the hillside. Reddmon was the first to speak up. \"So ladies, I have one or two things that I need to do, would you be okay getting home yourselves?\" Rika shrugged, \"Sure, whatever.\" Renamon smiled, guessing what Reddmon needed to \"do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon disappeared teleporting off somewhere. after a moment, when she was sure Reddmon had left Rika Huffed to herself, \"Well the least he could have done is seen us home.\" Renamon just smiled and started walking toward home, Rika jogging to quickly catch up. \"I'm sure we'll seem him later.\" Renamon chuckled. Her partner gave her a knowing look and laughed as well. \"So when are you going on a date?\" Renamon gave her a sideways glance. Rika was grinning widely at her, at least she seemed to accept it, but might as well be sure. \"I'm guessing that's what he's arranging now. But anyway, Rika, how do you feel about him?\" Rika barely missed a step. \"That doesn't really matter, you like him so that's good enough for me.\" Renamon felt a rush of affection towards Rika, she really had matured emotionally since they'd first met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared home Renamon began thinking about what exactly Reddmon would be doing, hopefully he wouldn't steal or destroy anything. Although it was almost certain he would do one or the other. When Rika unlocked the door and opened it Renamon decided she really should check up on him. \"Hey Rika I get the feeling Reddmon might end up causing trouble, whether he means to or not, mind if I go check on him?\" Rika gave her a crooked grin. \"Sure, if thats your only reason.\" Renamon felt hersefl blush and quickly teleported away. She went from area to area looking around for any sign of Reddmon</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reddmon walked around the park, trying to gather a nice bunch of flowers for Renamon. So far he'd gotten several yellow and white ones and tied them together with a red ribbon, it certainly wasn't a professional job but it still looked quite pretty. Not to mention the colours would allow Renamon to find all sorts of hidden messages. Reddmon gave it one more look over and dematerialised it, storing it for later when he came to the perfect moment. Reddmon pulled a list from it's ethereal state, he had made it almost as soon as he'd left Renamon and Rika. It had taken him quite a while to write it up, he just couldn\u2019t think what he needed, it read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.Get food. <br>\r\n2.Get flowers<br>\r\n3.Decide on location.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMaterializing a pen he crossed out get flowers. Leaving only number three left, but that was probably the most difficult one. A picnic was the obvious thing to do, but the only place that was secluded enough was the nearby forest, and he didn't know any nice places up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he sensed someone watching him, he sniffed the air and smiled as he caught Renamon's scent. \"What\u2019s up Renamon?\" He called out, discreetly putting the list behind his back and dematerialising it. Renamon teleported right in front of him, looking out of breath and a bit annoyed. \"Where in the world have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you!\" Reddmon shrugged and held up the phone Orionmon gave them. \"Why didn't you just call me on this thing?\" Renamon glanced from him to the one attached to her waist and slapped her paw against her forehead. \"Damn, I forgot about that thing.\" She signed. Reddmon replaced his phone and chuckled. \"Hey, Renamon you up for that date now?\" He asked holding out his paw. Renamon looked at the extended paw then back to him. \u201cYou really do have no sense of timing with these things do you?\u201c Reddmon pulled his arm back slightly, was that a no? Renamon reached forward and took hold of his paw, giving it a reassuring squeeze. \u201cI\u2019m sure I could help with that.\u201d He sighed mentally and led her towards the forest, hoping that he would stumble across a look out or something with a nice view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Reddmon do you have any idea where you are going?\" Asked Renamon. She had let him lead her around for at least three hours. They where only half a kilometre from a rarely used road, but Renamon was pretty sure Reddmon didn't know anything about the area so she just let him keep wandering around. Eventually Reddmon hung his head and sighed. \"Okay, it's official, we\u2019re lost.\u201d No, he was lost, she knew the whole area perfectly. Renamon laughed lightly, \u201cC\u2019mon, I know a nice place nearby.\u201d She took his arm and led him through the undergrowth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA humorously short walk later the trees suddenly thinned and the ground beneath them was replaced by a stunningly complex, yet some how subdued mosaic pattern. In front of them stood an ancient shrine, small well carved statues stood at regular intervals beside the mosaic path, all of which was shaded by over hanging trees. The setting sun shining through to create a shimmering effect as the trees swayed. \u201cWow.\u201d Breathed Reddmon, Renamon walked over to a statue and sat against it. This one was in the shape of a robed monk kneeling in prayer. \u201cI know, pretty isn\u2018t it. This is where I come to think or be alone. Not even Rika knows about it.\u201d She smiled to herself as Reddmon walked over to the shrine and inspected it, she wasn\u2019t completely sure to who or what it was dedicated to, but she was pretty sure it had something to do with Taoism. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon walked over and sat against the statue opposite her. \u201cSo, you hungry Renamon?\u201d Renamon nodded, she hadn\u2019t eaten anything since this morning in Orionmon\u2019s place, but why was he asking? Did he want to go home already? Out of nowhere Reddmon reached behind the statue he was sitting against and pulled out a picnic basket. \u201cReddmon, what the hell?\u201d He better not have stolen that, for that matter where did it just come from? Reddmon removed a wrapped sandwich from the basket and handed it to her, she accepted it warily and began eating. Reddmon must have noticed her hesitance because he laughed, \u201cI know what your thinking, I helped someone at a sandwich store for an hour and he made me the sandwiches, and lent me the basket.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon frowned to herself, that answers one question but how did he get it here without her noticing? Then she remembered Orionmon, he was always pulling things from thin air. \u201cSo. did you learn that trick from Orionmon?\u201d She asked casually. Reddmon almost choked on the mouthful of sandwich he was chewing. \u201cHa! Other way round, after we fought for the first time Orionmon somehow changed his coding to allow him to create those hole things of his, it lets him compensate for his lack of agility. Surprised the hell out of me the first time he did it. An energy ball I had just thrown hit me square in the face.\u201d Reddmon chuckled, running the side of his muzzle. Renamon glanced at the basket again, taking another bite of her sandwich. \u201cSo how does it work?\u201d Reddmon raised his paw and an apple appeared and dropped, landing in his waiting palm. \u201cWell, I store stuff by putting it in an ethereal state, where it kind of doesn\u2019t exist, whereas Orionmon just creates portals, either to another place where he has lots of things he thinks he might need or to a location he wants to go.\u201d Renamon thought about that for a moment, what sort of bizarre objects did he have hidden away in there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were interrupted by a loud beeping from her hip. She quickly took off her communicator and Reddmon moved a bit closer as she pressed the receive button.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Renamon, do you hear me?\" Asked Orionmon, his voice slightly distorted by static. \"Yes, relativity clearly. Whats wrong?\" Replied Renamon, curious as to what Orionmon wanted so soon. \"Is Reddmon with you? I called Rika and she told me you went out looking for him?\" Reddmon leaned closer and called out, \"Yeah I'm here, what do you want? You can\u2019t have found out anything already, you only dropped us off this morning.\" A note of irritation in his voice, Orionmon went on, either not noticing or not caring about Reddmon's tone. \"Well, I got lucky and found someone who has information about the Cyberdamon attack, but as I thought he wants something from me, well you and me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is he and what does he want? Nothing ridiculous I hope.\" Asked Renamon. \"He's an Etemon who is known for dealing in information, he told me a little, just enough to prove he does have the information we need, but he'll only tell us the rest if Reddmon and myself take part in a tournament he's running soon. He also gave invitations to the digidestined, everyone except you and Rika have accepted already. Rika said it was your decision, since you are the one who will be fighting after all.\" Renamon glanced at Reddmon who had lent back against the statue and was looking upwards at the newly risen moon, his finger under his mouth. Probably thinking about facing off against Guilmon or Orionmon. She had to at least watch over him, anyway it would probably be fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I\u2019ll go as well. What's the prize for first place?\" Renamon heard paper being rustled on the other end of the line. \"First prize is one million digidollars. Although, that\u2019s pretty much useless to you in the real world. But I might have something more useful to trade that for. Anyway, its champion level or lower and it will be starting in five days. I\u2019ll meet you all the day it starts, beside that good luck. Oh, and, sorry if I interrupted anything. Just thought you should be told immediately.\" Renamon and Reddmon said goodbye and hung up. Almost intermediately Reddmon got up and stretched his back, he looked at her for a moment then put his paw behind his head and scratched his ear. \"Renamon, if we face off in this tournament, do you want, me to uh, you know, throw in the towel?\" He asked with a lot of blushing and looking at the back of his other paw. Renamon laughed, he must be joking, he's gone from picking fights with me to being willing to take a fall within a few days. Reddmon looked at her indignantly, \"What? What's so funny?\" This just made Renamon laugh all the harder. \"I was going to ask you if you wanted to train with me that\u2019s all.\" She said wiping a tear from her eye. \"C\u2019mon we might as well head home, it's getting dark anyway.\u201d Reddmon nodded \u201cYeah, you think you can find your way through the forest at night.?\u201d Renamon got up and brushed a few crumbs out of her fur, \u201cHuh, of course I can. C\u2019mon let\u2018s go\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later they had reached Rika\u2019s and Renamon\u2019s house Reddmon landed lightly in front of the back door then turned and watched Renamon land beside him. Reddmon had been planning exactly what he was going to say the whole way. \u201cSo Renamon, thanks for showing me that place tonight, it was beautiful,\u201d He leaned close and kissed her softly, materializing the bunch of flowers behind his back, then broke of the kiss. \u201cBut not nearly as beautiful as you.\u201d He revealed the flowers and handed them to her. She took them and blushed deeply. \u201dReddmon, Rika has got to go to school to catch up on stuff she missed recently, and I\u2019d promised I\u2019d watch her.\u201d Reddmon nodded, wondering where this was leading. \u201cSo I need you to promise me, you won\u2019t cause any mischief or havoc okay, and you won\u2019t come to school either. No one knows about me and we need to keep it that way.\u201d That gave Reddmon an idea actually but he kept a straight face and put his paw over his heart. \u201cI promise that I, Reddmon will not appear at you school tomorrow.\u201d He said in as a sincere voice as he could manage. Judging by the look she gave him she probably didn\u2019t believe him so he bowed formally and teleported himself out of there. He watched from the branch of a tree as she looked at the flowers he had given her glanced at the surrounding trees and rooftops, not taking any notice particular of his position. Then she shook her head and mumbled, \u201cI know I\u2019m going to regret this tomorrow.\u201d as she turned around and opened the door. Reddmon was sure he caught a smile on her face as she walked inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon quickly returned to the abandoned house he had claimed for his own and settled himself down on the dusty couch. He looked around for moment, noticing the thick fog of particles that floated in the still air. He really would have to clean up tomorrow morning. Next time Renamon came round she would probably be in a state to notice the mess. As Reddmon let himself slip into the embrace of sleep he wondered, what had caused Cyberdramon to attack him?. Did he have enemies? Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning he rummaged through the closets in the house and found a broom, a feather duster and a bunch of other cleaning equipment. Within the hour he gathered most of the dust within the house to a pile in what he had started calling the living room. He stared at this massive pile of dirt, soot and rubbish and tried to figure out what the hell he was going to do with it. Shrugging he just dematerialized it, he could just dump it somewhere else later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked round at his house, it was a lot better than when he had first arrived, not clean but much better. He glanced at the clock he had found in a closet, it had been out of batteries, which he had found in a cupboard in the kitchen, and he\u2019d had to re-time it against the town clock, but it was working fine now and showed that it was about twenty minutes to 9. Grinning Reddmon thought about going to Rika\u2019s school as Redd, seeing if she and the others would catch on. Renamon would probably kill him later, but it would be worth it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, decisions. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reddmon walked out of his home, teleporting to the top of a nearby apartment block and looked around, spotting the roof of the school. He began jumping from building to building, figuring that he needed 3 minutes to get there and about 10 minutes to infiltrate the building and create all the documents that said Redd was attending the school as of this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon reached the block the school was on and laid himself flat against a roof, materializing his binoculars as he did. He looked from window to window until he found both the principal's office, an empty toilet attached to the same hallway and the principal's parking space in the parking lot. Which was empty, meaning this was his best shot to do what he needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed himself to his feet and teleported inside the vacant toilet, quickly changing into Redd. He walked over to the toilet door and opened it. As he made his way towards the principals office a thin lady with glasses and white hair come out of a doorway marked teachers lounge. She began walking along the hall towards him, mumbling something to herself when she noticed him just as he reached level with her. \u201cHello young man. I don\u2019t remember seeing you before? Are you new?\u201d Redd noticed a badge on her chest declaring her the head librarian and under that in thin elegant hand writing, Mrs Tang. Redd nodded and smiled politely, wanting to get on with it before the principal arrived \u201cYes, I start today, but I need to see the principal first, so if you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d She shook her head. \u201cSorry Mr Kakashi hasn\u2019t arrived yet, but you should be able to wait in his office until he does.\u201d Redd nodded \u201cThank you Mrs Tang.\u201d He said and continued towards Mr Kakashi\u2019s office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached it he turned the handle, looking both ways as he did, hoping no one else would enter the hall. Luckily the door was unlocked and the hallway clear so he slipped inside and quietly closed the door after himself. The Principals office was pretty plush, lots of leather chairs and a large desk with a good quality computer on it. Redd walked over to the computer and began looking around. It was on already and didn\u2019t  seem to have a password set up so Redd was able to access the files he needed immediately. He modified the database to say that a new student from Kyoto was starting today by the name of Holt Kenari. After all the others might see through a kid known only Redd, he put himself in the same year and class as Rika, Henry and Takato and saved all the changes he made. Then he got up and put everything as he had found it. He looked at the time in the bottom of the computer, he still had ten minutes till school started so he slipped back out of the Principals office and began walking around the halls, taking random turns here and there.That was almost to easy he thought to himself, he had done it in less than half the time he expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to turn another corner he heard the familiar voices of Henry and Takato very close by, talking about being late, Redd smiled to himself and walked around the corner. Henry and Takato barreled into him, barely able to slow themselves down. Redd let himself fall down hard and bang his head against the lockers behind him. Rubbing his head Redd looked up. \u201cHey you're Takato and Henry right.\u201d Henry gave him a wary look as he reached down and helped him up. \u201cYeah, How do you know that, and why haven't we seen you before?\u201d  Redd smiled and turned the helping hand into a handshake. \u201cI just started today my names Holt Kenari. The principal told me I would be in your class and that you would be able to help me round for the day, \u201c He said shaking Takato's hand as well. Takato smiled widely, the kind of person who makes friend quickly I suppose, thought Redd. \u201cSorry about knocking you over Holt, our teacher gets furious if we\u2019re even a minute late. Which reminds me, we gotta hurry. C\u2019mon\u201d He said motioning for him and Henry to follow. Redd chuckled to himself and ran after them, this was going to be an interesting day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reached the class room just as the teacher, a stern looking man with a thick mustache, was guiding everyone inside. He gave them all a withering stare as they fell into line with everyone else, in particular Redd. \u201cWho are you boy?\u201d He practically bellowed, \u201cA new student sir, Holt Kenari, I transferred this week.\u201c He was tempted to salute as well, but thought better of it. The teacher nodded and grumbled,  \u201cNo one tells me anything around here.\u201c and let him inside. As he entered the room Takato waved and pointed to a seat between him and Henry, with Rika sitting behind him. Redd sat down behind the small desk and turned in his seat, \u201cHi, you\u2019re Rika, Right?\u201d Rika gave him a suspicious look then nodded. \u201cYeah, but how do you\u2026\u201d Takato cut her off. \u201cKakashi told him to hang around with us till he gets settled.\u201d Rika nodded, most of the suspicion disappeared. \u201cSo what are we learning today?\u201d Asked Redd. Henry was the first to answer. \u201dTrigonometry, Great fun huh.\u201d He said rolling his eyes. Reddmon nodded in agreement and opened the lid to his desk, getting pencils and paper out. This part might not be so interesting, thought Redd tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher walked over to the chalkboard and tapped his chalk against it, causing the class to quite down. \u201cClass we have a new student today, \u201c He said pointing to Redd, his voice still raised higher than necessary. \u201cSo I\u2019ll reintroduce myself for him as well as go over my rules. My name is Oba Hidori, When I talk, you listen. I Won\u2019t tolerate any misbehaving. And anyone who breaks either of these rules gets detention. This is your only warning! Got it?\u201d  He said, writing everything on the board. The class replied \u201cYes Sir.\u201d in unison. Satisfied Mr Hidori used a duster to whip what he had written from the board. Then he began drawing various algorithms and rules for math on the board and Redd settled in for the most boring three hours of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the Recess bell rang and everyone walk out of the room chattering excitedly about one thing or another. As they left Takato tapped him on the shoulder, \u201cDo you want to have lunch with us Holt?\u201d Redd shook his head, \u201cNah, I was going to have a walk around on my own, you know learn the playground.\u201d Henry and Takato waved goodbye while Rika looked at Redd again, \u201cI\u2019ve got someone I need to talk to, I\u2019ll see you all after lunch.\u201d She said waving then running off. Probably going to see Renamon, thought Redd as he walked the opposite way. As soon as he turned the next corner in the hall he broke into a run, circling round the front of the school, figuring he might be able to sneak behind Rika and see Renamon. He wouldn\u2019t reveal himself of course, he just wanted to see where she was hiding Renamon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Redd jogged over and stood on his toes, wondering what had everyone so excited about. The group of kids had formed a circle, inside of which stood a  teenager, massive both in height and in girth. He had short black hair and a nose that had been obviously been broken dozens of times. Also in the circle was none other than Rika, she was on the ground rubbing the side of her face, which was an angry red and already beginning to swell. The bully crossed his arms in front of his chest and laughed. \u201cGet it through you thick skull Rika, I own this playground and you can\u2019t keep walking round as you please, you pay the fee and you're free to go.\u201d Rika spat out some blood and gave him a cold look. \u201cNo?\u201d he asked mockingly. \u201cWell fine then, have it your way.\u201d He said advancing on her and cracking his knuckles together.  Redd began pushing into the crowd, Trying to get to her. Renamon must be killing herself, she can\u2019t do anything but watch. Redd forced his way inside the circle, several people giving cries of annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the bully looked up, his fist cocked, ready to strike Rika. \u201cSo your that new kid huh. What do you want?\u201d Redd looked him up and down, he must be at least two years older than Rika and over twice her weight. \u201cPut her down and back off.\u201d He said, not trying to sound particularly aggressive. The bully just laughed letting go of Rika and turning towards him. \u201cYour asking for it wimp, but I\u2019ll let you go if you pay her fee and your own. That comes to thirty bucks. For today.\u201d Redd took a step towards him, mindful of everyone watching them. Seeing that he wasn\u2019t going to back down the bully raised his left fist and stepped towards Redd, taking a huge swing at him. Redd dodged under the blow and slammed his fist into the guys chest. He doubled over in pain as the crowd gasped. Seems like no one stands up to this guy, thought Redd as he raised both his fists in the boxers stance and backed away from the bully a bit. Someone in the crowd began chanting fight, which was quickly taken up by the rest. This was so much like the tournaments he\u2019d been to, thought Redd, dodging a lunge the bully made and punched him in the lower back causing him to fall to the ground and cry out in pain. He quickly recovered though and picked himself up, murder in his eyes. He took another clumsy swing at Redd which he dodged easily and then another. Redd stepped back, away from the blow then moved inward, giving him an uppercut to the chin then stepping round and smashing the other fist into the side of his head. The bully gave a moan then crumpled to the ground, out cold for at least half an hour. Finished with him Redd turned to Rika who was still kneeling on the ground, rubbing the side of her face again, staring at him with a slightly dazed look on her face. Redd walked over to her and offered her his hand. She smiled, or winched in pain, it was kind of hard to tell and took the hand, letting him pull her to her feet. \u201cThanks.\u201d She mumbled waving and turning, breaking into a run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd had broken up by now, the show having finished and all, so Rika was able to run clearly towards the forest that marked the edge of the school yard. Renamon was probably hiding within there somewhere. Redd was about to follow her in when a hand clamped on his shoulder. In the split second before he turned three things went through his mind, it was either a teacher come to chew him out, the bully himself, ready to knock him out, or one of the bully\u2019s friends, ready to take revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He was surprised then to see Henry, with Takato running up behind him, panting heavily. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d asked Redd. Henry gulped down a few breaths of air before answering. \u201cHolt, we heard that Rika got in a fight. What happened?\u201d Redd jerked his thumb over at the small group of people crouching around the bully. \u201cThat guy had set up some kind of toll fare scam, he had hit Rika and when I got here I broke it up and knocked him down.\u201d Takato stared at him with a look of disbelief. \u201cTollfare? Do you mean you beat up Headkicker Chuck.\u201d Redd shrugged \u201cI guess so, anyway, Rika went into the forest, I was about to go in after her to make sure she was fine.\u201d Henry and Takato exchanged a quick glance then patted him on the shoulder, leading him towards the cafeteria. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, she has a er, a hangout in there, she\u2019ll be fine. C\u2019mon we\u2019ll buy you lunch.\u201d Said Takato. Obviously trying to get him to not to follow her, Probably to keep him from discovering Renamon. He shrugged, at least that confirms where the yellow fox was hiding, \u201cSure, do they have any good food?\u201d He had Forgotten breakfast amidst all the cleaning so he was actually pretty hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch they went back into class and Redd noted that Rika was absent. A few hours later the final bell rang and everyone filed out of the class room again. Reddmon was about to bolt home when he heard Takato call out his name, well his fake name anyway. \u201cHey Holt, wait up a minute.\u201d Takato ran up next to him, \u201cDo you want to come over to my house? My parents own a bakery and we always have fresh bread.\u201d Redd shook his head, he had to get home as quickly as possible, if Renamon or one of the other digimon bumped into him he might be in trouble. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m late as it is, and I think I might not be able to come to school tomorrow.\u201d Takato looked slightly downcast as Redd turned and waved then bolted as fast as he could to his block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ducked into an alley and quickly changed back into Reddmon, stretching his tails happily. After he felt limber enough he hopped to the top of he roof and took a round about path to his house. He teleported in front of the door and slipped inside.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As he quietly closed the door behind him he heard someone inside sniffle softly. Reddmon stiffened slightly, had someone stumbled into his house? Reddmon silently edged closer to the wall, it sounded like it had come from the living room. Maybe he should change into Redd again, in case it was some random kid. After all he wanted to stay low key, the cops probably wanted to have a little talk to him after his, let's say, flamboyant entrance (not to mention the missing officer).  But on the other hand if it was one of the digimon or the digidestined they would both find out about his human form and Renamon would be really angry at him for doing what she specifically asked him not to do, even if he did help Rika out. Reddmon moved a little further inside trying desperately to identify who was inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rika, calm down, you're okay, that Holt kid sorted out chuck didn't he?\" Reddmon breathed a sigh of relief it was Rika and Renamon. He stepped into the living room and both Renamon and Rika turned round suddenly, Rika's face had gone from an angry red to a rich purple, although a little of the swelling had died down already, and judging by the puffy redness around her eyes she had been crying a lot recently. Guessing by the arm she had wrapped around her partner Renamon was trying her best to console Rika.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika heard a noise in the living room and spun round to see who it was, ready to jump up and run if necessary.But it was only Reddmon, Rika felt Renamon relax a bit, her grip having tightened slightly. This was the last thing she wanted though, they had only come here to hide instead of letting her mother see the bruise, she would have a complete fit over it anyway, but now that Reddmon had arrived she was regretting that decision. Any moment he would start poking fun at her, probably calling her week for losing a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead he frowned and turned on his heel, rushing out of the room. Rika looked questioningly to Renamon who shrugged as they heard doors being opened and closed in another room. As quickly as he went Reddmon returned, holding a bunched up cloth. He sat down next to them and held it out to Rika, \"Here, put this against your cheek. What happened?\" Rika hesitantly took the bundle and found that it was cold, he had gotten some ice from somewhere and put it inside the cloth. Rika put it against the bruise and sighed as she felt it alleviate the dull throbbing that had been bothering her since Chuck had punched her.  \"Thanks Reddmon, that's much better. Some jerk at school has been taking kids money, claiming it as a toll fare. I wouldn't give him my \"toll\" so he hit me.\" To her surprise, and she was already surprised after the makeshift icepack, Reddmon's frown deepened and a sphere of dark energy formed in his hand. \"You want me to go round his place and deal with him?\" Rika laughed and shook her head, \"Thanks, but someone else beat you to it. The jerk was about to hit me again when a new kid stepped in and took him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon stood up and walked over to the window, peeking out threw the blinds. Rika smiled to herself, Renamon was still protective towards her and it bothered her to see me hurt. \"Renamon, stop beating yourself up, you couldn't have helped without scaring the living daylights out of everyone. We still need to keep you hidden unless it's absolutely necessary. And besides, the police wouldn't put up with you beating up a kid, especially after all the trouble Reddmon made recently.\" Renamon sighed and turned around, leaning against the wall. \"I know, your right, but still. Hold it, Reddmon, where were you today? We came here about lunch time and you were nowhere to be seen.\" Reddmon sat up straighter, smiling sheepishly, \"Believe it or not I was here cleaning this morning, and I went out later to train in the forest.\" Seemed reasonable enough to her, thought Rika, the house was relativity clean, considering it had been abandoned for years. But Renamon didn't seem to be buying it. \"Then why can I smell Rika's school on you?\" Reddmon shrugged, \"I went round there on my way back from training, thought I could see you home or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon still seemed slightly suspicious but let the matter drop, then Reddmon stood up, \"So will you two being staying for dinner? Or going to school tomorrow for that matter?\" Rika exchanged a glance with Renamon. \"If you would let us stay that would be great, and I don't think so, I was hoping that this bruise would heal in a day or two. The ice should help.\" Reddmon clapped his paws together. \"Great, does anyone know of any good restaurants nearby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later they began eating a variety of Asian dishes, everything from Chow mien to Tom Yum soup, the table between them practically covered in takeaway containers. Reddmon had asked Rika to call in the order and answer the door when it was delivered, giving her money he had found stashed away when he was cleaning. The delivery man had asked about Rika's bruise but left without any further trouble. She had told him about a fight at school and he had nodded, mumbling something about the collapse of society.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon was feeling great, he had gotten away with going to school with them and they where spending the night at his place. Once they were done eating Rika went down the street to a phone booth to tell her mother and grandmother she would be staying at a friends for the evening, which was true enough. When she got back they sat around in the living room and talked for a while. Nothing in particular just this and that, plans and ideas. Eventually it got late enough for Rika to start yawning and he showed them to the room Renamon had stayed in, if somewhat reluctantly, the last she was here. He was pretty sure he didn't have stand guard this time so he went back down to the living and gathered up the remains of dinner, putting the containers with food left in the fridge and then dropping himself on the couch. He sat there for a while, smelling the intense aromas of the dinner they had eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon was quickly asleep, actually looking forward to what tomorrow would bring.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renamon awoke to the sound of Rika rolling over in her sleep, having thrown her sheets off during the night. Renamon pushed herself out of the large comfy chair she had been sleeping in and went over to their room's window, it was still dark outside but she could see the sun cresting the mountains. Renamon thought about sitting and watching the sun rise, but then again, Reddmon could be awake, it was worth checking at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon snuck out of the room and walked down the hall, pausing to stare at a really weird hole in the wall, it looked vaguely head shaped, possibly Reddmon's. As Renamon padded down the stairs Reddmon came into view, laying sprawled out on the couch, his eyes closed. Even from here she could see his eyelids moving constantly, probably having a dream thought Renamon. She walked over to the chair opposite him and sat down, watching him for a bit. After a while her eyes began to wander around the room and Renamon noticed that Reddmon had a working clock, and if it was right the time was 6 o'clock. The shops wouldn't be open yet so Renamon decided to fetch some food for breakfast, she really didn't feel like leftovers anyway. Renamon picked up the change that Reddmon had left on the table and left his house, figuring that Rika would be safe with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly made her way to the nearest general store, which still had a large hole in it's wall from the red fox's recent visit, but that had been boarded up so Renamon just teleported herself inside. She picked up a package of bacon, a carton of eggs and a carton of juice, as well as a container of butter. She put the proper amount of money on the counter and left as she had arrived. Renamon was hopping from building to building when she passed Takato's place. She paused for a moment, glancing at the armful of food she was carrying. Fresh bread would go nicely with this, she thought leaping onto Takato's house and placing the stuff she had gotten in a corner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon jumped down the side of the house, grabbing the rain gutter with one paw and swinging to a halt in front of Takato's bedroom window. Inside Takato and Guilmon were sitting at his desk, with what was probably his homework spread out in front of them. Renamon tapped a claw softly against the glass until they looked up, glancing around for the source of the noise. Guilmon was the first to spot her and he said something to Takato and they both rushed over and slid the window up. \"Renamon, what are you doing here?\" Asked Guilmon, who looked up to see what she was hanging from. \"I was hoping I could have some bread. I have some money if you want it.\"  Takato shook his head. \"Don't worry about it. I'll get some now.\" Guilmon turned to him, \"Takato, could you get me some as well?\" Takato nodded and ran out of the room, closing the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon sniffed the air, then gave Renamon a crooked grin \"So where's Reddmon, huh?\" Renaom felt herself blush slightly, why did he think they would always be nearby each other? \"He's at his house with Rika, when I left they were both asleep.\" Guilmon cocked his head, and with not a trace of guile on his face he asked. \"Did you all sleep together?\" Renamon nearly lost her grip on the gutter after that question. \"No Guilmon, we did not sleep together. Me and Rika slept in an upstairs bedroom while Reddmon was in the living room.\" Guilmon was about to ask another probably embarrassing question when Takato came in holding two loaves of bread. One wrapped in brown paper the other unwrapped. He tossed the unwrapped one to Guilmon who laughed happily and immediately began eating it. Then he handed the other to Renamon who took it with her free hand. As Takato handed her the bread he asked, \"So how's Rika?\" Renamon took the bread and answered. \"She's alright, as far as I know, she's still asleep at Reddmon's house. We stayed there last night.\" Takato blinked, \"What, he has a house? How did he get that?\" Renamon laughed, it was a bit strange actually. \"It's the old place on Omori St, so there aren't any owners. Hey, maybe you could come around after school? I'll call you later.\" With that she pulled herself up and got the other food, stacking it all haphazardly in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon arrived at Reddmon's place without much else happening and when she stepped inside everything was as she had left it, although Reddmon had rolled off the couch and was now sleeping on the floor. Smiling to herself Renamon walked into the kitchen and put the food on the table. She looked around in the cupboards, taking out a large frying pan, three plates and cups. She turned the the stove top on and drew a claw across the plastic wrapping of the bacon. As she put several pieces of bacon on the hot pan Reddmon wandered in, rubbing his eyes blearily. \"Morning.\" He mumbled, absently picking up one of the glasses and getting a drink of water from the kitchen sink's tap. Renamon cracked the eggs open over the pan and got out a spatula from a drawer, turning over the bacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon yawned loudly and got out some forks and knives as well as finding a toaster. He plugged it in and began slicing the bread with a knife he drew from thin air, putting pairs inside the appliance. Rika walked in, her hair messed up and her cheek still a deep purple, she sat down at the table and poured herself a glass of orange juice. Renamon smiled to herself and turned her attention back to the stove. As she kept the eggs and bacon from burning she realized something, she had been smiling and laughing a lot since Reddmon had appeared in their lives, maybe that was what everyone was picking up on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon everything was ready and put onto plates, everyone digging in. \"So,\" Said Rika, pushing her empty plate forward, \"do you have any plans today Reddmon?\" Reddmon shook his head and swallowed the mouthful he was chewing. \"No, I'm open to ideas. Anything you were thinking of specifically?\" Rika shrugged, \"How about a training session in the woods?\" Reddmon nodded, taking another bite of toast. Renamon remembered her short stop earlier. \"Oh, and I saw Guilmon and Takato, they might be up for that after school as well.\" Reddmon smiled, \"Yeah sounds good, but isn't it Saturday tomorrow anyway?\" Rika nodded, \"Although, you would want to be as prepared as possible wouldn't you?\" Reddmon leaned back in his chair. \"Not really, I just go for the sheer fun of fighting. And to have a chance to beat up Orionmon in front of a crowd.\" Or get beaten up, thought Renamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well should we head off then?\" Asked Renamon taking everyones plates and rinsing them off in the sink. Everyone else cleaned up everything else and they where soon ready to leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With breakfast over and done with Renamon teleported to the roof while Reddmon stayed inside with Rika. He figured that while Renamon could move unseen he would be a lot more obvious, since they had decided that he would carry Rika until they got to the privacy of the forest, they needed Renamon to make sure the coast was clear before they exited the house. Reddmon knelt down, letting Rika climb on his back and wrap her arms around his neck. \"Ready?\" He asked her. \"Just try not to go too fast okay? We'll be going over rooftops right?\" Reddmon nodded, waiting for Renamon to give the signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his phone crackled to life, Reddmon pressed a button on it and Renamons voice came through. \"Go.\" She said simply. Reddmon pushed open the door and knocked it closed with his tail. He then jumped up onto the roof, something a bit more difficult with Rika hanging on to him. He landed next to Renamon who motioned for them to follow then began jumping from roof to roof, trying to avoid busy intersections. Reddmon followed and they soon reached the edge of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon let Rika down and stretched his back, \"So, how should we do this? Find a clearing then beat the stuffing out of each other till we get tired?\" Rika laughed \"I know of a clearing that should do the trick. Follow me.\" She ran off through the trees and Reddmon dashed after her, tapping Renamon on the shoulder and whispering, \"Tag, you're it.\" Then he jumped into the trees, leaping from trunk to trunk, following Rika's path roughly. He heard Renamon laugh and follow him, catching up quickly.As he sensed her getting close Reddmon teleported to the ground and ran for a bit, weaving through the trees. Suddenly Renamon dropped down in front of him, instead of changing course Reddmon materialized a smoke grenade and threw it at the ground between them. Renamon didn't have time to react as a cloud of smoke burst from the grenade and engulfed her. Reddmon jumped over the cloud and landed on a branch. He could hear Renamon stumbling about blindly, coughing. As he jumped forward to catch up with Rika he heard her yell, \"Cheater!\" after him. He smiled and moved as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe burst into the clearing to find Rika panting against a tree. She could run fast, he had to give her that. He landed near her and walked over, looking around, the clearing was a few metres wide and surrounded on all sides by tall trees. Judging by how fast they had moved it was probably pretty far from anyone as well. \"Where's Renamon?\" Asked Rika. Reddmon laughed, \"We began playing tag, so she should be along soon.\" He was suddenly knocked to the ground by a heavy weight hitting him in the back. \"You're it.\" Said Renamon getting off him and jumping a good distance away, smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon pushed himself up, trying to get his breath back. He probably deserved that for the grenade stunt. \"Hey Renamon, how about ranged combat practice? Rika you might want to move into the forest.\" Rika backed away while Renamon began walking backwards and sideways, keeping Rika well out of the line of fire as well as getting extra distance. Reddmon created a pair of energy spheres and waited for Renamon to make her move. Renamon slowly took a braced stance and began creating lots of those diamond shards of hers. Reddmon winced, remembering how much those things hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems like she was waiting for him so decided to oblige and threw the first ball in a low arc that would follow the ground. Then without even watching it hit he teleported into the air above her and tossed it downwards. Only to find that she wasn't there and that the glittering projectiles had been flung in all directions. He couldn't dodge in time so he threw his arms up to cover his face. He felt several pin pricks sting his arms and let himself fall to the ground, figuring he should move immediately upon contact with the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as his paws touched the grass he rolled to the side, the ground was instantly embedded with twenty or so shards of diamond. Reddmon lept aside again as another flurry flew past him, he looked around, dodging as he did. Renamon was nowhere to be seen, so she must be in the forest. And the attacks where coming from completely different directions each time, his first choice would be to randomly toss attacks into the forest. But Rika was about so that was out of the question, so that left going in after her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reddmon chose a random direction and launched himself into the forest, landing deftly on a tree branch. He sniffed the air, smelling Rika's and Renamon's scent coming from nearby. He could hear Rika breathing on the other side of the clearing, but he couldn't hear anything from Renamon, neither footstep nor breath. Concentrating harder he picked up a light whistling sound and fell backwards just in time to avoid a bunch of crystalline needles, which struck the tree where his torso had been a moment earlier. He grabbed a branch as he fell and swung forward, jumping off the trunk of a tree and heading in the direction the attack came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe landed on another branch, running his paw over the rough surface, Renamon's scent was still strong and he could feel a slight warmness on the bark. Reddmon heard the singular whistling behind him and jumped forward to avoid it, only to have Renamon appear from nowhere, her feet ablaze, and kick him in the stomach then again on the underside of his muzzle. Reddmon gasped as the breath was driven from him again, he somersaulted mid air and landed on the ground, holding his stomach and rubbing his chin, she really was giving it her all. Reddmon looked up to see Renamon sitting on a branch, her legs swinging underneath her. \"Ready to give up?\" she asked, smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon laughed, he was to used to crashing through obstacles, taking the most direct route, making one if he needed to. This was different, he needed to use finesse here. Well I don't have much experience in that department, but I guess that's why they call it training, he thought to himself. He teleported onto a branch opposite Renamon and crouched down. \"Okay, round one to you. But how about close combat next?\" Before Renamon could even answer Reddmon lept backwards into a leafy branch then teleported a fair distance away, teleporting again just to be sure. He lent against a tree and materialized an alarm clock he had. He quickly set the alarm for two minutes and placed it inside of a hole in the tree. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon dropped to the ground and picked up a few pebbles, then jumped over to another tree and concealed himself within a clump of foliage. He waited until he heard Renamon come along, counting off the seconds till his clock went off. With about thirty seconds till the alarm rang Renamon cautiously moved into view, obviously expecting some sort of ambush. Reddmon smiled and tossed a rock against a tree nearby, watching Renamon spin towards the noise and launch several diamonds in the same movement, as well as moving away from the sound. Reddmon threw another rock in the opposite direction, getting an identical result. He did it once more, which made her land right next to the tree he had planted the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon looked slightly jumpy at the moment, completely unsure of what he was doing or even where he was. Reddmon smiled, counting down, five, four, three, two, one. The alarm rang out, shattering the silence. Renamon screamed and jumped about a metre in the air, Reddmon burst from his hiding place, punching Renamon in the stomach as she turned towards him and teleported behind her, sweeping her legs from under her. Reddmon quickly teleported to a higher branch and sat down as she fell heavily and nearly tumbled off the branch. He let his legs swing back and forth a bit as she groaned and picked herself up, glaring at him. She turned and took the clock out of the nook it was hidden in and tossed it at Reddmon's head. \"What?\" He laughed, moving his head to the side and letting the clock sail by, \"I thought it was pretty sneaky.\" Renamon let out a laugh, \"Yeah, but why the hell did you have a clock anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon looked behind him at the metallic wreckage on the ground. \"Yes I guess past tense would be correct. Anyway that makes us one all. What next?\" Renamon lent against the tree, her stance not completely relaxed. He had surprised her at her own game and she didn't seem to like that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon closed her eyes, apparently deep in thought. She probably wanted to win as much as he did. How should they resolve this? Reddmon chuckled to himself.</span></div></div>",

And if I remember right, when you threw my clock it wasn't even twelve.\" Renamon pushed herself off the tree. \"Well a draw won't do, so,\" She jumped onto the branch Reddmon was sitting on and charged towards him, \"I'll try things your way.\" She engulfed her feet and paws in blue flame and spun, bringing her leg around towards the still sitting Reddmon. Reddmon rolled backwards under the attack, standing up on his paws and swinging his foot at a high arc aimed at Renamon's muzzle. She easily ducked back from that and made a sweep at Reddmon's arms, Reddmon flipped himself over Renamon's leg and parried a blow Renamon sent at his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the same movement Reddmon turned sideways and drove his elbow at her shoulder, which she knocked upwards and then hit him hard in the now exposed ribs. Reddmon stumbled backwards then teleported onto the underside of the branch, gripping it with his claws. Renamon didn't know this of course, she was still standing on top of the branch, trying to figure out where Reddmon had run off to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon chuckled to himself then punched the branch, breaking it clear in half with a loud crack. As the surprised Renamon fell past Reddmon smiled and threw another punch at her, which she managed to grab and use to yank him from his perch. She used the leverage to smash both her feet into his chest, knocking him away from her and into a tree. Reddmon grunted as he hit the tree, but recovered quickly enough to draw his claws along the tree trunk, slowing his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reddmon landed he heard Renamon giggle somewhere above him, Reddmon looked up in time to see the yellow vixen flying towards him. She hit him in a flying tackle, sending them both tumbling to the ground. After a brief struggle Renamon ended up on top, pinning Reddmon\u2019s arms and legs to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon smiled and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, \u201cI win.\u201d She said getting off him. Reddmon brushed himself off as he got up and touched where she had kissed him. As Renamon stood against a tree watching him again Rika walked around a tree \u201cSo, who won?\u201d she asked. \u201cShe did.\u201d Answered Reddmon begrudgingly, not used to anyone but Orionmon ever getting the best of him in combat, and even that didn\u2018t happed often. Though truth be told, he somehow didn\u2019t quite feel like he\u2019d lost at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were derailed as Rika asked \u201cYou two hungry? We can go get some food if you want a break, or would you like to go another round?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time Renamon carried Rika while Reddmon followed behind them. They soon arrived back at the town and Reddmon moved up along side them. \u201cSo what\u2019s the plan Rika?\u201d He asked as he hopped from branch to roof. \u201cI was going to pick up some meat and salad from a delicatessen nearby. Renamon and I usually go there after training.\u201d Reddmon nodded and looked around, noticing that they were in a part of Shinjuku he didn\u2019t recognize. Suddenly Renamon turned and jumped into a tree that stood near the edge of a park. Reddmon followed and landed within it\u2019s branches as Renamon let Rika from her back. \u201dSo where is it exactly?\u201d Asked Reddmon, not sure why they had stopped here at all. Rika didn\u2019t answer though, instead she was concentrating on climbing down the tree's trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon nudged him towards the edge of the tree\u2019s leaves, moving a small branch out of the way. \u201cDo you see that shop over there?\u201d She asked, pointing at a small building nestled between a large office and a department store. Reddmon nodded, watching Rika cross the road and enter it. \u201cA friend of Rika\u2019s grandmother works there, so we usually get things at a discount.\u201d Reddmon looked both directions along the street. <i> Not many people around today.</i> He thought to himself. Then he noticed a guy walk from a nearby ally. He was rather tall and bulky, wearing a long heavy coat and a wide rimmed hat pulled low over his head. A few people would look back at him as they passed, but other than that he seemed rather inconspicuous despite his size. <i> Or maybe people are just getting used to weird things happening around here.</i> Noted Reddmon. Thinking of the recent digimon attacks, both himself and Cyberdramon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him, \u201cNo, he wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Moaned Reddmon aloud. Renamon looked at him, then at the stranger. \u201cWhat? Who wouldn't?\u201d Reddmon slapped his paw against his forehead, this couldn\u2019t end well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika looked over the large selection of sliced meat and the various types of salads, trying to guess what might be suitable for all three of them. When the bell hanging above the doorway jingled. Rika looked absently behind her to see a massive man stooping slightly to walk inside without hitting his head on the doorway. He was dressed completely in dark, concealing clothing, and wearing a pair of black glasses which covered his eyes and a portion of his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed Rika looking at him and frowned, walking up to her and crouching down on his haunches so that he was level with her. \u201cRika what happened to you? Your face is bruised.\u201d Rika blinked, she recognized that voice, \u201cOrionm-\u201d Orionmon held up his hand, \u201cC\u2019mon now, don\u2019t lie, was it you know who?\u201d Rika shook her head, that was almost the exact same reaction Reddmon had. \u201cNo, it was just a bully at school, but what are you doing here?\u201d Orionmon straightened himself up before answering. \u201cBuying more supplies for my place. And you?\u201d Rika almost laughed, that explained all the fresh food he had in that fridge of his. \u201cI'm getting lunch for me and the others. But should you really be here?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon just shrugged, turning towards the store clerk, who had an order wrapped up already. \u201cSorry, I couldn\u2019t help over hearing, but Orion, that\u2019s a bit of a strange name.\u201c Orionmon took the package and gave the clerk some money, \u201cIt\u2019s more of a nickname really, I teach at the dojo downtown you see. So that\u2019s just what some people call me.\u201d The clerk seemed satisfied by the answer and smiled, turning to Rika. \u201cSo Rika, have you decided what you want yet?\u201d Rika nodded and asked for some pasta salad and several slices of chicken and beef. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked out with their orders Orionmon said, \u201cSorry about that Rika, I honestly didn\u2019t know you would be there, and I\u2019m pretty sure my sudden appearance might be off-putting to some. Anyway, where\u2019s Renamon, and probably Reddmon?\" Rika took the lead, pointing towards the tree the two foxes were hiding in. \u201cIn that tree. But seriously, hasn\u2019t anyone caught on to your disguise?\u201d Orionmon laughed, \u201cI\u2019m one of the few digimon who, if given enough clothes, could pass for human. But yes, I do get more than few sideways glances.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon watched as Rika and Orionmon walked out of the store, holding a package each. They walked up to the tree and Rika knocked on the trunk then tossed up her bag, which Renamon easily caught and put aside. Reddmon sniffed the air, catching the smell of herbs and meat. <i> Whatever Rika had bought it smells nice. I wonder how long till we can eat? Oh damn, I'm starting to think like Guilmon.</i> Reddmon smiled at that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Orionmon, it's not like you to pull stunts like that.\" Orionmon shrugged, his response dulled down as usual. \"I've been doing this for quite a while actually. But what are you talking about, I'm sure you've had your own bit of under cover fun. Espionage and such.\" Reddmon grimaced, did he know about Redd? \"So where are you training?\" Asked Orionmon putting his package behind his back and dropping it into a hole that appeared. \"In the forest. Why?\" Replied Rika having gotten up the tree and sat down next to Renamon. \"I was going to offer you a lift back to it, that is if you wanted.\" Rika nodded, \"It would save us a lot of time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, where exactly are you?\" Asked Orionmon. The teenage girl looked at her hands, calculating something in her head. \"About one and a half kilometres south of here.\" Orionmon nodded and said. \"Look behind you, and see you there.\" He stepped backwards into an oval that appeared behind him, vanishing from sight. Reddmon looked behind him as asked and found that a similar portal waited for them, he let Rika and Renamon go through first then grabbed the bag of food and followed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later they where back in the clearing they had found earlier. And apparently Rika had gotten used to Orionmon's preferred method of travel because she and Renamon where already walking over to sit next to Orionmon. Who was stripping of his clothes, revealing the thick and heavily scarred metal plates he had riveted to his chest, arms and legs. Reddmon chuckled as he walked over to them, wondering how many of those nicks and dents where because of him. He sat next to Renamon as Orionmon took off his hat and glasses, tossing them behind him. They disappeared to some far off place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon began sorting out the food Rika had bought, while for some strange reason Orionmon produced a flute from behind him and began playing it. Reddmon shook his head as he recognized the tune as something that Orionmon had played or whistled since he had first met him*. It was a slow, sad melody that always had a weird effect on Orionmon. Causing him to relax, to become a touch more, well mellow. \"Orionmon, I didn't know you could play an instrument.\" Said Renamon a look of surprise in her eyes. Orionmon stopped playing and smiled, spinning the flute in his hand, \"Well I guess I'm the sort of jack of all trades, master of non kind of mon. I have lot's of skills, but combat is what I truly excel at. Everything else is just hobby, ways to fill the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i> As strange an answer as ever Orionmon. I wonder what you hide? </i> Thought Reddmon as he laid out the meats and opened the salads container. For as long as he'd known him Orionmon had given a off a strange aura. Giving even weirder answers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the food set out and forks produced by Orionmon (Something everyone else had forgotten about.) everyone began eating. Except for the warrior digimon, who said he wasn\u2019t hungry and began playing his song again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the food was gone and everyone full Rika looked at her watch, \u201cIt\u2019s still only two o\u2019clock, we have about an hour to wait before we can even call the boys. So Orionmon, would you like to have a sparing match with Renamon?\u201d Orionmon stopped playing again and looked up for a moment, probably running through the daily schedule he made each morning. <i> A complete waste of time, he never sticks to it anyway. </i> Reddmon thought to himself. But it was just another one of the digimon\u2019s strange habits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(*The tune played is Resident Evil: Outbreak, main theme, a nice piece.) </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Orionmon nodded standing up, \u201cAlways happy to spar with new people.\u201d He said, laughing  as he walked over to the far side of the clearing. Reddmon and Rika went over to take cover in the trees, Renamon meanwhile stood up and worked out a bit of stiffness in her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through everything she knew about Orionmon, he was big and strong but relatively slow. He used his portals to counteract this, moving instantly around the battlefield. This didn\u2019t put her at an disadvantage though, she could do that as well, if not better and more effectively. She had only seen him fight for a few minutes but his style seemed quite direct, with an emphasis on strong close combat attacks. Her best course of action then was probably stay at range attacking while avoiding his counters, but on the other hand she doubted he only had that fire pike attack of his, which in itself seemed to have a short range, as well as a obvious preparation and set-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon took her fighting stance as Orionmon did likewise. He was about 10 metres away, which suggested that either he was going to engage in a fire fight, which she was confident she could win, or he was gong to use his portals to close the distance quickly in which case she should use a blow to the chest to launch herself backwards then teleport to a different location to setup an offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Orionmon changed his stance, crouching down and touching his hands to the ground, a typical runners stance. Then he burst forward with worrying speed, his feet gouging up divots of dirt and grass as he thundered forward. Renamon jumped aside at the last moment and spun around to watch him run past, as she did she swore she felt an influx of displaced air. Renamon summoned up a cloud of diamonds and prepared to launch them at him when Orionmon rammed one of his spikes into the ground and slid to a halt, turning as he did and using the other spike to rake up a cloud of dust, obscuring himself. Renamon launched the diamonds anyway, he wouldn\u2019t have time to block after that manoeuvre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barrage of razor sharp projectiles disappeared into the dust and Renamon listened hard for sounds of impact against something solid, but only heard them hit the trees behind it. She looked around, ready for an attack from an unexpected quarter, building up another storm of diamonds as she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Orionmon burst from the cloud of dust, sprinting at her again, Renamon quickly launched another volley of diamonds at him but Orionmon moved to the side just enough to avoid them. Instead of  dodging again Renamon dashed forward to meet him, placing her hands on his shoulders and vaulting over him. As she landed gracefully Orionmon pulled up to a halt, a good few metres behind her, a smaller cloud of dust marking his skid. He had a lot of momentum when he got moving, that much was certain. Maybe she could use that when he charged next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and took another stance, different from before. Which had been a sprinting stance. This one seemed to be more of a swordsman like position. Orionmon had extended his spikes, which we now encircled in a bright orange flame, and began advancing. Not nearly as fast as before but his long strides would soon get him within striking range.  Renamon decided she needed to throw him off balance with a ranged attack then follow up with strike at his legs, arms or neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe created another group of diamonds, splitting it into two smaller one, launching one aimed at Orionmon\u2019s left shoulder the other at his head. Orionmon saw what she was doing and raised his forearms, which were protected by the steel of his wrist mounts. Renamon was sure they would stop the crystals so she tried to change the trajectory mid flight, but that was hard at the best of times and she had been sparring or travelling most of the day. But she managed to change it enough to get through his guard and Orionmon stumbled back, the diamonds glittering against his torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon saw her chance and teleported behind him punching him in the ribs then striking him in the neck. Instead of crumpling to the ground like most opponents would have Orionmon just grunted, falling to one knee and raised his hand. Renamon backed off while he pushed himself to his feet, groaning as he brushed the diamonds from his side and rubbed the side of his neck. \u201cAlright, you did really well. But you seem tired. Your reactions aren\u2019t as quick as I would expect. Would you like to get some rest and try again tomorrow?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon stood panting, slightly confused. Is he giving up? Orionmon waved for Reddmon and Rika to come back into the clearing. \u201cYou all seem quite weary. Maybe you and the others should come to my place tomorrow, It would allow us all to give everything we have, being so secluded and all.\u201d Reddmon crossed his arms across his chest, \u201cHold on a sec, that\u2019s not like you at all Orionmon, usually you badger me to keep training with you till you fall flat on your face with exhaustion.\u201d Orionmon laughed nervously and scratched his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon shook his head and continued \u201cBut I have to give it to you. It is a good idea, we can have some real fun without the risk of burning down the whole forest.\u201d Renamon frowned, he was holding back? Oh that\u2019s just great, another battle hungry nutcase to deal with. Suddenly Reddmon and Orionmon grinned at each other and broke into a fit of laughter. \u201cHey Orionmon, you remember that time our attacks struck each other mid air and exploded, pretty much levelling the Mechadramon\u2019s battle arena.\u201d Orionmon wiped his eyes. \u201cOh yeah, I forgot about that. Ha, that explains why he was so unhappy to see me yesterday.\u201d Reddmon looked shocked, \u201cYou say Mechadramon? What did he do?\u201d He asked. \u201cWell, lets just say his newly rebuilt arena isn\u2019t going to be open for use anytime soon \u201c Replied Orionmon, which made Reddmon laugh all the harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon exchanged a look with Rika, \u201cBoys, their the same no matter what the species.\u201d Said Rika shaking her head. Renamon nodded, this was usually how Takato and the rest behaved. But still, Reddmon was kind of cute like this, rolling around on the ground laughing helplessly as Orionmon described his recent misadventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waited for a gap in Orionmon\u2019s story and Renamon called out \u201cHey guys, we need to leave, Rika\u2019s bruise has healed up enough to pass off as nothing, so we\u2019ll see you towmorrow. OK?\u201d Both digimon smiled and nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t cause any trouble, got it.\u201d Said Rika seriously as they turned and left the clearing. Renamon smiled to herself, why did she even bother saying that? Was she asking for them to cause more havoc? \u201cHundred yen says that we hear an explosion from them before we get home.\u201d She whispered to her partner, to make sure Reddmon didn\u2019t over hear. Rika laughed \u201cYour on. I\u2019m probably going to lose but still.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth digimon and tamer continued walking towards the town, talking occasionally. But mostly they were consumed by there own thoughts.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As both the girls left Reddmon stopped laughing for long enough to catch his breath. \"Seriously though Orionmon, you and I haven't know each other for all that long, why have you been hanging with me recently anyway. Besides our fighting skills we don't really know much about one another, much less have anything in common.\" Orionmon's wide grin quickly faded being replaced by a solemn look Reddmon hadn't seen on him before. \"Your right, I don't know much about you. A while back I heard rumors of a digimon that matched your description causing chaos in the digital world, attacking places and what not, but then those reports stopped for a while. Eventually they started again, nothing as serious as before and not following the same pattern, but recognizable as your work all the same. Then we meet in combat and thats how we are now. But all that aside I know one thing about you Reddmon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon was slightly unnerved by all this. This was the first time Orionmon had talked, in anyway, about their pasts. \"And what's that?\" He asked, not quite sure where Orionmon was even going. Orionmon gently put his hand on Reddmon's shoulder \"That you my friend, are like me, a pariah.\" All the mirth from earlier had seeped from his features. He smiled wryly \"Sorry, life gets the better of me sometimes. Will you be fine by yourself?\" Orionmon asked standing up and brushing off his fur cuisse then opening a portal behind him. Reddmon nodded, still trying get a grasp on what Orionmon had just said. Orionmon nodded in return then disappeared through the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlone now Reddmon laid down on his back and stared at the sky for a while, watching the clouds move slowly towards some unknown destination. Who was he? Reddmon couldn't remember anything past landing in some village. The digimon there had attacked him on sight and he'd had to fight his way out. That was pretty much the beginning of his memory. But according to Orionmon he had been around before that, so why didn't he have any recollection of it? \"Screw it.\" Mumbled Reddmon as he got up and began walking towards the town, he had a life and it was fine by him. It didn't matter who he'd been, he was Reddmon and he was happy enough with his lot in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Reddmon walked through the undergrowth his thoughts turned back to Renamon, he needed to impress her, show her his sensitive side. <i> First I need to find it I suppose. Ideas, I need ideas. Save a kitten? Nah, that's way too clich\u00e9, and kind of lame. Charity work? Again, same problems.</i>  By this time Reddmon had reached the town and exchanged grass for rooftop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he heard a series of gunshots followed by an explosion. Figuring that whatever it was it might be worth a look. Reddmon changed direction and made his way towards the sound. He quickly came to a road which was blockaded both ways by several police cars with another few creating a ring before a bank building. Reddmon soon spotted the source of the explosion as a car that had burst into flames somehow and flipped over. Judging by the set up and the crowd of worried people it must be a robbery or a hostage situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man with an assault rifle of some kind lent out of a window, firing an extended burst at another police car. The officers near it fled as the vehicle shuddered from the impacts and exploded in a bright red fireball, being launched into the air as it did, nearly hitting some of the fleeing cops as it crashed back to the ground. \"Heroics might be just as good as sensitivity. And at the very least it will get the police off my back for before.\"  Chuckled Reddmon as he lept forward, jumping over to the other side of the road and landing on a window sill of the back. He smashed the glass a hopped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing shouts of alarm from downstairs Reddmon ran to the doorway and pressed his ear against it, listening to heavy footsteps make their way up some stairs, sounded like there was three of them. Nothing he couldn't handle of course, but if he wanted to pull this off properly he needed to keep collateral damage to a minimum. He looked around the room and saw an old fashioned typewriter. He went over and picked it up then crept back to his position near the door. Waiting till he heard the people outside walk past. Reddmon tossed the heavy piece of equipment into the middle of the room then stood where the door would swing inward. At the loud thud he heard the people outside stop, then gruff a male voice said something and the footsteps rushed toward his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was suddenly kicked inward, nearly smacking Reddmon in the muzzle, but he grabbed it and waited as one guy stormed in, shortly followed by a second. Reddmon flung the door closed, hearing a grunt of pain and a thud, one down. The other two spun round to face him. He smiled, nothing impressive, just average thugs. Reddmon dashed forward, punching the first guy in the stomach and wrenching the gun from his grasp, tossing it out the window. Then before the other guy could even raise his firearm Reddmon teleported behind him and landed a solid kick to the back of his head. Muscle bound or not the guy fell like a sack of potatoes and Reddmon ran to the door opening it again. The third guy was on the ground, his eyes closed and blood running from his now broken nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too easy.\" Chuckled Reddmon as he made his way down the hall. He paused at the stairs, kneeling down and poking his head through the railings of the banister. From his upside down view of the main room he could see two guys, almost carbon copies of the ones he'd taken care of, brandishing more rifles at a group of terrified looking people who were laying bound up on the floor. Reddmon smiled as he saw several children in the group. <i> Jackpot.</i> He thought as he pulled his head back through the banister. He looked around for something heavy, if a trick works on an idiot once it'll work a million times. Finding nothing suitable Reddmon just shrugged and yanked one of the banister's posts out with a loud crack. He swung himself over the rail and used it to launch himself into the foyer. As the to brutes swung round their rifles Reddmon tossed the railing at ones head, teleporting behind the other as he did. A few quick blows later and the robbers where unconscious on the tile floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon turned towards the crowd of people and smiled, walking towards them. \"Hi I'm Reddmon, I'll be rescuing you today.\" One person actually laughed as he began untying people's bonds. Once they had been freed people ran out of the building in groups, several actually thanking him as they left. <i>Being the hero is actually kind of nice. An interesting change.</i> Thought Reddmon as he looked around the room, empty except for the robbers, who where out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that he was done Reddmon walked over to one of the open windows and looked out, instead of seeming thankful smiles he was looking down the barrels of about thirty different guns. Reddmon gulped and ducked under the hail of bullets as the fuzz opened fire. Reddmon waited till the gunfire stopped and yelled back. \"A thanks would have sufficed.\" His witty comeback was replied with another round of police fire. \"Geez, ingrates.\" Muttered Reddmon as he teleported out of the building and hopped from roof to roof until he was several blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Renamon and Rika had just reached their front door and Rika had the key in the keyhole when they heard the first explosion. \"Damn, Ranamon I think you just won by a split second. C'mon we'd better go sort him out.\" Renamon nodded and they made their way toward the source of the noise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they arrived at the scene a crowd of people rushed out of the bank. A man Rika recognized as Takatoe's father noticed them arrive and smiled, \"Sorry to say but your a second too late, the bank robbers have already been dealt with.\" Then Rika saw Reddmon walk up to a window and smile, only to duck down a moment later as the police officers opened fire. Mr Matsuki groaned. \"And they just opened fire on the hero. They must still be mad about the damage he caused last week. Funny, but everyone else has gotten used to it really, and its not like he was the worst one yet. He didn't even actually hurt anyone.\" Renamon giggled softly while Rika choked back a laugh. \"That means I win.\" Said Renamon. Rika nodded, it seems like Reddmon didn't cause the explosions after all. She could clearly see bullet holes in the pavement near the wrecked cars.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon we'll meet him at his place.\" Said Rika as they ran towards Reddmon's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon flopped himself down on his couch. The police had hopefully gone into the building and actually captured the robbers by now. It had been an, interesting day and Reddmon was spent. But just as he was about to nod off the doorbell rang. \"Who the hell could that be.\" Grumbled Reddmon as he pushed himself up and walked over to the front door, peaking through the window besides it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reddmon let the drapes fall back into place, there was at least ten of them outside. He slumped against the wall, groaning softly. He was in trouble now. Unless it was some kind of random search, which he doubted, they had somehow found out where he lived. He could turn into Redd and try to throw them off? No, bad idea. That would just reveal that Reddmon and Redd, and Holt for that matter, were linked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon sighed and opened the door. <i>Might as well face the music.</i> An officer with a larger hat than the others stepped forward, probably the chief or something, Reddmon noticed that none of them had their guns drawn. \"Um, may I help you?\" He asked, still holding the door, ready to slam it shut at a moments notice. The chief coughed, clearing his throat. \"Afternoon er, sir. We want to apologize for earlier when we,\" He paused nervously, looking at anything but Reddmon. \"Shot at me?\" Offered Reddmon helpfully. The police officer laughed shakily and took off his hat, worrying it in his hands. \"Yes, sorry about that. We've been under a lot of pressure recently. The only real crimes going on are those caused by you digimon, and we're more or less helpless against you. So when we saw you we, overreacted. I'm ,we're sorry.\" Several officers behind him nodded solemnly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon almost laughed out loud, they weren't here to take another shot after all. \"Well don't worry about me causing trouble any more, I'll even try to take care of any Digimon related problems for you.\" He said, smiling at them reassuringly. This seemed to calm the officer down a bit. \"That would be really helpful, we would be quite appreciative. I guess that\u2019s all then. Thank you for your help today and your time this afternoon.\" With that he replaced his hat and nodded goodbye. Turning and leaving with the rest of the cops. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon watched the police get into their cars and drive off. <i>Yep, I might just fit into the role of hero after all.</i> Thought Reddmon as he closed the door and turned, almost walking head first into Renamon. \"Gah! Where did you come from?\" He exclaimed. Rika was standing close behind, watching them both intently. The corners of her mouth tweaked into a grin. \"So first you save some people, and then your polite to the police, even offering to help them. Who are you and what have you done with Reddmon?\" Asked Renamon putting a paw under his chin and turning his muzzle left and right, as if she was looking for signs of a disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, very funny. What\u2019s up?\u201d Replied Reddmon, gently removing her paw and  leaning against the door. Renamon shrugged, \u201cWe saw them shoot at you earlier and thought we should just check to make sure your not injured.\u201d Reddmon made a mental note of that and smiled. \u201cWell as you can see I\u2019m fine and now on good terms with the authorities. But I\u2019m tired, and if I know Orionmon he plans to put us all through boot camp tomorrow.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoot camp?\u201d Questioned Rika. Reddmon rubbed his eyes blearily before answering, \u201cAs you might have guessed he takes training <i> really </i> seriously. He\u2019s probably going to ask us all to face off against him then give us tips on our fighting style. Surprisingly it actually works, he tends to spot flaws pretty well.\u201d Chuckled Reddmon. \u201cAnd he won\u2019t go easy on you, so you might want to get some sleep tonight. Which is what I\u2018m hoping to do now\u201d He finished with a yawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon huffed. \u201cWell he\u2019ll be in for a surprise tomorrow, my technique is flawless.\u201d Reddmon shrugged and opened the door, \u201cWe'll see tomorrow won\u2019t we.\u201d Renamon and Rika both narrowed their eyes at him and Reddmon thought they might try to prove him wrong right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead they walked out and he waved goodbye, though neither of them were looking at him, instead talking to each other intently. Reddmon smiled and made another mental note, <i> don't offend their ability to fight, </i> then closed the door. He went back to his couch and laid himself down again. \u201cWell unless anyone else wants to burst in,\u201d He glanced at the door, half expecting something or other to happen. After a minute of silence he continued, \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d He closed his eyes and was soon fast asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Reddmon winced as a ray of morning light hit his eyes, an annoying way to wake up. He rolled off the couch he had been sleeping on and landed on his paws, doing a few quick push ups to get himself started. More alert he pushed himself to his feet and went into the kitchen, taking out a container filled with leftovers and putting it in the microwave on the counter. While that was running Reddmon went over to the sink and turned on the cold water. He watched it run down the drain for a moment then cupped some in his paws and threw it at his face, wiping last bit of drowsiness away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoroughly awake Reddmon fished a fork from a drawer and wandered over to the microwave just as it dinged, announcing that the food was hot. Reddmon retrieved the steaming rice and meat and sat down at the table, looking out the draped window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sooner they got through this tournament the sooner they dealt with the person behind Cyberdramon. And then he could get back to more important matters, like Renamon. The saving helpless civilians thing had worked pretty well, he was sure he had surprised and impressed both Renamon and Rika. But he needed something else, winning at the tourney would be a good start but he needed something, well, something beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe created an energy ball and held it for a while. Watching the black lighting leap within the sphere, it definitely had it\u2019s own kind of beauty, he let it dissipate, but not quite what he needed. Reddmon tossed the now empty food container into the bin against the wall. \u201cMaybe I can get the big lug to teach me to play and instrument.\u201d He said to himself, only half joking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue the phone attached to his new belt crackled loudly. \u201cReddmon are you awake?\u201d It was Orionmon, of course. Reddmon sighed, <i> How did he do that?</i> then grabbed the communicator and pressed the talk button. \u201cOrionmon, do you have my house bugged or something?\u201d He asked. There was a moments silence before Orionmon replied. \u201cWhat do you mean bugged?\u201d He'd never had any talent in deceit so it was probably just a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. What do you want?\u2019 He asked as he put the fork he'd been absently twirling in the sink. \u201cCould you meet me and the others by that delicatessen from yesterday.\u201d Reddmon had already left his house and was about a quarter of the way there before Orionmon even finished the sentence. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll be there soon.\u201d He hung up and quickened his pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was soon in sight of the tree that stood adjacent to the deli, and sure enough underneath was Orionmon, in disguise of courses. Next to him stood Rika and Takato as well. Reddmon jumped into the trees branches landing next to Renamon. She smiled and waved to him. \u201cGood morning Reddmon.\u201d She seemed to be in a very good mood today. Takato was the first to look up and notice him crouching within the leaves. \u201cOh, hey Reddmon. We\u2019re just waiting for Henry and Terriermon.\u201d Reddmon glanced around, he couldn't spot the red and white lizard. \u201cWhere\u2019s Guilmon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon heard a squeaky giggle somewhere above him. \u201cHe he he, hey Reddmon, up here.\u201d Reddmon\u2019s head snapped up and he nearly lost his balance and fell out of the tree. Less than two feet above him, his legs and arms wrapped around a branch, hung Guilmon. He waved his tail happily and grinned from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow Rika tsked. \u201cSooner or later he\u2019s going to fall you know.\u201d Reddmon thought she was probably right, but he seemed to be enjoying himself to much to care. \u201cHey, here comes Henry and Terriermon.\u201d Called Guilmon from his high vantage point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed Henry jogged into the shade of the tree a few moments later, with Terriermon riding on his shoulder. \u201cYour late.\u201d Noted Orionmon crossing his arms. \u2018Momentai Orionmon.\u201d Said Terriermon as he jumped off Henry. Reddmon chuckled to himself, remembering what Renamon had said that meant. Orionmon was the last mon to \u201ctake it easy.\u201d Suddenly there was a cry of panic above them and a red blur shot past. A second later Orionmon was knocked to the ground as Guilmon fell on top of him. <i> Well, Rika was right.</i> Reddmon hopped down to help them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI told you this would happen.\u201d Complained Rika as she helped Takato pull Guilmon off Orionmon and onto his feet. Orionmon waved his hand in a dismissive gesture as he stood, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, no one got hurt. But you\u2019re all here so we might as well go.\u201d He waved again and a portal appeared against the tree trunk. Reddmon was the first to walk through it this time, and after a moment of disorientation he was back at Orionmons place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later everyone else stepped through and Orionmon closed the hole. \u201cSo let\u2019s get everything set up then. Erm, I\u2019ll need help with that.\u201d He said scratching his nose absently. \u201cWith what?\u201d Asked Henry looking around at the empty clearing. Reddmon chuckled again as Orionmon made a downward gesture. Creating a huge, horizontal, hole above the clearing. A large pile of metal and transparent material plummeted down and slammed into the ground with enough force to make everyone stumble. Except for Reddmon and Orionmon who knew exactly what was going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOrionmon what the hell is that?\u201d Exclaimed Rika regaining her balance. \u201cIs that a, blast screen?\u201d Asked Henry as he walked over to it and tried to lift the top piece. Reddmon smiled, it was no use, only him <i>and</i> Orionmon could even begin to get those things in place. Instead Henry climbed on top of the pile and rapped a knuckle against the see through section. \u201cWhere in the world did you get this? It must be at least four inches thick.\u201d Orionmon walked up next to him and slapped a palm against the stack. \u201cApparently it\u2019s able to stop a tank round. Must get around to trying that. Anyway, Reddmon and I picked it up during a sortie we went on through some sort of military base.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato and Guilmon leapt up against the pile and began pulling on the top plate with everything they had, while Renamon and Rika just waited by a tree. Renamon\u2019s ears perked up when Orionmon mentioned the word sortie. \u201cWhen you say sortie you mean a paid mission, right?\u201d She asked. \u201cYes, didn\u2019t I tell you? I usually work as a mercenary or hired sword. And sometimes, when I think I\u2019ll need to blow stuff up I get Reddmon to come along, he is rather good at that. So can every one digivolve to champion. We\u2018ll need the extra strength.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids took out their digivices and a flash of white later Growlmon, Gargomon and Kyubimon stood before them. \u201cOkay everyone, just gather into groups take a piece of screen. Place it next to another and slid them together. Then pull out the supporting struts and push them into the ground.\u201d Reddmon and Kyubimon went with the Digidestined while Gargomon and Orionmon handled one together. Growlmon on the other hand was big and strong enough to deal with one on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon had a large circle set up inside the clearing. Orionmon did a quick check of all the shields then nodded his approval. \u201cThat was much easier than doing it by ourselves. Wasn\u2019t it Reddmon?\u201d Laughed Orionmon. Reddmon had to agree with him, it had taken only a few minutes from start to finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, one on one combat. Who\u2019s up first?\u201d Asked Orionmon clapping his hands together.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Orionmon motioned towards the circle formed by the blast shields, \"Kyubimon, I believe I promised you a rematch? Would you like to have the honours?\" The large yellow fox nodded and easily jumped the three metre high barricade. Doing a graceful somersault midair and landing lightly on her paws. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon watched her acrobatics and shrugged just creating a pair of portals on either side of the wall and walking through it, door like. Reddmon chuckled, pretty sure Orionmon only did that so he wouldn't look like a fool struggling up it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, shall we begin? Remember no need to hold back. Everyone is quite safe from any stray attacks.\" Said Orionmon stretching his arms out. Reddmon stood next to the wall, watching as both digimon took their fighting stances. \"<i>This promised to be a good fight.</i>\" Thought Reddmon. After all, he was able to take Orionmon down but he was interested to see if Kyubimon could as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon made the first move, spreading out her tails and calling \"Fox tail inferno!\" The flames on her tails flared brighter and shot outwards, flying towards Orionmon at incredible speed. He managed to duck and dodge the first few projectiles but the last pair hit him hard in the chest and shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon stumbled backwards a few steps then brought his arm up, wreathing it in flame and yelling \"Infernus Axe!\" He slammed it into the ground with a resounding boom. A fierce fire erupted from the point of impact and swallowed Orionmon, swelling out to take up nearly half the makeshift arena. Even through the shield Reddmon could feel the intense heat radiating from the conflagration that burnt inside. The others flinched back from the fire and Rika turned to him. \"What\u2019s happening? Will he be alright?\" She asked worriedly. Before he could answer a shape burst from of the side of the fire. It was Orionmon, launching himself sideways. When in mid air he made a slashing motion with an extended spike, bellowing \"Blazing slash!\" and a large line of fire flew from his arm, scything threw the air towards Kyubimon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the attack coming and jumped over it, spinning vertically. Her whole body was suddenly engulfed in an ice blue flame, which took on a life of it\u2019s own and formed into a draconic maw. \u201cDragon wheel!\u201d Cried Kyubimon as the flaming attack rushed toward Orionmon. He rolled to the side as the flames passed over him, missing by inches. \u201cTo close.\u201c Chuckled Orionmon as he brushed some soot from his shoulder plate. Kyubimon landed on her paws and smiled back, looking over his shoulder. Orionmon frowned and followed her gaze to see the attack had swung up behind him in a wide arc and slammed on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon braced as the dragon swallowed him, obscuring him completely. When the fire dissipated Orionmon fell to one knee panting heavily. Grunting he pushed himself back to his feet, swaying slightly. \u201cI\u2019m not done yet.\u201d He muttered between heaving breathes. Reddmon chuckled. Defiant to the end, that summed Orionmon up for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled his arm back, it\u2019s whole wrist mount now blazing. \u201cFire pike!\u201d He yelled as a lance of pure heat shot out towards Kyubimon, who jumped aside to avoid it. Then jumped upwards as another pair of attacks crashed into the ground in front of her. Only to have a wave of fire fly at her. Unable to dodge again she blocked with her tails. Stopping the works of the assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed shakily, and was immediately knocked her from her feet as Orionmon emerged from a portal and crash tackled her in the side. The two wrestled in the dirt for a few seconds before Kyubimon managed to get her legs under Orionmon and shove him off herself. Orionmon landed heavily on his back and scrambled to his feet as Kyubimon stood as well, facing off again. Reddmon could tell that both digimon were starting to tire, although he also knew neither would give up that easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon Kyubimon take him down.\u201c Called Rika, giving the shield a loud thump for emphasis. Kyubimon nodded and spread her tails wide. The flaming tips becoming brighter again. \u201cFox tail inferno!\u201d She cried as the small flames spread out in several different directions. Turning midair and zeroing in on Orionmon. For his part the warrior digimon just smiled and opened a series of portals swallowing the projectiles. This was probably Orionmon's most powerful, or possibly annoying ability, redirecting attacks. A pair of portals opened above Kyubimon and two of her own attacks flew out and nearly hit her. A series of holes began appearing all around Kyubimon. Lousing a rapid volley of her flames. She managed to dodge most of them, mainly by jumping around, under or over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon added several of his own attacks to the barrage, getting them to where he needed them by using his portals. Kyubimon had to jump over a wave of fire that flew close to the ground. Orionmon watched as she launched herself into the air and disappeared into a portal. Appearing underneath her, crashing into her bodily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth digimon slammed into the ground, with Orionmon on top, pinning Kyubimon with his arms and legs. Kyubimon struggled a bit, but found that Orionmon\u2019s grip was two firm.  Finally, \u201cAlright you win.\u201d She muttered grudgingly, ceasing to squirm. Orionmon got off her and watched as she de-digivolved, turning back into Renamon. Orionmon smiled and held out his hand helping Renamon to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe coughed then closed his eyes, probably running through the whole fight in his head. \u201cWell my analysis of you combat ability is pretty good. You tactics, agility, speed and accuracy are all perfect. And you seem to have the ability to guide you projectiles, I would invest time on improving that talent. Try creating attacks and moving them around at will. Maybe weaving them throughout trees in a forest. Beyond that your an excellent fighter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon glanced at Rika from the corner of his eye and noticed her smiling ever so slightly. Seems she was happy with Orionmon\u2019s praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and Orionmon walked to the edge of the shield, exiting the same way as they entered. Once outside Orionmon pulled a pair of small objects from a hole. Reddmon instantly recognised them as food bars that Orionmon kept with him, they boosted a digimon\u2019s regenerative ability considerably. Orionmon tossed one of them to Renamon then sat down against a tree trunk opening the plastic of his own. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d Asked Renamon inspecting the wrapping. Orionmon was already chewing on his so Reddmon answered for him. \u201cIt'll help you heal and regain your energy much quicker, tastes pretty good too.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon swallowed the last of the food bar as Renamon opened hers and chewed on it daintily. \u201cSo who\u2019s next?\u201d He asked looking around the group.</span></div></div>",

Growlmon looked to Reddmon, \"You said we could have a rematch for earlier, now is good.\" Reddmon nodded and jumped on top of the shield, balancing easily on the thick steel. He glanced back at Growlmon who looked at the wall, he was easily taller than it but not enough to jump over, and it would fall over if he tried to climb. So he pulled two panels apart with his claws and just walked through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting them back together he turned towards Reddmon, who jumped down from his perch and took up his fighting stance. \"You not gonna take me out so easy this time.\" Chuckled Growlmon, rearing back his head. \"Pyroblaster!\" He yelled, a large burst of flame hurtling from his mouth towards Reddmon. Who laughed and easily dodged aside, dashing forward as soon as his paws touched the ground. Growlmon launched another fireball at him, but Reddmon saw this one coming as well and jumped over it, flying towards Growlmon, his right foot extended. <i> This was going to be a mirror image of the last fight. </i> Thought Reddmon, just as Growlmon ducked the kick. His tail whipping up and slamming into Reddmon\u2019s chest, knocking him into the far wall, hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slid down the transparent barrier Reddmon smiled to himself, this was going to be fun after all. He pushed himself to his feet and began running towards Growlmon, ready to teleport out of the way of any projectiles. Instead of another long range attack Growlmon advanced to meet him, the fin like protrusions on his arms lengthening and beginning to glow brightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Growlmon was within arms reach, which was a lot longer than Reddmon\u2019s, he made a large swing at his waist. Reddmon vaulted over the blade and ducked as the other arm rushed over him. He quickly formed a ball of crackling energy in his paw and lobbed it up a Growlmon's muzzle, teleporting as he did. Reddmon landed several feet away, just in time to watch as Growlmon recoiled from the cloud of smoke created by the sphere\u2019s explosion. The large dinosaur like digimon shook his head and coughed, looking around for him. He quickly spotted Reddmon and growled, charging straight at him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon created another energy ball and jumped into the air, flipping and throwing the projectile at the ground beneath him. Dematerializeing a smoke grenade and pulling the pin as he fell into the black cloud to conceal himself. He dropped the grenade and rolled aside as he heard Growlmon charge into the dust. Reddmon kept low as he sensed Growlmon\u2019s tail swinging around just above him. <i> He mustn't have a clue where I am. </i> Thought Reddmon as he ducked under Growlmon\u2019s tail again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowlmon was a natural brawler but he still didn\u2019t have nearly as much battle experience as Reddmon did, which was something he could use. Reddmon quietly pushed himself to his feet and backed out into the clear air. Hopping back onto the barricade and watching for any sign of Growlmon. Eventually his red and black striped snout emerged from the smoke cloud. Reddmon teleported in front of him and did a midair back flip. Kicking him hard and sending Growlmon stumbling backwards into the smoke with a yelp. Reddmon tossed an energy ball in after him for good measure, as well as to sustain the cloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon heard some cursing from inside the smoke and chuckled, teleporting to stand on the wall again. He waited a bit longer for Growlmon to try to get out again, ready to punish any mistakes. \u201cPyroblaster!\u201d Growlmon yelled, a continuous beam of fire bursting out of the cloud and hitting the wall, sweeping along it. Reddmon felt the barrier vibrate softly as the fire passed under him, but it easily held. The grenade was beginning to wear off and it wouldn\u2019t be long till Growlmon got another solid blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich meant he needed to stop playing around. Reddmon waited a little longer, until he could see the vague outline of Growlmon standing within the fading cloud and dropped down from his position, running full speed towards Growlmon. As soon as he hit the ground his opponent turned and walked from the smoke, blades extended and glowing. Reddmon dodged a sweeping blow that carved a large ditch in the ground and jumped onto the extended arm, running along it and punching Growlmon in the side of the head. He teleported above him and threw another energy ball at his snout. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowlmon was knocked forward by the resultant blast, and Reddmon followed through by teleporting behind him and throwing a strong to the back of the his knee. Growlmon stumbled and fell heavily onto his side with a grunt of pain. Reddmon formed another sphere and landed near his head. \u201cReady to give up now?\u201d He inquired pleasantly. Growlmon looked from him to the crackling ball of energy. \u201cWill you throw that thing at me if I say no?\u201d He asked tiredly. Reddmon smiled and nodded. \u201cYep, so, what\u2019s your answer.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowlmon sighed and was engulfed by a white light, reappearing as Guilmon \u201cYou win.\u201d He said somewhat dejectedly as he walked towards the blast shield. \u201cWait, Guilmon.\u201d called Reddmon, running after him. \u201cYou did loads better this time, just look at me as a rival you need to overcome.\u201d Guilmon seemed to be slightly cheered up by this, or maybe he just couldn't stay depressed for any length of time, either way. \u201cYeah, next time I\u2019ll win for sure.\u201d Reddmon smiled and walked with him to the edge of the protecting wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon created a portal for them to walk through, after all Guilmon wasn't strong enough to lift apart the wall. Once through Orionmon tossed them a pair of his energy bars. Which Reddmon immediate opened and began chewing on. \u201cYay, food!\u201d Yelled Guilmon, nearly eating the wrapper as well as the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job Guilmon!\u201d Said Takato, running over and hugging Guilmon. \"You almost had him.\" Reddmon smiled at that, jumping up into a tree and sitting down on a branch. \u201cIndeed, you seem to make good use of your strength and toughness, as well as even using your tail as an effective weapon. My only advice would be to work on your reaction speed. That would allow you to attack and defend more accurately\u201d Said Orionmon appraisingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that leaves you Gargomon. I guess I\u2018ll face you.\u201d Orionmon got up and brushed a few bits of soot from himself, the varios scratches and such having completely disappeared.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Orionmon did a check on the mechanism controlling his wrist spikes then created a portal, motioning for Gargomon to step through.  As he started towards it Henry placed a hand on his partner\u2019s shoulder. \u201cGood luck Gargomon, and watch your shots. He can easily use them against you.\u201d Gargomon nodded, \u201dMomentai Henry, I've got it all planned out.\u201d Henry sighed and raised a finger in warning, \u201cRemember, no battle plan survives first contact with the enemy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon laughed and stepped through the hole, reappearing on the other side. Orionmon closed the hole and opened another to the far side of the clearing, taking up his stance as Gargomon did a final check on his arm mounted gatling guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Gargomon attacked first raising his guns, yelling \u201cGargo bullets!\u201d Firing full auto, spraying shots in Orionmon\u2019s direction. Orionmon bolted to the side, managing to stay inches in front of Gargomon\u2019s barrage. Even from this distance Reddmon could tell by Gargomon\u2019s stance that he was planning something sneaky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause of the curve in the arena wall Orionmon was forced to move towards Gargomon which meant he wouldn't be able to stay in front of the bullets for much longer. As soon as he saw this the warrior digimon crouched slightly and raised his arms in front of his torso. He was running straight at Gargomon now, the gunfire pattering against his metal armguards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Gargomon stopped firing, green light coming from the barrels of his guns. Then as Orionmon closed in, his arm raised to strike Gargomon released all the bullets at once, almost like a shotgun. Orionmon weaved to the side avoid the first blast but was knocked from his feet as the second one hit him in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon immediately stepped forward, rasing his arm and bringing it down towards the prone form of Orionmon. At the last second Orionmon caught the heavy gun barrel and pulled back, putting a foot on Gargomon\u2019s chest and flipping him over himself, changing his grip slightly and slamming Gargomon onto the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth digimon quickly scrambled to their feet, Gargomon charging up his guns for another close range blast and Orionmon extending his spikes to full length. Gargomon brought up his left gun but Orionmon stepped forward and knocked the barrel to the side, letting it blow a large chunk of dirt into oblivion, and swung the other, club like at Gargomon\u2019s shoulder. Gargomon quickly raised his right gun to block and a loud clang of steel on steel rang out through the clearing. Gargomon angled the gun barrel towards Orionmon\u2019s head and fired, but Orionmon jerked aside, the shots glancing off his shoulder plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon pushed hard against his larger opponent but it was clear that he was considerably stronger, and as Orionmon gave a solid push Gargomon slid backwards several inches. Smiling slyly Orionmon suddenly retracted his spikes and the unbalanced Gargomon stumbled forward, only to take a brutal blow to the chin. Actually lifting him clear off his feet. Orionmon followed up by using a portal to get above Gargomon and grabbed him mid air, spinning and throwing the gunner digimon against the arena wall.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon grunted as he hit the ground and pushed himself into a sitting position rubbing his chin. \u201dOkay okay, you win. What\u2019s up with you guys anyway, how come your so tough?\u201d Orionmon walked over and extended an arm to help him up. \u201cSimple, I train, a lot. Reddmon on the other hand, well I not sure, he won\u2019t tell me much about who taught him to fight.\u201d Orionmon and Gargomon exited the arena and Orionmon glanced up at him. <i> I\u2019ve told him a thousand times, I don\u2019t know where I learned to fight. He probably only wants to pester whoever taught me anyway.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnyway, Gargomon, you\u2019re an excellent fighter as well. Your attacks would give you an edge when fighting multiple opponents and that variation you made has a real kick to it, useful for close range one on one encounters, and surprisingly your hand to hand abilities are quite good for a long range specialists. But most impressive is your planning ability. Until we reached that deadlock you seemed to have two steps already set up. Something that neither Guilmon or even Renamon can match. My only suggestion would be to hone your close combat ability. Maybe study a martial art of some sort, good for self discipline as well.\u201d Henry laughed and put an arm over Gargomon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHim, disciplined? Yeah right.\u201d The digidestined and their digimon chuckled at that. <i> Seems like Gargomon has a reputation.</i> Thought Reddmon as he rolled off the branch and landed next to Renamon, who looked at him and smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon passed Gargomon an energy bar as well and turned back to the ring of shields. With a large sweeping gesture a massive hole opened up under it and the whole thing just fell into it. After closing it he turned back to the group. \u201cOverall you all should do really well in the upcoming tournament. Oh and something else of note is that deleting digimon is prohibited when on the grounds, so don\u2019t worry about losing you partners.\u201d He said smiling at the tamers. \u201cIt\u2019s mainly to keep strong fighters returning in the following competitions.\u201d Noted Reddmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Umm, I guess that\u2019s it, we have two days left to prepare so good luck. Anything else anyone wants to say or needs me to get for them?\u201d Everyone shook their heads. \u201cWell then form a line and tell me where you want to go.\u201d Everyone took turns at hopping through portals, Henry and the just de-digivolved Terriermon went home to their apartment, Takato and Guilmon went to the park and Rika and Renamon went somewhere uptown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Reddmon once again alone with Orionmon, \u201cSo where to?\u201d He asked, hand at the ready.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Sure, what is it?\" Asked Orionmon, closing the portal and crossing his arms behind his back. \u201cWell <i>*sigh*</i> laugh and I\u2019ll kill you. But could you, teach me to play an instrument?\u201d Reddmon asked, scratching the back of his head. Orionmon chuckled and opened a pair of portals, from which two large, comfortable looking chairs fell. Orionmon sat down in one and looked at Reddmon, smiling slyly. \u201cNo prizes for guessing why, huh? To woo Renamon?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah. Got it in one. So will ya?\u201d Asked Reddmon dropping himself into the chair opposite Orionmon. \u201cOf course I will, but the question is what instrument would be suitable? Taking into account your level of dexterity and the target audience, a flute perhaps? No, that\u2019s not really you.\u201d Orionmon looked towards the sky and scratched his chin. \u201cA piano? You could transport it easy enough, but you fingers might be too thick to manipulate the keys.\" Orionmon paused for a moment, then. \" Hmm, maybe. Could you create one of you projectiles?\u201d A strange request but Reddmon did as asked, forming a sphere of energy and letting it float an inch above his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon closed his eyes and cocked his head, listening intently. The sphere made a soft humming noise, constant and even. \u201cYes, that could work.\u201d Said Orionmon. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He asked, looking from the ball of energy to Orionmon, not quite sure where this was going. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, just wondering about something. Can you decrease the energy inside the sphere will maintaining its form?\u201d Reddmon nodded \u201cUm, sure.\u201d He dropped the amount of power in the ball, which in turn shrank, its humming decreasing in volume and pitch. <i> Ah, so that\u2019s what he\u2019s getting at.</i> Thought Reddmon, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, your catching on? Next try to increase the density of energy while keeping its size the same.\u201d Reddmon pushed more strength into it while simultaneously restricting its size. He was rewarded with a higher pitched humming and a slight increase in volume. \u201cGood, now how about a pulse, a quick increase in the volume. Try to keep the density the same while increasing the size quickly.\u201d Reddmon concentrated on gathering energy into the his paw. Then when he had enough he pushed it into the sphere, the ball bulged suddenly creating a thud sound like the beating of a drum or even a heart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes it feel like the integrity of the sphere was in anyway in danger of being compromised?\u201d Reddmon shook his head, that was easy to maintain, almost natural. \u201cThen lets try a rhythm next. Try to copy this with you sphere.\u201d Orionmon clapped his hands together in a simple pattern. Which Reddmon copied easily, Thud thud, thud, thud thud, thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs I thought, this will be much simpler than learning a traditional instrument, and more characteristic. One last thing to try. Can you increase the volume slower, more like a slide than a beat.\u201d Reddmon drew energy from the sphere at a steady rate, creating a sound somewhat like a engine powering down. Then reversed it, going back to the original size and tone. \u201cSo if you combine those two lessons you should be able to create music. What\u2019s more I've noticed that the projectiles you create in combat seem to be of a standard size, you could try different sizes and densities for various situations.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack to the topic of music though. Would you like to try a tune now?\u201d Reddmon nodded as Orionmon pulled his flute from midair. \u201cListen once then try to copy, okay?\u201d Reddmon re-adjusted himself in the seat and re-distributed the energy in the sphere. Orionmon played a more complex tune this time, one that Reddmon actually liked the sound of. Then once he finished playing he motioned for Reddmon to join in and began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon managed to play through with only a few errors. When they finished Orionmon lowered his flute, \u201cThat was very good Reddmon, you seem to have a knack for this. One more time then well move on to the last lesson.\u201d They played the tune again. This time, much to his own surprise Reddmon got it perfectly, matching Orionmon note for note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha! Now your getting the hang of it, but now where on the last stretch. Can you create a second energy ball, then copy this tune with it?\u201d Said Orionmon jovially, raising the flute to his lips and playing a different piece this time. This one had fewer notes but they all sort of ran into the next one, sliding up and down. Once finished Orionmon began again and Reddmon again copied, getting it on the first try. \u201cGood, now see if you can play both parts at once.\u201d Reddmon frowned, that might be tricky, like patting ones head and rubbing their stomach at the same time. \u201cYou mean one part on each hand right.\u201d Orionmon nodded and waited for Reddmon to start, absently spinning the flute in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon inhaled deeply and slowly let it out again. Starting both at once would be too hard so he decided to begin the first part then come in later with the second. Within moments he had both orbs of energy pulsing in time with their respective tunes, the melody they had been practicing played in its full for the first time. Reddmon grunted as his concentration slipped a bit and an incorrect tone interrupted the flow of notes. Orionmon opened his eyes, having closed them at some point or another. \u201cReddmon, that was good buy why don\u2019t you let them dissipate, it\u2019s getting late and were both tired anyway.\u201d Reddmon watched the lightning leap around the insides of the sphere then drew it out and back into his paw. \u201cI guess your right, Thanks.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell do you think you have a grasp on this now?\u201d Asked Orionmon. Reddmon nodded, \u201cYeah, so where do you think I should look to find new songs to learn?\u201d Orionmon reached into a portal and pulled out a CD player. \u201cHere, I think there is a music store near your place, have a look there sometime. But don\u2019t slack off this week, I don\u2019t want you to get knocked out of the running before we fight.\u201d With that Orionmon stood up opened a portal. \u201cSo you read to go home, or is there something else you need?\u201d</span></div></div>",

See you Tuesday.\" Yawned Reddmon, walking through the portal Orionmon created for him a moment later, giving a small wave as Orionmon disappeared from his sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short, dark trip he was back in his living room, the last rays of evening light struggling through the thick dusty drapes. Dead tired Reddmon glanced at the stairs, he could go up and sleep in one of the bedrooms. But he just settled for the couch again and sat down, punching the pillow a bit to get it comfy then laying his head on it. Within moments he was out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Reddmon winced as bright light hit his eyes. He sat up and stretched, glaring at the beam that traced along the room and over the cushion where his head had been moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the clock, his eyes taking a moment to adjust. It was nine o\u2019clock already so the tamers would be at school, probably with Renamon watching them, while Guilmon would be hiding out at the park. Reddmon frowned, that left Terriermon unaccounted for. He wasn\u2019t sure where the rabbit like digimon hung out during schooldays, most likely at home or maybe even at the park with Guilmon, those two seemed to get really along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could join the tamers as Redd/Holt, after all that jerk from before might give Rika trouble again, but on the other hand he really wanted to practice his \u201cmusic\u201d and maybe even experiment with changing the properties of his attacks.</span></div></div>",

He was starving, having forgotten to eat dinner last night. He changed into Redd and grabbed some money from the change bowl that stood on a table near the door. He would need to get some more cash soon, after all Renamon probably wouldn\u2019t approve of him stealing things anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon, well Redd, walked around town for a while, finding and investigating the music place Orionmon had mentioned and in the end stopping at a small roadside stall and eating some decent braised beef and rice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Redd had eaten his fill he went back to the record store and picked up a few CDs that had gotten his attention. Leaving the store he decided that he might as well practice outside, so he walked to the park and found a large area completely filled with trees. Redd hopped up into one and sat down, \u201cfeeling\u201d around himself for anyone that might discover him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing no one he changed back to Reddmon and materialized the CD player Orionmon had given him. Taking out one of the discs that he\u2019d just bought, Reddmon switched it on and inserted the CD into a likely looking slot, turning the volume dial to a relatively low setting. Reddmon listened to several of the songs, noting the ones that he thought he could play with just two or even one \u201cinstrument\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had gone through the CD he went back to the one he thought most suitable and played it again. He listened to it a second time then created a energy sphere in his paw and took a deep breath. \u201cWhat cha\u2019 doin\u2019 Reddmon?\u201d Asked a squeaky voice. Reddmon started, dropping the ball of pure destructive energy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly swung backwards under the branch and snatched the sphere from midair, halting it\u2019s fall inches from Guilmon\u2019s upturned muzzle. Not particularly disturbed by this Guilmon asked again. \u201cSo is it training, or are you playing a game? Oh, can I play too?\u201d Reddmon dispersed the ball and righted himself on the branch. \u201cHow long have you been there?\u201d He asked. The happy-go-lucky Digimon just shrugged. \u201dA few minutes, how about a game of tag?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNah, maybe another time, I\u2019m trying to learn something new at the moment.\u201d Guilmon cocked his head and sat down. \u201cMind if I watch?\u201d This time it was Reddmon\u2019s turn to shrug. \u201cSure, but it\u2019s more of a listening thing.\u201d Guilmon adjusted himself and watched Reddmon intently as he created another energy ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon started playing the music he had heard a moment ago, getting several notes wrong but getting even more right. He played it again, with much more success. And on the third try he got it perfectly. Quite happy with himself he looked down to his audience, \u201cSo what do you think Guilmon?\u201d Guilmon didn\u2019t answer, he was fast asleep, snoring softly, a small bubble of snot coming from his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon glared down at Guilmon, his eyebrow twitching. <i> Keep calm, keep calm, he fell asleep right? That\u2019s a good sign. It means it\u2019s soothing. Aw hell I could hit him twenty times before he woke up, let alone struck back.</i> Reddmon took another deep breath and let the energy ball he was holding fade. Sighing Reddmon dematerialised his stuff and hopped from the branch, materializing a camouflage patterned blanket and laid it over the sleeping form of Guilmon. Didn\u2019t want to freak out any park goers after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon left the park and made his way back home, entering by one of the upstairs windows. As he landed softly Reddmon sensed a presence in the room. He span round to see Renamon sitting on the bed, smiling at him warmly. Reddmon smiled back and clutched his chest it fake surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s up Rena, don\u2019t you usually watch Rika and the others on school days?\u201d Renamon got up and glanced out the window, \u201cTerrirermon is at the school at the moment, he should be able to handle any trouble. So what have you been doing?\u201d Reddmon shrugged, <i> and made a mental note to talk to Guilmon about keeping his mouth shut in relation to earlier.</i> \u201cNothing much, just looking around town, thinking.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon took a few steps closer, near enough for her muzzle to be inches away from his own. \u201cWhat where you thinking about?\u201d She asked, almost whispering. Reddmon smiled and gently touched her chin, \u201cTruth be told you certainly crossed my mind a few times.\u201d Renamon laughed lightly and sat back down on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry to say but I actually came here to ask you about less pleasant matters. Do you have any thoughts about the whole business with Cyberdramon.\u201d Reddmon rubbed his eyes, \u201cNot really, hopefully this tournament will turn up some leads. I\u2019m pretty sure that wasn\u2019t just a random digimon suddenly being obsessed with me.\u201d Renamon sighed, nodding. \u201cYour right, but what do we do once we find out who\u2019s behind it all?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh, that parts simple. I go beat them up till they beg for mercy.\u201d Chuckled Reddmon, leaning casually against the window sill. Renamon laughed and teleported behind him, standing on the veranda roof. \u201cI hope for your sake its that easy.\u201d Reddmon turned to look to ask her what she meant but she had already disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMeh, I can always ask them for help if it comes to that.\u201d Muttered Reddmon as he left the room, although he only said that because he was sure Renamon might be listening. And he suspected trust would be something she would appreciate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon made his way downstairs and sat in one of the chairs in the living room, rematerialising his CD player and finding the tune from earlier. He created another energy ball and began playing along, wanting to surprise the foxy lady as soon as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, as it began to get dark, Reddmon dispersed the spheres he was using and laid back in the chair. \u201cPerfect.\u201d He said to himself, smiling. He had gotten four pieces down and he had another that he wanted to start learning, but keeping those spheres coherent was beginning to tax him. And he still needed to figure out when to show Renamon, maybe sometime after the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon wandered up to the top floor, grimacing as he saw the large dent he had made in the wall. <i>That was from the first day I met Renamon, heh, that seems like such a long time ago.</i> Thought Reddmon as he swung the door open, looking at the bed Renamon spent a few days recovering on. \u201cWhich reminds me, I should change those sheets soon.\u201d Said Reddmon aloud as he walked to another room and laid down on its bed, then almost immediately getting up again and making sure the widows drapes where firmly sealed. He nodded in satisfaction then laid down again pulling the sheet haphazardly across his chest and instantly falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Tune was Lon Lon ranch from ocarina of time (If its not on CD it should be!)</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Renamon walked into the Nonaka\u2019s kitchen and said good morning to Rika\u2019s grandmother. She was always up at the crack of dawn, making some \u201cinteresting\u201d recipe or another. Rika struggled to eat most of it but Renamon herself usually found it quite palatable. This morning's food smelt strongly of ginger and cinnamon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you are Renamon, you\u2019ll need your strength for today won\u2019t you?\u201d Said the elder Nonaka kindly, placing a plate of colourful and fragrant food on the table. \u201cThank you very much. It looks lovely.\u201d Said Renamon with a slight bow as she sat down and began eating. After the D-reaper incident Renamon had become a official member of Rika\u2019s family. Complete with a touching ceremony which had brought a tear to her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Renamon finished the food on her plate Rika entered the room, rubbing her eyes blearily. \u201cMorning everyone.\u201d She mumbled getting herself a glass of juice and a bowl of cereal. She sat down opposite to Renamon, \u201cSo, are you feeling confident.\u201d She asked as she chewed a mouthful of cereal. Renamon snuffed a laugh, \u201cWell if Reddmon wins most of the time I have a good chance. But it\u2019s going to be fun going back to the digital world, we haven\u2019t been there in a while \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika choked on her cereal, she thumped a fist against her chest a few times and swallowed hard. \u201cFun?\u201d She cried, \u201cThe last time we went there we got separated and completely lost, not to mention almost getting deleted about twenty times! And we even lost Leomon.\u201d She finished, referring to Kari\u2019s long gone partner. Renamon nodded. \u201cIt is true that we lost much there, but we gained even more and saved many, besides Orionmon can get us out of any trouble we can\u2019t deal with.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRika nodded, conceding and finished the last of her cereal. \u201cSo should we call the others and meet them someplace?\u201d Asked Rika. Renamon shrugged and got up, taking her and Rika\u2019s dishes and putting them all in the sink. As she ran some hot water she lent against the sink. \u201cI suppose we should just get them to head over to Guilmon\u2019s place. I mean, that\u2019s where we usually meet up.\u201d She turned off the water and began cleaning the dishes. Rika came over and helped drying and putting them where they belonged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later they had both cleaned themselves up and gotten ready. \u201cBye grandma!\u201d Called Rika as she put her shoes on and left. \u201cKeep safe you two.\u201d She called back. Renamon hopped on top of the nearest building and watched Rika as she took out her phone and began calling the boys and Reddmon, even calling ahead to Guilmon so they wouldn\u2019t surprise him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived Reddmon was already there, talking about something to Guilmon. \u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t say anything about it.\u201d Complained Guilmon as she and Rika walked up the path. \u201cAbout what?\u201d Asked Renamon as they stepped inside small the building Guilmon hid in. \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d Said Reddmon quickly, too quickly. He was definitely up to something and Guilmon was in on it. Renamon glanced over at Guilmon who smiled nervously and waved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Whatever.</i> She thought, turning to greet Henry and Terriermon who had just arrived. \u201cSo does anyone know when Orionmon will arrive?\u201d Asked Henry, straight to the point as usual. \u201cYeah, he said he would be around soon.\u201d Answered Reddmon, visibly happy for the change of subject. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrival of Takato was announced by a load panting as he came up the path weighed down with a huge backpack, even from this distance Renamon could smell the fresh bread. Now that his parents knew about Guilmon Takato could stop bringing only day old bread. A fact that Guilmon had celebrated for a week non-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy in the world did you bring all that? We\u2019re only going for one day.\u201d Said Rika motioning towards the bag. Takato laughed, \u201cThis is going to be an awesome show, we\u2019ll probably want something to eat. And if it\u2019s anything like the real world the food will be way too expensive.\u201d Renamon had to give him that one. Food at events like this was usually triple or more than at other places. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Orionmon walked from a bush. What he was doing there she had no idea. \u201dSo everyone ready?\u201d He asked, looking around at the group. Everyone nodded so he created a portal in front of them and waited for them to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the familiar feeling of weightlessness they landed in a seemingly empty wasteland. \u201cGreat just like old times! Orionmon, did you get us los\u2026\u201d Rika trailed off as she turned to yell at the massive rookie. Her jaw had dropped, she was looking at something behind them, Renamon and the others followed Rika\u2019s gaze to see what she was staring at. When she saw the spectacle Renamon had to admit it was impressive, behind Orionmon stood an absolutely huge building that resembled the ancient Roman Coliseum. \u201cWelcome to Etemon\u2019s arena.\u201d He said with a chuckle as he turned and began walking towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and the others jogged to catch up and Terriermon was the first to ask what everyone was thinking. \u201cSo what\u2019s with the architecture?\u201d Orionmon shrugged. \u201cLike every Etemon I ever met he has an ego the size of a small country. I guess the roman motif is because he sees himself as Caesar, you know a great conqueror and such.\u201d Renamon frowned, \u201cSounds like a jerk, will we have to meet him in person?\u201d Orionmon stopped at the huge pair of doors and knocked, \u201cNo, no, I\u2019ll take care of that and get back to you when I have what we need.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large pair of doors ponderously swung inwards, revealing a cavernous foyer filled with digimon. Some in groups, some by themselves, mainly champion level but several rookies could be spotted in the mix. \u201cCome on, we\u2019d better sign in.\u201d Said Orionmon pointing towards a Gekomon behind a small reception desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked across the tiled floor Renamon noticed that most of the Digimon were watching them semi-surreptitiously, probably trying to gauge their strength. She was doing the exact same thing herself and by the looks of things they might have a tough fight. Renamon smiled to herself, this was going to be fun for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh, Reddmon, Orionmon glad to thee you here. And you brought guesths.\u201d Said the Gekomon with a pronounced lisp. \u201cGood morning, Reddmon and I are signing in and we also have three other combatants, Guilmon, Terriermon and Renamon, they\u2019ll be participating in their champion forms. Also can we have three guest seats?\u201d Orionmon took out some digital currency and gave it to the Gekomon, who quickly counted it and typed something into the computer on his desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds several slips of paper slid out of an attached printer. The Gekomon examined them for a second then handed one to each of the Digimon. \u201cThish ith the number that will be called when itsth your turn to fight. You\u2019ll be thiting in the stands \u2018till then, enjoy and good luck.\u201d Orionmon nodded his thanks and walked towards a flight of stairs set into the wall. Reddmon followed as did everyone else, when they got to the top Renamon was again stunned, not an easy thing considering the things they had been through. Although from the outside the building looked old and weathered the inside was a stark contrast. Concentric circles of plush chairs and stands sat around a deep pit lined with a mirrored metallic substance, giving a very futuristic feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral digimon were already sitting down either in pairs, large groups or alone. Orionmon led them over to an area at the front that no one was sitting in and lowered himself into a seat. Reddmon motioned for everyone to take a seat then sat down next to Renamon and Rika. Renamon and Rika leaned forward taking a look at the arena, it was several metres deep and a good thirty or forty wide, plenty of room for fighting, with little chance of attacks straying into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bit empty isn\u2019t it.\u201d Said Terriermon, pointing at the pit. Renamon had to agree, a digimon who specialized in long range attacks would be able to stand against the wall and just shoot at his opponent, completely avoiding attacks. \u201cThe terrain stays hidden until the match and is changed between each, you know using data storage or whatever.\u201d Said Reddmon as he looked around at the digimon already sitting down. \u201cWhat do you reckon Orionmon, sense anyone really strong?\u201d Orionmon nodded, \u201cYeah one or two, this should be fun. Especially with you all here. Means we have someone to cheer for.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon cleared his throat and turned to them. \u201cSo, I guess I should tell you all the rules. First off the contestants wait up here until the number they were allocated appears on those screens.\u201d He pointed to a set of large TV\u2019s that were mounted on the upper walls, just above where the crowd would sit. \u201cThen they make their way down to the doors of the arena,\u201d He pointed down to a pair of arches covered with iron grates. \u201cJust before you enter a new battlefield will be digitally generated. They are pretty varied, I\u2019ve seen flat plains, a block from a city, lush forests and more. Next step is to find and fight you opponent in the arena, keep fighting till he either gives up or is unconscious. As I said before deleting your opponent is prohibited. Oh, and besides getting outside help or digivolvling past champion, anything goes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget, the whole thing is worked out in a elimination system, last digimon wins.\u201d Noted Reddmon. Renamon rubbed her chin. \u201cHow long is the break between matches?\u201d Reddmon grinned happily \u201cThought you might be the one to ask that. As long as it takes for the last digimon to leave, or be removed from the arena.\u201d He chuckled at that last bit. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to end up being a contest of strength and endurance.\u201d She sighed, if they took too much damage in the previous bout they would be at a disadvantage in the next, and they would have shorter rest periods as they got into the semi-finals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep.\u201d He said simply. \u201cOh, hey it looks like we\u2019re about to begin.\u201d He nodded towards the nearest entrance as a horde of digimon began pouring out and taking seats. Within minutes the whole place was bustling with movement as digimon talked animatedly about various things. Renamon was surprised at the sheer number of digimon that had come to see something that was practically a daily occurrence in the Digital world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the arena grates opened and an orange figure walked out into the arena. He took a microphone from behind his back and practically yelled into it. \u201cWelcome ladies and gents to the fifteenth Etemon champion league! I hope you\u2019re ready for some mayhem because we'll begin without further ado.\u201d He pointed up to one of the screens which blinked on and displayed 13 vs 45. \u201cNumbers 13 and 45 C\u2019mon down.\u201d He said with a flourish and a horrible Elvis impersonation as he walked out of the arena. Renamon and the others glanced down at the slips of paper they had been given. Was one of them the first to fight?  </span></div></div>",

It was a massive wolf-like digimon that appeared to be wearing some kind of body armor.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone and their partners glanced at their slip of paper, \u201cNope, nope, nope.\u201d They said one after another. \u201cGood, that means you get to see what level the fighting is at before you\u2019re thrown into it.\u201d Said Orionmon looking around the arena. Renamon looked around as well but with all the movement of the cheering crowd it was difficult to spot someone standing. After a few seconds the whole arena was filled with a bright light and when it faded the shiny surface of the pit was replaced by a sandy field, with large and irregular rock formations jutting from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grates slid up and a pair of digimon emerged, one resembled a pirate, all but his right eye hidden by his shirt and hat. A huge hook attached to one arm and a large flared cannon on the other. The opposing digimon was a rather short and rounded warrior clad in silver armour and carrying a pair of long swords in his thin, almost lanky arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtemon\u2019s boisterous voice burst from speakers somewhere above them, \u201cThe first match is gonna be kicked off by Hookmon and Gladimon. Warriors, on you marks 1,2,3, fight! uh, huh, huh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the word fight the Hookmon raised his gun and fired a large cannonball at his opponent. Gladimon dove for cover behind a boulder, which was blown apart by the solid projectile. The sword wielding digimon dashed behind the next one, getting himself closer at the same time. Seeing that this tactic wasn\u2019t going to work Hookmon began edging closer, firing off shots whenever he caught sight of Gladimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hookmon blasted another rock to gravel he noticed that he\u2019d lost track of his enemy, Renamon smiled as she realised what Gladimon was planning. Sensing something Hookmon swung his cannon up and shot another iron ball through a bolder next to him, as he looked over the debris Gladimon made his move. \u201cSword Dancer\u201d was called out somewhere behind him and a rock formation was suddenly sliced apart as a tornado like apparition burst through it. It was Gladimon, spinning at high speeds towards Hookmon. He\u2019s twin blades chopping through any rocks he passed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHookmon fired another shot at the incoming whirlwind but Gladimon weaved aside and came in for the kill. Hookmon tried to block with his large hook, but that was knocked aside and one of Gladimons blades lashed out and drew a thin crimson line across Hookmon\u2019s chest, ruining his jacket in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHookmon roared in anger and made a clumsy swipe with his hook, which Gladimon easily avoided, cutting Hookmon\u2019s hook arm. Hookmon backed off, hurt but not ready to give up he fired off another shot and ducked behind a boulder. He leaned against it for a moment and inspected his wounds, from the looks of things this fight was over. The Hookmon looked up as Gladimon tapped his sword on the rock. He was standing over him, sword pointed at this head. \u201cSurrender or suffer further injury.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHookmon glanced at his shoulder then nodded. \u201cYarr, fine I gives in.\u201d He said grudgingly as he began walking out of the arena while Gladimon raised a sword in victory and quickly left as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he left the arena glowed brightly again and reappeared as a dense forest, although the canopy was rather thin so they could easily see the ground. \u201cThat was a awesome match, hope his pride heals as fast as his wounds. The next will be..... Number 1 and number 29.\u201d Renamon glanced at her number, \u201dNot mine, any of you guys up.\u201d Everyone else shook their heads. So they would get another chance to scout out the competition before they fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later the grates opened and a digimon appeared, he had shaggy brown covering his body with a pair of strong looking arms that almost touched the ground. \u201cIs that a Junglemojyamon.\u201d Breathed Henry. \u201cI thought those where supposed to be mythical.\u201d Renamon nodded, she had never seen one herself nor heard of any rumours of them being seen, guess this one needed the money or something. \u201cHold it where\u2019s the other digimon?\u201d Asked Takato, Renamon looked around. Takato was right, she hadn\u2019t seen or sensed another digimon enter, was it a forfeit?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s Junglemojyamon versus Sealsdramon this time. On your marks, get set. Fight!\u201d Yelled Etemon. \u201cBut there isn\u2019t an opponent in the ring.\u201d Called Rika. Renamon frowned watching Junglemojyamon closely. He seemed unsettled about something, despite having the environmental advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly from the trees a figure emerged, he looked like a lizard standing erect and covered in armour that blended into its surroundings almost perfectly, the effect finished with a few attached branches. \u201cThere!\u201d She said pointing at the attacked. The others looked just in time to see the Digimon throw off it\u2019s camouflage and strike Junglemojyamon in the back with a fierce blow. The rare digimon silently collapsed, knocked unconscious in a single hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh, that was quick. Cool show an all but could\u2019ve been more dramatic.\u201d Muttered Etemon over his microphone. As Sealsdramon walked out of the Arena a pair of digimon clad in white cloaks bustled in and picked up Junglemojyamon, carrying him out. \u201cMedimon. They're hired to take care of wounded at events like this.\u201d Said Reddmon, having noticed her watching them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHopefully this match will last longer. Numbers 12 and 34, step up to the plate.\u201d The Digimon glanced at their tickets.</span></div></div>",

It might be difficult to do so mid match.\u201d Rika nodded and jumped to her feet, sliding past Reddmon and running up to Renamon. They both descended the stairs by two levels, following signs marking the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the grate Rika pulled out her digivice and a digivolution card. A second after she swiped it Renamon felt her body overflowing with power and strength. After the traditional transformation montage Kyubimon was ready for battle. \u201cRika do you want to go back to the stands to watch?\u201d Rika smiled and  began running from the small tunnel. \u201cPut on a good show O.K.\u201d She called after herself. \u201cAlways.\u201d Kyubimon replied softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a now familiar burst of light from the grate and when it faded a small grouping of islands set in a emerald lake was in the place of the previous battlefield. Kyubimon stepped closer and the gate slid up into an alcove. As Kyubimon walked out onto the stony outcropping that was attached to her gate she was shocked, well surprised at least to see a familiar looking Clockmon walk out of the opposing gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Kyubimon! It\u2019s wonderful to see you, it\u2019s great to see you, well it\u2019s alright.\u201d Yes it was definitely the Clockmon they\u2019d met last time they were here in the digital world. He looked vaguely like a medieval executioner wielding a mallet and attached at the waist to a clock with arms and legs, a single eye showing through a broken section on its face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust because we know each other doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to go easy on you.\u201d Chuckled Clockmon, hefting his hammer. \u201cQuit yer' yappen\u2019 an\u2019 get ta' slappen\u2019! fight!\u201d Bellowed Etemon, signaling the match to start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon decided to end this as quickly as possible so she went straight to her strongest attack. She leapt in the air and spun vertically, building up heat and energy \u201cDragon wheel.\u201d She yelled, releasing the energy in a serpentine torrent that rushed towards Clockmon, forming the open maw of a dragon. The attack was dead on, but as it was about to wash over Clockmon he suddenly disappeared. One moment he was there the next, gone. Not even with the fading effect she and Reddmon made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did he do that?\u201d Kyubimon muttered, looking around for him. A second later she noticed a shadow growing below her and instinctively jumped back just as Clockmon slammed into the island she was on, cracking it in half with his hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had no idea where he'd come from but Kyubimon pounced forward anyway, knocking him from his feet and landing on an undamaged chunk of rock. As she turned Clockmon picked himself up, yanking his weapon from the stone and smiled as much as his stitched mouth would let him. Kyubimon wasn\u2019t sure how he dodged her first attack but she needed to keep on the offensive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gathered more energy to her tails, the flames of which flared brighter. \u201cFoxtail inferno!.\u201d She cried, unleashing several flaming projectiles at him. Before any of the attacks came close he disappeared again, Kyubimon didn\u2019t even have time to look round, she only felt the heavy mallet hit her in the back on the head. Dazed but still coordinated enough to react, she clamped her jaws around his arm and tossed him across the water, he skipped against the surface once then hit the edge of an island with a clank of metal denting. He clung to the island and pulled himself up. In the throw he had dropped his hammer somewhere, which gave her a massive advantage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClockmon glanced around, probably looking for his weapon. Kyubimon took this chance and gathered power into her tails again, launching another set of shots at him. Clockmon noticed the movement at the last second, raising sets of arms to try and protect himself. But that didn\u2019t stop him from being wreathed in blue flames, he thrashed about he fell back into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a pair of Medimon burst from the darkness of the gate and dove into the water, resurfacing a moment later with the unconscious form of Clockmon, who had passed out as he fell. \u201cAnd Kyubimon wins. A solid fight, some good maneuvering. But on to the next round, 11 and 44 get down here.\u201d Called Etemon, not even giving her time to leave the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyubimon finally got out and de-digivolved back into Renamon then teleported up to their seats. Renamon ignored the squeals of fright her sudden appearance caused from those sitting near them and noticed that Henry and Terriermon where missing. \u201cWas that their number called out?\u201d Reddmon nodded and she sat down in her seat between him and Rika. \u201cGood job.\u201d They said in perfect unison, Renamon laughed as they looked at each other, their cheeks slightly reddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys, Gargomon\u2019s on the field.\u201c Called Guilmon pointing a claw down at the arena. Indeed the large gun bunny was standing in the pit, which now took the form of a city block, as Orionmon had described. Everyone looked to the other entrance as they heard a clanking sound, like metal slapping and scraping against rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the din grew louder a tank like digimon trundled into the arena. His treads against the concrete the source of the noise. He was extremely bizarre looking. Painted a dull green, his head formed the tanks turret while his arms ended in mean looking machine guns. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis match is between Gargomon and Tankmon, let the bullets fly!\u201d Announced Etemon gleefully. The Tankmon pointed his cannon at Gargmon and with a thunderous blast a large warhead rocketed from his nose. Gargomon rolled to the side as the shell flew at him, missing by centimetres. The wayward shot slammed into the side of a building and detonated, the ensuing explosion caused the structure to topple over, crashing to the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTankmon kept rumbling along, scanning the buildings and alleyways. As she scanned as well Renamon caught a glimpse of green through a window. It seemed like Gargomon had realized he couldn\u2019t win in a straight up fire fight. Which meant he had a plan up his sleeve or at least he was working on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGargomon edged slowly from behind a building. He had gotten behind Tankmon, who had just reached the wreckage of the building. Gargomon stooped down and picked up a small chunk of rubble, tossing it at a far off building then stepping back into the shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTankmon slowly wheeled around to look for the source of the noise, swinging his machine guns up. Gargomon watched this for a moment then ran down the alley he was in, disappearing from her sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTankmon kept turning round, now growling in frustration. With a shocking suddenness he began pouring tank round after tank round into the buildings, strafing everything with his arm mounted guns. The Arena quickly began filling with smoke and The others began coughing from the dust. Suddenly through the loud whine of the gunfire came a series of louder shots and both abruptly stopped. As the dust settled Gargomon appeared, standing behind Tankmon who had several bullet holes in his tracks, as well as his guns being shot apart. The military digimon tried to turn towards Gargomon but he couldn\u2019t seem to move or pivot, only producing a grinding noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like this is over, Gargomon wins. Let's hope the rest of the matches are this destructive.\u201d Yelled Etemon. Gargomon waved to the cheering crowd then walked out while a large group of Medimon rushed in and dragged Tankmon out the other exit. <i>\"Hopefully they have a good mechanic here.\"</i> She chuckled to herself. Etemon called out the next numbers \u201c6 and 31, get you\u2019re buts down here and your gloves up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the digimon checked their numbers, although only Guilmon, Reddmon and Orionmon where left to fight in the first round.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAlright, seems that my opponent is waiting.\u201d Said Orionmon as he stood up, Renamon pulled her legs in slightly to make room for him when he walked past. But he just fell downwards, having opened a hole under himself. <br>\r\n\u201cShow off.\u201d Muttered Reddmon glancing at the hole as it closed in on itself. Renamon smirked and elbowed him gently in the ribs. <br>\r\n\u201cYour furiously trying to think of some more flamboyant way of entering, aren\u2019t you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReddmon gave her a funny look for a second then smiled broadly. <br>\r\n\u201cHa, ya got me. I\u2019m leaning towards of some sort of explosive. You know, enter with a bang?\u201d Renamon shook her head at that horrible pun then peered down into the arena which had gone through it\u2019s change already. The paved streets now replaced by a sandy beach, complete with white crested waves on one side and a dense forest of palm trees on the other. It was all very beautiful and a strange place to fight but what confused her was, where were the waves coming from? They just seemed to appear from the arena wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon\u2019s wondering was cut short when the grates slid open. Orionmon stepped out of one while a large armour plated dinosaur stomped from the other. The Monochromon didn\u2019t stop moving once he had entered the ring. In fact he sped up, quickly gaining impressive momentum. \u201cHey I didn\u2019t say start\u2026. aw hell, go fer your lives.\u201d Etemon complained sullenly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nRenamon knew that while a Monochromon\u2019s charge was horribly destructive it was relatively easy to avoid, so she was surprised when Orionmon spread his feet and braced for impact. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing? Isn\u2019t he going to dodge?\u201d Asked Renamon worriedly. <br>\r\n\u201cNah, not his style. He\u2019s almost as head strong and stubborn as I am.\u201d Laughed Reddmon, waving his paw casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monochromon lowered his large horn, preparing to gore Orionmon with it. But as he closed the last foot Orionmon leaned to the side, pushing down on the horn as it rushed past, putting his other hand under Monochromon\u2019s snout and lifting. Using his opponents momentum to flip him over and hurl him into the trees, crushing a large swathe with his bulk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and the others sat stunned as Orionmon got up and brushed himself off. Reddmon began howling with laughter. <br>\r\n\u201cYou should see the looks on your faces. Bet that was the last thing you were expecting huh? Heh, he\u2018s the only guy I know nuts enough to try that.\u201d Said Reddmon, raising his voice to be heard over the crowd as they roared their approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Monochromon didn\u2019t seem to be quite so pleased with his rough treatment,  he quickly rolled to his feet and reared back his head, launching a massive ball of fire from his maw, bellowing \u201cVolcanic strike!\u201d Orionmon dashed forward, running low and fast. He ducked under the projectile mid flight and slid to a halt in front of his opponent as the attack hit the ground and detonated in a brilliant flash of heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Monochromon could react Orionmon grabbed his chin and yanked him up onto his hind legs, exposing is unarmoured stomach. Before he could get his feet back on the ground Orionmon delivered a series of brutal punches that actually kept Monochromon elevated. He suddenly stopped, stepping back as Monochromon fell, raising a large cloud of sand as he hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonochromon groaned and tried to push himself to his feet but only fell back down with a grunt of pain. Looks like he\u2019d had enough. \u201cThis match is over, seems like Monochromon couldn\u2019t handle him. The next fighters are, 8 and 9.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrionmon stepped backwards into a hole while some Medimon retrieved Monochromon. Orionmon appeared back in front of his seat just as Guilmon practically exploded from his. \u201cMy turn, my turn, my turn!\u201d He cried happily. <i> Apparently it was his turn to fight.</i> Thought Renamon, wondering if he could show his inexperience anymore obviously. Although, childish as he was he could still fight exceptionally well, so he\u2018d probably be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRenamon and the others wished him good luck as Takato took him down to the arena gate. As they made their way down the beach disappeared, replaced with off all things a massive chessboard. The stone pieces at least three metres high and set-up, from what she knew of the game, with black one move away from cornering white in checkmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later the gates slid up into their slots and Growlmon came out, having to stoop to fit in the tunnel. Judging by the way he was rubbing a claw against the top of his head he\u2019d found out how low the ceiling was the hard way. Looking over to the other entrance Renemon smiled. A large treelike digimon walked out, his skin, well bark was a light brown. A crack in his trunk forming his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Woodmon, looks like Growlmon has this one in the bag. Once he finds out that Growlmon has a fire alignment he\u2019s gonna\u2019 fold faster than you can say digivolve.\u201d Laughed Rika. Renamon nodded in agreement, Woodmon were famous for their fear of fire digimon. Which was well founded after all, since they where exceptionally flammable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s Woodmon versus Growlmon. Go!\u201d As Etemon signalled the beginning of the match. Growlmon went straight onto the offensive, extending the fins on his arms and running forward, knocking over any pieces that got in his way. Which pretty much meant any that got within arms reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he approached the Woodmon ducked behind a white rook, apparently waiting for something. Whatever it was he had waited to long because Growlmon sliced through the stone structure. Missing the top of Woodmon by barley an inch. Instead of flinching the Woodmon spun and rammed his larger upper arms into Growlmon\u2019s throat, his lower pair grabbing Growlmon\u2019s arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBranch drill!\u201d Laughed the Woodmon, small spheres of glowing green energy began running from Growlmon to Woodmon. Growlmon tried thrashing but the grip on him was too strong so he angled his head downwards facing Woodmon. \u201cPyro blaster!\u201d He yelled, bright flames bursting from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the last second Woodmon swung his arms up, hitting Growlmon\u2019s muzzle and diverting the torrent of flames. Visibly frightened the Woodmon backed off, raising his arms in surrender. \u201cI knew this would happen first match. I give!\u201d He said turning and running as fast as he could towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowlmon watched him run to his gate and pound against it, yelling to be let out. He shrugged and walked to he own as the crowd began booing. \u201cIt started off well but that was a let down. Growlmon wins.\u201d Declared Etemon, \u201cAnd the next numbers are 4 and 25\u201d he finished as the gate opened and the contestants walked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it finally Reddmon's turn? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he disappeared the arena flashed white, the previous battlefield being replaced with a grassy field, an old stone house sitting atop a small hill, a quaint scene to say the least. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Again Renamon was bemused by the way the grass blew in a wind she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel, creating a beautiful wave effect. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, was it Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turn to fight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Takato, who had just returned with Guilmon. Renamon let them get to their seats then nodded to Guilmon \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better be more careful next time. You only won because all Woodmon are pyrophobics.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Guilmon cocked his head and looked at her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPyrowhatics?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked. <i> Ugh, mental note, get Guilmon a dictionary for Christmas. On second thought, he might just eat it.</i> She thought, rubbing her eyes in frustration. Henry thankfully answered for her with a lot more patience than she could have mustered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means they fear fire, so when he saw your pyro blaster attack he was terrified and forfeited.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, right\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.. Yay I got lucky.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Exclaimed Guilmon happily. Renamon shook her head and looked back to the field just as Reddmon and another digimon stepped out of their alcoves. Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s adversary was what looked similar a Gaomon, but instead of his signature boxing gloves he had a pair of metallic and futuristic looking gauntlets that had bundles of cables leading to a vest that matched his gloves, except that it had flat black panels of the back of it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo this match is Reddmon vs Heliogaomon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shouted Etemon, apparently having run out of \u00e2\u0080\u009cwitty\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarks. At Etemon's announcement Heliogaomon looked up suddenly then tensed visible, his lips pulling away from his sharp canines, his hackles rasing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, having noticed the agitated state the blue digimon was in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Currently, because of a hill between them the digimon couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see each other. But Reddmon teleported to the top of the hill only to duck down a moment later as a beam of incandescent light shot past him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou! I finally found you! Lambent shot!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled vehemently, firing off another pair of beams from the palms of his gloves, the panels on his back now glowing bright yellow.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSolar panels? Well that explains the name I guess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered Henry, almost to himself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon, watching as Reddmon dodged around another beam which etched a dark line across the hillside.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell helio means sunlight so this digimon uses light based attacks and the black panels on his back gather energy. Pretty much giving him infinite power as long as the suns out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The wolf like digimon was advancing on Reddmon now, still firing his attacks off with wild fury. With the speed the shots travelled Reddmon was struggling to keep himself from being fried, already Renamon could spot a couple of singe marks on his fur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i> Damn this sucks! </i> Thought Reddmon, dodging a pair of beams that passed by either side of him, they travelled way too fast to watch, he had to guess their trajectory by the guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements alone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He needed find out what his problem was, he seemed seriously peeved off to say the least. Reddmon rolled under another blast of light then dashed towards him, teleporting to the side to avoid another attack, as a third came at him he jumped over it, flying towards Heliogaomon, ready to tackle him. Heliogaomon raised his hands, the palms of which had large glowing circles on them, Reddmon noticed them pulse slightly then the light suddenly intensified. Reddmon was sure this meant he was about to fire so he teleported behind him and grabbed both of his arms, pushing him to the ground, using his size and weight for leverage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your problem kid? Those attacks were aimed to maim and kill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He whispered into his captive\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear, keeping a firm grip on his arms.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat! You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even remember?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He cried angrily \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna annihilate you for what you did!\u00e2\u0080\u009d As he vehemently spat that last part the panels on his back began glowing as well \u00e2\u0080\u009cSolar flash!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled, a blinding light bursting from his back and arms. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon pushed himself to his feet and stumbled backwards, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see a blasted thing, only a after image of those panels blocking his vision. \t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to make you sorry that you took one step into my village.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said a voice from somewhere to his left. Reddmon spun in that direction only to have a fist slam into his muzzle from his right. Reddmon was sent tumbling to the ground, his face throbbing dully. Hearing a low buzzing he rolled himself to the side, feeling a blast of heat as another attack flew by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon looked up to see that his vision had cleared somewhat, everything was still blurry but he could make out the building that stood on the hill. He Jumped up and teleported behind it, out of sight of his enemy. Breathing hard Reddmon rubbed his eye\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and blinked rapidly, trying to clear up his sight a bit quicker.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, hide you coward. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find you and rip your cold, black heart out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \t<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reddmon couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him head on, he had way to much firepower, and probably another trick or two up those shiny sleaves of his. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got one or two as well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered Reddmon creating an energy ball in one paw. Steadying it with the other he began pumping more power into it, causing it to swell in size like a balloon. Strangely enough it also gained a bit of weight so when he felt it was ready he really had to put his back into it to lob it over the building and hopefully towards the middle of the arena. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon pushed himself flat against the wall and covered his ears, readying for the blast, which certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disappoint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reddmon chuckled as a wave of orange light washed past him. Orionmon had been right manipulating his attacks statistics was pretty effective. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaybe I overdid it a bit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He muttered as he looked around the corner of the building, his eyes having readjusted enough to take in the damage he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Most of the arena had been reduced to scorched earth, only that which was obstructed by the building and hills was left uncharred.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold it. Where did he go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see Heliogaomon anywhere. Surely he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hit him dead on.<br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot satisfied till you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve killed the last one, eh\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon span to see Heliogaomon holding himself up against the wall with one paw, the other was aimed at him, specifically his head. As he looked at the glowing circle Reddmon noticed that his opponents arm was shaking slightly, seems like he was tiring or injured from the blast.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the last time I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what your talking about. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got me mixed up with someone else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon said truthfully.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Heilogaomon barked a course laugh then moved with surprising speed, rushing forward and grabbing Reddmon by the throat. \u00e2\u0080\u009dFour years ago you attacked my village and razed it to the ground, killing all but me. I will never forget you from that night, everything from you eyes to your scent is burned into my memory and I will <i> never </i> forgive you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The doglike digimon raised his other paw in front of Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and began putting apparently huge quantities of energy into it. Reddmon grabbed the arm holding his throat and pulled, but it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t budge, so he kneed Heiliogaomon in the chest, then as his grip loosened he stepped behind him and slammed a fist into his back, knocking him to the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m really sorry for what happened to you, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know anything about that. I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cLying basterd, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll kill you if it the last thing I\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.Ugh\u00e2\u0080\u009c With that the vengeful thought the digimon lost consciousness and fell weakly to the grass. <br>\r\n\t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reddmon stepped aside as a pair of medimon came by and inspected him, picking him up a moment later and carrying him off. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was awesome, Reddmon wins and moves onto the next round.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Announced Etemon jovially. Reddmon didn't quite share his enthusiasm, Orionmon had mentioned that he had been causing havoc before the point to which he could recall, but what Heliogaomon had described was outright murder. Was he really capable of that? After all he had beaten a few digimon up but nothing too serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reddmon slowly walked out of the arena, not particularly feelling like he should rejoin the others immediatly. If he really did that and didn't remember, what else did he do, who else did he hurt? Reddmon walked to the stairs, drawing a single claw along the stone wall as he went. He needed to talk to Orionmon about this, but not today.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She had overheard all of what Heliogaomon had said, but she was pretty sure no one else had, mainly because they were still cheering loudly. Although at the other end of their group Orionmon was also watching Reddmon leave looking saddened by something. Maybe he knew what Heliogaomon had been talking about.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next contestants were called out but neither of the numbers belonged to any of them so Renamon turned her attention to the archway that Reddmon would probably appear from, that is if he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t choose to teleport in. After a few minutes, almost double the time it took the her or others to return, Reddmon appeared from the arch, but stayed half hidden in the shadows. Something was bothering him, that much  she could tell, was he feeling guilty? Was what the blue digimon said true?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRika, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to have a look round for a while. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Renamon, excusing herself, then got up and walked up the isle between the rows of seats. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon was really wrapped up in whatever thoughts were bothering him, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even notice her until she was practically standing next to him. He was staring vaguely towards the arena frowning about something.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on your mind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked as she came up next to him. He looked at her and switched on a smile, but she could tell it was only half real.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, its nuthin\u00e2\u0080\u0098 really. So is any one fighting in this match?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The question was casual but she could tell he was just trying to change the subject. She continued scrutinizing him for a few more moments, then as if reading her mind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot working huh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said sadly, letting the smile fade.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, not really. So will you tell me what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009c<i>*Sigh*</i> You know me way to well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, just something that digimon said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout that attack on his village four years back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She offered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you heard huh? I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember doing anything like that, but then I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember all that much anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re worried you did something that will affect the way we, I, look at you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon chuckled a little. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I said you know me <i> way </i> too well already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon kissed him lightly on the cheek and hugged him firmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of cute when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re insecure. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, remember what I told you before. Everyone has come to like you for who you are know. You've stopped causing trouble and chaos so they have nothing against you, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve accepted you. And we will always be there to help you. Now c\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, lets go sit down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon let her take his paw and lead him back to the seats, sitting next to her and watching the current match come to a conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The next few matches only got tougher as the group of fighters dwindled and the weak were eliminated, Terriermon moved on by winning a close match against the Gladimon from the first round, while Guilmon lost to a Snimon, now sporting a large bandage which covered a nasty gash across his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after, Reddmon had an intense game of cat and mouse against a Ninjamon, managing to get behind him and take him out. Then Orionmon but heads with a Nanimon, literally, he head butted him into submission receiving nothing but a small bruise on his forehead. Seemed he had a harder head than even Guilmon<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, finally Renamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s number was called. She walked out into the arena, which was a now a small village that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look out of place in a rural area, a gravel road formed a path between the two entrances. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThings are really heating up now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Kyubimon fighting of against Commandramon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Kyubimon looked down the main road, at the other end stood a digimon that resembled an Agumon, except with checked navel camouflage replacing his usual orange skin, and dressed In full combat gear, including a dangerous looking assault rifle. \t<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyubimon remembered seeing this guy fight before, he used efficient military tactics to isolate, trap and neutralise his opponent, but the Frigimon he took out last round wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the best fighter, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d quickly panicked and ran headlong into an ambush.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyubimon had no intention of doing likewise so as soon as Commandramon dashed into a yard she mirrored his movements and ran into one as well. He was probably going to try to hunt her so she doubled back and snuck around to where he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d entered the town.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quickly caught his scent and began following it, when all of a sudden the trail turned into a building, a wide open window showing his path more clearly that his smell. Kyubimon squeezed inside the mid-sized opening, finding a strange satchel sitting on a table in the middle of the room. It didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t match with anything else and it was covered with Commandramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scent so he must have placed it. She cautiously moved closer and looked at it. It was wrapped in brown fabric and had a small panel with a green light on it which was flashing slowly, beeping in time. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Damn, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bomb!</i> Thought Kyubimon, her first instinct was to get out of the house as quickly as possible, but then she noticed a stubby black protrusion sticking out of the top of it. <i> So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s detonated remotely, maybe I could use it.</i> She grabbed a corner with her teeth and quietly left by the window she had come in by. Knowing that if Commandramon saw her he could easily blow her head off with this thing. She cautiously sprinted across the gravel road and nudged open a window of the adjacent house, tossing the satchel inside then closing it again. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With the trap set all she had to do was find him. Which wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that hard, she only had to walk down a few paths and within minutes a barrage of machinegun fire raked the wall in front of her. She faked a cry of surprise and turned tail, running back the way she came. After turning around a corner she spun and unleashed a dragon wheel at him as soon as he came around the corner. He managed to jump back out of the way of the torrent of blue flame but by the time he could swing his gun back around she had already continued running.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few turns later the house she had set the bomb in came to view, Kyubimon ran past it, back across the gravel road and up to the window that Commandramon had opened earlier, she then turned around to wait for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It took a few seconds for him to appear, and as soon as he saw her he swung back behind the wall, as he did she swore she saw him grin. Then in a sudden wave of force the building exploded, bricks and mortar flying in all directions. Once it stopped raining chunks of rock Kyubimon cautiously walked forward to investigate. But her worries where settled when three Medimon ran out and began digging into the wreckage, dragging out the battered form of Commandramon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSneaky, I like it. Kyubimon wins the match in a blast of glory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyubimon walked out of the arena and sighed, de-digivolving to Renamon. That win had more to do with luck than wanted to admit. She walked up the stairs and sat down in her seat between Reddmon and Rika. Rika gave her a thumbs up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood job Renamon you beat him at his own game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah that was impressive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Agreed Reddmon, smiling warmly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, hey, Takato can you please pass me some bread?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She caught the roll that was thrown to her a moment later. As she began eating the next match started, it was between Sealsdramon and a Wizardmon, which ended in a similar manner to Sealsdramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first match, with a effective stealth attack.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as she brushed the last remaining crumbs from the fur on her chest Etemon declared that the second round was over and they where now in the quarterfinals, which meant a max of three fights to go, but also the chances of her fighting one of their friends increased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up...</span></div></div>",

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve barely gotten my breath back from the last match.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moaned Renamon, getting up tiredly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, hopefully it will be an easy one.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Rika also getting up and walking with her down to the arena entrance. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Kyubimon  padded into the arena she looked around at the rocky outcroppings that thrust from virtually every surface, punctated by large crystalline formations. <i>  Seriously, who went to all the trouble of making these things. </i> Thought Kyubimon as Etemon announced that she would be facing a digimon called Shurimon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Kyubimon looked over to a cave that matched the one she had entered by, in front of it stood a digimon dressed in desert ninja attire and holding a tri-bladed shuriken in each of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s spiralled, vinelike arms and legs. Behind a matching veil glowed two yellow eyes, watching and gauging her strength as she did likewise to him, at least she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fighting an amateur.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly he disappeared in a whirlwind of leaves, which was strange because there wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any leaves around. Kyubimon snapped to her left as she heard a rustling sound slightly above her, rolling aside in time to avoid a pair of shuriken as they lodged themselves into the ground with two solid thunks. Kyubimon drew power into the tips of her tails as Shurimon landed lightly and leapt at her, the shuriken in his hands raised to be swung or possibly thrown. But Kyubimon didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give him the chance, hurling several flames at him \u00e2\u0080\u009cFox Tail Inferno!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She yelled, but Shurimon just vanished in another sudden flurry of leaves, which were set alight by Kyubimon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0There was another rustle of leaves behind her and Kyubimon only just managed to duck another spinning blade as it whirled overhead, nicking a tail and her ear. Kyubimon grunted as she felt a trickle of blood run down her head and quickly turned to her attacker. He was slowly edging towards the two shuriken which where sunk into the rock, he currently only held one more and wore a big one on his back. Kyubimon dashed forward, not wanting him to retrieve his weapons.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She tackled him to the ground, dodging a swipe from one of the blades and pinned him down with her paws. He struggled for a moment then looked her in the eyes, disappearing as another whirlwind shrouded him, but this time she was in middle of it, and she could see smaller shuriken swept up amid the leaves. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>Dammit!</i> She thought, as a small blade slashed across her back, it was a glancing strike, probably a warning of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to come, but it still stung like crazy. She poised herself to make a break for it, but as she was about to jump Shurimon resolved from the leaves, holding the bigger shuriken with both hands.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Before she could  even dodge the large plate of metal rushed towards her face. With a dull thud like a hammer hitting wood she was knocked to the ground, and as she tried to pull herself up, her vision struggling to refocus, a blackness encroaching on the edges, she saw a pair of strange, white digimon running towards her. Just before she passed out one absurd thought ran through her fading consciousness. <i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cReddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to laugh his head off\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i><br>\r\n\t <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Likewise wrapped  up in bandages. Although his were mainly around the waist, and judging by the lack of blood, probably cracked ribs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo he lost too, huh? Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon asked, exploring the dressings further, finding a nasty sore spot above her right temple. It was slightly swollen but not too bad considering she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gotten hit over the head with a chunk of plate steel.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell Orionmon, Takato and Guilmon are still upstairs, while Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the one fighting at the moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Answered Rika, as she finished they all turned as a pounding of footsteps echoed from behind a large pair of closed doors. They suddenly burst open, kicked hard from the other side by none other than Reddmon. Who ran over and smiled warmly as soon as he saw she was awake.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat happened to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked when she noticed that he was covered in thin deep cuts.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cKnife fight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d* He replied simply as a pair of Medimon came in behind him, carrying an unconscious Sealsdramon, who had similar cuts on him as well. Though he also sported a rather sizable dent in his helmet. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad to see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re finally awake, the Medimon said you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fine to leave their care soon, something about a final check-up.\" As he said this one of the mentioned digimon walked over and asked about tending to his wounds but Reddmon politely declined, saying he would be fine.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you won then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked, absently scratching at the gauze wrapped around her ear, which had began to itch like nothing else.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon nodded and pulled up a seat sitting next to Rika. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo how are you feeling, you took a pretty nasty hit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She could see the hidden concern glinting in the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be better once we get out of here and back to watching the tournament, I want to see who wins or even better, who gets the best of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, looking around the relatively large room. It was just like a regular hospital, except it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s occupants where a bit more, varied, than in the human equivalent. White walls and a white tiled floor, and an overpowering smell of disinfectant.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSure I can handle that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, turning to a passing Medimon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think my friend could be cleared to leave now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The physician digimon nodded and set the folder he was carrying on the foot of the bed, producing a small penlight, flashing it in her eyes then holding a gloved finger up and asking her it to follow it without moving her head. Satisfied he said she could go, but warned her to take it easy and avoid fights for a day or two.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Terriermon was still unconscious so Henry stayed behind with his partner. When they got back to their seats they noticed that Orionmon was gone, a quick glance into the arena revealed his location. He was fighting hand to hand, well, spike to sickle with the Snimon from Guilmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s match, and by the looks of things he was coming out on top. The forest they where fighting in mostly levelled, either sliced down or smashed apart as the competitors fought.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Renamon, now we match.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Called Guilmon, waving a claw wildly as he noticed them approach, causing Takato to duck as he was nearly hit in the head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon smiled slightly at that and sat down just as Orionmon slammed his opponant to the ground in a brutal duplex. As the Medimon came out to retrieve Snimon Orionmon disappeared and re-appeared using a portal, noticing their return.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve recovered enough to watch with us, sorry to see you lose. But don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry it\u00e2\u0080\u0098s likely one of us will get to sort him out for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said indicating Reddmon and himself. This match marked the last of the quarter finals, only one more round left till the finals, something which Etemon declared almost word for word. He also called out the numbers for the third last fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* Think RE4 Krauser vs Leon cut scene. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Which he could see through, well partially anyway, his vision was obstructed by large piles of garbage as well as various mechanical odds and ends, wrecked cars and the like. His nose stinging from the rancid smell wafting off it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDammit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0099 smell awful after this, probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get the smell out of my fur for a week. Arg, Renamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to come within ten feet of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grumbled Reddmon as he ducked under the ascending grate. Even before Etemon announced the opponents Reddmon knew he was facing off against the Shurimon from Renamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s match, he had dedicated his number to memory.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As soon Etemon did start the fight Reddmon ran as fast as he could around the edge of the arena, watching in between the mountains of trash. Glimpsing a flash of white and green he instantly changed from speed to stealth, hopping across random but solid objects like old washing machines and cracked bath tubs, making his way to a large and precarious hill made of car wrecks.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He finally got a clear view of Shurimon, who seemed to have gotten lost trying to wander through the maze of rubbish. Reddmon gently eased an iron bar out from under a pile of old chairs and tossed it against at the stack opposite to him, causing a loud clattering crash. Shurimon reactively span and threw a spinning disc at the pile, slicing a large gouge into it. Reddmon smiled as the tower of detritus slowly began to topple. Making his move Reddmon used the groan of buckling metal to mask all trace of his sound, teleporting behind Shurimon and kicking him viciously in the back, knocking him to the ground, within the shadow of the falling trash.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With another burst of foul air the heap of refuse crashed to the ground like an avalanche of moulding slime, completely covering Shurimon. <i>Ugh, maybe that was too mean.</i> Thought Reddmon as Shruimon dragged himself from under the rubbish, his white clothes stained with several smears of something he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to identify. With an angry growl Shurimon disappeared in a swirl of leaves, with several chunks of metal and old fruit swept up in the mix.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Expecting this Reddmon ducked as a blade of steel lashed out above his head, sweeping around he created an energy ball and thrust it at Shurimon, letting it explode at point blank range. Reddmon winced as his arm was caught in the blast but Shurimon took the full force of it and was sent flying into another pile of rubbish, caught in <i> another</i> tide of refuse. The Medimon appeared from nowhere and began digging for him, but Reddmon had already turned to leave, he certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t envy their job.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he got out he wiped the new layer of soot and burnt fur from his arm, and noticed for the first time the state he was in, covered in dirt, sweaty, cuts and blood stains all over his fur, and now a smell of rotten garbage. <i> What a lovely day it's been, all I need to do now is to go roll in a pig pen.</i>Bracing himself for the barrage of good natured jokes Reddmon teleported back to the others.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh man, did somebody just open a carton of year old milk or something, oh it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just you Reddmon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As he expected Terriermon was the first to take a shot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah yeah, I stink, I know. Orionmon, you usually have something for every occasion, you got any shampoo or anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While Renamon gave Terriermon a withering glare Orionmon opened a portal and put his arm into it, rummaging around for a bit and pulling out a small pale green bottle, tossing it to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to drag my match on a bit, go here to have a wash.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, getting up and opening another portal in the ground in front of Reddmon, through which the sound of moving water could be heard. As Orionmon made his way to the arena Reddmon glanced down at the bottle in his paw, quickly scanning the label.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDog wash? Oh, real cute Orionmon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called sarcastically. Everyone, even Renamon and the digimon within earshot began laughing. <i> \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did I say that out load.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> He grumbled under his breath as he stepped into the portal and landed lightly in a small forest clearing, one side taken up by a sheer rock wall, from which a beautiful sparkling waterfall fell. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Stepping into the pool that formed around the cascade Reddmon found it pleasantly warm, possibly from a nearby volcanic spring. Orionmon always did know some of the best places to rest or train. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Opening the bottle he empted half of it into his paw and began lathering it up all over his body and his tails, quickly covering all his red and white fur with a thick layer of bubbles. At least the stuff had a nice strong eucalyptus scent, powerful enough to make his nose sting slightly,  and effectively cover the smell of old decaying trash. Wading through the small pond he stepped under the waterfall and began rinsing himself off. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009dEnjoying the show?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked loudly, sensing a voyeur. Moments later Renamon dropped down from a tree, blushing deeply. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust making sure you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, um, slip or anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  She said, now looking at anything but him. Reddmon laughed and began lathering up again, concentrating on his head this time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once he had finished washing up he waded back out. Renamon had been discreetly watching him from the corner of her eye the whole time, though he would probably be doing the exact same thing if she was bathing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow how am I going to get dry before I start stinking of wet fur?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked rhetorically, materialising a pair of water balloons behind his back. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHey what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, nodding behind Renamon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked, turning and looking into the undergrowth. Looking back just in time to take a balloon to the muzzle and chest. Not particularly phased, but thoroughly soaked Renamon just wiped the excess water from her face. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks Reddmon. Now we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re both going to smell like drowned rats.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon chuckled and threw her a towel he had just metallised as he began to dry himself off.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They were both quickly dry and Reddmon no longer smelled like he had just taken a nap in a dumpster. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon lets go back, Orionmon has probably beaten his opponent to a pulp by now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Renamon, leading the way back to where the portal still hung a metre or so off the ground. They both jumped up through it landing back into the testosterone rich atmosphere of the arena. As soon as they arrived there was a cheer as Orionmon picked his opponent up, the Starmon that had beaten Terriermon, and threw him through a rock formation, similar to the first match\u00e2\u0080\u0099s environment. Battered and bloodied the Starmon was carried off by the Medimon while Orionmon walked out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that ladies and gentlemon is the last round of the semi-finals, will Reddmon please come to the field so we can watch you fight for our entertainment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Called Etemon, apparently going for something that vaguely resembled irony. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon teleported himself back to the arena entrance and began stretching for what he anticipated to be the most fun fight so far, although the bath he just had was pretty relaxing so he probably had a slight advantage, what with Orionmon getting no such break. Still he was likely to put up one hell of a fight. The arena flashed brightly again, momentarily blinding him, and when it reappeared it was a...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rika watched as both digimon walked out into the arena, which was just a flat dirt field with a large white circle painted on it. They stepped up to a pair of lines just inside the ring, waiting for the signal to start. She was pretty sure they were both totally insane, but Renamon had a thing for Reddmon and Orionmon was friendly enough, having acquired a few odds and ends she wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have been able to get otherwise, so if she could cope with Takato and his goggle head friends then she could handle these two. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon and Orionmon visibly tensed as they took up fighting stances, games faces on as Etemon began speaking. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd so we have it, after some amazing fights only Reddmon and Orionmon stand, but now we get to see which one takes the prize this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009c As soon as he finished his sentence both combatants launched themselves forward, racing towards each other. But Reddmon moved faster and he threw a flying roundhouse kick at him before Orionmon had covered even a third of the original distance between them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orionmon was ready for it and easily brushed the blow aside, slamming his open palm into Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest in return. A strike that sent Reddmon sailing backwards.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He recovered easily and landed on his feet and paws several metres back, immediately rolling to the right as a spear of fire bored into  the ground where he had been standing . Orionmon kept up the attack, launching one fiery projectile after another. Reddmon ducked and weaved, stepping around each one, several came within inches but none finding their mark.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then suddenly he disappeared. Reappearing a moment later behind and above Orionmon, holding a ball of crackling energy in his paw. He tossed it at Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back before the bulky digimon could turn round.  But only inches before it made contact a hole appeared and the sphere and flew into it. Another hole came into existence next to Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg and Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand shot out of it and took hold of him. Orionmon pulled hard and simultaneously made the hole bigger, yanking Reddmon though it and tossing him bodily across the arena.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he sailed through the air Reddmon turned and formed another pair of energy balls, hurling them in a pair of identical arcs towards Orionmon, who smiled and braced for impact. But instead of hitting him they collided right in front of the digital warrior and exploded with a thunderous blast that engulfed both him and half the arena in a cloud of thick black smoke.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon landed again and dashed into the smoke, the sounds of  heavy impacts and grunts of pain issued from within. After a few moments the concealing cloud cleared enough to reveal Reddmon and Orionmon, both locked together, each holding one of the others wrists. It was a battle of pure strength and Orionmon had the clear advantage, he shifted his stance and began to push downward and forward. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orionmon changed his grip and looked like he was about to finish it when Reddmon disappeared again, leaving Orionmon stumbling forward. Off balance and unable to block as Reddmon appeared behind him and unleashed a withering volley of smaller energy balls, quickly wreathing Orionmon in yet another cloud of thick acrid smoke. He was completely hidden by the smoke but Reddmon just started scattering the shots slightly to ensure an impact.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Suddenly the form of Orionmon appeared several metres above Reddmon, the portal he had appeared from closed in on itself as he began falling. As he gained velocity he raised his arms above his head, his arms then body became wreathed in fire and he yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cINFERNUS AXE!\u00e2\u0080\u009d at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At the sound of Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice Reddmon snapped up and leapt backwards out of the way, a second before impact. A massive pillar of fire exploded from Orionmon with enough force to send Reddmon slamming against the arena wall. Everyone watching the fight was forced to shield themselves as a blistering heat washed over them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The blaze suddenly abated revealing a panting Orionmon, he grinned widely and slowly walked from the charred crater he had created and stood with his arms across his chest. Reddmon pushed himself from the wall, revealing a Reddmon shaped outline against it, he laughed boisterously and brushed the soot and singed fur from himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In a sudden blur of motion he was in front of Orionmon standing on his paws. He must have gotten weary from the fight because the warrior digimon didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get his arms up in time and took several kicks to his chin and torso. He stumbled backwards and regained his balance only to have Reddmon teleport behind him and land a solid kick at the back of Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leg, forcing him to his knees. As he fell Orionmon made one last gesture of defiance, spinning around, his now extended spike flaming and yelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBLAZING SLASH!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sending a horizontal wave of fire towards Reddmon, who dodged under it with a backflip. Orionmon fell clumsily on his back, panting heavily while Reddmon stood back up. After a few seconds Orionmon didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get up, so apparently Etemon decided to call it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe victor and tournament winner is, Reddmon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d An uproarious cheer was raised from the crowd as they clapped and hollered and generally made a lot of noise. Reddmon walked over to his fallen opponent and crouched next to him saying something then helping him stand. The Pair then limped across the arena and out through the door Reddmon had entered by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks for coming to this year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Etemon grand cup, light class. Hope you come for the heavy weight in a few months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The digimon began to mill out of the stadium, talking about this and that. As they did Reddmon and Henry, with Terriermon came out of the stairway and began wading through the crowd.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he finally made it over to their seats Guilmon and Takato rushed over and began chattering away about Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fight, filling Terriermon and Henry in on what had happened while they where in the infirmary.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey Reddmon, where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Orionmon? We need him to get us home remember.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Noted Rika, cutting through the excited jabbering of the boys.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yeah, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dealing with Etemon now, he said we should just wait around for a bit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe better get that information about Cyberdramon, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want this to have been a total waste of time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said, turning to look at the arena, which had reverted back to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shiny metallic state.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about her, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just upset because I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whispered Renamon. Rika had about a hundred come backs to that, but she let it slide, mainly because Renamon was right. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They all sat round and talked for a while, waiting for Orionmon to arrive when there was a monstrous explosion on the other side of the arena, everyone leapt to their feet as a large portion of the walls fell in on itself. From the smoke several Commandramon and Sealsdramon emerged, sweeping the area with their guns, looking for targets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a shout one of the invaders noticed them and began firing, the seats and walls around them breaking into chunks as everyone ducked for cover.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yelled Takato over the clatter of gunfire.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cLike I know goggle head, just keep your head down before you get hit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rika snapped back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cUgh, good advice\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Orionmon as he appeared from a hole and landed on his chest with a thump, Rika noticed that in his right hand he clutched a thick manila folder. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon man get us out of here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Urged Reddmon as a fresh barrage of gunfire racked the chairs next to them, spraying them all with white foam. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orionmon complied, quickly forming a small portal which he indicated they should crawl through. Rika waited as the boys crawled through then let Renamon go after them, quickly shuffling through herself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a solid thump they landed on the grassy hill that Orionmon had dropped them off at last time. Brushing her self off Rika stood up and glared at Orionmon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was all that about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She demanded, they could have been killed, and she at least wanted to know why.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to know as well. You came way too quickly for that to have been unrelated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Henry as Terriermon climbed back onto his shoulders.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shrugging Orionmon dropped the files he was holding into a hole that appeared in front of him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot entirely sure yet, but I do know they were sent by the same people who altered Cyberdramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coding to make him become fixated on Reddmon. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need a day or two to find out more, but as far as I know they won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to enter the real world. Yamaki dealt with that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been talking to Yamaki?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Takato, who seemed to get along best with the creep. Rika hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trusted him an ounce since the day they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d met. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, smart guy but not exactly polite, almost condescending really.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rika smiled at the digimon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, another brownie point for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0099 let me read those files then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Reddmon casually.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Orionmon shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo real point, most of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just raw info and half of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incomplete, as I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have it all organized soon, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to head off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, waving and turning to step into a new portal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by the way. Reddmon do you want me to get you something in return for your prize money?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon scratched his head and went through some sort of mental checklist.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMight as well get me some hardware, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m running short of the usual stuff, and maybe anything else that you think would catch my eye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to get all that as soon as possible. See you later everyone, hope you enjoyed yourself today.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, disappearing as usual. After a few moments everyone said good bye and walked off to their respective homes, leaving Renamon and Rika alone. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what do you  think Renamon, we haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been in it this deep since the D-Reaper incident.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika as she began walking in the general direction of their house. Renamon followed close behind still visibly unnerved by the sudden attack, probably expecting another despite Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assurance that it was unlikely. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure this isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as big as the D-Reaper, but whoever want\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reddmon obviously has some impressive resources to throw around. And I guess I want\u00e2\u0080\u00a6. I want to protect him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftie.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She chuckled as they turned onto the road that lead directly home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon woke up the next morning stiff as hell, that tournament had been great fun, especially with Renamon and the others there, but he had taken a thorough beating. He tenderly touched his chest, exploring a huge bruise where Orionmon had thumped him. Luckily his thick chest fur hid the darkened patch so nobody would be the wiser.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pushing himself up Reddmon groaned as his shoulder throbbed dully. Rubbing his aching muscles he walked into the kitchen, opened the fridge and took out a few spare bread rolls that Takato had given him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he chewed on them he sat down at the kitchen table and materialized his record player and CD\u2019s. Searching through them he found one of interest, then after turning it on he got up and retrieved some butter for the bread, spreading it on them as he listened.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon planned to ask Renamon out on a date this evening so he wanted to practice a bit before he went out and begin planning the night in detail. Which he was determined to make as romantic as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A few hours later he had indeed gotten several great ideas and was feeling rather pleased with himself, but the sun had gone down so it was almost time to get going. Before he left he went through a mental checklist, sort of \u201cfeeling\u201d any objects he had stored to make sure he grabbed what he wanted when he needed it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cRight here goes nothing.\u201d He muttered walking out the front door and closing it behind him. A short trip later he was looking over the Nonaka\u2019s place.\u00c2\u00a0On one side of the well groomed garden there was a tree across a pond, from which he planed to \u201clure\u201d out his \u201cprey\u201d. Since he was going to use music that was the best place, as it was near Rika\u2019s bedroom yet the rooms in which her grandmother and mother slept where both rather far away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon would probably sense him soon so he had to act fast. Teleporting into the tree he sat down on a relatively unobstructed branch and materialised a pair of lanterns with paper shrouds, lighting the candle in each and hanging them on either side of him, so that he was softly illuminated with a warm, orange light.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Satisfied Reddmon created his instruments of choice, a pair of spheres humming with energy, after doing a quick tune up as quietly as he could Reddmon began playing one of the songs he had taught himself, loud enough for someone nearby to hear but soft enough for anyone else to dismiss it as a radio or something of the like.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Almost immediately after he started light in Rika\u2019s (and presumably Renamon\u2019s) room blinked on, casting a pair of shadows against the sliding rice paper door. It slid open to reveal a bemused Renamon and a groggy looking Rika. Renamon whispered something to her partner who whispered something back, smiled then disappeared back inside. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon stepped outside and quietly slid the door closed behind her. The light inside was extinguished a moment later. Reddmon changed his tune as she walked around the pool and jumped up to sit next to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo that\u2019s what you warned Guilmon not to talk about, hmm?\u201d She said, laughing softly as she watched him and the spheres. \u201cC\u2019mon I know a much quieter place.\u201d Reddmon had looked throughout the day but didn\u2019t find anything suitable so he nodded and followed her as she leapt from the tree and began travelling downtown. Reddmon followed, jumping from lamppost to lamppost, following close behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She quickly reached the forest but didn\u2019t slow down until they passed a old dilapidated house.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Renamon you heading anywhere in particular?\u201d He called as he ran across the shack\u2019s veranda, noticing the smell of old rotten wood and dead animals.<br>\r\n  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry it\u2019s nearby, I just use this place as reference.\u201d She jumped back into the cover of the trees and he put on a bit more speed to keep up, he was about to ask how she found this place when she abruptly stopped, standing on a thick branch, waiting for him to catch up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As he came up next to her he chuckled at Renamon\u2019s sense of romance. The tree they stood in was the last for quite a while, mainly because it stood on the edge of a sharp cliff. The moon had emerged from behind the horizon and was reflecting off the expansive field of green below them, which swayed gently in a breeze, an ocean of movement and life.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNice. So you must wander around a lot?\u201d He asked as he created another pair of energy balls, picking one of the slower more melodic tunes he had picked up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYes, after we dealt with D-reaper and managed  to get back to this world things have been a bit slow. Besides it pays to know ones surroundings down to the last detail. Anyway, I\u2019m surprised something so destructive could make such a beautiful sound.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou talking about me or these.\u201d  He joked nodding to the pulsing balls of power. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s seems like you\u2019ve gone to a fair bit of effort to impress me.\u201d She chuckled creating a paw full of diamond shards and lifting them aloft with a smooth gesture. Reddmon watched entranced as they floated up in front of the night\u2019s radiant moon, glittering as they began slowly spinning.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSeems like I\u2019m not the only one who\u2019s been pursuing artistic hobbies.\u201d Chuckled Reddmon. Renamon shrugged and smiled as she began guiding the crystals in and impressive aerial ballet.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After several minutes Renamon launched them towards the moon and watched them reach the top of their arc then slowly fall, diving into the trees below.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat do you think the chances are that you just killed someone.\u201d Noted Reddmon, surprised by Renamon\u2019s slightly careless action.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOh no!\u201d Gasped Renamon, paling slightly. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that, I\u2019ll be back in a moment.\u201d She disappeared and Reddmon smiled, taking this chance to rematerialise the basket that held the boxed dinners he\u2019d picked up from a nice place in town.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAll clear, thank goodness. Oh, thanks.\u201d Reported Renamon as she reappeared on the branch and took the offered meal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As they ate they began talking about various subjects, including what they wanted from life and what they thought their purpose in said life was. Reddmon was surprised to hear that until relatively recently Renamon\u2019s only goal was to become the strongest and to digivolve to as high a level as she could, much like himself really. But due to meeting Rika, initially a means to an end, she slowly become protective of her new friends, and now Reddmon. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cAhem! Er, shall we go home then?\u201d Asked Reddmon with a cough, slightly pleased yet simultaneously unnerved by Renamon\u2019s similarities and differences to himself. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMight as well, do you mind if I stay with you tonight.\u201d She asked, smiling at him somewhat coyly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure, c\u2019mon.\u201d He flipped down to the ground and took off at a run, following their scent from earlier.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? Why don\u2019t we just walk for a while.\u201d Reddmon jinked aside as Renamon whispered into his ear, he expected her to be close but not right next to him. Sliding to a halt he let Renamon pull up next to him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They began walking at a more relaxing pace and Renamon took them off the path they\u2019d come by, though she assured him that they would get home before midnight. As they walked they began talking again idly moving from around in a lazy route between the trees. At one point Reddmon materialized an army knife he had gotten somewhere, he didn\u2019t quite remember who he\u2019d took it from but it had a nice vicious look to it. Tossing it into the air and catching it by the opposite end. They eventually heard the sound of running water, which as it was on their way turned out to be the very waterfall Reddmon had bathed in the other day, which disturbed Reddmon that Orionmon seemed to have the whole area scouted out so well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Shortly after they passed the waterfall Reddmon began tossing the knife into trees along their path, being well crafted it flew straight and lodged itself into the target trunk with little effort.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMay I have a try?\u201d Asked Renamon, who had been watching the flight of the knife as they walked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSure.\u201d He said as he handed it to her, handle first. \u201cJust hold it loosely in the palm of your..\u201d <i>*Thock*</i> The knife embedded itself several inches into a trunk seven metres away. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOkay so seems like you\u2019ve done this before.\u201d Reddmon muttered half to himself as Renamon laughed and gave him a wonderfully enticing smile<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYou should see what I can do with a katana or some shuriken.\u201d She chuckled, yanking the thrown blade from it\u2019s tree.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Deciding to make her put her money where her muzzle was Reddmon produced said weapon and passed to her. Which elected another lovely laugh, and in a blur of motion all the tree blanches in the vicinity fell to the ground in almost perfect synch. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cOk, that\u2019s impressive. You do have a lot of free time don\u2019t you.\u201d He said as she reappeared and sheathed the sword with a sharp. <i>*klack*</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhen you have it it\u2019s best to do something useful with it.\u201d She replied, offering him the sword.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNah you keep it, it suits you.\u201d True enough, the yellow of the scabbard was only a half tone darker than her fur, something that was by no means accidental.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0She smiled at him again, a look he was really beginning to enjoy. As she readjusted the strap to place the sword over her shoulder they jumped out of the thick layer of diced foliage Renamon had created and within half a hour they where back within the city limits. Managing to get themselves in a brawl with a couple of punk teenagers harassing a group of young women.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWell that was fun, we should patrol the streets more often.\u201d Chuckled Renamon as she sat on the couch, resting her paws on the pommel of the her new sword. Reddmon nodded in agreement then sat down an the couch as well. It was getting late and Reddmon could tell by the way her grip was slightly loose that Renamon was as tired as he was. After a bizarre recounting of previous misadventures they\u2019d had, both in and out of the digital world, Renamon yawned and excused herself for the night, going up to the bedroom she\u2019d used previously. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon smiled broadly, congratulating himself on an almost perfect evening. He fell soundly asleep wondering what he should plan for next time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon woke slowly the next morning, almost not registering the weight on his chest as he was about to stretch. At some point during the night Renamon had snuck down stairs and sat down next to him, laying against his chest. It was amazing she hadn\u2019t woken him up, he was usually a light sleeper. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Then he noticed the table. It was about one grenade shy of collapsing under the weight of the military gear that had been heaped upon it, rocket launchers, machine guns, both light and heavy, as well as many cases of various grenades. how Orionmon got it on there without waking them he would never know. Reddmon could usually get enough stuff to keep himself amused for a while, either by black market or theft methods, but Orionmon always had the best weapons, and would never let on about his source. He had asked Orionmon to get him things in the past, but this time he\u2019d surpassed himself, it looked like he had given him more than his moneys worth, but then again he\u2019d probably be needing most of it soon anyway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He was tempted to go through it and get it all sorted and stored but staying where he was at the moment was pretty tempting as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began quietly inspecting things, dropping them into his other space in logical groupings, ready to be grabbed at a moments notice.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Eventually Reddmon came across something he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize. It was a gun, that much he knew, but it was like nothing he had ever seen before, it had the basic shape of an automatic rifle, closely resembling a P90, with the exception that instead of a barrel it had a large pair of electrodes jutting from it as well as wires all over. <br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome kind of supercharged tazer maybe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> He thought to himself, putting it somewhere near the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop\u00e2\u0080\u009d so he would remember to try it out later.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Just as he put the last grenade away he heard Renamon stir then yawn.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing down there Reddmon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust sorting through some things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cRight.

Renamon giggled and began walking off in a seemingly random direction, but Reddmon noted that if they walked straight ahead they would eventually reach the school.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not used to being away from Rika for extended periods are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked as he jogged to catch up to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperience has taught me that weird things tend to happen to the three of them, so we make sure that at least one, preferably two of us are with them most of the time.

Meet me at my place, the portal is behind you. I should the information we need soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sure enough a gaping black hole had appeared a metre behind them, waiting. Renamon motioned for Reddmon to hand her the phone for a moment.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOrionmon could you bring Rika along as well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay just hurry through. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With an explosion and a curse Orionmon hung up. And with a shrug between them they stepped into Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Half an hour earlier <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOrionmon dropped himself down at the very edge of the military complex that was supposedly containing the information on the person trying to take Reddmon out. Crouching low he snuck up to the chain link fence, creating a hole through it and dashing up to a large concrete bunker. It was daytime so he had to get inside before he was spotted, the further he got before that happened the better.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAccording to his sources he would find a hatch in the building that would lead him to a underground facility in which he could follow a map leading to a file room with info on test subject targets and all sorts of other useful intel, apparently it was a hard copy backup room, far apart from where anything really important took place. Which made it ideal for him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tMoving over to the thick steal door he listened for a moment and heard the muffled voice of a guard talking which meant that there was at least two digimon inside at the moment. He wrenched open the door and charged in, storming towards a Gabumon in the centre of the room. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs he entered the guessed pair of digimon span towards him the other digimon, a Koemon, quickly reached down to grab a phone like device at his hip. Only to have Orionmon sweep his forearm round and knock him to the ground with a sharp crack of skull on concrete. The slower one, the Gabumon faired no better as Orionmon kept the momentum going, taking a step past Koemon and grabbing the furred digimon by the neck, punching him once in the face then dropping him unconscious to the floor.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrunts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered Orionmon disdainfully as he looked to the hatch that took up a large amount of floor space, though that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0098t say much. The building itself was rather large and seemed to function as a barracks most of the time, being stuffed with bunk beds. Which kind of made sense, during the night the barracks would be full and during the day the whole place was being patrolled. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith a sharp twist Orionmon opened the hatch, and by the sounds of it, stripped gears that would be used to open or close it, either automatically or remotely. Hopping  down into it Orionmon found himself in a hallway with a steel grate floor and riveted iron walls<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009cHomey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> He thought wryly as he checked the room he wanted respective to his current location.  Left, straight twice, right, another straight, left then three doors down. Setting off at a run Orionmon made the first left turn then crashed headlong into a pair of digimon, a Commandramon and a Gaurdromon. The Commandramon was sent sprawling by the impact but the champion digimon held up better, merely stumbling back a few steps. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs soon as he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognise who Orionmon was he slapped his hand against a red button attached to the wall, which Orionmon noted were set up at regular intervals. As soon as the button was pressed a shrill klaxon sounded out and a recorded message began declaring that there was an intruder in area 5. Orionmon slammed his spike across the Gaurdromon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, knocking him out of the way and out of the fight then gave the Commandramon a kick to the chest as he brought up his rifle, the huge steel shoe sending him tumbling down the hall. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOrionmon heard the sound of pounding footsteps behind him and set off again, this made things harder but far from impossible, after all he just had to get the files he wanted then he could make his own escape path, no need to worry about being cornered.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs he made it down the straights he slid to a halt and looked behind himself just in time to see a group of Gaurdromon launching a salvo of missiles as they pursued him. Taking this chance Orionmon pulled a Reddmon and grabbed a smoke grenade from a small portal pulling the pin then dropping it as the projectiles rushed towards him. Just as the missiles were about to hit the grenade went off and filled the junction with thick dark gas. \tRolling to the side he heard the missiles rush past and detonate further down. He pushed himself back to his feet and dashed down the hall.  That would have bought him a few seconds as they figure out which way he went. But he still couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hang around, it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be long before lieutenants or higher class digimon arrived to give him grief. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tNaturally as soon as you think about the worst case scenario it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll immediately happen. At the next corner he had to turn looked right, the way he had to go then left, to make sure no one was sneaking up behind him, and low and behold a Devimon was sneering at him from halfway down the hall. He was definitely not a basic trooper so he was probably going to take time to deal with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith a small grin Orionmon got an idea about how to move on quickly. As a security measure regular teleportation such as what Reddmon and Renamon used wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work, although his portals were unhindered. So with a flourish he opened a pair that were linked to each other on either side of the Devimon, essentially creating an infinite loop. Orionmon heard the Devimons roar of frustration then ran the other way.  He was nearly there just down this hall when suddenly a squad of Commandramon came around the far corner, he could see the door he needed, but even if he made it without getting mowed down he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough time to search.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe quickly turned to the wall and rammed a spike in between two plates of iron that made up the walls, levering them apart. As the Commandramon rapidly took up firing positions Orionmon used his bare hands to tear the metal from its mountings with a horrible tortured screech. Just as he braced it against his shoulder the floor and walls not obscured by his makeshift shield where lit up with a hundred sparks and bullets ricochets. He needed to call Reddmon quick and this seemed like good a time as any.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tTossing a dissuasive grenade down both directions of the hall Orionmon got his phone out. A quick conversation later and Reddmon and Renamon where at his place, he tossed another pare of explosives at the advancing enemies then called Rika.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHi Rika sorry to call you at such short notice but Renamon and Reddmon are at my place and we might need your help soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on are? you under attack, your not gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0099 get us shot are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa ha ha. No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not home and no one but me is in danger. But Renamon asked me to bring you along, would you be able to go through the portal behind you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in class or something?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked suspiciously.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have checked that first. Your at lunch and you went for a walk by yourself in the forest, now could you please get in the portal, I really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spare much more time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOkay, okay, no need to get pushy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She hung up and Orionmon sensed her walking through the pathway and arriving at his sanctuary. Satisfied he got rid of the phone and took out a rocket launcher. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t usually this blunt but he needed speed more than finesse.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBracing himself he shot an explosive round down in the other direction. Which hit the ground at the junction and exploded with enough force to bring down part of the ceiling, ceasing his worries from that direction. Feeling the gunfire cease momentarily Orionmon dropped the launcher and pulling out a small wad of a clay like substance. He grabbed the steel plate and slapped the substance against it, picking it up and spinning, throwing it with everything he had down the hall like a oversized shuriken. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith a cry of alarm the digimon leapt out of the way as the large scrap of metal lodged itself into the wall, at which point he took out the detonator for the wad of C4 he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d stuck to the metal and pressed it. With a rush of heat and a blast of noise that hall caved in as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSatisfied that he had a few minutes at least Orionmon jogged to the door he needed and used his spikes to rip that open as well, revealing a room literally lined with filing cabinets. Moving up to the first one he noted that they were all alphabetised. So logically R for Reddmon was the first place to look. And with a quick search he found a file marked with Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe was about to send it to a table he had set up in his sanctuary for the others when he noticed a small square of paper clipped to the top of  it. It read, see Cyberdramon. Guessing it was linked for a reason he quickly found the C section and then Cyberdramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s file, which actually had another attached to it. The one that was apparently related indirectly to Reddmon was labelled \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Crystal Project Top Secret.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Definitely worth reading. Sending them to his place with the other Orionmon turned to make sure no one would sneak into the portal behind him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Orionmon stepped back quickly. The doorway was, blocked. He had left it open to the tarnished metal hall outside, but now the door was concealed by a wall of dark smoke, blacker than even the grenades he used and perfectly flush with the door. But that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the strangest thing, it seemed to radiate evil, a malignance like none he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever sensed before.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs if sensing his fear a pair of blood red eyes coalesced within the darkness, followed by a large, grinning of set of teeth, canine judging by the shape. As Orionmon backed away s the dark face slowly became three dimensional like it was pushing through the smoke, defiantly canine. Spinning, Orionmon opened a portal and dove through it. Not seeing a trio of jet black diamond like objects shot from the smoke and follow Orionmon into his portal. As it closed a deep harsh laughter rang out through the empty room, a laugh full of the intent to cause suffering and anguish.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was three of them, each with a different name printed neatly on the top right hand corner. He passed Rika the one with Cyberdramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, to Renamon his own and kept the one with the enigmatic name of black crystal project, which was apparently top secret.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He began quickly scanning through page after page of stuffy science talk taking in maybe three fourths of it. Nothing in his file was even related to him, why did Orionmon bother to get it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I hope you guys got some better stuff than me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He sighed as he closed the folder and put it back on the table. Who knows, maybe Orionmon could explain it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s significance when he got here. With even less warning than the first another portal came into existence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell speak of the devil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered Reddmon as Orionmon stumbled into the clearing. He straightened himself up and smiled at them, only to have his smile freeze a second later and then quickly contort into a grimace of pain as he doubled over, revealing three large spikes of some dark material sticking out of his back. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the portal closed behind him he fell to his knees, Renamon and Rika stepped forward to try and help him but Reddmon felt a twinge of regret as he motioned for them to stay back. According to the file he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d read those crystals were a perfected version of something called a black gear. A controlling device used to manipulate digimon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wrong Reddmon? We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to help him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon taking another step closer, just as Orionmon roared in pain and exploded into a crimson red blaze, still visible through the distorting heat. At least that solved one problem.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOrionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s be infected by the same thing as Cyberdramon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained to the tamer and her partner. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThose crystals are going to double his strength, at least. Not to mention making him obsessed with a single objective, probably destroying me. Damn here we go..\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Reddmon trailed off into silence as the fire that surrounded Orionmon began darkening, quickly becoming a patch black flame that scorched the ground around him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon and Rika gasped as they noticed the trees around them begin to rot, the leaves falling from their perch, many of them dissolving mid air, the rest forming a thin layer of fowl smelling mulch. Trees began twisting into gnarled shapes, the weaker of them falling to the ground to join their lost foliage. All of them forming a skin of ugly looking fungus, a horrible mottled material that spread it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tendrils up and around the branches, glistening with seeping fluids. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The whole place looked like something out of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nightmare, endless death and decay, with the huddled form of his friend in the centre. With a grunt of pain the crystals on Orionmon withdrew into his back and he slowly straitened himself up again, his eyes no longer the bright green, instead they were a baleful red, practically glowing with anger.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing that there was no talking there way out of this one Rika took out her digivice and a card from the deck strapped to her hip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReady Renamon? Speed activate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a blur Renamon disappeared from sight, dashing around Orionmon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cRenamon wait, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be so easy to beat this time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called dashing forward to help her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As Renamon reappeared behind Orionmon he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even look back, with a growl he quickly drew his arm back, elbowing Renamon hard in the chest and sending her tumbling into the muck lining the small clearing, before he could even call out her name he realised he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d bumbled into Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reach and took a fist to the jaw a second later. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rolling to his feet and teleporting backwards Reddmon created an energy ball and called out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make me do this Orionmon, if you can hear me fight it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He tossed the sphere straight at Orionmon and grimaced as it hit him square in the face and detonated. <i>Seems like he can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use his portals, or at least doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plus at least.</i> <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As the remnants of the explosion faded away Reddmon blanched, that attack would have usually knocked Orionmon off his feet, but those things had increased his toughness a hell of a lot, he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even moved let along shown any signs of pain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would certainly qualify as bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Groaned Reddmon as Orionmon drew back his arm again, except this time it was wreathed in that dark flame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled  as Orionmon launched his attack, not at him but at Rika. Teleporting next to her and grabbing her by the waist he, with some difficulty, managed to move them both several metres to the side as Orionmon unleashed his attack. It was his fire pike alright, but as it rushed passed it seemed more like a freight train, several times larger than usual and mush more cohesive it bored a trench into the ground and incinerated a path through the trees.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYep, that certainly qualified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Rika somewhat shakily, probably not used to having such destructive attacks aimed at her. Renamon suddenly appeared next to them, still a bit dazed from the blow she took.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon you better digivolve, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll need strength more than speed to take him down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, pulling out his digivice and a blue card he kept for emergencies. Ignoring their looks and gasps of surprise Reddmon swiped it through and quickly digivolved to, sans montage.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuit staring and digivolve already.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He snapped as he flexed his claws, waiting for her help to attack.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut how did you? Where did y..\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stuttered Rika, like she was the only person to have a digivice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explain later alright, but we really have more pressing matters don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t cha\u00e2\u0080\u0099 think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He sighed, jerking his chin towards Orionmon who had been staring ruthfully at them the whole time and certainly wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be polite enough to keep doing it for long.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon had been giving him a suspicious but no less disturbing look since he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken out his digivice but said nothing and nudged Rika, nodding for her to proceed. In a flash Renamon was replaced not with Kyubimon but her ultimate form, Taomon. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce we cleanse him of those evil influences you will owe us an explanation Reddmon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stated Taomon, clearly not happy with him having secrets. he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably have to reveal Redd/ Holt as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ViralReddmon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He corrected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we can, short of deleting him, apparently that was a weakness of the previous versions, they could be destroyed without killing the host. Which tended to leave the victim pissed and wanting revenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the plan then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell first we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\u00e2\u0080\u00a6got to get the hell out of here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled as he saw Orionmon lifting his arms for his infernus axe attack, and judging by the boost his other attack had gotten he would raze a huge area to the ground.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He quickly scooped up Rika in his arms and began running full pelt through the trees, his champion form making it much easier than as a rookie. But he slid to a halt and nearly dropped Rika as Taomon appeared in front of him. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you doing, move.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He urged as she calmly raised her arms, the long sleaves of the robes she wore sliding up to reveal her paws. Reddmon looked behind him to see Orionmon slam his arms to the ground, a huge wave of all consuming black fire rushed in all directions. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAw nuts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered Reddmon as it came towards them, showing no sign of slowing.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalisman spell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A dome of white light spread from Taomon as a ying,yang symbol appeared beneath them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCould you let me down now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika from her rather uncomfortable position on his shoulder, probably not enjoying the edges of his armour. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when were you going to tell me about that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked as the flame washed over them, not even changing the internal temperature. Instantly regretting his choice of words as they gave him a withering stare.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I said I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll explain everything later okay, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry I kept secrets from you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He assured them as the wave of flame suddenly withdrew into itself, becoming a brilliant white ball of light with the changing Orionmon in the center. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh great He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s digivolving. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all we need a super charged Savagemon. I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to go on the offensive.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With a nod of agreement Taomon dropped the barrier around them and moved forward, lightly hopping from rotting tree to rotting tree. Moving faster ViralReddmon ran through the muck, making his way around Savagemon, who was still howling at the sky, the last of the flames dying out. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Taomon pulled, of all things, a giant brush from the folds of her robes and drew a symbol in mid air, quite literally as the symbol stayed there as if it where drawn on invisible parchment. Reddmon was about to call out to her, asking what she was doing when the symbol glowed and a beam of brilliant white light burst from it and hit Savagemon. Clearly damaging him. Savagemon roaring in pain and raised his arms and axes in front of him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Seeing an opening ViralReddmon jumped from the thick filth around his feet. The beam of light cutting off a second before he passed into it, with a sweeping motion ViralReddmon brought his leg round and kicked Savagmon hard across the face, appearing a second later behind him and grabbing him by the neck, slamming him to the ashen ground. Moving backwards again he dodged aside another beam of light that Taomon hit Savagmon with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pushing himself to his feet, ignoring Taomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack completely, he turned to ViralReddmon, growling and taking a step out of the blaze of light. With another bestial yell he threw one of the thick bearded weapons. ViralReddmon ducked under the blade, which for some reason exploded when it hit a tree. They weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting anywhere, they were faster than him but it was only a matter of time, Savagemon charged forward wielding his remaining axe two handed, before got a solid blow and killed one of them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cTaomon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called, dodging back from the crazed berserker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s swings. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou got any ideas?\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cCan you digivolve any higher?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked stepping in-between them and blocking the axe with her brush.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell yeah of course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand around. Do it now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes sir.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said with mock salute, pulling his digivice out and swiping another blue card. With a second boost of power a pair of leathery black wings formed from cracks in the armour on his back, stretching to full span, which was about a metre and a half each side. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWings? Is that it? You grow a pair of wings?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika disbelievingly. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0DeviReddmon glanced over at her, <i> Fine then smart aleck.</i> He thought, moving high speed around Taomon and in front of Savagemon kneeing him in the gut then grabbing him by the throat and tossing him back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Savagemon landed hard on his back, losing his other axe in the fall, which DeviReddmon swiftly scooped up and threw far into the distance. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo still think I just <i>\u00e2\u0080\u009dgrew wings\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i>, eh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He called to Rika, who had stepped up beside Taomon, who calmly pointed behind him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Following the finger but expecting a charging Savagemon DeviReddmon was surprised to see him standing where he was thrown, glaring at them with pure hatred. <i> That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weird. every time I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen Savagemon he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attacked relentlessly, never stopping until the target stops moving, if their lucky.</i><br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, cool looks like where going to get to see Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ultimate form.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Commented DeviReddmon as he backed away, Savagmon had begun to exude power from himself, distorting his shape.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you crazy? His champion form was enough trouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yelled Rika angrily. At the sound of Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice the energy cut out, Orionmons ultimate form coming into focus. warriors </span></div></div>",

You got any info on him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked not taking his eyes of their new opponent.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGimme a sec\u00e2\u0080\u0098. Yeah, got it, according to this his name is Bushidomon, a vaccine digimon who stands by the old codes of honour and has a devastating dragon king slice attack. How do you think we should take him on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She replied, shuffling through the cards she had. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh here we go, this might work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let you ladies lead then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon said with a bow, ducking under a blade as Bushidomon dashed forward. He was much faster than Orionmon or Savagmon but still not in the same league of either of them. But on the other hand he probably had endurance and strength that they would struggle with.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDeviReddmon rolled to the side as another sword rushed past his head and was quickly followed by a sandaled foot which missed him by inches and smashed a large hole into the ground. Flipping to his feet as a sword slid into the dirt where his head had been DeviReddmon teleported behind him and tried to sweep kick Bushidomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs from under him but he blocked with his other sword and drew the first back for a killing strike.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSkullmeramon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tA long pair of thick chains whipped out of nowhere and wrapped around Bushidomon, strapping his arms to his body. Not missing a beat DeviReddmon lunged at him, knocking him to the ground and further pinning him with his own weight, as Bushidomon glared up at him with those glowing eyes DeviReddmon cocked his fist and slammed it into the side of Bushidomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s helmet which jerked to the side with a resounding clang. Pulling his other arm back he swung again and again until, with a primal roar Bushidomon flexed his arms and shattered the chain, throwing DeviReddmon off in a rain of broken metal links.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tThrown back, DeviReddmon landed on his paws and knees, sliding backwards in the sludge of decaying leaves, which he just noticed had stained his fur, armour and to a lesser extent Taomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s robes. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tWith not even the slightest signs of pain, discomfort or disorientation Bushidomon pushed himself to his feet, even though his helmet was covered in dents and must surely be ringing like a church bell at a wedding.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t phase him much, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m out of ideas, how about you two?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, taking a final search through her cards. By the look of things Bushidomon was about to go on back on the offensive not a fun proposition. And they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even seen his special attack yet. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDeviReddmon had one attack he was sure would work, but it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t something he wanted to use on a friend. No matter what the circumstances. With a threatening growl Bushidomon changed his stance, holding his swords with the point backwards and the blades out. Without further warning Bushidomon dashed towards him one sword held back the other forward, almost ninja style. With a spinning motion he slashed at DeviReddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chest the first missing but the second and third found gaps in his armour and drew blood, as Bushidomon brought up his leg to knee him in stomach DeviReddmon brought up his own and pushed off it, launching him out of the way of a final rising slice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalisman of light!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Yelled Taomon as she drew said symbol mid air, a blast of light stopping Bushidomon from pursuing DeviReddmon before he could land.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tBushidomon glanced at Taomon menacingly, raising both swords above his head then slamming them, point down deep into the ground. Both swords began to glow brightly and a pattern of straight burning lines began to snake out from the point the swords penetrated the ground. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDamn, this must be that dragon king slice. I need to end this now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Muttered DeviReddmon as a pulse of raw power washed out across the glowing hieroglyph like markings that now reached out past where Rika stood, which meant she would be caught in it too.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tDeviReddmon gathered all his energy into his right paw and began running towards Bushidomon as another pulse passed underneath them, then another, quicker this time and defiantly brighter. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much time and this would be all or nothing too. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tLeaping into the air DeviReddmon pushed all the energy into a ball, then forced that into a short blade. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t big but it could cut through anything and corrupted data on a massive scale, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d taken out megas with it in one strike.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDark blade!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Bellowed DeviReddmon as he crashed into the kneeling Bushidomon, his attack effortlessly passing through armour and flesh alike. With a single grunt that sounded more surprised than anything else they tumbled to the ground, the glyphs on the ground swiftly retracting and dissipating.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tDeviReddmon pulled the blade from his fallen friend and dispersed it back into his body just as Bushiomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s red eyes faded back to green. The fight was over.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith and sigh Bushidomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s form was momentarily blurred as a flurry of data code unravelled from him, leaving Orionmon on his back with a dark edged knife wound in his chest.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coughed Orionmon, trying to push himself to a sitting position but groaning and falling back as the just de-digivolved Renamon and Rika ran up next to them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you apologizing for? I just sign <i> and enforced </i> your death warrant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d DeviReddmon chuckled, waving off his friends apology. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, this is the last of the information *cough hack cough* on the person trying to do you in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, wiping the blood he coughed up off his hand then plucking a folder from a hole and giving it to him. \u00e2\u0080\u009dAnd you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll probably need this to *hack cough*, sorry about that, get home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He finished pulling out a digi-modify card and handing that to him as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe warriors path? Cute, I guess it opens one of your portals back to the real world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGot it in one. Sorry if I hurt any of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon Orionmon stop talking like there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no tomorrow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Rika, crouching next to him and wincing as she saw the darkness around the wound spreading visibly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHa ha, *cough cough* me and Reddmon both know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He chuckled, his body becoming sort of pixilated for a moment before regaining form.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook Reddmon, be careful in the next few days. Your life is still in danger, as is those of your new friends, I was the first but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll begin using them against you soon. I hope we meet again, I enjoyed your friendship.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His body blurred up again, but this time it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recover, he broke up into thousands of cubes which floated apart from each other then faded away.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cUm, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry to be insensitive, but aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we stuck here now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon laying an paw gently on his shoulder. Reddmon watched the last bits of data disappear before answering.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Orionmon was clever like that, he built in several failsafe into this place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d So this was what it was like to lose a friend. It sucked like hell. He was going to find who caused this and crush them with everything he had, make them pay dearly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAhh! Reddmon!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked up from his tightly clenched paw to see Rika pointing towards the edges of the horizon. Which had began to pixilate just as Orionmon himself had.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just this world collapsing because Orionmon can no longer maintain it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry? How is that meant to allay our fears.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon disbelievingly, turning around to find that the whole realm was collapsing around them, revealing a black void.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause any living beings that Orionmon tags upon entry are deposited where they entered should he be deleted, as I said fail safes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained, watching as the nothingness approached, he knew they where safe but watching that approach was kind of unnerving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, Reddmon, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard rumours that powerful digimon, when deleted are reborn again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Renamon giving his shoulder a squeeze. She was trying to make him feel better, that was nice of her, at least they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hate him for deceiving them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah I know, but when that happens your personalty might be maintained but all knowledge and skills are lost, even if I manage to find him <i> and </i> befriend him again it will be years before he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a challenge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOne track mind, you delete him and all you can think about is when you can meet him in combat again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She chuckled, rapping a knuckle across his head. Reddmon was desperately trying to come up with a comeback when suddenly everything went black. Well more like the black swallowed everything. He blinked to try and refocus but everything was simply replaced with a forest, one that he quickly recognised as the exact place Orionmon had picked them up from this morning.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going home to look through those files some more, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call you if I come up with something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon said, noticing for the first time that Rika wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t with them, then he remembered that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t with them when they entered so she would have appeared somewhere else.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cReddmon. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry that you lost a friend today, if only for a while, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything reckless okay, call Rika and myself if you intend to go hunting for the culprit. <i>We can and will help you.</i>\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said putting emphasis on the last statement.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, reckless I may be, but stupid I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not. I just need time to plan, I\u00e2\u0080\u0098ll see you tomorrow, oh and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell the guys, okay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d With that he teleported out of there, quickly making his way home. He was sure she was worried about him, hell he would be if she lost Rika. But he was also sure she had enough respect to leave him alone for a few hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tHe was shortly at the abandoned house he called home and had let himself in, realizing for the first time that he was still in his ultimate from. With a cleansing breath he de-digivolved and changed back into Reddmon, thankful to have his tails back again. Making his way to the kitchen he materialized the four folders he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gathered throughout the day and dropped them onto the table before finding a cloth in one of the cupboards and wetting it under the tap. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSitting by the table he opened the folder marked with his name and began swabbing at the cuts and bruises, wiping off any of the foul gunk that clung to his feet. Reading through it he found that it was filled with everything there was to know about himself, most of which he himself didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know. It also outlined why he was targeted, something about prior employment with a virus type digimon by the name of Reapermon. Who had for some reason or another lost favour with him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tMoving on to the other folder he found that the Cyberdramon that attacked him was just a wild digimon that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d captured and used as a guinea pig to test the latest version of the crystals, which according the that relevant folder was a precursor to the version that was used on Orionmon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBut while the first three files brought him up to speed it was the last one that gave him a direction to go in. It was all about Reapermon, everything about him. Where he could be found, things he owned, and even his fighting style. Orionmon came though again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon looked out the window and was surprised to see that night had rolled over the town and that he had been reading in twilight from what little shone through the window, he hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \tWhat now? Sleep on it or plan now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And anyway, she expressly forbade him form coming to school.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGot it in one, I usually call myself Redd but I felt that was too obvious, might have fooled Takato or Guilmon but the rest of you would have guessed immediately.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright that explains what you are, but who are you? Where do you come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon, moving onto the second most pressing matter.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit tougher. Mainly because I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember, but according to that file I worked as the second in command for a bounty hunter organization led by a Reapermon. Doing allsorts of violent and destructive odd jobs. And for some reason I quit or was fired, then I disappeared for a while. Actually now that I think about it that might explain that Heliogaomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anger when he saw me in the tournament.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tSo anyway, when I reappeared I was apparently much less, dangerous. Still causing havoc but not on a murderous warpath. That new period matches reports which place it at the start of my memory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to speed now, right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot entirely. Shortly after I reappeared Reapermon started putting massive resources into tracking me down. I came here, he eventually followed, hence the attack with Cyberdramon. And Orionmon. To put it simply this is the guy I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m after now. I have a rough plan of attack and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll fill in the specifics when I go to the digital world.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Stated Renamon, everything had the ring of truth to her ears and she was certain that no matter how good Reddmon was he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d do something reckless and get himself deleted.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMe too, I cant let you two go with out a person to watch your backs and let Renamon digivolve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the pair of you if I tried could I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He sighed resignedly. \u00e2\u0080\u009dYou do know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to have to fight through an elite army.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHuh, if we can take on a creature that deletes data by touch then we can handle an army of digimon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon scoffed, like she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d lose to minions.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon smiled and shook his head, shrugging his shoulders, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFine, but the guys don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it be easier if there were more of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnly if you want to face the whole force, I was hoping to do what Orionmon did. Go in, strike, then disappear, that card he gave me should sort out any hasty exits we need to make. I can see those four making a huge noise at the worst possible moments. Where as we could easily run you through the basics of stealth as we travel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He explained, something that was actually a great idea, as long as they came back in a better shape than Orionmon did. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRenamon winced as she finished that thought, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly respectful to the dead. Well, the temporarily missing at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decided then. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going back to the digital world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Declared Rika enthusiastically, slamming a fist into he open palm.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTomorrow, miss sunshine. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m tired. You should prepare for a few days travel. And maybe tell your parents.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He advised, standing up and dematerialising the folders he still held. Renamon nearly laughed out loud, never in her memory had Rika been called that, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to remember it for the right moment. They followed him to the door and said their good byes for the night, arranging to meet up in the park in the morning.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tJust as Rika turned to leave Reddmon grabbed her by the shoulders and pulled her close, kissing her on the muzzle for a slow moment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He whispered releasing her and taking a quick step back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cRenamon, c\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Called Rika impatiently, looking back to see what was holding her up. Renamon felt heat rising to her face as she looked from the waiting Rika to a smiling Reddmon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy you cheeky\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She muttered, not bothering to finish the sentence let alone knock him over the head, instead hurrying after her partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext morning</span></div></div>",

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d always had a knack for doing the unexpected. But it was way to soon for him to have been reformatted and re-digivolved back to his rookie form. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo until then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to deal with Reapermon to keep myself amused.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A glance at the clock told him that he still had a fair bit of time to wait till he had to meet up with the girls so he had plenty of time to grab breakfast. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAfter checking that he had everything stored that he wanted, weapons, extra food, camping stuff as well as other survival paraphernalia. He locked the front door then teleported round to the back of the house, transformed into Redd and ambled down to the business district. He wandered around for a bit before walking by a sit down food stall. It smelt good enough and he was running out of time so he lifted one of the hanging fabric doors aside and sat down on one of the stools.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning!

Renamon had gotten rice and a bowl of soup he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite identify but was wonderfully aromatic, simple as he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d expect. Rika order was a seafood curry with a strong green pigment, again very aromatic.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks good, Thanks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Redd, picking up his chopsticks and digging in, following the rules of etiquette Renamon taught him yesterday, if only for brownie points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOnce they'd finished their food Redd offered to pay their bills, but Mr Hamano just shook his head then gave him a knowing wink. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry about it, have a nice day, eh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRedd just waved and politely smiled in return, the guy must think him and Rika are together or something.

Halting and masking her presence as she saw Guilmon run down an alley below her. She disliked deceiving him, but they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the others following them later on and getting lost.

Rika took one of the thick, high strength straps and began pulling them shut, so they wouldn't come undone when they fell into the digital world, a fall that experience told them would be rough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon watched as Rika struggled to pick the bag up then sighed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere, give me that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said taking the backpack up then immediately dropping it.

She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d seen Orionmon pull similar tricks before but humans probably didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get used to the sudden disappearance of objects.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, lets go before Guilmon gets back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Reddmon walking inside the Dino\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hideaway. \u00e2\u0080\u009cUmm, how do we use the portal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked, poking his head back out the doorway.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust follow us.

Oh yeah that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, the digital world. Renamon pushed herself up, seemed like she was the last one to come to, everyone else had already crawled out of their own sandy craters and scrambled into hers.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGlad your alright.

Besides she had the feeling they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be falling almost as much as last time they visited.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe do have a better plan of action than last time don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we? This is all feeling way too much like d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moaned Rika, pointing off to a collection of craters Renamon instantly recognised as their last point of entry. Which was strange since that was a such long time ago<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat was the plan last time?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Reddmon as he scanned the rather bleak horizon, staring at the rock formations that resembled radio towers then glancing at each of the data streams that were currently passing, one roughly north, one south east and another to the west. Assuming one could discern the points of a compass from the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s location, again on the assumption the digital world played by that particular rule. Which was highly doubtful.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.

Can you pass me my water bottle, its in the side pocket of my bag.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika with a shrug. Reddmon laughed to himself for a moment before frowning in concentration for another, plucking Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark green water bottle from mid air.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where we are so I was gonna\u00e2\u0080\u0099 suggest hopping through data streams till we find a town. Then go hunting for info the usual way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, tossing the bottle to her then walking off in a seemingly random direction.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat should I have expected? He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a boy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whispered Rika as she began walking after him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009dYes. This was going to be exactly like last time, at least Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be complaining to him not me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> Thought Renamon, following the pair as they began squabbling about which direction to go.</span></div></div>",

He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d travelled through them hundreds of times, with and without others and they'd <i>generally</i> gotten him where he wanted, although that was usually as vague as just somewhere else.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery time those things caught one of us our group got more and more scattered, we should just walk around until we find someone or something helpful.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\nHe could tell Renamon agreed with Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument and was about to intervene, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0098d win anyway if he only stalled a few more seconds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt only takes a few seconds for the drop off point to change by kilometres, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even hold your hand to make sure...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon cut himself off as a white paw clamped around both their hands/paws, he looked to Renamon to see he staring between then at the approaching stream.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cFine you win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sighed Rika, giving in and stopping her struggle.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThey watched as the data stream loomed over them and Reddmon felt that odd falling sensation, although it was more like falling up rather than down. But suddenly that changed, they bagan falling properly and the blinding pink light was cut off, revealing exactly what he was looking for, a large desert town. Only problem was they where about seven metres off the ground, easily a dangerous fall. He fealt both there hands/paws squeeze sharply as the girls saw where they were. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tActing instinctively he pulled on Rika\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and grabbed her as they make contact, Renamon let go and righted herself as Reddmon did so for both of them, landing almost perfectly in the sand with a heavy thud that send shockwaves of pain running up he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSee, piece of cake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moaned Reddmon, letting Rika to her feet then rubbing the pain out of his thighs. He stumbled over to a wooden crate by the side of the small yard they were in and lifted himself onto it. Kneading the aching muscles.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo where are we.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, looking around and taking in the unusual architecture.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a large merchant town by the name of Amani*, mainly made from data on middle eastern bazaars, exactly what we need.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He answered, frankly quite happy with his luck, he even knew several friends in the area who he could pull favours from.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLets go, we have someone we need to talk to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon pushed himself off the crate and motioned for the girls to follow him. They walked out of the back yard and up a side ally between two squat, single floor buildings that were the same colour as the sand around them. As they left the alley they found themselves in a bustling main road. Digimon of all types and levels travelling to and fro, half of them carrying large stacks of packages in front of them the other half pulling heavily laden carriages behind.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRenamon sniffed the air casually and instantly snorted, probably trying to get rid of the overpowering smell of exotic spices and something else he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never been able to identify. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOhh that smells nice. What is it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, also tasting the scent on the air, although it was probably nice and mild for her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cFood court.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, pointing down one way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go there later, but first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed to a side road a few metres in the opposite direction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe go that way. Stay close together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty easy to get lost here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He regretted that as soon as he said it because they both shot him a irritable look.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t children you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hissed Renamon, walking in the direction he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pointed. Rika shrugged and walked after her, for a second Reddmon considered hiding, just to give them a little scare. But he knew a few slave mongers hung around here and would have no  qualms or problems with kidnapping them. Renamon was street smart but Rika needed more experience, so in the end he just jogged after them, ducking and weaving through the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAfter walking down several roads, each more seedy and less frequented than the last they came to a large rug store at the very edge of the city, deep within the shadow of the high wall surrounding the \u00e2\u0080\u009cCity of Wishes\u00e2\u0080\u009c as it was known.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you sure this is the place? Seems kind of..\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rika tried to find the right word to describe it.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMusty?\" He offered, \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, he might be shady but this guy is the best informant I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve met. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have info on where we can find Reapermon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon ducked under a large, incredibly old rug that hung over the door and lifted it aside for them. As soon as they were all in another rug hanging against what appeared to be a solid wall flew open from which emerged a short digimon wearing an orange robe that brushed his feet, his head covered in dusty bandages that only parted to show two darting yellow eyes, a Cheshire smile and a pair of pale orange cat ears.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     \"Hello Basimon. Hows business?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAhh Reddmon, I was wondering when I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d see you next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His voice soft and with the slight rasp of age but still full of authority. His sharp eyes sliding over Renamon then resting on Rika, lingering a few moments to long. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not at all like you to travel with others, least of all a partnership of digimon and human. Something troublesome must be coming my way, hmm. <i>Sigh.</i> Ah well you always pay my fees, what is it you need?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He sat himself of a stack of cloth and motioned for them to do likewise. Reddmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s makeshift seat, a collection of older articles released a small cloud of dust that made him break into a coughing fit.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOnce he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d cleared his throat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI need to know the current whereabouts of a digimon named Reapermon, do you know him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBasimon chuckled to himself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes of course I do, but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dangerous individual, I would need to cover my tracks well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His grin widened disturbingly, his eyes glinting greedily.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t With a sigh Reddmon materialised a large sack he kept various valuable things in and tossed it to Basimon. Upon catching it Basimon simply hefted the bag and put it behind him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWonderful, go to the bazaar find a food stall selling curry and wait there. A Digimon I trust will be there soon to guide you.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, you mean he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually going to take us there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, probably not believing how helpful Basimon was being, who despite looking shifty was actually very reliable, to those who paid enough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes of course girl. Now go, shoo, shoo. I need to prepare for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He urged, waving for them to leave.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon, this gives us a chance to get something to eat, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about lunch time anyway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Reddmon walking out and again holding the rug aside for them to pass. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs they where walking back down the path they came from there was a massive crash and a lot of hollering at the intersection up ahead.

They've been taking a holiday here with their digimon. <i>Sigh</i>, I was really hoping we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d avoid them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Reddmon taking a step closer to the intersection, he wanted to get a look at these tamers. Since they were here already they might as well be helpful. Reddmon stopped in his tracks as there was a blossom of light followed by a blast of sound that rattled the pots in a nearby store.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re even more noisy than Guilmon hunting for the peanut better jar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mumbled Renamon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cC\u00e2\u0080\u0099mon we probably should get them out of trouble. It certainly won't be the first or the last time we'll have to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThis time Renamon took a step forward but was stopped by Rika putting a hand on her shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo way, the last time we were stuck with those two I nearly went insane. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just hide back here till everything dies down, they have Guardromon and MarineAngemon with them. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was another series of explosions then more yells and they all looked down the road to see two kids, probably Kenta and Kazu, running around the corner, shortly followed by a small pink digimon that floated off the ground and a Guardromon bringing up the rear. The brown haired one, wearing desert gear waved to them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey! Rika, Renamon, help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He yelled as a large mob of angry looking digimon came into view behind them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see your point, but no helping it now. Alright, lets see.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon glanced around them, no easy doorways or any large objects to hid in, only two empty roads behind them. One of which, the one they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d just come from, was a dead end. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGot it, Renamon, get Rika on top of that building and hide with this. Be ready for us, we'll need to do this fast and smooth\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, materializing a large folded square of tarp like material and passing it to her then pointing to a building a bit down the road leading back to Basimon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s place.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThey nodded then Renamon scooped her partner up and disappeared. His part was somewhat harder, he made a show of seeing them and pretended to run down the other path, discreetly dropping a few smoke grenades with timers he hoped he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d set right. Once out of sight he immediately pressed his back to the wall, waiting. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere\u00e2\u0080\u0099d they go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said a young boys voice, different from the first\u00e2\u0080\u0099s<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo clue, but who was that red dude they were with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Panted the other.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cPsst. Quick over here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whispered Reddmon as they came into view. Not stupid enough to ignore help in their current situation they wheeled into his alley without a moments hesitation.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you and where are the ladies?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked the Guardromon immediately. <i> Admirable set of priorities.</i> Noted Reddmon, holding up a finger for a moment. The smokes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d set burst into a screen of fine grey mist that would give them plenty of cover for what he was planning.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cFollow me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, dropping another smoke grenade and running down the road he sent the girls. The kids exchanged a look between them then followed. As he entered the intersection again, a third of which was obscured, he dropped not only a few more smoke grenades for good measure but also what were known as flash-bangs. When they went off they produced a blinding white light and a deafening crack, useful for disorienting enemies without killing them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 He quickly made it to the building Renamon and Rika were on. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReady, here they come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He whispered, hoping Renamon would react quickly enough. Because as soon as the first of their new friends caught up, the boy who had black hair and wore glasses, he made a shushing gesture then grabbed him by the lapels of his jacket and tossed him upwards towards the roof of the building. Too surprised to make a noise the kid was snatched from mid air as he came level with Renamon, and hopefully hidden under the blanket he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d given them, which was specially designed to hide all traces of a digimon's presence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey where did Kenta ge...\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon clamped his paw around the now identified Kazu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mouth as he emerged from the spreading cloud then tossed him up as well. Luckily the Guardromon seemed to catch on quick because he nodded then crouched down, jumping an impressive height and managing to hoist himself up onto the roof. Lastly the MarineAngemon appeared, but because he could fly all Reddmon had to do was point upwards and jump onto the roof as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 When he got ontop he was greated by an odd sight, the stealth blanket (He hated that name but couldn't think of anything better) was easily large enough to hide even a large ultimate class digimon with little trouble but it still looked rather lumpen with them all under it, and by the looks of things there was a bit of a struggle going on underneath. He lifted one corner and ducked in, holding it up a second longer to let the MarineAngemon in as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMmpff!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon pivoted on his haunches to see that it was the brown headed kid, Kazu, making all the fuss. He was thrashing about with both the girls holding him down, hands and paws held firmly over his mouth.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite kid, we have to hide for a few minutes, if you need to ask questions whisper, alright?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Reddmon under his breath, gently easing the girls muzzle from his mouth.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He whispered, pulling a small water flask from his robes and taking a swig.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy name's Reddmon and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a friend of a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon whispered back. The one who was probably Kenta gave Rika and Renamon a questioning look and they nodded, confirming his creds.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHey, why are you all here anyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Kenta <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo sort out his past, now shush.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Admonished Renamon as part of the pursuing mob stopped in front of the building. Chattering about their sudden disappearance. After several tense minutes of waiting everything died down and eventually all the digimon left, probably to clean up whatever mess they'd made.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon threw off the concealing blanket and began folding it up into a square. \u00e2\u0080\u009dSo what did you guys do anyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He dropped it behind his back and let it disappear, getting odd glances from the newcomers. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThe Guardromon was the first to answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy partner Kazu had an altercation about the cost of our lunch. Regrettably we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have enough to pay and I was forced to defend us from the rather aggravated storeman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, we have an appointment to keep, do you have somewhere to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, seemingly wanting to get rid of them, which was fair considering they seemed to be trouble magnets.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no, we kind of forgot how to get home, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re already late.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Ketna, hanging his head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cCongratulations, this is your lucky day. We just happen to have a one of a kind digi-modify card that'll get you right home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon put on his best salesmen voice, pulling out the warriors path card that Orionmon had given them. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tWith a flourish he gave it to Kazu and motioned for him to scan it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked, flipping it over and looking at the official logo most of the digi-modify cards had.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt opens a portal to the real world. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know the exact target location but probably some place in Shinjinku.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Explained Renamon as Kazu gingerly ran the card through his digivice. Crying out in surprise as one of Orionmon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s characteristic black holes silently appeared.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou actually expect us to get in that thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Kenta disbelievingly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve travelled through these loads of time while you where gone, there probably safer than travelling by plane.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Rika said, sounding remarkably like Reddmon talking about the data streams earlier.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLets go for the blunt approach shall we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suggested Reddmon moving forward and plucking his card form Kazu then grabbing the chest of his shawl and tossing him into the portal. Snatching Kenta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm and throwing him bodily through it as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy word, what are you doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Blustered Guardromon as he backed away from Reddmon, probably thinking him to be insane.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cGetting you home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, plucking MarineAngimon from above his head and pushing him into the metal digimon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, then grabbing him by the round handle that adorned his front and swinging them through the portal, not a moment before it closed in on itself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell that handles that then, eh.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, proudly slapping his paws together and turning to the girls to see Rika struggling to keep herself from laughing as Renamon shook her head with a paw over her eyes.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you could have handled that with a bit more finesse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked when she noticed his confused look.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat, they barley made a sound let alone reacted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not what I meant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sighed as Rika actually burst out laughing, a rare occurrence.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on you two, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve still go to meet that guide.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon said, throwing a paw up in exasperation and hopping down off the building. Reddmon exchanged a grin with Rika then picked her up and jumped off the house after Renamon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really a set section there was just more food stalls here than in other places.<br>\r\n\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said by a curry store, so maybe we could just follow any scents of spicy food.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Suggested Reddmon, trying to sift through the tangy air for anything that smelt hot. But that was easier said than done, the air was just way too rich here, even a Renamon or Garurumon wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to pick one out.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cCouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it have occurred to Basimon to give us even a vauge discription of the guy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Groaned Rika doing a final sweep then giving up.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re the one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m meant to meet then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d They all span to see a stooped digimon looking up at them with a pair of pale brown eyes that had pinpoints of white that seemed to serve as his pupils. His rather morose eyes the only part of his face that was visible under the large grey cloak that covered his head and indeed his whole body except for his clawed hands and a worn pair of leather boots.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere did you come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Reddmon. In response the digimon jerked a thumb at a store that sold, wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know it, curry. They had been looking in the wrong direction the whole time.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy names Sairamon, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been watching you the whole time. Waiting for you to mention our, mutual friend before approaching.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He walked back to the curry store and picked up a huge collection of odds and ends strapped and banded together, swinging it over his shoulder with little trouble. Reddmon could spot things like rolls of fabric, several sheathed swords, and he could of sworn he caught a glimpse of a tap poking out from the side. The whole bundle was easily bigger than any of them, and substantially larger than Sairamon himself, probably heavier than him as well.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\"Shall we head off then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked, adjusting the thick straps crossing his chest. Reddmon was still amazed he could even lift something that big. He was probably strong in as an ox in a fight, he felt like a champion at least.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mind if we get something to eat first?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon, pointing toward the store they were standing next to, Basimon nodded and made a suggestion about going for the mild, a piece of advice they all took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs they walked out of the city they finished the last of their lunch, or possibly dinner, Reddmon had lost track of time a while ago. Sairamon wasn't saying anything just leading the way through the maze of stalls and buildings, shrugging off all questions they asked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tFinally they made it out, yet their guide still remained silent, motioning for them to be patient. It was only when they had walked over several sand dunes and were completely out of sight of Amani did Sairamon explain where they were going.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI apologize for the sustained silence but you never know <i>who</i> might be listening. Our goal is the current whereabouts of the mercenary-king known as Reapermon, correct?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, so you know where we can find him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Renamon as they began climbing up the next dune.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course. A while ago by happen stance I noticed a convey that bore his mark crossing the desert, curious I followed and saw them entering a large structure. A month later I was in the area, again by chance and saw the exact same convey enter the building. I went back two more times to confirm then told Basimon, who paid me handsomely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Reddmon couldn't see his face but he could practically hear the smile in his voice.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd how long till he arrives next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Panted Rika, the heat apparently getting to her. Geez like she could complain, she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even covered in fur. Never the less Reddmon sighed and pulled out a coolie hat and her water bottle from his other space, passing it to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks, but why do you have this anyway?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked, slipping the strap of the water bottle around her shoulder then looking the coolie hat over before putting it on. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon shrugged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot quite sure, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got some weird stuff in there though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTonight to answer your earlier question. And by the way, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve arrived.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Sairamon, having stopped and waited for them to finish. He pointed to the top of the dune they where currently scaling. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon dropped to his stomach and crawled to the top, peaking over the peak, Renamon and Rika coming up next to him. Beyond the sand dune they were on was a vast sprawling complex that that was surrounded by a tall barbed wire fence with several tall towers at the corners, which probably had sentries scanning the no mans land that separated the dunes from the base. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThe base itself was made of thirty or so utilitarian military buildings painted to blend in with the desert each short squat and designed to have a small silhouette.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cNice place, I wonder who does the decorating? So should we go in before or after Reapermon arrives? i say before an be ready for him when he arrives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Proposed Renamon and Rika nodded her agreement.<br>\r\nSairamon {saira = traveller )</span></div></div>",

So that was problem one.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tOnce they got inside they needed something to give them a few minutes to find a place to conceal themselves while being able to watch the main entrance, a large gate that had another pair of lookout towers attached to it. As he looked around the enclosure he saw a large group of digimon march out into a open courtyard, taking up rigid formations then changing said formations at a gesture from a Strikedramon who appeared to be their sergeant. The twenty or so digimon moving around in perfect sinyc were all a species known as Jundmon, steel armour , jagged blades, vicious tempers and little else. Another reason to keep everyone occupied while they slipped in. so that was two problems, solving them with a single solution would be optimal.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t<i>\u00e2\u0080\u009dThis seem as good a time as any to use some toys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> Thought Reddmon as he flipped through the list of weapons he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d \u00e2\u0080\u009cacquired\u00e2\u0080\u009d through various means.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cEureka.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Reddmon suddenly, giving Rika and Renamon a start as they scrutinised the walls for possible weak points. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back in a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Reddmon began making short teleports around the enclosure making sure to stay hidden behind the dunes till he was about a third of the way round. With a smile he waved a paw and a large gun metal box appeared, and after pulling at a few handles and twisting a couple of parts the correct way one of his favourite pieces of hardware was ready.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tIt was in essence a high tech multiple missile launcher, with several racks of explosive projectiles, a short antenna and four sturdy legs digging deep into the sand. He slid a pair of blocky binoc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s from a recess and crawled up the slope.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe pressed a few buttons on the top of the binoculars and brought them up, looking at several of the towers in turn for a second each, \u00e2\u0080\u009cpainting\u00e2\u0080\u009d them with an infer red marker, which would mark the impact point of one of the bundles of fun. After targeting all the towers Reddmon still had four left so he just aimed them at random points throughout the complex then set the timer for a minute, pressing the confirm button and tossing it back near the launcher.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis should be a good lightshow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Chuckled Reddmon, quickly making his way back to the others, landing silently next to them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlright, once the place is softened up we move. Renamon you take Rika, follow me and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftened up? What do you mean by tha\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t finish as a sharp whistling broke the comparative silence of the desert, they all turned to see a finger of smoke tipped by a black cylinder shoot up from behind the dune he went to, followed by another, then another, they just kept coming until the first stopped rising and began curving downward until it was pointing dead on at one of the towers. There was a cry of alarm and a shrill keening of a klaxon began but that was drowned out as the first missile hit its mark, damn near blowing the building in half in a brilliant fireball and a visible wall of concussive force. Then another one hit destroying more watchtowers, followed by even more, the whole place quickly reduced from a figure of military perfection to a smoking war zone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTime to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reddmon said, leaping to his feet and snatching out a grenade launcher he kept for special occasions, the missiles had taken out all the towers but several where still in flight, Rika glanced at them worriedly and was probably about to question the sanity of moving now but Renamon pulled her onto her back and jumped up with him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are crazy, you know that right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said as she tensed to follow him.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be nearly as much fun if I weren't, would I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said, teleporting half the distance in one go. He smiled as she followed him, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t count the times he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d done this kind of thing with Orionmon, and he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the heart to tell them he was being cautious for their sake he was pretty sure that would earn him a friendly clip round the ears and nothing else. </span></div></div>",

He took another surreptitious glance at the raised seat behind them, the large mega level digimon with a skull motif they knew only as boss sat glaring around the room, one metallic claw digging deep gouges into the solid steel armrest, the other arm, a large scythe like blade just tapped and tapped and tapped. If it was anyone else he might have asked them to stop. But Nasirmon were gangly, with a thin body covered by loose fitting sun-bleached robes, not made or know for fighting. That was probably why they gravitated to secretarial jobs.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSir we have an attack on home base.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Declared a younger Nasirmon several stations down.

So far he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d achieved both objectives of enforcing chaos and keeping everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention away from them. He smirked as he heard the twin explosions followed by the desperate bellowing of those trying to maintain order then ducked back into the alcove Renamon and Rika where sheltering in.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re having way too much fun, put that blasted thing away for a moment and help us with this door.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon urged, jerking a thumb at a semi-concealed door that blended in with the wall pretty much perfectly, anyone walking by would probably overlook it unless they knew it was there. Luckily Renamon had noticed it as they were running by.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you just teleported inside?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked dematerialising the grenade launcher, he was out of ammunition anyway. Still, a purchase well made.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause, for some reason I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She bristled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I certainly can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t knock it down, that would defeat the purpose of sneaking inside altogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She made room for him as Reddmon moved forward and materialized a set of lock picks. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d learnt how to use them ages ago and but never actually had to, never thought he would really. Taking out a pick and a lever he began feeling around inside the tumbler and was surprised to find only three pins that needed lifting, a military place like this usually had better locks, but hey this only made things easier. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe slipped the tools away then nudged the door open, looking both ways down a deserted and stark hallway then motioned for Renamon, then Rika to follow him. He eased the door shut then whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRenamon, you go take the front and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep a watch behind us, just follow any signs that peek you interest.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Renamon nodded then proceeded quickly to the first intersection, finding a stupidly convenient sign showing what was down each path.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think the henchmen here get lost often?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika as they turned left. Reddmon glanced at the sign as he backed past it, seemed like Renamon had chosen the control room, or the barracks. He assumed, well, hoped for the former.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cProbably, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve heard this guy tends to hire the brutish types a lot, he finds it easier to stay in charge that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Noted Reddmon, recalling the profile he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d read on Reapermon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cShhh, someone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Said Renamon, stopping mid stride. Reddmon turned from his rear guard position and strained his ears, picking out a pair of steel shod footsteps, he sensed a pair of champions nearby so it was probably small Jundmon patrol. Renamon made a small movement with her paw and they both dashed down the hallway. Her on the left him the right.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tJust as he expected two of the soldier digimon marched into the intersection and noticed them immediately, guarding for their charge, twin swords up and crossed, legs spread to take the force but loose enough to adjust if needed. Renamon must have seen this too because when they were two metres away he noticed a small twitch in her leg and arm muscles. <i> \u00e2\u0080\u009cClever, that should work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</i> Reddmon came almost level with her then pulled an arm back as if preparing to strike, Renamon did similar.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBoth the Jundmon changed their stances minutely to take them on but just before impact was made Reddmon leapt over Renamon as she swept under him, crossing over each other and hitting their surprised targets around there guard and with lethal force.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tThe Jundmon burst into blue clouds of data and as Reddmon yanked his arm from a small hole he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made in the wall he turned to Renamon and smiled, noticing the big blocky digimon beyond her a Husamon, the ultimate form of Jundmon. Keeping the steel armour and visored helm but exchanging the twin swords for a large shield wielded like a buckler and a long scimitar, which made his stomach turn as he saw it soaring through the air towards Renamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon Grabbed Renamon by the shoulders and swung her to the side, she cried out in protest but cut herself off as the flying blade slide through his shoulder and clattered to the ground past them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon barely had time to straighten himself to the Husamon as he came thundering forward, slamming the shield into him and crushing him into the wall. He jerked his head aside as a pile driver of a fist crashed into the reinforced concrete wall, leaving a hole twice as big as the one he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d made. With a thick chuckle he easily yanked his fist out, a tangle of rebar clenched in his hand. He dropped it and curled his fist again, he wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to miss again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs the grieved knuckles rushed toward him Reddmon saw a flash of yellow, the Husamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head jerked to the side and the shield pinning him against the wall relented. He landed on his paws and lashed a foot out, hitting the knight digimon in the unarmoured back of his knee, the forces unbalancing him and sending him crashing to the ground. Reddmon rolled to the side as Husamon and the floor surrounding him were peppered be a flurry of razor sharp diamond shards. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tBy the time the Husamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data had dispersed Reddmon pushed himself up against the wall and tenderly examined his shoulder and chest. The cut wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deep and was already stopped bleeding freely, but he was pretty sure his ribs where at the very least bruised, probably cracked.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRika ran to his side, holding her digivice and a hyper strength digi-modify card. Renamon was at the intersection, watching for anymore patrols, glancing at him worriedly.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you alright Reddmon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, leaning close to inspect his wound. Reddmon just nodded and materialized a spray bottle of antiseptic and some bandages then handed them to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAfter they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d patched him up they assumed the same formation then continued on, although there was a few more close calls they managed to get to the control room without meeting anymore roaming digimon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon leaned up against the wall beside the door and waited for Rika and Renamon to take up positions opposite.

But from where?<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAs his eyes adjusted to the harsh lightReddmon saw a shapely figure walking towards them, dark, but that was because of the lights. Then as they dimmed slightly he saw why she looked so dark, she was a LadyDevimon, tall and clad in black leather with sections that where seemingly alive, faces appearing then melting back into the material as she strode up to them.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRenamon stepped up next to him and glared at LadyDevimon menacingly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it you want? Either move aside or be knocked aside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She growled, the hackles on her back standing on end.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon barely heard her, this digimon was part of his past, he knew it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to do is give you one last chance to escape , you wont get another when lord Reapermon arrives.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She replied, smirking down at Renamon, being much taller and of a higher level. But to Renamon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t backing down an inch.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tHe didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sense any animosity coming from LadyDevimon, at least not aimed at him so he stepped forward and gently pushed Renamon back, putting a touch more room between the pair who where now deeply engaged in a staring match.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cLook, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sorry have we met before?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked, finally drawing LadyDevimon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gaze of death from Renamon. As soon as she made eye contact with him her face softened, Reddmon swore he saw several emotions flash through her eyes, sadness, pain and old love, the last one Renamon definitely picked up because she growled again. Thankfully Rika pulled her back and whispered something to her.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d remember me, well I guess I did a thorough job then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She glanced around her worriedly, like she could be caught doing something wrong at any moment, then with a sigh of resignation she continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to leave either way are you? You aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t able to recall much from several years back right? That\u00e2\u0080\u0098s because I erased your memory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you do that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Asked Rika, strangely not getting any evil looks from LadyDevimon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo save him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a snort behind him and LadyDevimon shot another look past him. Reddmon just shook his head and hoped a fight wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t break out, they seemed to have an ally here, something that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to run into him that often.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom what and why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He forged on, dragging her attention from Renamon again.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou\u00e2\u0080\u0099d gotten too powerful, Reapermon was going to kill you before you became a threat to him. And as for the why, well because, we used to be, intimate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a scuffle behind him as a few muffled threats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I see you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already started a new life, with new friends. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m, happy for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Another flash of sadness, she broke eye contact with him and turned, walking towards a doorway underneath the large screens that took up most of the wall. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow I expect that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what you wanted, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be best if you leave, now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tReddmon looked back to the girls to see that Rika had an arm around Renamons neck, who had stopped struggling but was still shooting daggers at LadyDevimon.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry but we're here to defeat him, for a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He stated, stopping LadyDevimon in her tracks. She laughed lightly then shook her head.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\t\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy how you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve changed, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I could give you that chance Redd\u00e2\u0080\u00a6ugh\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was cut off as a massive metal claw ripped through the door, shredding the jamb and knocking the steel plate of it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hinges. Wrapping around her waist then yanking her back with a violent tug.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0     Reddmon threw a glance to Renamon and Rika, just to make sure they'd seen that as well, and judging by their expressions they had. She had been helpful, even if she was an evil digimon they should try to help her. And that was Reapermons claw, he was sure of it. But he was also sure that was a trap, for real this time. <i>\"Damn! This sucks!\"</i> Thought Reddmon for what felt like the hundredth time that day</span></div></div>",

The lights blazing around the set dimmed down and Rika relaxed from the tense pose she was in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<i>\u201cGreat!\u201d </i> She thought, <i>\u201cI\u2019m starved\u201d</i> Renamon and Reddmon had dropped their fighting stances as well and had began talking about wether or not they had a chance at going out for a date, which made Rika want to get to the lunch room all the more, she and Takato had finally started dating and although he\u2019d finished his work on camera he would still hang around and have lunches with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cC\u2019mon Let\u2019s go.\u201d She said motioning to the laughing pair of Digimon, Reddmon wiped away a tear and nodded, giving her a wide grin. Reddmon and Takato got along well but Reddmon seemed to prefer it when Guilmon came along, but after a series of \u201cincidents\u201d Guilmon wasn\u2019t allowed on site anymore. Though she liked the happy go lucky dinosaur the room was usually quieter when he wasn\u2019t in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0They made there way off the set and through the maze of trailers, filming equipment and other facilities one would usually see at any large scale production. Even though they\u2019d been in the area for a while they got lost twice and in the end resorted to just having one of them take turns lifting Rika on to their backs and hopping onto of the trailers, instantly finding and heading towards the blue topped mess tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As they touched down Rika dropped down from Renamon\u2019s back Takato seemingly appeared from thin air and wrapped his arms around her in a fierce hug. She still wasn\u2019t completely used to being this close but she repressed the urge to shove him away and instead hugged him back. Throwing an icy stare at the fox digimon as they gave each other a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cSo, how did today go?\u201d Asked Takato as a steady stream of Digimon began emerging from the woodworks of  the support crews sprawling collection of caravans. Husamon, Jundmon and Nasirmon among others, all the extras and stuntmon that made the show seem real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cPretty good,\u201d Said Reddmon as they walked over to the kitchen area and each grabbed a tray from a tall stack of them, moving along a line and picking plates of what they wanted from a large spread. And naturally Reddmon had his stacked high, at least double what everyone else had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When they had everything they wanted they wandered round till they found a few spare seats in the long  rows of tables with integrated seats. It was still kind of weird, everything was designed to facilitate huge numbers of people, or digimon and had to be slightly larger than usual to accommodate the higher levels of the latter. They began talking about whatever came to mind as they ate roving from subject to subject as whim took them, that is until some weirdo appeared and strode up to where they where sitting, he was nothing special himself, average in most respects, but clothing now that\u2019s what set him apart. He wore sandals, with socks shorts of a glaringly vibrant shade of orange and a deep blue singlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cUmm, may we help you?\u201d Asked Renamon with one raised eyebrow, a forkful of rice halfway to here mouth, the guys just seemed slightly shocked, <i>\u201cProbably stunned by those damn shorts.</i> Thought Rika as the guy bowed low and readjusted a pair of reflective sunglasses he had low on his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cMorning, sorry to interrupt your lunch. I\u2019m Horosuma the writer of the show and was hoping I could get your okay on a scene that I was thinking of putting in.\u201d He simultaneously removed his glasses and pulled a thin sheaf of papers from behind his back, presenting it to Renamon, who cautiously gave his a long hard look then gave the rest of them a questioning look. She put her fork down and took the papers from Horosuma\u2019s hand, Reddmon leaned over to read it with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rika tried to crane her neck to get a glimpse but she and Takato were on the other side of the table so couldn\u2019t make anything out. But judging by Renamon\u2019s expression as she slowly turned red as he eyes scanned side to side they wouldn\u2019t be performing the scene this was confirmed and Reddmon, who was apparently a slower reader began grinning goofily, a thin line of drool running down from the courner of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cYOU PERVERT!\u201d Yelled Renamon as she snatched the paper from a rather disappointed Reddmon and jumped to her feet, but Horosuma was already halfway across the tent, which was a fair distance in such a short time. Renamon sighed and sat back down with a growl and systematically shredded the papers with her claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d Asked Takato, although Renamon had already sent her an outline via their special link, and it wasn\u2019t the kind of think you\u2018d explain in public. But Takato didn\u2019t need any such subtitles, Renamon\u2019s expression made him drop the question instantly and he went back to eating his lunch, studiously avoiding eye contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cI could tell you.\u201d Offered Reddmon slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cNo, you couldn\u2019t.\u201d Shot Renamon, firmly, clamping a paw over his muzzle. \u201cNot if you ever want it to happen anyway.\u201d Rika almost choked on her lunch that wasn\u2019t something she needed to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message from the author.  <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Huff pant huff, okay I think I got away with it, ahem, anyway I hope those that have been following have enjoyed it so far, although if you didn't you probably wouldn't be reading this would you?  <br>\r\nEither way I would be really grateful for any feedback, or even better yet you opinions or helpful advice, still learning and essentially teaching myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRACK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Oh damn she found me!

He was now considerably weaker than her as her bandages looked professional while his were loose and already falling off.

She dodged his attack easily but that didn't stop him going on the offensive. He threw a few punches before Renamon sighed and grabbed him by the throat and threw him to the ground. \"Ow\" he grunted as he hit the ground and felt Renamon's foot on his chest. \"You just don't know when to give up, do you?\" Renamon said as she put some pressure on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'm just a slow learner\" he said with a smile as he grabbed Renamon's foot and twisted her off of him....</span></div></div>",

ViralReddmon was enjoying the battle that he was having with her, \"come on that the best you got\" he said with a smile as the two locked hands. He moved in quick and kissed her on the cheek, \"creep\" she yelled as she swung at him. He chuckled softly and jumped back, the two were locked in such intense combat that they failed to realize the digifeild appearing around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark Warriormon appeared in the middle of the field as the two continued to fight, his appearance is that of a ten-foot tall armored creature with a large claymore on his back, which he rarely uses. ViralReddmon landed in front of him with his back to him, he noticed someone was behind him and slowly turned to face him. \"Whoa you are one big...\" ViralReddmon started before he got slammed through a wall, \"ouch\" he groaned as he pushed the rubble of him. He heard a slamming in front of him and watched as Sakuyamon landed on top of him. \"Aww I didn't know you cared\" ViralReddmon said as he helped her up, \"shut up\" she muttered softly. \"I hate to say it, but I think we are going to have to help each other on this one\" ViralReddmon said as he moved over to the hole they had made.</span></div></div>",

Reddmon had reverted back to normal and was trying to force himself to his feet, he looked up at the Warriormon, its armor was cracked in a few places but it didn't seem to be slowing down or stopping. Sakuyamon charged him, Warriormon dropped his arm down and twisted to the side a bit, he suddenly brought it up slamming it into Sakuyamon's chest. She landed a few feet away from Reddmon, he looked over and watched the Warriormon slowly stomp toward them. \"Warriormon's only move fast when the want to and that's not very often\" Reddmon thought to himself as he stumbled over to Sakuyamon and lifted her into his arms. He heard movement behind him and saw Gallantmon, lance ready, charging toward him. \"Right over there buddy\" Reddmon said as he motioned toward the Warriormon, Gallantmon charged past him and slammed into the Warriormon. Reddmon took this time to get Sakuyamon to safety, he landed on a nearby rooftop and looked at the unconscious Sakuyamon. \"Only a kiss from a handsome prince can wake the sleeping beauty\" Reddmon said as he slowly moved in and kissed her softly on the lips...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHWACK<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it would work\" Reddmon said as he rubbed the side of his face, \"geez what's that face of yours made out of\" Sakuyamon said as she rubbed her hand. \"You should stay here and rest I'll go help your friend down there\" he said as he stood and stumbled over to edge of the building. \"You're in no condition either\" she said as she tried to stand up, only to fall back, \"maybe, maybe not\" he said as he jumped down. Gallantmon was on his stomach, pinned under Warriormon's foot, \"HEY UGLY OVER HERE\" Reddmon yelled as he jumped up and down waving. Warriormon looked over and began stomping over to Reddmon, giving Gallantmon the time to get up and attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bout damn time you got here\" Reddmon said as he watched the Warriormon's data dissolve, Gallantmon stepped forward and brought the tip of his lance underneath Reddmon muzzle. \"Hey watch it you could poke someone's eye out with that thing\" Reddmon said as he pushed the lance away. \"You're not getting away this time\" Gallantmon said as he brought the lance back under his muzzle. \"Yeah yeah, hey listen I...WHAT THE HELL'S THAT\" Reddmon said, Gallantmon looked behind him. \"Sucker\" Reddmon thought as he disappeared, Gallantmon looked back and began stomping the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakuyamon had fallen back asleep and was sitting against a wall, Reddmon sat there staring at her. \"What is this\" he thought as he looked at her, \"this feeling... it's strange, I don't like it\".

Pulling out her D-Power, its blue trim flashing in the moonlight, she ran down the street to the digital field that had surfaced in the soccer field outside Takato's school. She put her sunglasses on as she burst through the layer of fog to the inside of the field. A gloomy purple tint put everything into a serious mood, and a second later Renamon came into focus beside Rika. Holding up her D-Power, she pointed it around; nothing. \"I hope we didn't come all the way out here for nothing.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this digimon?\" Renamon murmured. Her ice blue eyes gazed around the empty field, looking for something, anything, to show why there was the fog. A glancing blow to Renamon's right shoulder brought her around. \"Hey!\" she spun on her attacker, lashing out reflexively. At first she thought she saw herself, but as the figure passed out of the shadows and into the moonlight, she heard Rika give a little snort. Her D-Power surged to life, the screen lighting up and producing an image of a red, fox-like, two-tailed digimon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reddmon. A Rookie level virus-type. His Obsidian Claw attack leaves opponents in the dark.\" she paused for a second. \"He looks a little like you, Renamon. Are you related or something?\" after another few seconds of silence, Rika sighed. \"You know what to do,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\" Renamon grated. She jumped high into the air. \"Diamond storm!\" At once, little glittering shards of data apparated and hurled down towards the other digimon. He quickly jumped to the side, deftly manouvering out of the way. Lunging right at Renamon, he spread his arms wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obsidian claw!\" he cried, slashing at Renamon. He caught her a direct blow to the chest, and she crashed down to the ground. Rika's frame tensed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Renamon? Get up!\" after her partner made no move, Rika whipped out her pack of cards. Selecting one, she held her D-Power in front of her.<br>\r\n\"Digi modify!\" she shouted, swiping the card without another moments thought.</span></div></div>",
