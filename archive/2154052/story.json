            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I sat in my new home eating cold soup, careful not to make any noise. If anyone or anything heard me on the outside, I was a goner. I was hiding in a gas station off of a highway, miles from the nearest town. Here I was free from tickling for now, besides the cockroaches, which had mutated to be pink and have feathery legs. There weren't too many though so I could usually fend them off pretty quickly even if they did get a few giggles out of me. I dropped my soup as one assaulted my foot. I squealed and smashed with my hand. The tickle on my foot reminded me of the day it all started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was with my girlfriend, Emily, and we were watching a movie. She was laying back with her feet in my lap as I gave her a foot massage. The window was open and a strong breeze came through the window. I felt my whole body almost immediately begin to tingle, it felt so sensitive. Suddenly Emily's demeanor changed, I couldn't put my finger on what had happened but she was definitely different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never give you foot massages, why don't you lie back and let me take care of you.\" She smiled sweetly and sat up patting her lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok...\" I agreed, but felt as though something fishy was going on. As soon as I laid my feet in her lap, she put them in a headlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're mine now!\" She seemed insane at this point but I didn't have time to think about it as she frantically scratched her nails over my soles and nibbled on my toes. It tickled like nothing I had ever felt before. I screamed and bucked but was unable to shake her off. I was nearly in tears when, luckily, her two kittens pounced on her feet and licked all over her feet and toes without letting go. She squealed and fell to the ground in a giggling heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI caught my breath and decided that I had to figure out what was going on. I ran out the front door, hopped in my car and sped off. As I drove through the town I saw countless scenes of tickle horror. My neighbor was a single father with three teenaged daughters. He was hogtied and being mercilessly tickled by all three. As I continued driving I saw that an apple tree had caught a girl by the feet and dangled her in the air brushing its leaves over her feet. The last thing I saw before I escaped the town was a women in nylons being swarmed by ants, laughing hysterically trying to swat them away. And that was the last I saw of my old home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\nSuddenly I heard the front door to the gas station creak open. I peaked around the shelf, luckily I wasn't seen. It was a girl. 'Damn it!' She was about 18, brunette, and was wearing opaque white tights, cotton black booty shorts, and a pink sports bra. She was very cute, and her outfit made her an easy target, but something didn't feel right. It couldn't be this easy. She crept through the aisles as I slid away trying to avoid detection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're in here!\" she yelled in an excited way. Damn, she had came across my spilt soup. In terrible timing a cockroach got stuck in my shirt. I let out a slight chuckle being caught off guard before crushing it. I had to bolt. I ran towards the door. Her footsteps were right behind me!</span></div></div>",

Sprinting as fast as I could, I could hear her footsteps right behind me. As I made it out the doorway, I made a critical error and tripped over it, stumbling slightly, but managing to stay on my feet. That didn't matter however as that slight stumble slowed me down just long enough for the girl to catch up with me. Before I even had a chance to recover, she pounced on me literally, jumping on my back and tackling me to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I've got you now\" The girl said excitedly, sitting on my back as I tried throwing her off. \"Ooh, and you're a fighter? No worries, I know just how to handle that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't have a chance to fight back before she slipped out a wet cloth and held it over my mouth and nose. The chloroform on the cloth quickly started taking effect as I became dizzy and lightheaded. I tried in vain to fight her off, to put up more of a struggle, but it was useless. My limbs became heavy and my moves sluggish as I attempted to get her off my back while grabbing at the rag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me!\" I said, my voice muffled by the cloth as I continued to try fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, don't fight it,\" The girl told me in a faux comforting voice. \"Just close your eyes and go to sleep. I promise we'll have a lot of fun real soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Get...off,\" I said, slowing down even more through my attempts to resist the chloroform. \"Don't... don't... don't... tickle me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, don't worry, I won't tickle you just yet\" I heard her say, slowly fading out of consciousness. \"I've gotta take you somewhere safe &amp; secure first. So just ease on up and go to sleep\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attempts at defense crawled to a halt as I stopped struggling. Darkness was starting to creep in and I didn't have the strength to put up anymore of a fight. My arms went from trying to grab the chloroformed rag to dropping to the ground. Shortly after that, my head lowered onto the ground and I lost consciousness. The last thing I heard before fading to black was the girl saying \"I can just tell I'm going to have some real fun with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't know how much time passed before I regained consciousness, but when I came to, I found myself lying on a metal bed. I blinked a few times before looking around to get a feel of my surroundings. From the looks of things, I was in some kind of medical room or something. To be more specific, it looked like I was in either an autopsy room or the lobotomy room of some mental ward. I shivered slightly as I felt a breeze blow around my body before I realized that I'd been stripped to nothing but my underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I on a bed?\" I asked myself as things became more clear. My head was still spinning from the chloroform so I tried reaching my hand up to clutch it. That's when I found out that I had been tightly secured to said bed/examination table. My arms were stretched straight up over my head with straps around my wrists and elbows keeping me tied down. My legs had been similarly secured, with straps fastened around my knees and ankles. Try as I might, I couldn't break the bonds. That's when I heard the girl's voice speak to me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to see that you've finally awakened\" She said sweetly, smiling from ear to ear. \"I was beginning to think that I'd used too much chloroform and that you'd never wake up\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, I'll give you anything you want, just let me go\" I pleaded with her. I knew that she likely wouldn't listen, but I had to try something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let you go?\" The girl replied, giving me a look as if I were crazy. \"Oh no, no, no. Not before I tickle you silly.\" She walked around the table, examining me closely. \"Now, you can make things easy and tell me where you're most ticklish, or you can be stubborn and I can find out for myself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed silent and didn't utter a word, instead looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the silent treatment? I guess that means you're not going to tell me, huh?\" The girl asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head and said \"No way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl gave me a huge cheshire cat esque smile and said \"That's perfectly fine with me! It just means more fun for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe circled the table, looking down at me like a vulture. I could've sworn I saw her lick her lips before she said \"Now, now, where to start my test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her very long to decide as she walked to my legs and squeezed my thighs. That got a few giggles out of me but nothing more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheheheheheh\" I chuckled, but didn't even make an attempt to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't expect that to be your most ticklish spot\" The girl said. \"The thighs rarely are for most people\" She then moved so she was standing over my head. \"Why don't we try... here!\" She exclaimed before suddenly plunging her fingers into my armpits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Heheheheheheh cut it out hahahaha\" I said, squirming slightly but not letting out anything more than a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, a good reaction, but still not quite what I'm looking for\" She said, walking down to my bare feet. \"How about these feet of yours?\" She stroked one finger down each of my soles, catching me off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eek! Ehehehehehehehehehehehe No Wait!\" I protested, bursting into high pitched squeals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm, these feet seem rather ticklish\" The girl noted with a hint of excitement as she used all ten fingers to tickle my feet, running her fingers from my heels to my toes and back again, occasionally tickling the bottom of my toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nohohoho! Dohohon't tickle my hahahahahahahahaha tohohohoes hehehehehehe\" I pleaded. She hadn't even reached my real weak spot yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she must've knew this as the next thing she said was \"While I'm loving the reaction I'm getting, I doubt that this is where you're most ticklish\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl left my feet alone and walked back to my upper body. She balled her hands into fists and began rapidly grazing her knuckles up &amp; down my ribcage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gahahahahaha! Ohohoho pleahehehese! Ihihihi can't stand huhuhuhuh being tickled Ehehehehehehehe!\" I said through my laughter. She stopped after a minute or two as her eyes looked to my belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one more place left to test and that's this tummy of yours\" She said cheerfully. My eyes widened in horror for a split second as that was where I was most ticklish. If she found that out, I'd be done for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not there, anywhere but there\" I pleaded desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, my, your tummy must be quite ticklish if you're begging this much\" The girl replied before she moved her hands down and began using her fingers to spider tickle my belly. I instantly lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha hahahahahahahahahaha\" I shrieked, laughing at the top of my lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you appear to be quite the ticklish subject\" The girl noted, stopping briefly to look me over. \"Now, the only question is: where do I wanna tickle you first? Do I wanna tickle your tummy first and drive you crazy or do I wanna start slow and work my way up? Or do I wanna just be random and tickle you wherever?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile on her face, she ultimately decided to tickle my...</span></div></div>",

I had found an abandoned mansion that was clear of any people or potential tickle hazards. I spent a few months in this mansion before I ran out of supplies. Those were the loneliest months of my entire life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was the whole area lacking in population, but I had no way to connect with the outside world anymore. I would have times where moments in my life would flash, making me realize how sad of a life I live now. My family and loved ones now gone from my life because of the virus, leaving me with no one to trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy girlfriend isn't the only one to be infected. I had checked on my family after my knowledge of the outbreak came to be, but I was already too late. I walked in to see my Dad hogtied and exhausted before I had been captured by my mother and older sister. It had become a routine for them to tickle torture our feet for six hours total each day, luckily it wasn't at once. One day my Dad escaped but left me to continue being tickled. My Mom and sister would even invite Aunts, friends, female neighbors, and co-workers to tickle me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would always remember the way they tickled me. I would be either hogtied or put in tickle stocks. I would only wear jeans and underwear, and sometimes it would only be underwear. And it would always be the same: they would spend 15 minutes on my upper body, then they would tickle my feet for 1 hour, and lastly would tickle both for 15 more minutes. The way they would scratch and wiggle their fingers on my skin was chilling. When I escaped, it felt like escaping the death sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day of my stay in the mansion, I had a memory flash again. For some reason however, it didn't seem to be recognizable to me. But while I was trying to decipher it, I was caught by a hooded woman. She tied me up in a fancy contraption made exclusively for tickle torture. She told me,\" You thought that you were safe here but now I have you all to myself.\" I was so scared of what she would do to me. She grabbed my boots and started to remove them. I desperately try to find a way of escape. I noticed that the key was close to where my hand was. I try and reach for the key as she get closer to attacking me.</span></div></div>",

Its just that I didn't want you to run away without knowing what happened.\" Shawn tells me. His face turned bright red and said. \"Im sorry that was a lie. The real reason is that I need some help and I didn't want you to leave.\" Shawn told me. \"Um o-okay c-can you untie me p-please?\" I ask him. \"Oh yea right. I'm sorry I should have just asked you and not have tied you up.\" Shawn said. \"Its o-okay.\" I tell him. I then remove the blanket that was in me. I then blush realizing that I wasn't wearing pants or a shirt. I immediately pull the blanket that was on me back on me. As I look at Shawn I see that his face is also red. \"Oh I'm I just um I took um I'm sorry I um I didn't um look um at you um much I um mean at all I um I'm sorry.\" Shawn said. His face red as a tomato. \"It um o-okay.\" I tell him. \"I um... I'll um go get you some clothes.\" Shawn tells me. I just wait there for five minutes until he comes back with some clothes. \"H-here you go.\" He says his face red. \"Hey Shawn.\" I call him. \"Yea?\" He asks me. \"What do you need help with?\" I ask him. \"Oh yea. Um there is a bigger hospital that I think is safe. But I don't want to go alone.\" He tells me. \"I'll go.\" I tell him. \"Really? Thanks!\" Shawn tells me as he goes over to hug me. I blush and then hug back. \"I'll um go step outside so you can put your clothes on.\" Shawn tells me blushing. As soon as he closes the door I get out of bed and put on the clothes he gave me. I put on black jeans, a belt, a green shirt, a dark green jacket' socks, and some boots. When I finished Shawn knocked on the door. \"Hey are you done?\" He asks me. \"Yea come in.\" I tell him.  \"So do you want to go now or?\" He asks me. \"We can go now.\" I tell him. \"Great! Lets go!\" He says. As we walk carefully to the hospital I hear him humming a song. \"Hey Shawn what are you humming?\" I ask him. \"Oh um I'm humming a song.\" He says. \"What song?\" I ask him. \"It's a song I made.\" (He actually did make the song listen to it sometime) \"What's it called?\" I ask him. \"It's called life of the party.\" He answers. \"Cool do you think you could sing it right WATCH OUT!\" I say pushing him down. I then got grabbed by the vines that were going after Shawn. \"Oliver!\" I hear him yell. The vines slid under my shirt and tickled my armpits. \"Hahahaha run hahaha Shawn hahaha!\" I yell. The more vines lift up my shirt and start tickling my ribs. \"Hahahaha Shawn hahahaha I said hahaha run hahaha!\" More vines come and start tickling my sides. \"I'm not leaving you!\" Shawn said running over the the vines trying to cut them. \"Hahaha Shawn hahaha go hahaha run haha!\" I kept telling him. The vines the grabbed Shawn and started tickling his abs and belly button. \"Hahahaha I haha told haha you haha to haha go!\" I told him. \"HAHA I HAHAHA TOLD YOU HAHAHA IM NOT HAHA LEAVING HAHAHA YOU HAHAHA!\" Shawn yelled. \"Now hahaha we're both hahaha stuck hahaha!\" Shawn is so ticklish that he passed out in 30 minutes while I passed out in 45 minutes. I woke up in a hospital bed again but this time Shawn was also in a hospital bed next to me. Shawn then woke up and we were both tied up. \"Ughh where are we?\" Shawn said. \"Ugh I'm not sure.\" I told him. We both realized we were in the hospital we were heading to. \"Hey Shawn?\" I call him. \"Yea?\" He responded. \"Are you wearing clothes?\" I ask blushing realizing I'm only on my boxer briefs. Shawn then blushes and replies. \"N-no. Just my boxer briefs.\" His face as red as mine. Then the door opened and we were both scared what it would be.</span></div></div>",

Male subjects felt an increased sensitive to tickling when subject to it, females also felt an increased sense of sensitivity to tickling but also an undeniable urge to tickle men, and animals and plants mutating and adapting behavior for the purpose of tickling humans. The scariest thing about this virus is that it spreads from its host airborne to new hosts. Once the doctors had realized it, it was too late. They had already infected the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly the world fell into disarray. The virus had overtaken the world in under 48 hours. The world was one giant tickle war with women seeking out men to tickle for the rest of their lives and the wildlife helping out.
