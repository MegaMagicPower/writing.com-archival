A broken marriage and his separation from his children had thrown his life into a hole that he felt there could be no escape from his downward spiral. Three years after the divorce Jeff lost his well paying job at the motor plant and was now forced to stock shelves at Wal-Mart. Since the divorce Jeff had not been in a relationship and was struggling to cope with life. Since his wife had kicked him out Jeff was forced to buy a small home on the outskirts of town that he himself hated. It was small, stuffy, and not the property that he had originally payed for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was having an average Friday night sitting in his small home watching tv and sipping on a six pack of beer. Suddenly his phone started ringing and he picked it up, \"Hello?\" Jeff instantly recognized the voice at the other end, \"Hey Jeff\" answered Jeff's ex-wife \"I need to talk to you about the kids.\" Jeff chuckled, \"What about the kids?\" Mindy, Jeff's ex, said, \"I was wondering if you could watch them this weekend? My boyfriend and I are going to Florida and I need someone to watch them.\" Jeff, excited to see his children which he hadn't seen in a year, answered yes and learned that his son and daughter would be at his house tomorrow night. Jeff thanked Mindy and hung up the phone.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs Jeff hung up the phone he heard a loud crash in his back yard. \"What the fuck?\" stammered Jeff as he got up to see what was going on. A small crater was steaming in Jeff's back yard and he walked over to look at it. On the ground there was a cantaloupe sized rock. Jeff reached down and poked the rock. Surprisingly the rock was cool to the touch, but as he touched it a crack began to appear on the stone. Suddenly it cracked open like an egg and two necklaces as well as a metal plate were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in, Jeff pulled out the necklaces and inspected them. They were made of a shiny platinum material and was a series of chains intertwined and only one had a large gold pendent at the bottom. Confused, Jeff examined the metal plate and was astonished to discover English written on it! The tablet read, \"HELLO OWNER OF THE NECK-LACE PROTOTYPE. THESE NECKLACES ALLOW THE WEARER TO TRADE HEADS AND ASSUME THE LIVES OF ONE ANOTHER! CERTAIN TRAITS MAY ALSO BE EXCHANGED. BE WARNED! ONLY THE WEARER OF THE NECKLACE WITH THE PENDENT WILL BE AWARE OF THE CHANGE! ALSO, A PAIR OF PEOPLE MAY ONLY SWAP ONE ANOTHERS BODIES ONCE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwap heads? How could that be possible? Jeff looked at the necklaces and grabbed the one with the pendent and put it on and stared at the other one. Jeff thought, \"If I'm going to swap heads I want to know it.\" Jeff looked at the other necklace and began to ponder what to do. These necklaces were probably fake, but they could be real. Jeff then looked across the road towards his neighbors the Watalskis. The husbands name was Tim. He was 48 and the local orthodontist. Tim was one of the wealthiest men in town and he had used that wealth to acquire a trophy wife, Susan. Susan was as beautiful as can be. She was 25 and had the body of a model. Before meeting Tim Susan was a cheerleader in college and then worked at the local strip joint Catz. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at their house Jeff knew what to do. He went inside, grabbed an envelope and put the other necklace inside of it. He then wrote on it Tim Watalski. Jeff then walked across the street and put it in their mailbox. Jeff grabbed his necklace and smiled at the possibility of being Tim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff went back inside his house and continued to drink beer thinking of the possibility to be a different person. As Jeff continued to drink, he eventually passed out. Jeff was awoken by a jolting on his neck. Jeff opened his eyes and saw that it was 10 in the morning and then he felt a chocking feeling around his neck. Jeff looked down and saw that the necklace had tightened around his neck and was almost chocking him. Jeff smiled as he realized that he was about to switch with Tim. Suddenly Jeff felt his head lower into his torso. He smiled as his head eventually lowered all the way into his torso. When his head disappeared he lost all feeling to his body and everything went dark. Suddenly Jeff could feel again but everything was wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head slowly began to emerge again, but as it emerged he saw a mirror in front of him and wanted to vomit. Jeff's head was emerging from the body of the 25 year old Susan Watalski! He watched in horror as his head popped out of Susan's body dressed in a purple top and a pair of the tightest shorts JEff had ever seen <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3944697427_80cfe942b3_o.jpg.\" target=\"_blank\">http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2428/3944...</a> Jeff's jaw dropped as he began to walk around in Susan's high heels and as he ran his hands down her slender form. Jeff was dumbstruck when suddenly he heard a voice down the hallway</span></div></div>",

Despite the sight of his 45 year old male head sitting atop Susan Watalski's stunningly-hot 25 year old female body in the reflection before him, despite the sensations and feel of that body washing over him even as he looked at it, he couldn't force himself to believe that any of this was really happening. Finally, he managed to stammer back a forced answer to the voice. \"Uhh...just a....just a minute. I'm...a...I'm not ready...\" he trailed off as he walked forward on Susan's ridiculously high heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Susan's long, lovely legs and feeling the cool air of the room on them, Jeff couldn't help but reach down and run the strange new fingers he found himself possessing over their smooth, supple surfaces. \"Jesus...\" he whispered, \"This is really Susan's body...my head is on Susan's body...\" he continued as he looked over the beautiful young woman's body from his new all too close vantage point. He ran Susan's hands up and over his new hips and on to her tight little belly. As he continued upward he felt the curve of her amazing tits straining against both the fabric of her purple shirt, and, what Jeff could only assume was a bra. Having long admired Mrs. Watalski's body from afar, he was actually beginning to enjoy the opportunity to assess it from such an incredibly close position when the bizarre reality of what was happening hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked up at himself in the mirror and gazed at his shocked, original male face now resting on Susan's slender shoulders. He looked at the necklace that had obviously put him there and shook his head. \"I've got to get back to my own body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jeff struggled to come to terms with what had happened. The mysterious necklaces that he had found in his back yard turned out to have the capability to switch people's heads. Jeff had learned this first hand as his head now sat firmly attached to the beautiful body of Susan Watalski. Jeff looked around the large luscious bedroom he and his 25 year old female body were situated in. Jeff struggled to walk on Susan's high heels as he began to walk to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the door Jeff was greeted by his neighbor Dr. Watalski, \"Hey babe. You ready to go out?\" Jeff was amazed. Since he was wearing the necklace with the pendent, everyone thought that he was actually Susan instead of Jeff Baker. Jeff stammered, \"I'm not feeling too well. Why don't you just go on without me sweety.\" Dr. Watalski looked concerned and asked, \"Alright I guess. You just make sure you rest. By the way honey you look sexy in those shorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff looked down at the skin tight jean shorts his feminine legs were encased in and got a faint smile on his face, \"Thanks...\" Dr. Watalski left the room and Jeff could hear his car leaving the large home's garage. Jeff was thankful. He didn't have to spend the afternoon walking around town with what everyone must think to be his husband. Jeff left the bedroom and began to walk around the Watalski home and he was surprised at the sheer elegance of it. As Jeff looked around one of the windows he saw his home across the yard and to his complete surprise he saw Susan Watalski standing on his porch. The only problem was that Susan's beautiful 25 year old head was attached to Jeff's 45 year old body. To Jeff's surprise Susan was not freaking out but was actually acting much like he would on a Sunday afternoon. \"This is so fucking messed up\" Jeff stammered out loud as he watched his former body sit on what had been his porch. Jeff remembered the note the necklaces had left and knew that there would be no possible way to switch back with Susan. He knew that in order to get his body back he first had to switch with someone else, but in order to switch with someone else he had to aquire the other necklace that Susan currently possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff...</span></div></div>",

As he struggled to stay upright on Susan's former heels and legs, he did his best to formulate some kind of plan. All he knew for sure was that he had to get over there and get that other necklace from the equally misplaced young woman who now had his former body and seemed to believe that she was him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the sound of his new heels clicking and the alien sensations of Susan's hips and breasts swaying and straining against the fabric of her purple top and tiny jean shorts, Jeff found his mind wandering. The utter wrongness of his new position on Susan's body was tempered with an odd appreciation bordering on lust that he was feeling with his new ability to experience the young woman's body from his current vantage point. He closed his eyes and shook his head vigourously...he was a man damn it! and he was going to get his body back as soon as possible!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway across the street, Jeff cursed his decision to head straight over to his former home. \"I should have switched to some more sensible shoes and some clothes that left more to the imagination...\" he muttered to himself as he noticed passing motorists and pedestrians admiring the sight of his \"borrowed\" mouth-wateringly sexy 25-year-old female body. He could feel the cool breeze on Susan's cleavage and legs and the sensation of goosebumps rising on her smooth and delectable flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jeff neared his former front porch, he could see his former body seated on his front swing in the exact same manner he himself had positioned it a million times before whilst enjoying a day off. The only difference was that Susan's pretty young head now sat firmly on his broad shoulders. He could see the young woman look up curiously as he neared the porch. To his shock, he could see the umistakable gaze of someone lustfully admiring from afar. Here pretty eyes traveled up Jeff's new legs, hips, and tits with obvious sexual appreciation. \"Jesus...she's checking me out like I used to do to her...\" Jeff whispered to himself in surprise. </span></div></div>",

She fumbled with a cup of coffee she had been holding as she tried to get her composure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff found himself staring at her for a bit before he could manage an answer. As bizarre as his own situation was, he was having an even harder time wrapping his mind around the sight of the figure before him. Susan's pretty young female face smiled nervously at him with her long blond locks of hair framing it perfectly. He'd have been all to willing to admire her beauty on any other day, but the sight of that face on what had until very recently been his own body made him more than a little nauseous! His mid-forties male body looked fidgety and a tad paunchy as Susan seemed to be doing her best to look nonchalant and to suck in Jeff's former gut. Jeff immediately recognized his favorite set of \"day-off\" clothes; an old baseball jersey, a pair of baggy khakis, and his old dependable flip-flops. If he could have ignored Susan's pretty, nervous head, it would have been exactly as looking in a mirror. Jeff furrowed his brow and decided to dive into the conversation. He had to get that necklace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh...yes...Hello Suuu...uh...I mean Mr. Bakers...I hate to bother you but...\" he fumbled with his words as he tried to come up with some plan of action on the fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan smiled broadly as she looked Jeff's new body over. Jeff could tell that she was drinking in the sight of the new him. Her eyes ran up him from his cute new toes poking out of the purple heels on his feet up to the soft, smooth shoulders his head now rested on. She seemed to be trying to do so without his notice, but Jeff knew exactly what she was doing. \"Jesus...am I this obvious when I stare at her?!?!\" Jeff wondered to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...call me Jeff\" Susan beamed, \"we are neighbors after all, might as well be neighborly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff did his best to smile back as he glanced over his own misplaced body. Jeff couldn't help but notice his former khaki's tenting around his own former crotch. \"Great...she's getting hard...\" he mentally grimaced. \"Thank you...Jeff...\" he managed to answer as he looked at the necklace below Susan's head. He had to get that damned thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair...</span></div></div>",

Sam was dressed like any 13 year old kid in his baggy jeans and zip up jacket. Sarah on the other hand looked way too old for a 16 year old girl. Dressed in her white top and short mini skirt Jeff was angered <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.iheartthat.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/21242_Miley_Cyrus_2009_Teen_Choice_Awards_August_9th_2009_033_122_472lo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.iheartthat.com/wp-content/upl...</a> . Before he could say anything, Susan (believing she was Jeff) stepped in. \"Sarah! Why do you look like that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah smiled, \"I thought you would be stressed by it!\" Susan, now with Jeff's forty some year old body walked over and hugged the two kids. Jeff longed to be back on his body to share in the experience, but he had his head attached to Susan's 25 year old body. Jeff struggled to come to terms with the situation as he stood awkwardly in his high heels and short shorts. As Susan hugged the kids she turned around to Jeff and said, \"I'm sorry Susan. We'll have to continue this talk later. I really need to spend some time with my kids.\" As the three of them went inside Jeff struggled with what to do next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff reluctantly walked across the street back to what was now his mansion. As his heels propelled by his feminine legs clicked across the road. As Jeff reached the front door he felt a warm sensation around his neck. Confused, Jeff looked down at his ample cleavage and saw the pendent on his necklace beginning to glow. Jeff hurried and tried to pull off the necklace, but it tightened too quickly around his neck. Jeff continued to struggle with Susan's dainty hands as his head slowly descended into Susan's sexy body. Jeff fought as hard as he could to pull the necklace off as he felt some of Susan's nails breaking but it was too late. Eventually Jeff's head sank all the way into Susan's frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Jeff could feel again but  </span></div></div>",

In no time at all he felt sensation return to him as his head emerged onto an entirely different neck and shoulders. Looking down, he could feel his feet still forced up into the position a pair of high heels would subject them too. He could also feel the cool air of the breeze on legs that were almost as exposed as Susan's had been in her preposterous shorts. After a moment to focus, Jeff realized where his head had ended up; he was now affixed to the pretty young body of his daughter Sarah!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite himself Jeff cursed. \"Damn it! Not Sarah!\" he reached up and could feel that the pendant necklace was securely fastened around the thin young neck of his 16 year old daughter. He teetered a bit as he looked down at the revealing ensemble he had been shocked to see Sarah wearing earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Sis, are you talking to yourself now?\"  Sam chuckled as he nudged Jeff's soft new arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan, her pretty head still sitting on Jeff's middle aged male body walked over with concern in her eyes. \"Are you okay honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff regained his composure. \"Oh! Uh...I'm fine guys. Don't worry.\" He finally manged to squeak out. Looking across the street, he could see Susan Watalski's ravishing, long legged body now crowned by the cute teenage head and face of his daughter standing on the Watalskis' front porch. She stumbled a bit on her new heels before reaching up to the other necklace now resting on her new neck. Shaking her head a bit a smile crossed her lips as she turned to go into the house; apparently slipping into her new role as Mrs. Watalski. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! I HAVE to get that damned necklace back and sort this out!\" Jeff thought to himself. </span></div></div>",

The small community was beginning to stir to life when Sam Baker's alarm clock began to ring loudly. \"Son of a bitch.\" Sam muttered as he quickly smacked his alarm. Groggily awoken, Sam began to prepare for school. Searching through his closet Sam scruffed up a pair of jeans and a simple red shirt. Next he found a zipped up hoody and grabbed his backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHurrying down the stairs Sam grabbed a pop-tart from the pantry and sat down at the table. His Dad Jeff Baker was already there drinking his morning coffee and reading the morning paper. Sam grabbed the front section and began to read. Most interestingly he noticed an article titled METEOR SHOWER HITS RIVER FALLS. According to the paper a meteor shower had passed last night and across town some meteor had hit a barn. Sam was distracted by the paper when his dad murmured, \"Shouldn't you be going to school?\" Sam looked at the clock and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way to school Sam came across one of the abandoned houses on the block and noticed a smoldering piece of the yard. Confused, Sam walked into the yard to investigate. On the ground there was a cantaloupe sized rock. Sam raised his eyebrows as he realized that it was probably another meteor from the shower. Sam reached down and poked the rock. Surprisingly the rock was cool to the touch, but as he touched it a crack began to appear on the stone. Suddenly it cracked open like an egg and two necklaces as well as a metal plate were inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching in, Sam pulled out the necklaces and inspected them. They were made of a shiny platinum material and was a series of chains intertwined and only one had a large gold pendent at the bottom. Confused, Sam examined the metal plate and was astonished to discover English written on it!  The tablet read, \"HELLO OWNER OF THE NECK-LACE PROTOTYPE. THESE NECKLACES ALLOW THE WEARER TO TRADE HEADS AND ASSUME THE LIVES OF ONE ANOTHER! CERTAIN TRAITS MAY ALSO BE EXCHANGED. BE WARNED! ONLY THE WEARER OF THE NECKLACE WITH THE PENDENT WILL BE AWARE OF THE CHANGE! ALSO, A PAIR OF PEOPLE MAY ONLY SWAP ONE ANOTHERS BODIES ONCE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam couldn't believe what he was reading! Swap heads? That was stuff of Sci-Fi! It couldn't be possible.Confused and now fascinated with the necklaces Sam walked to school. Looking at his watch he knew he had a little time before he was late. Walking into the building Sam tried to hurry past the front as he saw his enemy, Daniel Price. Daniel was 3 years older than Sam and stood nearly 8 inches taller than him at 6'2. Daniel also played Football for the team and for some reason picked Sam to be his victim of bullying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam desperately tried to get past Daniel without being seen, Daniel picked him out of the crowd. Greeted by a shove to the back, Sam turned around to face the bully. Daniel grabbed Sam by the collar and assertively asked, \"Do you have my lunch money kid?\" Sam, fearing for his life, pulled out 3 dollars and handed them over to Daniel. Daniel smiled and shoved Sam to the ground. Sam gathered himself and watched Daniel walk over to his girlfriend Amanda Summers. Amanda the most popular girl in school was a beauty. She had been in pageants and had one the Miss River Falls 5 times and today was looking great in her tight jeans and mid-riff revealing t-shirt. Her glasses also added to her sexiness <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://lh5.ggpht.com/_oXRE85sZw60/TFC3UdlzPiI/AAAAAAAAGCg/dLZNaIyS9_Q/megan-fox-voltron-shirt-brian-austin-green-lunch-sherman-oaks-14.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://lh5.ggpht.com/_oXRE85sZw60/TFC3Ud...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam gathered his backpack he saw the necklaces laying on the ground and a grin grew across his face. Sam knew that if the necklaces truly worked he'd be able to swap his head and lives with Daniel and bully him for once. Sam smiled as he grabbed the necklaces and began to wander to the locker bays. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in shop class had never really payed off until Sam had discovered a way to open lockers without knowing the combos. Sam heard the bell ring and people began to walk into class. He knew this was his opportunity to plant the necklace without the pendent into Daniel's locker. Sam cracked open the lock and put the necklace on the inside of the door. Sam smiled as he knew that as soon as Daniel saw it he would slip it on and he would effectively be him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam closed the locker and walked into his first period class. Luckily his teacher was cool and he bought Sam's, \"I was talking to another teacher\" excuse. The class seemed to take forever to Sam waited anxiously for the period to end so he could switch heads with Daniel and finally be the bully not the bully-ed. After a hour and a half and waiting the bell finally rang. As it rang Sam slipped the necklace with the pendent around his neck and he hurried to the locker bay. As Sam hid behind some lockers he saw Daniel emerge and head to his locker. As Sam watched anxiously, Daniel opened the locker and after a few seconds pulled the necklace out of the locker. Daniel examined it and Sam anticipated the swap. As Daniel was about to slip the necklace around his neck he was interrupted by his girlfriend Amanda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam grew even more excited as he saw Amanda thinking that in a few seconds she would be his girlfriend. As Daniel and Amanda talked Sam noticed that Amanda had grabbed the necklace and was about to put it on! As Sam desperately tried to pull off his necklace he saw that Amanda had already put the necklace on! As Sam grasped the necklace it instantly tightened around his neck to the point were it was straining against his skin. As Sam tried to pull the necklace off he looked over at Amanda and was amazed when he saw her necklace tighten also. Sam began to feel sick when he saw Amanda's head slowly lower into the area where her necklace was. It was as if her head was being sucked into her torso. Suddenly Sam felt his head begin to lower into his body. As Sam tried with all of his power to pull the necklace off he lost feeling to his body and everything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Sam could feel again, but he instantly knew that something was wrong. He could feel air on his stomach as well as jeans too tight to be his own. As Sam's head emerged from what was obviously Amanda's body he realized that his vision was blurry. Confused, Sam muttered, \"Why can't I see?\" Suddenly he was answered by Daniel's voice, \"I see your glasses. Give me a second.\" Sam stood there and a few seconds later Daniel returned and handed Sam some glasses. Sam took them and put them on and his vision was immediately clear. Sam saw first Daniel standing in front of him, but he then turned his attention to his new body. Sam saw two breasts protruding from his chest and was at a loss for words. He reached up with his new feminine hands and began to feel his breasts. They were soft and very sensitive as Sam felt his new nipples become erect. Sam then felt down to his exposed midrif which was flat and sexy looking. Sam then looked behind himself and felt Amanda's pert tight ass encased by her blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam was then interrupted by Daniel, \"Babe? Why are you feeling yourself up?\" Sam looked up at Daniel and stammered, \"I just feel weird.\" As Daniel began to put his arm around Sam, Sam saw the real Amanda off in the distance walking away. Realizing that this might be his last opportunity to get her necklace back Sam took off after her. He slung Amanda's purse over his new shoulder and hurried after his former body. Unfortunately for Sam, Amanda's flip flops wern't the best running shoes and his former body got away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked at what had just happened Sam     </span></div></div>",

Seconds ago he had hoped to end up with the body of his bully Daniel, but instead had his head affixed to his girlfriend Amanda's body in a last second incident. Shocked and astonished, Sam had to find his old body with Amanda's head on it in order to retain the necklace whose partner now rested on his neck which in turn was connected to a beautiful 18 year old woman's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that Amanda could take the necklace off and give it to someone else Sam first took off his more powerful necklace with a pendent and continued his search for his former body. As Sam walked through the halls he was amazed at the lack of responses to his current situation. Here he was, a 14 year old boy now with the body of an eighteen year old woman and no one noticed. As Sam walked down the hallway towards what had been his locker, he was greeted by another girl, \"Hey Amanda! How's it going?\" Sam, now with Amanda's body as well as eyesight adjusted Amanda's box frame glasses and said, \"I'm doing fine...How are you doing?\" The girl smiled and began to talk about her boyfriend and other things and Sam began to grow impatient. He shifted his weight to one hip and he noticed the slight jiggle in his new ass as he did so. Tired of hearing the girls pointless chatter Sam slung his new \"Juicy\" purse over his shoulder and continued his search down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sam neared his locker he saw his best friend Joe leaning against his locker and talking to a figure wearing baggy jeans, a red shirt, and a hoody. The person also had a head full of long black hair which Sam instantly recognized as Amanda. Sam crept up and heard the two's conversation. \"So how did you get that necklace Sam?\" Amanda replied, \"I was walking to school and found it with another one and this plate that said the two could swap heads, but I haven't been able to find the other one.\" Joe looked quizzically, \"Swap heads? That sounds like BS\" Amanda looked down, \"Yeah... You're probably right. II really don't need it.\" Amanda (with Sam's body) handed over the necklace to Joe and wandered off. Joe picked up the necklace and looked at it and put it on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam, realizing the opportunity</span></div></div>",

Donovan was your typical black 29 year old con man trying to get by with a record of theft and drugs. Donovan had tried to set himself straight multiple times, but  each time he tried he found his way back into danger. Donovan removed his ski mask from his head revealing his smooth trimmed head with the chin strap beard and tried to get as far away from the jewelry store as possible. Donovan saw an overpass near the local college and decided to lay low here for awhile since he knew cops never came to this part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Donovan parked under the overpass and began to sort through the pieces he had stolen. A few rings, earrings, and bracelets were in the mix, but a pair of necklaces stood out to Donovan. The two necklaces were made of a type of metal he had never seen before. It seemed to have a slight glow and wherever he touched it it grew brighter. Donovan also noticed that one of the necklaces had a larger locking mechanism to it that seemed to be made of gold. Admiring this necklace, Donovan slipped it around his neck and fastened it. Donovan then went about getting rid of his evidence of his crime, most notably the revolver he had purchased from a friend who specialized in unmarked weapons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Donovan stepped out of the car to throw the gun down the sewer, he failed to notice the other necklace fall into the street. Donovan got back in his car and drove off leaving the other necklace laying under the overpass. Little to Donovan's knowledge a group of drunk sorority sisters from the nearby college happened to stumble under that same overpass...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan got back to his apartment and laid his bag of stolen jewelry on his table. The apartment was small and meager, but it had a kitchen, a bed, and a tv. All Donovan really wanted. As Donovan went to grab some leftovers from his fridge, he felt a warm sensation come from his necklace. Ignoring it Donovan began to chow on some leftover chinese food, but the sensation from the necklace began too grow hotter and hotter. Donovan in a panic, dropped his Chinese food and reached to grab the necklace, but he couldn't because it has shrunk into his neck! Donovan could feel his flesh separated in a perfect line around where the necklace was, and began to yell for help. Before he could reach a phone a white flash filled his vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan felt like he was in the scene from Star Wars where the ship went into hyper drive and suddenly a image appeared in front of him that looked like a dorm room. The image grew closer and closer until it completely filled Donovan's vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan was freaked out and yelled, \"What the hell is going on?!\" Suddenly a feminine voice from behind him yelled back, \"We're getting drunk bitches!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonovan turned around and saw that he was indeed in a dorm room, and it was full of a bunch of sexy looking girls dressed in school gril outfits. Donovan smiled at the sight and started to walk towards them when he noticed a breeze on his legs and that he seemed to be propped up. Looking down Donovan was speechless. Donovan now had the body of some twenty year old white girl! Donovan's new white body was dressed in a ridiculously short pink school girl skirt complete with white stockings and black high heels. As Donovan turned around he saw a mirror and the horror that now presented itself <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://teenkasia.com/hosted/026_pb_schoolgirl/teen-kasia-01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://teenkasia.com/hosted/026_pb_schoo...</a> Donovan's black head rested on top of what was undoubtedly a white girl's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly... </span></div></div>",

It was the start of fall break, but decided that he just wanted to visit home instead of staying at home the whole break.  He had a great family, but he wanted some time to himself.<br>\r\nGreg wasn't a loner, but wasn't a social butterfly either.  He had a few very close friends, along with a few others, and he liked it that way.  He friendly and easy to get along with, but he needed his time alone to recharge.<br>\r\nHe was just past a rural intersection when he saw a rock sticking out of the ground.  He stopped the car.  This didn't look right.<br>\r\nHe got out ad walked over.  It looked like a meteorite hit, but it was very strange.  He saw two necklaces, along with writing on the side of the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nATTENTION!  You have been given a pair of unique necklaces.  When two people put them on, it switches both their heads and lives.  If you do this, you have to remove the necklaces, then put them back on in order to switch again.  Only you, the reader of this, will know wha has happened.  This is a great gift.  Use it well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he finished reading, the meteorite started to vaporize, almost like it knew he had finished reading.  He shrugged, then took both necklaces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back to the university to see that there were some people left.  The fastest way to his dorm room was past the women's side his his quad.  He walked up to the fourth floor, past the room of Amber Jennings.  He knew her and liked her, mostly because she was just a decent person, but the fact that she was smoking hot was not a bad reason either.  Her boyfriend, though, left something to be desired.  He was a linebacker for the football team, and while he and Greg did get along, Greg never understood why she put up with him.  He was a bit of an idiot to women and not really all that bright.  Amber was extremely intelligent, and could do better.  Greg stumbled on an idea.  Finding a piece of paper, he wrote \"put this on\" in girly-type writing, put the necklace on the door, then walked away.  He wasn't concerned with theft, since he saw Amber's boyfriend, Joe, slowly making his way up the stairs as he went up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg walked away from the dorm room and walked into his own room.  By virtue of his roommate washing out already, he had all of it to himself.  He put on the TV and gave it about fifteen minutes, the put on the necklace himself.</span></div></div>",

While he wanted to be Joe, this could be just as fun.  Plus, since his former body's now-owner now believes that she was always Greg, he figured he could still swap back if something went wrong.  He really didn't see himself in a losing situation.<br>\r\nHe went to the closet and dresser, and started pulling clothes out.  She was loaded down with clothes, far more than Greg would ever have thought.  He doubted she wore even a quarter of these on a regular basis.  After searching, he came upon several different clothing options.<br>\r\nFirst, he laid out just normal clothes, white bra and panties, jeans, t-shirt, white socks and tennis shoes.  He also laid out something a bit nicer, black dress pants, white blouse, black socks, and the same underwear.  He also grabbed something more sexy, but still reasonably casual, which was a denim miniskirt, black, more revealing (but not slutty) top, wedge sandals, and lacy black bra and panties.

He didn't know if he liked only one layer being between the world and his new vagina.<br>\r\nHe stripped the first off carefully and put the second on.  He was less comfortable, to be sure.  The blue miniskirt was tighter and restricted his movement more, but the pantyhose were a welcome addition, mostly because they added a second layer of clothing over his panties.  The halter top was okay to feel, but having a bra felt better.  However, he looked great.  If there was any flaw in his body, it couldn't be seen in these clothes.<br>\r\nHe stripped naked again, admiring his female form below his neck.<br>\r\nWhich outfit does he finally chose?</span></div></div>",

He snapped out of it, then put on the the top and mini skirt. He sat on the edge of his bed and strapped the wedge sandals to his feet.

He started looking at himself in the mirror, proud of the outfit he put together for himself, or in this case, Amber's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Greg heard a knock at the door. \"I'm coming!\" he said. He opened the door and two girls were shaking frantically. \"Amber come on! We're late for our meeting!\" one of the girls said.

She isn't even made up yet!\" the other girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry!\" The first girl, now identified as Lucy. \"I'll do it for her while you drive, okay Mia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg tried to interject, \"I, but-\" but before he knew it, he was already in the car, on the way to the far end of campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three got there swiftly. Lucy and Mia were clearly more excited and got out of the car first. Amber/Greg staggered out last. Not only was s(he) fully dressed in the sleeveless black top, denim miniskirt, and wedge sandals, but his still masculine face was made up with light eye shadow, mascara, and pink lip gloss, thanks to Lucy's makeup expertise. As much as Greg wanted to enjoy being dressed up and feeling more like a woman, his head was spinning from the whirlwind of events. S(he) followed Lucy and Mia to the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three entered a classroom. Amber/Greg sat down while Lucy and Mia talked with each other. Greg was still confused. 'I thought we're on break! What is this meeting about!?' he thought to himself. Greg looked around. The room was sparse with other students he had seen, when he was fully Greg of course. On his right, he noticed a guy looking in his direction. Greg remembered him as Alan, just someone in a few of his classes. Alan smiled at Amber/Greg, then quickly turned to the front. In that moment, Greg couldn't help but smile back. \"He's been looking at you this entire semester!\" Lucy said. \"Why don't you finally talk to him!?\" she encouraged. \"Maybe.\" Greg quickly replied. Then, on his left, someone caught his eye. In the front was a student who Greg thought was a guy with long hair. Then it came to him. 'That guy's hair looks like. . . Amber! And that's my jacket she's wearing!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone!\" the man in the front yelled. \"I'll be back soon, but we're going to start in 5 minutes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreg realized he only had a chance to talk to one of them. Should he check with Amber and see if she's aware of the changes, or talk with Alan and possibly start something?</span></div></div>",
