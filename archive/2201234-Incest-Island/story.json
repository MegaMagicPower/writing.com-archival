You look down at yourself and notice that your feet are buried in the sand and as far clothes go the swimsuit you were wearing barely survived what you went through. As you get up, you notice you older 22 year old brother Daniel in just his shorts and your younger 18 year old brother Travis totally naked. You try to run over to them but quickly fall over from various aches and pains all over your body. You then do a fast crawl over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daniel! Travis! Wake up!!\" you shout hoping they survived too<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel wakes up with a few grunts and Travis says \"five more minutes\" half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Daniel asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue\" you respond \"All I remember is the storm that hitting the boat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm complaining much, I want to know what happened to my clothes\" Travis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in any event, we should probably get used to the idea of living here until we're rescued.\" Daniel pointed out. \"I'll look around for some fire wood. John, you look around some food. Travis, you look around the island to see if you can find some shelter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, may as well and try to make some shorts while I'm at it.\" Travis says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan.\" you reply \"Meet back here in an hour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all agree and head off in different directions.</span></div></div>",
