Missing by several inches, he instead knocked the clock to the floor, where it continued its loud beeping. Not wanting to actually get up out of bed, Connor grabbed a pillow and buried his head in it, trying to drown out the noise. It was no use. His mom had bought him an industrial-strength alarm, knowing that he hated waking up in the mornings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this morning should have been different. \u00a0After all, it was Connor's 13th birthday; his first day as a teenager. Most kids look forward to that, counting down the days one by one, barely able to hold in their excitement of the magic \"-teen\" suffix. Almost all of his friends in school had big parties on their 13th birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot Connor. It may have had a little to do with the fact that, being the youngest in his class, he was thus the last one celebrating this milestone, and the big \"1-3\" didn't hold much weight among his peers. \u00a0It may have been because his parents refused to throw him a party or any real celebration. \u00a0\"You're a big man, now,\" his dad had said, \"and you'll have to do what all other men do on their birthdays: work.\" \u00a0Why, oh why couldn't this day have fallen on a weekend?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the big reason that Connor wasn't celebrating this day was that he knew that it would change nothing. \u00a0He still had to go to the same crummy school and live in the same crummy house with the same crummy family in the same crummy town in the same crummy country in the same crummy planet. \u00a0Thirteen was just a meaningless number, no different from Twelve or Fourteen, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, that's what he thought at the beginning of the day. \u00a0But at the end, well, he had an entirely new perspective.</span></div></div>",

He had never drunk alcohol, and he had plenty of sleep last night. \u00a0Maybe it was just one of those mornings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached the bathroom, flipped on the light switch, and hopped into the shower, washing the sleep from his eyes. \u00a0Though his headache and wooziness subsided, something still felt peculiar, and he couldn't quite place his finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished up in the bathroom, brushed his teeth, and then grabbed a hair drier. \u00a0It was then that he finally looked at himself in the mirror, and stopped. \u00a0Something was different! \u00a0It wasn't his hair; it was still a shaggy brown mess. \u00a0His eyes were as dark as ever, his nose and mouth were the same... \u00a0He looked at himself up and down, and noticed that...he was bigger! \u00a0His waist line was level with the bottom of the mirror just the night before, but now it was several inches above it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell's going on?\" \u00a0Connor said aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that honey?\" \u00a0It was Connor's mom's voice. \u00a0She must be outside in the hallway!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to bring this to her attention just yet, he said, \"Uh, nothing important, Mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, dear,\" she said, \"but make sure you're down for breakfast in five minutes.\" \u00a0She turned and walked down the stairs, back to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor slowly opened the door, peeked outside, and made sure no one was coming. \u00a0He then darted across the hall, back to his bedroom. \u00a0He grabbed an undershirt and a pair of boxer briefs from his dresser. \u00a0Both of them felt very tight; his undershirt didn't even cover his stomach! \u00a0The clothes he was wearing the night before were still on the floor; he picked them up and put them back on. \u00a0Whereas last night they fit just fine, this morning his shirt barely reached his belt line, and he had to struggle to get his pants on. \u00a0When he finally did, they wouldn't fasten shut, so he had to get the braided belt he hated from his closet and use it for cover, as it was the only belt that fit him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Connor said, \"this should work.\" \u00a0At this point, though, he felt his muscles begin to burn. He looked down, and was shocked by what he saw. \u00a0He could actually see his legs getting longer, as the cuff of his pants rose higher above his ankle. \u00a0The belt began to stretch further, straining to stay together, and his shirt was revealing more and more skin. \u00a0Finally, Connor heard a loud RIPPPPP sound, as his shirt tore up the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" \u00a0He said, as he quickly took his clothes off so that he wouldn't ruin any more of them. \u00a0He stood there, dumbfounded, for a few minutes, only in his undershirt and boxers, which themselves were straining to keep it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to figure out how tall he was. \u00a0He knew the top of his doorframe was seven feet off the ground, and his head was about 10 inches from that, so he had to be over six feet. \u00a0It was a gain of almost a foot, in just one night!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Connor said, \"I've heard of growth spurts, but this is ridiculous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, he heard his mother's voice. \u00a0\"Connor!! \u00a0This is the last time I'm calling you! \u00a0Get down here for breakfast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh. \u00a0Connor panicked for a moment. \u00a0He couldn't let his family see him like this, could he? \u00a0</span></div></div>",

You knew this might happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother stepped back, looked at him sadly, and then turned away. \u00a0\"Uh, no, Connor, I...I just can't believe it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor looked at his mother puzzled. \u00a0Thoughts were swirling around in his head, but then he felt that...burning sensation again. \u00a0Knowing what was coming next, he closed his eyes. \u00a0\"Here we go again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his skin tingle as it stretched out and he grew taller and taller. \u00a0His bones creaked and moaned as they lengthened. \u00a0His braces began to come loose from his teeth. \u00a0Finally, after a few seconds, it stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor opened his eyes and looked down. \u00a0His undershirt was now in tatters, and his boxer briefs were stretched almost to the limit. \u00a0He now towered above his mother by a good two feet. \u00a0He looked up and saw that his head was almost at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked into his mother's eyes and saw something he had never truly seen before: fear. \u00a0She shook her head in horror and rushed to the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor felt sorry for his mother, but deep down, he was beginning to like what was happening to him, at least a little. \u00a0He had always been on the short side, and this..whatever it was, was more than making up for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned towards the table and looked at Sara. \u00a0She was just staring at him, partly afraid, but partly admiring too. \u00a0He squatted down next to her; even squatting, his head was above Sara's at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha thinkin', Squirt?\" \u00a0He asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him for a moment. \u00a0\"You're not going to do anything to hurt us, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor chuckled, \"Of course not! \u00a0What made you think that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sara said, looking down at her cereal, \"you're pretty big now, and kinda scary. \u00a0Almost like a monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor smiled, and ran his fingers through Sara's hair. \u00a0\"Don't worry, Squirt, no matter what happens to me, I'll always be there to protect you.\"<br>\r\nSara turned back towards Connor, then reached out and hugged his arm, and gave him a kiss on his cheek. \u00a0\"My big bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor nodded. \u00a0Maybe everything would be just fine, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned back towards his mother, who was still on the phone, very flustered. \u00a0\"Listen,\" she was almost yelling now, \"I don't care what kind of meeting he's in, interrupt him!...Yes, I know. \u00a0Just tell him these two words: \u00a0It happened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor's grin quickly turned into a frown. \u00a0Who was she talking to, and what was she talking about? \u00a0She clearly knew something that she wasn't telling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she hung up the phone, he looked up at her, waiting for something anything. \u00a0She just looked at him, started to cry again, and turned back towards the kitchen, and began to wash dishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, honey,\" was her only reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, the school bus honked from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, should I get ready for school or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mother gave a half-laugh, half-sob. \u00a0\"I don't think that will be neccesary, Connor. \u00a0Sara, you go ahead and get to school, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But,\" Sara stammered, \"if Connor gets to stay home, I want to stay home too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother turned around quickly, with a much more serious face. \u00a0\"Sara Felicity Young, you get on that bus right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSulking, Sara slid out of her chair and grabbed her bookbag from the table. \u00a0She ran up and gave Connor a quick hug on the leg. \u00a0\"I'll see you later, big bro.\" Sara then turned around and ran out the door, towards the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had left, Connor turned towards his mother. \u00a0\"Listen, mom, I don't know what's going on here, but whatever it is, you don't need to take it out on Sara!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he slowly walked closer to her, she started to back away in fear. \u00a0\"Stay back! \u00a0Don't come any closer!\"<br>\r\nConnor looked at her incredulously. \u00a0\"What are you talking about? \u00a0Mom, it's me, Connor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the front door burst opened, and his dad stormed in. \u00a0An impressive figure at 6'3\" and 250 pounds, his dad looked like he could have played lineman for the Chicago Bears. \u00a0In reality, though, he was an accountant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Son,\" he said, as he looked sternly up at Connor, \"it\"s time to go.\"</span></div></div>",

his energy levels had increased along with his size, and he was able to run at nearly a full sprint, covering ten feet with each stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he came to a hill, his breathing became slightly more intense. \u00a0He stopped for \u00a0a second and looked around. \u00a0The vehicles had gotten closer; they were traveling faster than even he could, and they would catch up with him in just a few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a vehicle zoomed over the hill, honking its horn loudly. \u00a0It screeched to a halt, turning to avoid hitting Connor. \u00a0It looked like nothing he had ever seen before. \u00a0It was bigger than a tractor trailer, but was almost triangular in shape, with a large cargo space in the back. \u00a0It was armored like a tank, with several huge, thick wheels and a pointed front end. \u00a0The windshield was tinted a dark black; Connor couldn't see who was driving this thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to turn around and run away, thinking it was another army craft, but he heard someone scream, \"Connor, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spun back towards the unusual truck, and saw a gulf-wing style door open on the driver's side. \u00a0Out leaned a girl, who couldn't be more than sixteen. \u00a0She had bright red hair, pale skin, a skinny build, looked to be about five foot ten, and was wearing a camouflage tube top and a pair of khaki shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you? \u00a0How do you know my name?\" \u00a0Connor asked in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jade. \u00a0Hurry, get in the back. \u00a0We don't have much time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flicked a switch on the dashboard, and the back of the vehicle opened apart, revealing a large space, big enough for Connor to ride in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he had to do something, but he hesitated to trust this mysterious stranger. \u00a0\"Why should I go with you?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we can help you. \u00a0Look, you're all confused with what's been happening, but believe me, I know what you're going through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled gently at him, but her smile quickly turned to a look of desperation. \u00a0She pointed behind him. \u00a0\"Hurry, they're almost here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor turned around; the military was almost upon them. \u00a0He didn't have much choice, so he ran to the back of the truck and climbed in. \u00a0As quickly as he got in, the truck began to move, turning to flee their assailants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the front of the vehicle, Jade flicked the switch to close the back, and shifted gears. \u00a0She looked in the mirror and saw that the army trucks were right on their tail now. \u00a0Several soldiers began opening fire on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Christ!\" she screamed. \u00a0She turned to her companion in the passenger's seat: a 14-year-old Hispanic boy who was seven feet tall with black shoulder-length hair. \u00a0\"Miguel,\" she exclaimed. \u00a0\"Return their fire!\" \u00a0She grabbed the semi-automatic rifle behind her seat and tossed it at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-jade,\" he stammered, \"I-I haven't used one of these since training!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now's the perfect time to start,\" she said. \u00a0\"We're not going to lose them easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking, Miguel turned off the safety, then opened the passenger side door. \u00a0Leaning out meekly, he blindly pointed the gun and fired a few rounds, which bounced off the side of their own vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Miguel,\" Jade said. \u00a0\"Look, you take the wheel, I'll take the gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe jumped out of her seat and over to the passenger side, grabbing the gun from Miguel's hands. \u00a0He quickly grabbed the wheel, and swerved just in time to avoid running into a creek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade stuck her foot around a handle on the side of the truck, and leaned out as far as she could. \u00a0Bringing the gun to her eyes, she lined up her target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRAT-A-TAT-TAT-TAT<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bullets struck the tires of the closest Hummer, causing them to start to lose air. \u00a0She quickly hit the tires of all the vehicles chasing them as much as she could, ducking back into the truck whenever she was being fired at. \u00a0The Hummers all soon began to slow down, and their vehicle began speeding away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sat back down inside and closed the door. \u00a0\"I think we can outrun them now,\" she said. \u00a0She looked over at Miguel, who was too focused on his driving to pay any attention. \u00a0Jade laughed. \u00a0She couldn't blame him; the Chimera was a tough truck to drive, and required all your concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade sat down the gun behind her seat, and opened the door that connected the cargo area to the cab, closing it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor had his back to her, but she could tell that he was frightened. \u00a0He filled up most of the cargo area; sitting on the floor, he had to almost lie down to not bump his head on the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade placed his hand on his arm. \u00a0\"Connor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I know there's a lot going on right now, but trust me, when we get back to our base, we'll answer as many of your questions as we can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned over to face Jade, and she finally got her first look at him up close. \u00a0She knew he was an attractive boy, but she had never gotten to look at his eyes, which were deep, and brooding. \u00a0Even though he was three years younger than her, he had already begun to develop a muscular build, which was only enhanced by his new height. \u00a0Maybe, in another life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Connor said, \"can you at least answer one question for me right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade nodded. \u00a0\"I'll try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know who I was, and where to find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade smiled. \u00a0\"Because I'm your guardian, Connor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor's nose scrunched up in confusion. \u00a0\"Guardian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it'll make a lot more sense when you find out what our group is,\" Jade said, brushing the hair out of her eyes, \"but for the past three years, I've been assigned to watch you, make sure nothing was to happen to you, and to be ready for what happened today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Connor said, \"you were watching me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, more like just general monitoring,\" Jade shrugged. \u00a0\"You're a very special person, Connor. \u00a0All of us in the League are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor leaned back, trying to make sense of this all. The League? What the hell was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Connor,\" Jade said, comforting him, \"this will all be a lot better, real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continued down the road, Connor stayed silent, and Jade moved back towards the front of the vehicle for the rest of the trip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The back doors to the truck opened up. The ride had been over an hour, and Connor's eyes were used to the dark, so when the light poured in, he had to shield his eyes for a few seconds until they adjusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he could see again, he saw Jade standing on the ground right outside the truck, smiling. He leaned forward, looking up at the giant cavern they were in. It was at least half a mile wide and the ceiling was at least two hundred feet off the ground. Balconies ran along the side, like the levels of a giant shopping mall. A giant shopping mall designed by moles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough there was definitely a lot of natural forces that created this huge cavern, Connor noticed a lot of man-made improvements: doors on the side of the wall leading to other sections of the base, moving walkways, escalators and elevators, TV monitors and computer banks all over the place. There were also two other large vehicles parked on the other side of the cavern, similar to the one he was currently in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor was impressed at what he saw. It reminded him of some of the comic books he read when he was a little younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back at Jade, who was now talking to Miguel, coaching him on his rifle skills. Connor stared at Miguel for a minute, astonished. Yes, his seven-foot height wasn't near what Connor's was, but it was still a sight Connor was unaccustomed to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" Connor said, pointing to Miguel, \"does he have what I have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiguel smirked, blushing a little, as he walked away towards a door marked \"Vehicle Maintenance\". Jade was trying to hide her amusement, but couldn't keep it in; she threw her head back and laughed loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Connor asked as he got out of the truck. Just then, he heard a loud snicker from behind him. He turned around and saw a giant pair of legs at his eye level. He looked up, and up, and up, astonished to see a sixty-foot tall fifteen year old girl standing next to a door about the same height, which they had just taken the truck through. She was wearing what looked like something out of Star Trek: a collared shirt made of red and black fabric with a cool looking silver stripe crossing from her right shoulder to her left hip; long, tapered black pants with a red stripe down the sides, and shiny black boots covering her feet, nearly the size of a car. Connor could make out a patch on the right side of her shirt, with a big L in the middle and a G and a T on either side, all in very sleek, futuristic font.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L-G-T?\" Connor asked, pointing to the patch. \u00a0\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the League of Giant Teens,\" Tara replied. \u00a0\"That's who we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor spent so much time examining the stunning outfit, that he barely noticed the girl who was wearing it. \"Welcome back, Jade,\" the girl said, waving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Tara,\" Jade replied. \"I gotta tell ya, this was one hell of a mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This must be Connor, then,\" Tara said, as she kneeled down to get a closer look. Connor stared in amazement at Tara's face looming above his. She was a light-skinned black girl, with chocolate-brown wavy hair that came down to her neck. She had a thick, muscular build; Connor imagined that at the height of an average girl her age, she would have been a star athlete. At her waist was some sort of firearm that Connor didn't recognize; it looked like it was big enough to take out a tank with one shot, but in relation to Tara it wasn't any larger than a handgun, and was shaped similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTara stuck her hand out, causing Connor to instinctively back away at first. \"Nice to finally meet you, Connor,\" she said. After a few seconds, Connor shook her hand, which was more than twice the size of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tara is part of our security team here,\" Jade said. \"She graduated top of her training class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou act like that's such a big deal, Jade,\" Tara said, rolling her eyes, then standing back up to her full height. \"There were less than twenty of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless,\" Jade said to Connor, \"she's one of the most talented members of the league. That's why she's on security. \"Come on, Connor,\" she said as she started walking away, \"follow me. We have to meet the council shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The council?\" Connor asked. \u00a0\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" she said, \"they're just three older members of the league who set the plan for what we all do.\u00a0They're actually pretty cool, and they really want to meet you, which is surprising for a newbie. But first, we need to get you some clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor suddenly realized that he had been half-naked all this time. He looked down and saw that the red bed sheet was still draped around his waist, but was barely covering anything. In the excitement of the escape, he hadn't even thought about it. What the hell, he figured. He had a damn fine body, and he was proud to show it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started following Jade, who had hopped on a bike and was peddling fast, so that she wouldn't be outpaced by Connor's much longer legs. As they walked across the cavern, Connor noticed lots of different teenagers throughout the cavern, of all different sizes. None were as big as Tara, but a few were the same height as Connor. Others were fifteen feet tall, ten feet tall, or even Jade's height or smaller. Some wore different versions of the space-age suit Tara was wearing, others wore button up shirts and slacks, t-shirts and shorts, skirts, jeans, and the like. A few boys were even walking around shirtless, with an outfit similar to Connor's. All looked to be between the ages of 14 and 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade led Connor towards the opposite end, where she stopped at a counter that had a computer with a large LCD monitor attached to it. Behind the counter was a long pole that ran back behind the wall to another room. She clicked the mouse and started up a program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see, what kind of clothes would you like right now?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor pointed back towards where Tara was standing. \"Can I have an outfit like that?\"<br>\r\nJade chuckled, a laugh that was beginning to grow on Connor. \"Those are team outfits; they're specially made when you're assigned your squad upon graduation from training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor sighed. \"Oh, well. Then what are my choices?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let me enter your current size in to the computer,\" she said as she typed. \"What are you, about thirty feet tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I dunno,\" Connor said, \"I didn't really have the chance to measure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Jade replied, \"we just have to get a general fit for right now. Male, three-zero feet, slender build... Hmm, looks like we don't currently have much in your size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled up a few outfits on the monitor: one was a simple red shirt with blue jeans, a color combination that Connor didn't much care for; there was a couple of fancy suits, but Connor didn't feel like dressing up if he didn't have to. He finally settled on a navy blue polo shirt with khaki shorts. Jade added on some boxers and an undershirt to the package and clicked \"Accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall behind them began to whir loudly, and soon, a large garment bag zipped down the pole towards them. \u00a0Connor picked it up and opened it; inside was the exact outfit Connor had selected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Jade said, \"try it on.\" \u00a0She pointed to a large divider that offered connor some privacy. \u00a0He went behind it and changed in to the clothes. \u00a0Surprisingly, they were just a bit baggy, but they would work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped back from behind the divider. \u00a0\"Well,\" he asked Jade, \"what do you think?\"<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" she said, smiling. \u00a0\"You'll just have to grow into them.\"<br>\r\nConnor rolled his eyes. \u00a0\"Very funny,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade checked her watch. \u00a0\"Okay, the council wants to meet with you soon. \u00a0Do you want to go straight to meet them, or do you want me to give you the tour first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor thought for a moment. \u00a0Meeting the council probably meant he would get his questions answered, but it would be nice to know a little more about where he was, and there was a lot of things here that looked interesting to him.</span></div></div>",

Connor guessed he was of Middle Eastern descent. \u00c2\u00a0He was wearing a long sleeveless white robe that stretched from his shoulders to his bare feet. \u00c2\u00a0The robe hung open, revealing his defined pecs, abs, and arm muscles, as well as a pair of tan pants that cut off halfway between his knees and ankles. \u00c2\u00a0To Connor, the boy looked like he could be a genie from Arabian Nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Khenti,\" the boy said, \"but everyone calls me Khen. \u00c2\u00a0I am the current Council Leader, and am the oldest remaining among the League.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor realized he was staring with his mouth hanging open. \u00c2\u00a0He regained his composure, and gave a half bow, unsure of how to respond. \u00c2\u00a0\"Hello, Khenti--er, Khen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhen smiled and chuckled. \u00c2\u00a0\"No need to bow, Connor. \u00c2\u00a0We treat everyone as equals here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor nodded, and stood straight up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Connor,\" said a female voice to Khen's left. \u00c2\u00a0\"We know how you're feeling; we've all been there.\" \u00c2\u00a0The voice, which had a proper British accent, belonged to a girl who was about half as tall as Khen, but still a good twenty feet taller than Connor. \u00c2\u00a0She had short blonde hair and a determined look to her face. \u00c2\u00a0She was dressed in an outfit similar to Tara's, the security guard Connor had seen in the main cavern, and she looked to be a year or two younger than Khen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Penny,\" the girl said. \u00c2\u00a0\"I am the head of security for the League. \u00c2\u00a0And I play a mean game of football, if I do say so myself. \u00c2\u00a0Oh, I'm sorry--you Yanks call it 'soccer'. \u00c2\u00a0In any case, we'll have to play sometime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin crossed Connor's face. \u00c2\u00a0He didn't think he'd do so hot against a girl who had a good twenty feet height advantage on him. \"Hello, Penny,\" was all he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that brings us to me!\" said a voice Ken's right. \u00c2\u00a0Connor had to squint to make out who was talking; he finally saw a boy standing on the desk. \u00c2\u00a0The boy was only six feet tall (\"Only six feet\", Connor thought to himself, \"that's something I never thought I'd say.\"), looked to be about fourteen, and was wearing a white lab coat. \u00c2\u00a0He looked to be half-Asian, with long, styled black hair and a pair of horn-rimmed glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Chris,\" he said, with a wide smile. \u00c2\u00a0\"I'm the new head of research and technology for the League; just got elected last month. \u00c2\u00a0I know, it may seem like I'm playing to that whole 'Asian nerd stereotype' thing, but, believe me, there's more here than meets the eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Connor couldn't help but think \"Geek\" when he looked at him, there was something about the boy that exuded an air of coolness and mystery to him. \u00c2\u00a0\"Hello, Chris,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that brings us to you, Connor,\" Khen said. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cOf course, nothing really needs to be said there; we know pretty much all about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis took Connor by surprise, and he furrowed his brow quizzingly. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u201cReally?\u201d He asked. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cWhat exactly do you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris responded, \u201cWell, today\u2019s your thirteenth birthday--Happy Birthday, by the way; you\u2019re the oldest of two children; you\u2019ve lived at the same house all your life; you like video games, comics, and bicycling; you\u2019ve made mostly As throughout school with a few Bs and one C in Mrs. Lowery\u2019s Spanish class in sixth grade--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhen stuck out his hand. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cEnough, Chris. \u00c2\u00a0I think he gets the idea.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor was speechless. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cHow do you know all this stuff about me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Penny said, \u201cwe\u2019ve been kinda spying on you. \u00c2\u00a0For a few years now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpying?!\u201d Connor exclaimed. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhen leaned forward towards Connor. \u00c2\u00a0\u201cTrust us, Connor, when we say that it was only for your own good. \u00c2\u00a0You\u2019re very special, Connor, and we want to help you achieve your potential.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor shook his head. \u00c2\u00a0He couldn\u2019t believe all that he was hearing. \u00c2\u00a0He had been spied on by these guys? \u00c2\u00a0He was special? \u00c2\u00a0What were they talking about? \u00c2\u00a0He didn\u2019t know if he could take any more. \u00c2\u00a0Maybe trusting these guys was a mistake. \u00c2\u00a0But what could he do?</span></div></div>",

He closed his eyes and put his thoughts in order. There were so many questions swirling around in his head that he wasn't sure of which one to ask first. But he supposed he should start at the beginning.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" he started, making sure he chose his words carefully, \"I keep hearing about 'The League'. 'The League' this, 'The League' that. Frankly, I just want to know what the hell 'The League' actually is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhen shrugged slightly. \"That's a fair enough question, I suppose. You'll learn about it in great detail in your Orientation class tomorrow, but here's the basics.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On the surface, we're just what our name says: an organization for teenagers who have the special ability to control their own growth. But in reality, there's a lot more to us than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPenny continue the explanation. \"We fight alongside various underground groups around the world in resistance against the Chordata. In a way, we're all that stands between them and total planetary domination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, wait, wait,\" Connor said, confused. \"The Chordata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris sighed, taking off his glasses and rubbing his eyes. \"Guys, this is gonna be all too much for him to take on at once. Can't it wait for tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKhen turned to Chris and shook his head. \"No, we made a promise, and he wants to know; I don't blame him.\" \u00c2\u00a0He faced forward again. \"Connor, the Chordata are the bad guys. They've been around for centuries, and have manipulated world leaders and events to work towards their ultimate goal: total control of the planet, and the destruction of all who stand in their way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was beginning to sound crazy to Connor, but then again, so had everything else that happened so far today. Sensing his confusion, Jade moved closer to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. \"Remember the military vehicles that attacked us earlier?\" Connor nodded. \"They were under orders to take you to a Chordata holding facility, one that masquerades as a US Army base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" Connor thought for a moment, \"you're not talking about the base my parents were taking me to, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJade closed her eyes, nodding somberly. \"Yes, Connor. West Taylor is actually managed by Chordata forces. They have control over much of the American military.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, did my parents--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's all he needs to know right now,\" Chris interrupted, nearly shouting. The expression on his face looked much more serious than it had before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the anger start to build again, Connor stepped forward. \"No. You promised me you would answer all of my questions. I need to know: did my parents know what they were doing when they took me to the base? Were they-- Are they possibly working with these Chordata people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three on the council looked at each other, all of them reluctant to answer. Khen stood up, walked around to the front of the desk, and leaned back against it. This close, he seemed to be even more of an imposing presence than behind the desk.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor, this is never easy to say,\" he started, then paused. Finally, he just came out with it. \"Your parents ARE Chordata. All of our parents are. That's how we became the way we are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis answer stunned Connor slightly, and he started to feel a little light-headed. Seeing this, Jade brought over a stool, which, while nearly twice as big as her, was barely enough to hold Connor's much bigger stature when he sat down on it. He began to hyperventilate a little. If what the Council said happened to be true... Connor couldn't begin to imagine what that would mean for him and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he became more and more overwhelmed with what had just been made known, he felt his emotions beginning to boil again. Bewilderment, frustration, and fear all swirled in his head, but a new feeling was bubbling underneath: anger. Anger at his parents, anger at the world and the-- the Chordata, whoever the hell they were. Right now, though, the only ones he could focus it on, the only ones he could see ... were the council.\u00c2\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his rage began to manifest, he felt his muscles begin to tense and his skin tingle, a sensation he had felt before and recognized the significance of. He looked up at the Council, his eyes starting to water slightly as he felt his clothing start to get tighter once more.</span></div></div>",

Plus, they were his family. No matter how much they pissed him off, he still loved them and didn't want to hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRunning toward the car, Connor ripped the roof off of the car and carefully picked his parents up. A minute after he had ran away, he heard a loud explosion from where the car was. Connor found himself in a forest. Since the trees were taller than him, he figured it would be a great place to hide until he could get an answer out of his parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down and right away, felt his dad stir in his hand. As his father's eyes opened, the man quickly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Connor, where are we? What happened to the car? Why did you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor cut him off, \"It's okay dad, everything's fine. The car didn't make it, but I saved you guys just in time,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, saved us from something you caused? Why would you do something like that when you knew the risks?\" his father asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry dad, I was so angry at the time, I just....let it take over. I mean, you didn't tell me anything about why we were going to the Army, yet you expected me to understand everything\". His dad sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry too Connor. It's just, your mom and I...well, let me start from the beginning. When you were born, the doctors discovered that there was something in your DNA that didn't match up. Don't worry, you are human, but there was an extra gene that they couldn't figure out. There were two cases before you like this and one after you, but after that, the doctors found no traces of that extra gene, even to this day. Well, a couple of years ago, one of the kids that had the extra gene, David, started growing, like you are now, on his thirteenth birthday. After that, we knew that must have been what would happen to you. We were contacted by the army, who said they wanted to set up a special program with the four of you that had the extra gene, but we don't know what the program is. But I can assure you it is not something with experiments or tests\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor looked down at his dad with mixed emotions. He was somewhat upset that his parents didn't tell him earlier, but he was also relieved he knew everything. He had a better relationship with his dad than his mom. He didn't hate his mom, but his dad and he got along better. They would always go out to sports games or movies, even out for ice cream, just to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you keep this from me dad? I mean, you and I are so close, why didn't you tell me?\" Connor asked. He wasn't crying, but his voice carried sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry son, we just thought you would want to live a normal life with no worries about this. I know it was somewhat wrong not to tell you, but would you have wanted to go through your life knowing about this, dreading this day for the fact that you wouldn't be normal anymore?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor knew his dad was right. He would have dreaded this day if he knew it was coming and looking back, he knew he wouldn't want to change the life he had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks dad,\" he said. His dad nodded and (as best as he could) hugged Connor around his neck.</span></div></div>",

His mom was still unconsious, but he was fine with getting the directions from his dad. Suprisingly, they reached the army base in a shorter amount of time than his dad thought, though that was probably due to his son's longer legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing around the base. No roads, no planes, no sign of life. They were in front of a solid green wall bigger than Connor, about fifty feet tall. Connor's dad motioned for his son to put him down. When he reached the ground, he walked over to a black box and pressed a button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, this Rick Jackson. You all are expecting my son Connor today\". That was all he had to say before a portion of the wall in front of them opened up like a door. The opening was big enough for Connor, who picked his dad up and headed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing Connor noticed was the gigantic (he guessed maybe 200 feet) tall building in front of him. He saw a couple of jeeps around the building but no one walking around. But he soon saw someone exit the building and walk up to Connor's feet. The giant boy bent down, so the man wouldn't hurt his neck looking up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Connor and Rick. My name is General Harris and I run this facility. Do you need anything first? Food, a bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor spoke up, \"Uh, actually my mom....fell asleep,\" he said, not wanting to mention the incident earlier. He held out his hand containing his unconsious mom, \"Can you get someone to put her in a bed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeneral Harris nodded. He called for someone over his walkie and waited. Seconds later, a man came out with a stretcher, took Connor's mom out of his hand and headed back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's go on a tour first, shall we?\" General Harris turned around and started walking around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This army base was built just for you Connor. Well, for you and the other three like you. It's big enough to hold you and you won't have to worry about anyone seeing you, since no one ever comes around here\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor was interested in the tour, he really was, but he was finding it boring. He had to take one step every thirty seconds just so he wouldn't have to pass the General.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm..excuse me sir,\" Connor interrupted, \"But is there a way we could do this faster? No disrespect, but it's kind of boring walking this slow,\".General Harris laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Well, we'll have the others give you the tour later than. For now,\" General Harris pointed at a large door, \"you can go in there and meet them. If you don't mind, can you leave your dad here so we can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor nodded and lowered his hand carrying his dad down to the ground. Rick got out, told Connor to \"have fun\" and walked away with the General. As Connor started heading for the door, he wondered about who he was going to meet inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he pushed the door open, he saw that he appeared to be in a room that resembled a regular bedroom. There were two bunkbeds, one on the left side and one on the right. In the back of the room were two doors, one behind each bunk bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could explore the room, he saw two people enter the room. Both were boys and were the same height Connor was. One had short blond hair, and blue eyes, the other had shaggy brown hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond haired one spoke up first, \"Hey man. Are you the new kid? I'm David,\" he said, extending his hand out. Connor took it and just as he was done shaking, the brown haired kid extended his hand, \"I'm Tim\". Connor shook his hand and started to open his mouth to talk, but David beat him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably have alot of questions right now, so sit down and we'll talk\". David and Tim sat on the bottom bunk of the left bed and Connor sat opposite them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's question number one?\" Tim smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor quickly asked, \"What am I doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid answered this question. \"You met General Harris right?\" Connor nodded. \"That's my dad. See, when this happened to me and since I was the first one this happened to, he had an idea. He quickly made a plan that secretly went through the government and had this army base built. We're sort of superheroes you could say. Whenever something happens around here that could be more than the police ot firefighters can handle, they send us out to help them out. It's not bad actually. Plus, while we're here, we get to learn more about our powers and control them, learning new abilities\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor quickly tried to soak everything in. But after that long explaination, Connor had another question for David.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the general is your dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but he's cool. Dad can be a bit tough to deal with at times, but he only wants the best for us\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who is the other kid?\" Connor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Tim started, \"As you know, we were born before you were. David is 16 and I'm 14. The other kid, Kevin, isn't 13 yet, but he will be soon. I beleive his birthday is in six or seven months\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor nodded and asked his final question, \"So what abilities have you guys learned that you can teach me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid answered this one. \"Well the biggest thing we've learned so far is how to control our size. We can, but rarely, shrink back to our normal size and can grow bigger than our size now. There are some other powers, but we'll help you learn them along the way\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor thanked them and they spent the next hour getting to know each other and soon became fast friends.</span></div></div>",

The park was surrounded by mountains so that ordinary people would never expect something like this inside. While outside, Connor experienced another growth spurt. He watched as Tim and David got smaller until he was 50 feet tall. \"Not again....\" Connor muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" David said looking up at his friend. \"We'll help you get better control of your powers.\" David then started to grow himself until he was the same height as Connor. Tim followed shortly afterwards. \"Soon\", Tim started. \"You'll be able to do this!\" Tim then started to grow himself. David did as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor watched as he became eye-height to his friends. Then shoulder height and finally waist height.

It's not like he wanted to grow in the first place. He closed his eyes to focus on growing to Tim and David's height. He didn't feel anything. So he focused as hard as he could, thinking about growing. He could suddenly hear Tim and David's laughter above him. Great, just what he needed. Their laughing at his inability to grow. He opened his eyes and found the two giant boys were getting the rest of their laughs out. Connor looked at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. I guess I can't do it, but there's no need to laugh,\" Connor said, embarrassed. Tim and David quickly looked at each other, guilty, and shrunk down to Connor's height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey man,\" Tim started, \"We weren't laughing at that. It;s okay that you can't do it yet. We just wanted to see if you could do it on your own. But you should have seen your face. It got all scrunched up and tight. It was hilarious\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnor felt a little better now. At least they weren't laughing AT him (Well, they were kind of) but it wasn't for what he thought it was. He still wanted to learn to control his height though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll start our lessons tomorrow though. Today, we'll just relax,\" David said. He and Tim shrank back to 20 feet tall and headed towards their room when they heard Connors voice above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys,\" David and Tim turned around to see that Connor hadn't shrunk with them, \"I don't know how to shrink\". David slapped his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Connor,\" Tim said as he and David grew back to Connors height.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>No point in doing something stupid- they were going to find out, one way or another, so Conner figured he might as well confront them about it now. \"Alright, I'n... I'm coming down now, Mom. Just don't panic when you see me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conner, is everything all right?\" Genuine concern traced the edge of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's... well, just look.\" Conner took a deep breath, opened the door, and ducked his 7'10\" body through the frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner's mother was waiting for him downstairs, along with his dad. He felt slightly nervous as they stared at him, waiting for their comments. When they finally came out, he was shocked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conner, what are we supposed to be looking at, besides you not being dressed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his mouth open agape slightly. How did they not notice? \"I can't get dressed, Mom, because none of my clothes fit! And none of my clothes fit because I'm over seven feet tall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know how tall you are, son, and it's about time you realized that you're due for a refresher in wardrobe. Those clothes you've been wearing have been too small for ages, now, and we're finally going to get something that fits you properly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Who cares about my clothes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do, apparently, or else you wouldn't keep wearing them and bringing them up at breakfast,\" Conner's dad chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat on earth were they talking about? Conner wondered. \"Helloooooo? Am I the only one who sees that I've-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was cut off as the familiar pains and burning sensations kicked in. \"Hold on,\" Conner said, in half a daze, and closed his eyes. He waited until the feelings had receded, then opened them again- his vision definitely higher than what it was several minutes ago. \"A-HA!\" He said with satisfaction. There's no way this wouldn't resolve it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-ha, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just now! I JUST grew several inches! How could you not notice?!\" Conner let out, slightly panicked. Conner's mom just blinked and stared at him with furrowed eyebrows to mark her confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Conner... your height hasn't changed since you hit 8'5\" several months ago. You're done growing.\" Conner was about to speak out at this absurdity when his dad interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough of this nonsense, I've got work. Conner, get a pair of sweats from my room upstairs. You can wear them to mow the lawn, and when you're done, your mother and you are going clothes-shopping. No more excuses- eat your cereal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said EAT.\" His stern look told Conner that this was the end of all possible discussion. Conner frowned, collapsed on a chair he barely fit on, and ate his cereal in silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the morning was executed in eerie silence. Conner looked down at his parents several feet below him. What was going on that he wasn't being seen as any bigger? What was happening to them? What was happening to him? His mind swirled with questions as he rinsed his bowl out, put it in the washing machine, and lumbered into the garage to get the mower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was summer vacation, which on the plus side meant no school, <br>\r\nand on the minus side meant crazy temperatures. Conner panted as he worked on the yard, his enlarged body covered in sweat. Forced to work without a shirt and in sweatpants in a ninety-degree heat should be criminal, he thought miserably to himself. He wondered how many of his classmates were actually enjoying their time off, instead of being forced into unpaid labor. He surveyed his work, as he finished pushing the mover down another row. About half-done with the front yard. Actually making good time, he thought- at least the height did that much for him. Didn't make it any less weird, though. Not even the passersby on the streets looked at him twice before they continued their jogs and dog-walks. He was about to resume when he saw the garage door open and his parents' car slide out. \"Going to pick up some groceries, be back soon,\" He heard his mom call out before it turned onto the street and sped away. He let out a sigh of relief that he was now alone, and trotted back inside to cool off for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rested on the first couch he encountered, he thought carefully about his parents' reactions- or lack thereof. What on earth could it mean? What was wrong with them (or him, he reasoned) that they couldn't remember anything about what happened directly in front of them? He couldn't elaborate on this much, because the chime of a doorbell interrupted his thoughts shortly after. He huffed at the irritation. Perfect timing. He approached the door and opened it, hoping whatever it was could be brief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person at the door was a young East Asian girl, probably fourteen years old from the looks of her. She was wearing a knee-length robin's egg blue skirt, with a white top to complement it, clearly casual wear. Her long black hair reached down her back almost to her waist. At a second's glance from her to you, she instantly broke into an excited smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERFECT! You must be Conner!\" She burst energetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConner was taken aback. \"How did you know my name...?\" He slowly asked, with a hint of suspicion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, because you're eight friggin' feet tall and thirteen years old, duh,\" she said jokingly, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Conner didn't have time to rally this information within him before she sped off again. \"Look, I understand that you're really confused, maybe even a little scared, and that's natural, but I don't really have the time to explain everything here, and it's seriously important that I get to back to base, pronto,\" she rattled on breathlessly. \"Once we're there, I promise to tell you everything you want to ask, but in the meantime, you've gotta trust me on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot to ask from a teenage giant you just met, Conner thought. \"What about my parents? Are they going to worry about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your parents will be fine! The Transification Field we've got going right now is completely temporary, but without it, things get messy, and if you stay here, things are going to get even messier. So if you don't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The WHAT? What did you do to my parents?!\" Conner's voice raised significantly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl groaned and rolled her eyes. \"It's not important, I swear! I'll tell you everything, but you've got to trust me and come-right-now!\" She tugged on Conner's arm twice at the end for emphasis, though he didn't budge an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell would I do that, I don't even know your name!\" he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katie,\" She responded curtly. \"Now come on!\"</span></div></div>",

They help Connor control his power(s), and help him become a member of the League of Giant Teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike most of my other stories on this site, this story will focus on a single main protagonist (Connor). Other characters can be brought on for support, and our narrative can shift to these characters as needed, but the story should never be too far away from Connor. I want this to focus more on plot and character development than some of my other stories. Also, as a 13+ story, explicit sexuality will not be allowed. That isn't to say there shouldn't be romantic involvement or intimacy, but don't take it too far. Basically, if it wouldn't be in a PG-13 rated movie, don't put it in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, though all story ideas and plot twists are appreciated, there is one storyline I would like to reserve for myself. It's the story path with all ones (1-1-1-1, etc.). As such, one choice at the end of this line will always be marked \"RESERVED\". While you are more than welcome to branch off from any of these chapters by using their 2nd choices (or more, if present), any chapter added to the choice marked \"RESERVED\" will be deleted or moved around, depending on how well I can accommodate it. There will only be one chapter at a time in this story that will be reserved at any given time. I apologize for this one conceit to myself, and hope you understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, though, I hope you enjoy the story, and have fun!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheck out my portfolio <span class=\"noselect\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" oncontextmenu=\"uport_ajax_rt_opts (event, this, 'citywalker', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON', '100840282'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1; return false;\" onclick=\"uport_ajax_opts (event, this, 'citywalker', '', '', '', '10', '', 'ON'); hide_uport (); this.shown=1;\"><a title=\"Username: citywalker\r\nMember Since: November 19th, 2010\r\nClick for links!\" style=\"line-height: 1em;font-size:1em;font-weight:bold;cursor:pointer;\">citywalker</a></span> <span class=\"noPrint\">(<a title=\"View citywalker's Community Recognition\" class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"javascript:LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/authors/action/overall/user_id/citywalker',%20'CommunityR_100840282',%20'400',%20'650')\">47</a>)</span> <a class=\"imgLink imgPortLink\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); var mywin = window.open('https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/citywalker','_blank'); mywin.focus (); event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/portfolio/view/citywalker\" target=\"_top\" onmouseover=\"uport_ajax2 (event, this, 'citywalker', '&lt;span style=\\'color:#990000;font-weight:bold\\'&gt;Offline or Private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt; Last On:  Yesterday', 'Yesterday', 'November 19, 2010', '', '', '10', 'Registered Author');\" onmouseout=\"hide_uport ();\"><span style=\"padding:0px 2px 0px 0px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/costumicons/ps-icon-regular-10.gif\" width=\"30\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><a rel=\"nofollow\" onmousedown=\"if(event.which == 3) { event.preventDefault(); LaunchPop('https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100840282',   'mess100840282_1578549802', '710', '540');  event.stopPropagation(); return false; }\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/em/action/new/toid/100840282/in/1\" target=\"_top\" title=\"Email User: citywalker [Offline / Private]\" class=\"imgLink imgPortLink noPrint\"><span style=\"vertical-align:middle;padding:0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><img src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/mail-off.gif\" width=\"22\" height=\"15\" border=\"0\"></span></a><span class=\"noPrint\"><span id=\"new_ffcitywalker\"><a class=\"imgLink\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" onclick=\"doAjaxO('ffcitywalker', '', 'post', 'https://www.Writing.Com/main/my_favorites.php', 'action=fanfav&amp;fav=1&amp;user_id=100840282&amp;nopad=1&amp;new=1&amp;ajax=new_ffcitywalker');\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"Click to add citywalker to 'My Favorites'. \r\nClick again to become a 'Fan'. \"><span id=\"ffcitywalker\" style=\"padding:0px 3px 0px 3px;vertical-align:middle;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/favplus.gif\" style=\"padding-right:1px;\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></span></a></span></span> for my other sci-fi and fantasy stories featuring transformation, muscle development, and growth!
