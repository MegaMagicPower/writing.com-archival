You can either take the role of Byleth, teacher at the Monestary or play your own character. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Rules:</u><br>\r\nNot really many rules, just a few for the base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Byleth or your own character is male in this story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Male giants only though and keep it to shrinking, rather than growing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) No one sentence chapters or chapters just to add you own options, keep it at at least 3-5 sentences per added chapter<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Nothing too gorey or brutal, everything else is fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add and rate the story and most importantly, have fun with it ;) </td>",
