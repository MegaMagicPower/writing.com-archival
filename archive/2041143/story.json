He has heard he can find many rare pokemon there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what kind of pokemon I could find here that I couldn't find in Shino. Ohhh I'm so excited to be exploring a new region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continues exploring the ruins. Damon comes upon the wall that contain the pokemon Unown. He looks at the wall and tries to understand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm I wonder what this means. If only I could only understand what this says. Maybe it will tell me where I can find a powerful pokemon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then touch the wall. Suddenly the wall starts to glow. Damon was blinded by the light. \"W-what's happing? Where did this light come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the light faded. Damon was gone. Damon then finds himself in another dimension. \"Where am I? What is this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the Unown appear. The leader then talks to him. \"Greetings human. It has been a long time since we had a human visit us\" said their leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this place anyway?\" Damon ask. \"This is our home. Humans come and visit us and ask us to change them into any pokemon they want\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" said Damon \"Yes we can. Would you like to be change into a pokemon as well. We have to warn you it will be permament. You won't go back being a human\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon then thinks about it. \"Yes I'm sure about it\" said Damon. \"Very well human. What pokemon do you want to be change into?\"</span></div></div>",

So it wasn't a dream\" He then heard a voice. \"Damon honey. Are you awake?\" A female Raichu. She was Damon's new mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good your awake. Your father wants to see you.

As they rotated around him, they curiously searched through his memories. It was quickly apparent that Eevee-line was his favorite family of Pokemon. It had nearly limitless potential. Many believed, especially Damon among them, that Eevee was the only pokemon with the potential to evolve into every type; it was simply a matter of time before other evolutions were discovered. \"You have made your choice, and now, you shall start anew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unknown swirled around him, moving faster and faster. Damon became dizzy, unable to keep track of any single unknown. They simply blurred into a spinning sphere around him. Light, energy poured through him, and in the next instance, it was gone. Damon was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as if coming out of a void, Damon slowly opened his eyes. He blinked several times, slowly taking in his surroundings. He appeared to be in a small cave-like structure. The ceiling, made of dirt, was only a foot or so above him. The ground he laid on was covered in pulled weeds and grass. Damon realized that it was actually a den of some sort that he was inside. And, it was surprisingly warm inside despite the rain he could hear and see pouring from outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is when he noticed a brown and black something at the bottom of his field of vision. He brought a hand, or what used to be his right hand, to his face. It was a paw, a fuzzy brown paw. He touched the brown and blacking thing, realizing that it was actually his muzzle and nose. Damon smiled inwardly, realizing that it had worked. The unknown had turned him into an Eevee. Something swished around behind him. His eyes quickly looked in back of him and saw his brown, cream-tipped tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also noticed something else behind him. He slowly stood up, on his four legs. It was a strange feeling to move about on four legs instead of two. He turned around and saw another sleeping Eevee. He stared, studying the young Pokemon. It seemed to be a male, like him, and roughly the same size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little one! What are you doing up?\" Came the voice of another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon jumped, and landed ungracefully on his stomach. He turned to see the one who had spoken. Standing just inside of the opening was pink haired, fox-like creature. Its fur was damp from the rain. Pink ribbon-like appendages clung to the pokemon's fur. \"Sorry little one. I did not mean to frighten you.\" It said just before is shook the fur from its body. Its ribbon-like feelers floated around it. The Sylveon, which Damon just recognized it as, walked over and nuzzled his face. \"You should be asleep like your twin.\" It then looked up and past Damon. \"Or, I suppose that is too late...\" you heard the older pokemon sigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon then turned around to see that the other eevee had just woken. It seemed to have a curious look in its eyes as it took in everything around it. Before it could speak, the Sylveon walked past you and laid down. \"Come now little ones, it is time to sleep. Your father will not be back for some time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was tired. He and the other Eevee looked at one another for a moment before they both walk, on wobbling feet, to their mother. They rested against her warm belly, facing one another. Within a few minutes, Damon fell asleep to the sounds of rain splashing against the ground outside. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damon woke several times that night, but only for brief periods. His more sensitive ears had alerted him to the footsteps of another pokemon entering the den. It was fox-like, just like the Sylveon, but it had sleek, obsidian black fur coving most of its body. Strangely, it had yellow bands-like shapes on its forehead, ears, and and upper legs. He felt an instant connection to it, similarly to how he felt with his new mother, the Sylveon. The Umbreon was his new father. But, Damon's young, tired body forced him back asleep so that he could not greet his father. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next time he awoke, it seemed to be early morning, and his parents seemed to be prepping to leave. The Umbreon was nuzzling the other Eevee, Damon's would-be twin. The Umbreon noticed Damon's half-opened eyes and smiled. \"Go to sleep my sons. We should be back before you awake; if not, stay in the den.\" His eyes became heavy, and Damon fell back asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon finally awoke to the sound of something sniffing. He found that other Eevee had awoke before him, and was sniffing his face. Damon backed away, startled. On his feet, he and the other Eevee stared at each other. Damon forced his raised back hair to lower, trying to calm himself. \"Sorry, I did not expect to see your face in front of mine.\" Damon made his best attempt at a smile, but it was awkward with his new face. The other Eevee seems to try and mirror the same expression, and Damon got the distinct impression that he knew him. But of course, that did not make any sense. They had just met, and they were likely newborn Eevees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I was just curious. We smell the same, but I guess that makes sense since we're supposed to be twins.\" The other Eevee replied, with a friendly face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word 'supposed' made Damon pause. \"What do you mean, supposed to be twins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its weird isn't it... I haven't head of many Pokemon having a twin.\" The other Eevee responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Damon was not confused about the statement. It actually seemed like a very logical question. Before becomming an Eevee, he had never heard of twin Pokemon, but what did not make sense was that this other Pokemon in front of him was speaking about it as if he had experience or something. If this Eevee was his twin, shouldn't he be young and not know anything. Damon was only curious about having a twin because he had his human memories... A lightbulb suddenly went off in his head. \"Um... this is going to sound crazy, but were you human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Eevee's ears fell back against his head. \"Why would you ask that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because...\" Damon figured he should also confess, to make his twin more incline to admitting it. \"Because I was also human before waking up as an Eevee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were!\" The other one seemed to be excited. \"That is amazing! The last thing I remember was asking the Unknown to make me an Eevee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That is the same thing that I asked.\" Damon smiled. \"What was your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon! What was yours?\" The other pokemon asked excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Your name is Damon!\" Damon was suddenly confused. His name was relatively uncommon, and to find another person with his name who was also turned into a Pokemon seemed to be astronomically impossible. \"My name... is also Damon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" The other Eevee seemed just as confused. \"Your name was Damon too? No, that can't be.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its true.\" Damon stated, feeling annoyed that this other human-turned-pokemon did not believe him. \"I used to live in Newbark Town!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I used to live in Newbark Town!\" The other Damon said. \"What... What is going on? There was no other Damon in my home town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething scratched at the back of Damon's mind. He had always loved Eevee, which was why he had chosen to become that Pokemon, but he always went back and forth between his two favorite evolutions for that Pokemon. Had the Unknown... Could the unknown... \"Do you have a brother?\" He asked, and then quickly stated before the other Damon could respond. \"Don't say his name if you do. Just answer yes or no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Damon answered, \"Yes... I do have a brother. A younger one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a younger brother too.\" Damon stared at the other Damon intently. \"Uh... on the count of three, lets say our brother's name out loud at the same time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Damon nodded in agreement, and on the count of three, they both exclaimed together, \"Zach.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Damon seemed frustrated. \"You are copying me. Anyone who knew me would have known who my brother was. Um... what is my favorite poison-type pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was not happy with the other's accusation, but he decided to play along, answering how he would have answered the question himself. \"You don't have a favorite poison-type pokemon, at least not one that you know of yet. You always wanted to be the first one to discover Eevee's poison-type evolution.\" Damon hesitated for a moment as the other Damon took in a quick breathe of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis answer clearly resonated with the other Damon. After a few long moments, the other Damon said, \"Let me guess something too. You always wanted to discover all of the unknown Eevee evolutions. You always believed that Pokemon with such limitless potential should be able to evolve into every Pokemon type.\" That was a closely held secret. Damon had never told it to anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean that we used to believe that.\" Damon stated. He paused for a moment to let it sink in. \"I think we used to be the same person.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" The other Damon asked, believing him completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Damon simply stated. \"The Unknown could transform us into a Pokemon, so...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why? Was it on purpose... or an accident?\" The other Damon started, then quickly changed his mind. \"Never mind. I think I heard something from outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon's ears perked up as well; he heard footsteps. \"Who is it?\" he asked aloud as he turned to face the opening of the den beside the other Damon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was no longer raining outside, so Damon could clearly hear the shuffle of feet. The fur on his back began to stand on end, as he waited with anticipation. Finally, their parents, the Umbreon and Sylveon, stepped through the opening backwards as they were dragging something. \"Its just us little one.\" The Sylveon, his new mother, said as she let go of a giant leaf they were carrying. Damon and the other Eevee stepped forward and saw a mound of berries. \"Your father found a large clump of berry trees growing, and we left early to pick some.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sweet aroma wafted through the air, and Damon's stomach chose that moment to growl. He felt the pang of hunger now. His brother, the other Damon, stepped up beside him, his stomach growling as well. He and Damon stared at each other for a few moments, making a silent agreement. They decided to drop the subject of how the Uknown had split the original Damon into the two of them. Their parents did not seem to be aware that they used to be human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you going to dig in?\" Their father said, after swallowing a bite of a large blue, oval-shaped berry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Both Damon and his brother said at the same time. Damon voraciously began eating berries, enjoying the juicy flavor. \"Thank you Dad... Mom...\" He tried saying their familial titles out loud. His parents simply smiled, seemingly pleased that he was happy with the meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah thank you!\" his brother also repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course little ones.\" Their father replied. \"When we finish, your mother and I will be taking you outside. You have been cramped in here for too long due to the rain.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar dear, that was supposed to be a surprise.\" Their mother chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Slyphy. I was just too excited to keep it a secret much longer.\" Their father replied. He turned happily to Damon and his brother, \"Don't eat too quickly little ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon watched out of the corner of his eye as his brother seemed to ponder something. He was about to ask what it was, when he finally asked aloud, \"Mom... Dad, why do you always call us 'little ones' and not my our names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well little one,\" Their mother started, \"If I knew your name, I would call you buy it.\" The mother stated as if that answered the question. She must of read the confusion on both of their faces because she continued, \"Neither you nor your brother have names yet. It is a part of our culture for an Eevee to take on a name once they evolve. It is a sign that they have grown up, and are ready to leave the den.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon pondered his mother words. He found it fascinating that Eevee's took names after evolving, and that pokemon had their own names besides what their trainers gave. \"When can we evolve!\" he said excitedly as a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In due time little one. You are still too young to worry about such things.\" Their father said. \"Now, hurry up and finish.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Damon, his brother, and their parents had finished the breakfast, they were ready to embark on their small adventure. Their father had explained that they were just going to explore the area directly around the den, so that Damon and his brother could begin to get an idea of where they were. As Damon stepped out of the den, he immediately in awe of the scene in front of him. His family's den seemed to be on a small hill, looking over an open meadow. A river winded through the meadow, sparking in the sunlight. Around the meadow and the den was a forrest full of tall pine trees. It was breathtaking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on brother!\" The other Damon called as he ran past him. \"Race you to the river!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's cheating!\" Damon yelled as he followed his brother in pursuit. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Their race quickly ended as Damon and his twin became enthralled with exploring the open area. A few Stantler grazed in the distance, and a flock of Murcrow happily ate berries from a tree. Damon followed his brother to river's edge. It was calm and clear. \"Wow!\" he heard his twin say as he stopped by the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Damon asked as he came along side him, but the reason was quickly apparent. He too was awestruck by his reflection, their reflections. Seeing his new face was like an out of body experience. It was even more memorizing seeing how he and his twin looked exactly alike. All Pokemon, even those of the same species had differences between them, like different colorations or patterns of fur. Some even had completely different, unique colors. But he and the other Damon were strikingly similar, but Damon figured that made sense because they seemed to have been the same human. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayfully, Damon made a face, sticking out his tongue. His brother mirrored his expression, perfectly. The other Damon then stuck his tongue out sideways, with a googly-eyed look. Damon and his twin went back and forth copying each other's expressions. A part of Damon knew that the behavior was childish, but he could not help it. Playing with his 'twin' felt right somehow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spent time running around the meadow, and finding other Pokemon enjoying the day. The weather was sunny despite it having rained the previous day. All the while, their parents watched from a safe distance and speaking with each other. After some time, their parents seemed to become distracted, engaged in a conversation. Damon convinced his brother to head on back and check on their parents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached from the side, they began to overhear their parent's heated conversation. \"...but they should know.\" They heard the last few words that their father said as they came within earshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've discussed this Lunar, at length.\" Their mother chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that still did not change my mind. They should know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're too young.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slyphy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar, I want them to enjoy the childhood for as long as possible; besides, they might not even be those Twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know as well as I do that our children are the Twins referred in the prophecy. One day, they will save the region. Not knowing will only put them in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon's ear perked up. \"What do they mean? Twins... Prophecy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhh...Quiet\" His twin scolded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't know that.\" Their mother said, sounding tearful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sylphy, we need to prepare them. Its our job as their parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right.\" Their mother sniffed. \"Born of Night and Pixie light...\" she said, a seemingly odd phrase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning us.\" Their father replied. \"They will go on, fighting back the darkness together, growing stronger together, and eventually they will evolve together. Though, I am not sure what that part of the prophecy, 'evolving together' means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prophecy is meant to be vague.\" She then let out a loud sigh. \"Fine, we can tell them. But not today; let them be children at least for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well my love.\" Their father replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon stared at his brother. They wore matching looks of shock. Slowly, they backed away so as not to disturb their parents. As they got out of ear shot, Damon asked, \"What does that all mean? What prophecy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know just as much as I do.\" His twin stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could retort, he heard a deep growl from behind them. Slowly turning, Damon saw a large, black wolf staring at them, just a stone throw away. \"Is that a Mightyena?\" his twin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon thought that it looked like one, but its were blood red. Foam and saliva dripped in pools from its mouth. \"KILL!!!\" It roared. \"TWINS!!!\" </span></div></div>",

Damon and his twin followed suit, sitting in front of her. Damon noticed that she suddenly looked much older, as if the prophecy was some great burden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and his brother listened intently  as their mother explained. \"Little ones, you are both very special. Twins are very rare, almost unheard of with most pokemon families. Historically, twins that are born bring about great change, good and bad, to the world. Within the Eevee family specifically...\" Their mother hesitated for a moment. \"Only one other set of twins were born.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is another pair of twins, like us?\" Damon asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They died, a long time ago.\" She replied gravely. \"They sacrificed themselves to save our world from a powerful darkness. Just before their death, they recited a prophecy. Unfortunately, most of the lines have been... lost over the years. No one today can even agree on what all of the lines are, or even how many there are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon imagined a terrible game of telephone. Every generation, starting with the first who heard it, would recite the prophecy as clearly as possible to the next generation. But over time, the meaning and words would change, or become lost. \"But then... how do you know we are the twins in that prophecy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother smiled, \"Well for one, you were born twins; the only twins since the first. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Damon interrupted, \"We were born of night and pixie light. You and father.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir mother giggle softly, \"Yes, that is true.\" Growing more serious, she continued, \"But, I was going to say that the red-eyed pokemon have returned, and they have named you as a threat. They would only do that if you were the twins of prophecy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and his twin looked at each other, frowning. He wondered in his head, 'What had the unknown thrown them into?' A look from his brother indicated that he was thinking the same thing. Damon looked outside the cave opening, the sun had set and night was upon them. \"Wait, what about Dad!\" Damon exclaimed, feeling terrible that he just remembered their father. He had stayed back to distract the red-eyed pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father will be alright; he is no Slakoth when it comes to combat.\" Their mother smiled reassuringly. \"Though, it make take him some time to find us. We surveyed several different caves, looking for back-up homes incase anything should ever happen. He will find this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt comforted by his mother words, hopeful to see their father soon. Their mother then said, \"Now, it is time to rest little ones. We will begin your training tomorrow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Damon fell asleep right away, along side his brother. As they dreamed, their father did find the hideaway, and the very next morning began the twins' training to become the heroes dictated in the prophecy. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Months had passed since Damon and his brother had first woken up into their new Eevee bodies. Since the red-eyed Pokemon attack, their parents had tirelessly trained them. They performed drill after drill, mock battle after mock battle. But, the results spoke for themselves. Damon felt confident that he and his brother could take on many threats together. They had successfully fought back a hoard of red-eyed pokemon with their parents on two occasions. After each, Damon and his family fled their temporary homes to new accommodations, wanting to avoid them as much as possible for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring these long, tiring months, Damon also felt a connection grow between his twin, the other Damon, and himself. He felt stronger when they were near each other, and weaker when they were apart. He was not sure if that was some supernatural link between them, or simply becoming more familiar and attuned to each other. His twin, however, firmly believed that it was a magical bond of sorts, and he often commented on feeling Damon's emotions as if they were his own. Damon was not convinced of this though. That was not to say that he did not 'feel' his brother's emotions. He believed that it was more related to them spending so much time together and having been one person before this all happened to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt present, Damon and his brother were traveling across a grassy, golden-yellow plains. The trees were sparse, and the brothers could see for miles in any direction. They had left their parents a few days back, upon their insistence. Their parents felt that it was time for Damon and his brother to seek evolution, a usually solo quest that all Eevees took on at their age. Damon and his brother agreed to take on this quest together. They planed to meet their parents, after their evolution, at the town at Serene Village. To Damon and his brother's surprise, it was not a human town, but a town consisting only of Pokemon and a special guild. They were not sure how, but Damon believe that the unknown had now simply transformed them into Pokemon. The unknown had also transported them to a world of only Pokemon. No humans existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir parents had told them to look for a sign of their evolution. Their father, Lunar, had explained that, during his quest, he felt something call out to him in the middle of the night. With the full moon to light his path, he followed the calling. He had come to an opening in a forest, where the moonlight illuminated him. Tiny, silver lights began to surround him, and after several moments, he had changed, evolved into an Umbreon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was beginning to think that father's tale was untrue. He, with his brother beside him, had been traversed the area for days with no sign or calling. His brother insisted that they travel along the plains, but they had yet to come across anything that would qualify. Damon was beginning to lose hope, until his ears suddenly perked up at a sound. He paused. \"Wait.\" he said to his brother, who had walked a few paces ahead of him, \"I thought I heard something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you...\" His brother's question died in his mouth because he too seemingly heard something. Damon watched as his brother's eyes turned toward the same direction as his. \"That way!\" they both cheered as they raced off towards a lone tree in the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not in the dessert, it was an oasis of sorts. The tree grew beside a small, calm pond. There was no river or stream connecting to the pond, so Damon had no idea why the water had not dried up in the summer heat. \"Look at those!\" Damon yelled out when he noticed two, colorful rocks by the tree. He felt an energy pulsing from the rocks as he approached cautiously. \"A fire stone and a thunder stone!\" He announced, unable to hide the excitement in his voice. \"I call fire!'</span></div></div>",

The stones were lying beside each other, less than a foot apart. Damon approached the fire stone and touched it with his snout. Immediately, he felt an energy burn through him, his body pulsing with power. \"Wait!\" He yelled. He closed his eyes, and pushed back the change. Slowly, the power left him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do that?\" His brother asked at he came up beside him. \"You were about to evolve; your body was glowing white!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're supposed to evolve together, right?\" Damon asked. He did not wait for an answer before providing one himself. \"I think we are supposed to touch them at the same time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, lets do it together then.\" His brother said as he stood next to Damon, in front of the Thunder Stone. \"1...2...3\" They said together just before touching their stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, the energy from the Fire Stone enveloped Damon, but this time, he let its power flow through him unobstructed. The transformation did not seem to occur immediately, to his surprise. After several long moments, Damon felt a spark of power cross between him and his brother, as if they were sharing the stones' power with each other. He felt arcs of electricity dance across his fur as heat, like from a pleasant campfire, surrounded him. That is when he felt the changes occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon watched his reflection in the crystal clear pond shift. His body grew larger and stalkier. His brown fur transitioned into an orange-yellow color, and a collar of thick, white fur surrounded his neck and trailed upwards like the flame of a candle. His tail grew bushy and white. Then he noticed other, more unusual changes. The orange-yellow fur on his back became needle-like, creating a spiny fringe around his white tail. A tuff of white fur on the top of his head, between his ears, grew into a spiky point. Damon knew that these changes were not solely into a Flareon, or even into a Jolteon. His features appeared to be a combination of the two different Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while this transformation occurred, Damon also felt himself and his brother join together. He did not know how to describe it. He was fusing with the other Damon, their bodies joining as one. He knew he should have been terrified of it, but he felt no fear, only excitement and strength. Finally, the process came to an end. Damon and his brother had evolved together into a new, fusion form of Flareon and Jolteon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\" They both exclaimed together as they stared at their reflection in the water, with their two nearly identical heads side-by-side. \"I didn't see that coming.\" Damon commented. \"We didn't just evolve, we fused together into...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plasmeon.\" His brother supplied a name, which seem appropriate. \"The fire and electric type, Plasmeon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like that name for us.\" Damon decided. \"Its our own new Eevelution species. We discovered a new evolution!\" Damon had always held the childhood dream of discovering a new Eevee evolution, an eevelution. Now he and his twin had; they were a new eevelution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to come up with names for ourselves, our own, individual names.\" His twin said. \"Dad said that our names should come to us after evolving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since we're a combination of a Flareon and Jolteon...\" Damon considered this for a moment. \"Ignis. My name is Ignis.\" The name had just popped into his mind, like their father had explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brother then stated matter of factly, \"Raiju. That's my name!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnis and Raiju were ecstatic to have discovered their names as well. But soon, the thrill and excitement slowly faded from Ignis, and an unsettling realization began to sink in. He and his twin had evolved together into a single Pokemon, not two. \"Raiju, we're sharing one body.\" Saying it out loud made the gravity of their situation more real. They were not just sharing a body. It was more like they were two halves formed into a single whole. Ignis became more aware that he could not feel, could not control their whole body. It was like everything to the left of him, on his twin's half, was missing, nonexistent. He had no domain on the left side of their body; he could only control their right fore and hind legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as his twin's smile also faded as reality seemed to come crushing down on him as well. \"Yeah, I just thought of that too.\" He whispered. \"We evolved into one pokemon.\" He seemed to emphasize 'one' as he spoke. Suddenly, his expression changed. \"No! We may be one Pokemon, but we are two individuals!\" He stated defiantly. \"Admittedly, we're inseparable, but we still count as two.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not following Ruiju.\" Ignis sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignis, we were fused together to make one, powerful Pokemon. We are a combination of both Jolteon and Flareon. I know we are bigger, faster, and stronger than either of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With one obvious weakness.\" He retorted, not needing to state that they each only controlled half of their joint body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not saying it is going to be easy. We'll have to start up training again, and then we'll become the perfect pair! Unbeatable!\" Ruiju's smile had returne, and it felt genuine to Ignis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your optimism is contagious.\" He gave his twin a smile in return. His eyes stared at their image in the water, partly believing his brother's words. Ignis had to agree that he felt powerful, and he guessed that he and his brother stood far taller than any of the other Eevelutions.  \"Its a good thing we get along so well.\" Ignis smirked playfully at his brother's reflection. \"In any case, I have no choice but to train with you now. So... what first?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Serene Village was a surprisingly robust town, with several buildings made of wood, dirt, and stone. Ignis had no idea that Pokemon could build such structures; many of the designs were similar to the buildings that older civilizations of humans built. The main difference was that the structures were more attuned with the environment around them. The village seemed to be located by a crystal-clear lake. A river flowed through town, dividing it between the plaza and residential sections. The plaza itself was buzzling with Pokemon buying, selling, and trading. There even seemed to be a small cafe of sorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he and his brother traveled down the main road in the village, they left the main plaza behind, following the directions towards the residential side of town. Ignis was glad to leave the plaza, and he felt that his twin shared his same relief. Ignis realized that fusion evolution, the name he coined for their type of transformation, was just as remarkable and unheard of in this world as it was in their original world. He and his brother stood out like a sore thumb and would continue to no matter where they went. Ignis did not regret choosing to evolve with his brother in such a way, but their decision had more downsides than they initially realized. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed the well-traveled path, passing by several pumpkin-shaped houses. Ignis and his brother stopped in front of the house, that the kind citizen had directed them to. He was nervous, and the effect was worse because he could since his twin was also worried. Ruiju seemed to bottle up his nervousness sooner and knocked on the door with his paw. A few moments later, the familiar form of their mother pulled the door open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Ignis and Ruiju both cried out as they ran up to nuzzle her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Sylveon seemed to initially be startled, as she was almost tackled by a giant fox-like creature with two heads. \"Little ones?\" She asked before rubbing her head against their's affectionately. \"It is you two? My, you are not little ones any more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Ignis commented. \"We did as the prophecy said, and we... evolved together.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This wasn't exactly what we expected... its why it took us so long to meet up with you.\" Ruiju explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your evolution is... surprising to say the least. I had expected you to evolve at the same time, not into a single form.\" Sylphy, their mother noted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prophecy was more literal than any of us thought. But as long as we stick together, we are an unbeatable team!\" his twin smiled broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like there was a choice not to stick together.\" Ignis bonked heads with his brother playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this commotion.\" Their father said from somewhere deeper in the house. He came into view and paused in shock at their appearance. \"Are you really my sons?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnis and Ruiju bounded inside and nuzzled their father. \"Its us dad!\" They said in tandem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the reunion, the four of them settled down, and the twins retold their tale, taking turns to speak. They explained how they found the stones, and decided to touch them at the same time. Cheerfully, they each exclaimed their names to their parents, excited to finally share what they were. \"Now, we're Ignis and Ruiju, the first Plasmeon!\" He and his brother said together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never would have imagined that there was another, secret path of evolution for our kind.\" Umber, their father marveled their his sons' form. \"What did you call it... a fusion evolution. Makes me wonder if we are the only kind that call pull that form of transformation off, or if other Pokemon can also fusion evolve.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its possible.\" Ruiju spoke. \"Our form has huge benefits. You should see what we are capable of doing. But at the same time, I don't think many would have considered evolving together like we did.\" He shared a glance with Ignis. \"If we had known before evolving, I like to think we still would have chosen to fusion evolve, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnis continued his brother's train of thought, \"But... there are downsides to this evolution. Ruiju and I share an incredibly, powerful form, but it is a single form. We are permanently stuck with each other and have to work in tandem for pretty much everything. I don't think there are many Pokemon who would choose to be physically inseparable from someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, are you truly inseparable... Is there no way for you to de-evolve, in a sense of the word?\" Umber asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe and Ruiju both shook their heads. \"No, this is permanent, like all other evolutions.\" Ruiju explained. \"We had weeks to explore... the limits of our form, besides just training. There was a time we wondered if our form was some cross between a Mega evolution and normal evolution; instead of us each getting a Mega form, we though we might be sharing a single Mega form. But no matter how hard we tried, we could not de-evolve into our separate component parts, a Flareon and Jolteon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnis decided to not add all the ways they tried to split apart, or even why they tried so many ways. Despite their initial confidence in learning to master their joint form together, spending every minute of every hour of every day stuck together was challenging. Nearly every action needed to be consulted and coordinated. If one wanted to get a drink from the lake, they were forced to ask the other to help them walk and bend over. He and his brother argued often in the beginning, and their single body gave them no respite to cool-off alone. A few times, they tried to literally pull themselves apart, or practiced their attacks on each other. Both were, not surprisingly, stupid ideas on their part. They may have been twins, and a single human even before that, but always getting along and agreeing was difficult. They quickly had to learn the etiquette of compromise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver those weeks however, Ignis felt that their brotherly bond did deepen. He was not sure when, but his mindset changed during that time. He thought less about himself, and more about themselves. He no longer forced himself to work in tandem with his brother, as he wanted to go along with his brother. His dreams shifted from having his own body, to sharing a body with his brother. Now, he was unsettled by nightmares where he and his brother had separate bodies. \"We are a package deal, but we wouldn't have it any other way.\" Ignis concluded. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Damon could not help but smile as he and this other Lugia flew high over the world below them. He felt the wind blow through the feathers of his body, or rather, half of his body. He seemed to own only half of their shared form. He imagined it was akin to being cut in half, vertically. He flapped his powerful right wing, and tucked his right leg into his side, mirror his other half. \"How can we fly so easily?\" Damon questioned. The more he thought about it, the more he figured they should have been struggling to stand let alone fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a peculiar mystery, isn't it?\" The other Lugia smiled brightly. After a few moments, he answered, \"I gifted you with some of my knowledge as we joined together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of your knowledge...\" Damon thought for a moment. \"You mean, I know how to fly because you shared with me how to fly?\" He remembered professor Elm going on about a form of memory, specific on how to perform procedures like walking. Lugia was part psychic. If he could pass on that knowledge, then Damon figured that he'd be able to fly just as well as the other Lugia could. \"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can fly together because I am still... linked into how and where you want to go.\" The other Lugia tried to explain. \"When you want to fly right, I get a feeling and try to move my half of our body in tandem with yours so we can fly right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you are reading my mind.\" Damon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, in a way. I can only sense what you are about to do a few moments before and try to act accordingly.\" The other Lugia continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is kind of cool. But, what if you want to do something? I'll have no idea.\" Damon questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are already 'reading my mind' in a small way.\" The other Lugia explained. \"How else do you think we could speak with one another over the howling winds?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon was surprised for a moment. \"Huh... that is cool.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does the temperature have to do with being in tune with one another?\" The other Lugia questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon laughed out loud, having just realized that neither his nor his other's half mouths had not been moving during their exchange. \"Sorry it is a figure of speech. I meant that talking to each other through our minds is incredible.\" He then continued, \"but how do I get more in tune with you, so I'll know when you are trying to do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... that is difficult to explain. It comes second nature to me.\" He was quiet for a few moment. \"Close your eyes and concentrate on my voice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon hesitantly closed his eyes. He was afraid about falling, but the other Lugia calmed his fears. He focused on his other half's voice just as he explained. At first, Damon could only hear the other Lugia speak, but then he felt something else, an instinct of some sort. Damon lifted his right wing, and gracefully, he and the other Lugia circled in the sky. He opened his eyes, amazed by his small accomplishment. \"I did it!\" He exclaimed. \"I felt that you wanted to circle around the left, and I followed through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Lugia seemed pleased and laughed out loud. \"Yes, we make a great team!\" The two leveled out and continued moving forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I don't even know your name! Do you have a name?\" Damon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I have a name!\" The other Lugia shook his head. \"But, I guess I should have introduced myself earlier. The name is Ryu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nice to make your acquaintance Ryu.\" Damon smiled. He and Ryu continued flying for a short time, trying to get better acquainted with one another. Damon told him about growing up in New Bark town. In turn, Ryu told Damon about his history. It was surprising for Damon to learn that Ryu was actually not much older than himself. He had grown up around the Whirl Islands, and only recently left to explore other ares within the Johto region. He was very nearly captured by team of people with a large letter on their uniforms, whom Damon realized was the infamous Team Rocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though the situation had been frightening for Ryu, it was not all bad. He was nearly captured by the ruins of a long dead civilization. While escaping, he had learned from one of the individuals in a white coat that Lugia possessed a special power of sharing strength by joining as one in body. This prompted Ryu to seek out another Lugia willing to join with him so that capture would be impossible in the future. He had been turned down several times until finding Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they flew, they ended up towards the southern sea, near large pillars of rocks along the coast. \"Damon, you interested in testing our body through that maze of rocks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" he cheered in agreement. \"We'll have no trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two-headed Lugia then angled their body into a dive, and the outer edge of the rock pillars approached quickly. They spread their wings in tandem and glided closely to the ocean. The spray of the water tickled Damon's nose. They flew into the maze of rock columns, and at first had no difficulty dodging the rocks. As they moved deeper, a fog moved in, limiting visibility. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu say a tower appear quickly in front of them, and shifted his wing so as to glide toward the left. Damon sensed this movement from his other half, and shifted his wing so their body glided in the direction Ryu wanted. However, his other half had misjudged how far they were away from the rock and tried to level them out too soon. The edge of Damon's wing brush along the column's side, grazing his skin. For a few moments, they were disjointed in their movements, bringing them closer to the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, that hurt!\" Damon complained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, the fog is making it difficult to see.\" Ryu stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let's fly out of here.\" Damon said just before he flapped his wing and tried to angle their body skyward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we can make it through the rest of the way!\" Ryu quickly stated. He shifted so that Damon's effort made them glide toward the left. His wing skimmed the water for a few moments before they leveled back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryu!?\" Damon glared at his other half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are going through this maze of rock!\" Ryu exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, we're not!\" Damon yelled back. He tried again to fly upwards but his other half did not comply. Their body weaved back and forth, coming close to hitting several pillars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to make us crash Damon!\" Ryu yelled, angry with his other half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you are!\" Damon fired back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew as if drunk. Each tried forcing the other to comply while also moving enough to keep them from rushing into any of the rocks. Neither knew where they were in this maze of rocks now. As their body continued gliding, a giant pillar of rock suddenly appeared in front of them from the mist. Both were taken by surprise, and each yelled out a different direction to their partner, expecting the other to follow their lead. Their joint body kept moving closer to the rock at a great speed. Just before they were going to crash, a single though ran through both of their minds. In a last stitch effort, both flapped their wings simultaneously in front of themselves. The effort slowed them down, but it was not enough to keep from from crashing into the rock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cloud of dust and debris filled the air upon their impact with rock. Both cried out in pain. Their body fell backwards and instead of landing in the water, they fell onto a rock plateau, just above the surface of the ocean. For a few moments, they laid their half paralyzed. The wind had been knocked from their lungs, and it took some time to recover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have made it all the way through if you hadn't made us crash!\" Ryu accused Damon, breaking the silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't make us crash; you get all of the blame on that!\" Damon yelled back. \"I warned you that this would happen! But, you didn't listen!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't listen!\" Ryu argued. \"And just before we crashed right now, I had yelled to fly left! And what happened instead; we flew right into it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had yelled to fly right, but you didn't listen to me!\" Damon butted heads with Ryu<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get away from me!\" Ryu pushed against Damon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could, but you see, we only have one body!\" Damon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the moment, yes. But, that can easily be fixed.\" Ryu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? How?\" Damon was taken aback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really think that we'd be stuck together forever?\" Ryu rolled his yead. \"No, according to what I had learned, Lugia can join together and separate at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is good news.\" Damon sighed. \"Spending forever with you was looking more and more unappealing.\" He looked at Ryu expectantly. \"Well, separate us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot do it alone.\" Ryu glared at his other half. \"As ironic as it sounds, we have to separate ourselves, together. We have to willingly pull ourselves apart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets do it then.\" Damon then yanked hard to the right, and they toppled onto their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a hatchling!\" Ryu yelled. \"We can't just split apart like that. We have to concentrate and focus on being separate Lugias again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I though it was just a matter of pulling.\" He closed his eyes. \"Okay, focus on being separated from you...\" </span></div></div>",

He seemed to not appreciate Damon's attitude. \"We fused together in much the same way, just imagining that we shared a powerful joint body. We just have to do the opposite now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then. The sooner I am away from you, the better.\" Damon stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My thoughts exactly.\" Ryu replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon closed his eyes, and cleared his thoughts. He imagined himself pulling apart from his annoying other half. As he pictured this within his mind's eye, he felt his psychic power, along with Ryu's, surround their body. They slowly lifted off of the ground, hovering a few inches above the small rock outcropping. Damon continued to focus his mind on separating himself, and what he would do once it happened. He imagined himself being free to do as he pleased with his own Lugia body again. He pictured himself soaring through the air, the wind ruffling his sleek white feathers. A smile came to his face when he thought of finding his friends and revealing himself to them. He pictured it clearly. His friends would be awestruck of seeing a mighty Lugia, and then they would become confused when Damon used his psychic powers to reveal to them who he was. Slowly, Damon felt himself being lowered back onto the rock outcropping. He opened his eyes, ready to do just as he had envisioned, but reality stoped his short. Nothing had happened.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and Ryu were still firmly attached to the same body. \"What gives?!\" Damon exclaimed. \"Why are we still stuck together?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know!\" Ryu appeared to be just as confused. \"It should have worked. I felt out powers... It should have worked!\" He repeated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try again?\" Damon asked. Ryu only nodded his head in response. Damon closed his eyes once more and tapped into his powers. Just like before, he felt their body lift off of the ground. His and Ryu's psychic energies surrounded them and gently tugged at their body is opposite directions. But again, nothing happened when the two were lowered back onto the rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand. The people in white coates spoke of this being a surprisingly easy task, and the hieroglyphics on the walls showed as much.\" Ryu looked into the distance, seemingly trying to remember every detail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What hieroglyphics?\" Damon asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the cave that I was nearly captured... their were images that I saw along with what the people in white coats had spoken.\" He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon knew of no such cave, but he figured that it was worth taking another look at. \"Ryu, we need to head back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?\" Ryu exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt Ryu's fear through their psychic link. \"Ryu, I know your afraid of being captured, but we need to see those images. What we tried is obviously not working, and if we ever want to be separated, those images might have a clue.\" He then tried a reassuring smile, \"Besides, your whole reason for seeking out another Lugia was to join with them to bolster your powers. Well, your powers are bolstered, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes since we've joined, I feel much more powerful. But, I did not realize the cost...\" Ryu did not finish his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...\" Damon thought for a moment. \"You didn't know that you'd have to be in total sync with your parter. You didn't know that we'd each only control half of this joint body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. The images were crude, and they did not have any instructions on them.\" Ryu seemed defensive, embarrassed. Damon thought that he would have turned red if his father's didn't cover his entire face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not judging.\" Damon quickly said to placate his other half. \"But, that does explain why you insisted on going through this maze of rocks. You wanted us to practice flying together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu nodded. \"Because of our psychic link, we could anticipate what the other wanted to do, but I figured that it would be more difficult in a fight. Our psychic powers may give us an edge, but the level of coordination our form reacquires... its unbelievable. We would have to be attuned to each other and watch the flow of battle. We would have to attack, defend, and evade together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly, we failed on the evasion.\" Damon smiled<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu mirrored his smile, \"Yes we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are two separate Lugias forced to work and move as essentially one Pokemon. An argument was bound to happen, but I'm glad it happened now and not during a real fight.\" He sighed. \"We just have to be aware that we're not always going to agree. With that said, I am sorry for my part in making us crash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize too Damon. I should not have insisted on continuing through the maze.\" Ryu replied. \"Let's get out of this fog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.\" Damon smiled. The two worked together to fly upward, and out of the maze of rock pillars. </span></div></div>",

They needed to maintain their psychic connection, or risk falling from the sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince finding that he could not so simply separate from Ryu, Damon felt trapped by their joint body. He had agreed to join with his friend, but he realized that it was more impulsive than anything else. The idea of becoming a powerful legend along side a real legendary pokemon was amazing, but he scolded himself for not thinking through first. When he looked over towards Ryu, his friend seemed to have felt just as foolish for offering something he barely understood himself. Now, they were both paying for their rash decisions. For better or worse, Damon knew he was locked to Ryu until they could find a way to separate themselves. He forced himself to not think of the alternative, their condition being permanent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon racked his brain, trying to remember anything that would be helpful, but everything was coming up blank. He had never heard of the location which Ryu had descried, and neither had he ever heard of two pokemon, legendary or not, joining together into a two-headed version of themselves. He knew of pokemon that were born with two heads, or evolved into something with two, or more, heads, but nothing like what he and Ryu had become. He sighed heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're almost there.\" Ryu spoke to him, seemingly thinking that Damon's sigh was related to the length of time that had passed. Damon did not correct him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey flew on. Damon's only way of knowing how much time had passed was the arc of the sun. It was now well over the 'hump' in its arc and falling toward the ground again. He figured it was late afternoon. His mother would be getting ready to cook dinner, back at home. \"No.\" He said to himself, trying to not let himself think of that. He noticed Ryu look at him, obviously sensing something through their link, but his other half said nothing. Damon, instead, looked outward and notice a large canyon up ahead. \"Is that it?\" He spoke through their link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is where hieroglyphics are.\" Ryu answered as they made their decent. They agreed to land on the far left end of the canyon bottom so as not to be discovered by the criminals currently taking up residence near where the ancient images were located. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Damon quickly realized that walking on the ground was much more clumsy. The awkwardness was more due to their body not being designed for travel across land, rather than difficulty with coordination of their movements. They managed though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached around a bend in the canyon, he saw a small camp, not the huge fortress he was imagining. There were several large tents pitched around the outside of a large cave. A large antenna, in the center, dwarfed everything else in the camp. The people in the camp were wearing a black outfit with the letter R printed in the center of their uniforms, but there was only a handful. One of the members, seemingly the leader, wore a white lab coat over his uniform. He had wire-frame glasses, and his dark blue hair was tied in a ponytail. The leader seemed to be busy admiring something on a tablet. Some of the others members were busy moving large boxes to inside one of the tents. Damon realized that they were cages, and some of those cages had pokemon inside. The distance was too great for him to make out all of the details of the creatures, but they appeared to be some of the pokemon from the local area. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to help them.\" Damon spoke, urgently to Ryu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not yet.\" He replied back. Damon was shocked for a moment, having not expected that answer. Ryu looked towards Damon, \"I mean it may not do us any good to pick a fight with this group right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wasn't the whole point of joining with me to become more than powerful enough to fight off people like them?\" Damon insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the maze of rock?\" Ryu answered back. \"What good is power if we cannot use it effectively? We may get captured and be of no use to anyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon had to agree with that logic. He imagined Ryu and himself attempting to dodge an attack in opposite directions and becoming struck by it. \"Fine.\" Damon agreed. \"Sneak into the cave first?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Despite their clumsy movement on solid ground, Damon and Ryu managed to sneak past the small contingent of Team Rocket agents. Damon realized that being part psychic was more than just helpful with wordless communication with his other half. He or Ryu would use their psychic power have rock fall from the canyon wall, or an object would cause one of the agents trip. All of these minor actions distracted the agents and allowed them to safely sneak past. Damon let out a sigh of relief as they entered the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther back, the cave was kept lit up by portable light systems, so Damon and Ryu had no difficulty watching their steps. They continued down the zig-zagging path for a few minutes before it opened into a large cavern. Damon gasped, \"Wow!\" The walls were filled with different, ancient drawings. \"This is amazing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but remember why we are here.\" Ryu chided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I forget.\" Damon replied glumly as he looked at where their necks joined the same shoulders. Not wanting to argue, he asked, \"Where are the drawings you saw?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis way.\" Ryu answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and his other half walked toward the furthest wall, and images quickly caught his eye. Before them, there were a series of hieroglyphics etched into the wall, seeming to show a story. It depicted two beast-like Pokemon, which Damon did not recognize, fighting along side one another. The next images showed them losing, narrowly avoiding death, from an even more powerful creature. The two beasts were then joined together into a two-headed body, and with that shared power, they were shown to be victorious in a battle against the creature that had originally defeated them. \"But how do we separate?\" Damon asked as he studied the other images. The remaining ones were harder to make out, as if they had been scratched out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand... There were more drawings here the last time.\" Ryu stared hard at the unreadable hieroglyphics. \"Those villains! They must have etched out the remaining images!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic was rising in Damon. \"You have no idea how to separate us! We're stuck together!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Damon.\" Ryu seemed defeated, blaming himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon took a few shaky breathes, trying to calm himself. Team Rocket were not just a random band of thieves; they had large schemes and great plans. \"They wouldn't just destroy the only images of this phenomenon.\" Damon thought aloud. \"Just in case, they would have kept backups of some kind, perhaps photographs.\" Damon looked at his friend. \"We may still be able to find the answer we're looking for, but it won't be easy. We'll have to deal with Team Rocket.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I would like to destroy this camp of theirs for defiling these images...\" Ryu said, \"How are we going to get our answers? If it comes to a fight....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to be in total sync, I know.\" Damon sighed. Saying they should be in sync and actually working seamlessly together were two completely different things. Damon recalled the events at the rock outcropping, and even trying to sneak past the agents outside. While they had been successful on the latter, they were several points where they could have been discovered simply because he and Ryu had a difference of opinion. His mind wandered again, thinking of all the other Pokemon with two or more minds. Most, like the Doduo species, had the benefit of being born that way. Through experience, they learned how to work together nearly seamlessly. He and Ryu may have their psychic connection, but they lacked the experience of sharing a body since birth. Even while knowing they now shared the same body, they both were guilty of trying to act independently at times.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon sighed again. \"Look Ryu, these are the only choices I see we have. We either try to attack the base now or we retreat. If we attack now, we would have surprise on our side, and we may be able to overpower any threats. Heck, we may even be able to get the Pokemon they captured to help fight them off. All we would need to do is scare them off, even for a few minutes. Then we could spend that valuable time we earned to search for the copies of the images they destroyed. The down side is we have no backup right now, and we could get caught.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon paused to let Ryu process his first point before continuing. \"Of if we retreat, we could spend time recruiting others to help attack the base. I am sure you know of many who would be willing to help us. And, we could have some time practicing on how to fight together. But, the downside is that they may leave with the information we need, or they fortify greater defenses.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a mind for tactics.\" Ryu smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" Damon felt blood rush to his face, embarrassed by the compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly\" Ryu spoke, \"We are of two minds now. I sense that you want to attack now, while you believe the information we seek is here. But, I want to play it safer and retreat. Live to fight another day as the humans have once said.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon smiled when his friend referred to humans and did lump him with them. Damon was, after all, feeling more like a Pokemon than a human now. \"We need to be in complete agreement, with whatever choice we make. Agreed?\" </span></div></div>",

The words the Keldeo spoke resonated within him, and he knew that this Pokemon was right. \"Kirin...\" He hesitated when a name appeared in the forefront of his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that is my name.\" Kirin answered. \"You are beginning to remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I am... my name was Kelpie.\" He continued, finding his own name appearing in his thoughts. \"I'm Kelpie.\" he repeated, the name feeling right. \"But wait...\" Kelpie became puzzled as he looked at his other half, his brother. \"Why do we have separate names if we used to be the same pokemon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After being split in two, we ran across the world together as two young colt pokemon. But danger was always present.\" His voice then turned sour as he explained further, \"The others decided an additional layer of protection was needed. They transformed us both into a humans and wiped our memories.\" He sighed. \"I have only recently discovered who I was, finding the unknown like you had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelpie knew his brother was telling the truth as flashes of memories flew through his head. He saw himself as a young Keldeo running across the ocean with another, nearly identical young, blue horse. Back then, they longed to be reunited, but they did not have the power. But now, he felt an energy stirring within, seeking something. \"I feel my power... I feel your power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I feel it as well.\" He then urged. \"Our true form is needed. I think we are strong enough now to undo what the others had done to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelpie rushed over and stood beside his brother. \"Then lets channel our inner power, make one whole from two halves.\" Following instinct and his old memories, Kelpie closed his eyes and focused on the energy dwelling within himself. He pushed it outward, enveloping himself in the power. Sensing his brother doing the same beside him, Kelpie expaned his life engery, allowing it to intermingle with Kirin's. Just as his power joined with his brother, his body seemed to blend into Kirin's as well. They were becoming one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, he felt a resistance of sorts. Something was holding them back, trying to keep them from merging. \"Push through!\" Kirin exclaimed from beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelpie did just that. He felt his power and his body joining with his brother despite the resistance, but concern began to well in the back of his mind. He was beginning to tire, and he was sure that the process was not complete yet. Beside him, his brother breathed heavily as well. \"I don't know if we can keep this up...\" His voice was strained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right brother...\" Kirin reluctantly agreed. \"We are not strong enough yet...\" The brightness that had surrounded them began to dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelpie, like his brother, let his life energy return within himself. \"Well, we succeeded partially at least. I do feel more...\" he paused trying to think of a word to describe the sensation, but he could not come up with one that summarized the sensation completely. \"...powerful. Our life energies have partially joined together, and I feel a new inner strength because of it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I feel it too. Perhaps this attempt did bring us one step closer to our goal.\" His brother answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light had complete disappeared, and Kelpie opened his eyes. They strained against the darkness of the cave, but he could still see the silhouette of his brother standing beside him. \"Wow... this feels weird...\" He said suddenly, realizing a strangeness of his body. While he was still standing, he felt as if he were cut in half. When he looked down, he could clearly see his four legs, though he could only feel his fore and hind legs on the right side. But then another strangeness dawned on him, and he questioned himself where his brother's legs were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelpie's gaze shifted as his eyes followed his left foreleg towards his now wider torso. He realized right away that his own head seemed to be displaced on the right of his own body. The reason why did not elude him for long, because as his eyes continued upward he found himself staring at his brother's face. A shiver ran down his spine. \"Kirin... perhaps we were too hasty in our attempt...\" Kelpie gulped loudly. He and his brother had fused together, but not completely. They were to be sharing a single body from their necks down. </span></div></div>",
