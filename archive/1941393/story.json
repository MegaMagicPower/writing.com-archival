            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack sat at his computer, currently lost inside a world of chatrooms and forums, as he had a tendency to. The Internet was a fairly big part of his life, and heck, it was a big part of the reason why he was where he was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack idly glanced over at the picture he kept on his desk - one of him and a black haired girl standing on a beach, smiling like nothing else in the world mattered. The black-haired, green-eyed girl in the photo with him was Hannah, his first as well as current girlfriend. Their meeting was a curious one, and it was actually due to a unique, strange interest they both shared - muscle growth. The two met on a forum dedicated to the topic of outlandish and fantastical muscle growth, and spent countless nights over the course of months conversing about it. Eventually, they managed to discover that not only were they the same age, but they actually lived in the same town. They met up at a cafe in real life and each found the other one nice, likable, and sharing in the same interests. They started the relationship soon afterwards. When college applications rolled around, they both decided to go for Northern State University, both due to its prestige and the two of them wanting to stay close to one another. When they were both accepted, they pooled their money together and bought an apartment a block away from the campus for privacy reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now, here they were. Hannah was out getting a few groceries at the moment, but they had the whole place to themselves. Though he wasn't exactly the most physical person, Jack had great grades, an amazing girlfriend, and a wonderful place to live. Everything was going alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it was about to get... a bit more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jack's eyes went from the picture back to his computer screen, he suddenly found a pop-up ad obscuring most of his view. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WANT TO CHANGE ANYTHING AND ANYONE YOU WANT? ACHIEVE IT WITH THE REALITY BUTTON!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack simply rolled his eyes and went to close out the ad. These things always promised ridiculous things like losing 40 pounds without any exercise or whatever. He couldn't believe some people still fell for these.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked the \"X\" to close out the pop-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... It didn't close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of confusion, Jack tried to close the window once more. Still nothing. He leaned back in his chair, letting out a breath of frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Dang, it's one of THESE things. Might just have to restart the computer to get rid of it. ... Or...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe read the message over again. The power to change ANYTHING or ANYONE he wanted... that would definitely be a treat... He quickly shook the thought out of his head. There was no WAY that was possible. It broke every law of science he knew, and why would it just be given away by a pop-up ad?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAw, what the heck. He had virus protection anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked on the ad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt disappeared for a second... then another box popped. This one simply read \"ENJOY.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack spent a couple of seconds deciding what THAT could mean, when suddenly... the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind immediately jumping to the conclusion that Hannah had forgotten her key again, Jack got out of his chair and went over to the door. He swung it open, revealing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second of confusion, Jack looked down. Sitting on the doormat was a small cardboard box. That was... weird. He didn't remember ordering anything. Jack peered out the doorway, looking left and right to see who could have dropped it off. No one was there. Curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot thinking too much of it, Jack picked up the box and shut the door. He looked the box over as he walked back to his computer. Oddly, it had no return address. Or any address that it was sent to, for that matter. How did it reach his doorstep then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he got back to his computer, he sat down and looked back up at the screen. The pop-up was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's heart was racing as he did his best to tear open the packaging. The cardboard was tough, but he did his best, and after a minute or so a small object fell into his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack dropped the remainders of the box onto the floor and picked it up. It appeared to be a small red button, similar to the Easy button from Staples. This had no writing on it, however, and was a bit smaller, fitting neatly into the palm of his hand. Jack ran his fingers over it. It felt cold and metallic... but still strangely inviting, somehow. It gave Jack the feeling the description of it was true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood up and began to pace, never taking his eyes off of the button. He could... he could get anything he wanted now? He could CHANGE anything he wanted now? As much as he wanted to keep thinking it wasn't possible, there was no other explanation for what had happened. If he understood it right, all he had to do was think of what he wanted to happen, push the button, and it would happen. He could do ANYTHING! Jack found it a bit harder to breathe as his mind raced with ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he had to do was choose one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of the corner of his eye, Jack noticed the Superman posted he had hanging up on his wall. It brought back memories of all the comics he had read up until this point. Superheroes lifting cars over their heads, stopping trains, punching through solid steel walls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And there was the idea. The one, most important thing to him right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe brought his eyes down to the button. He somehow knew that he only had to think what he wanted, but he said it anyways:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was the biggest, strongest, most muscular being on the planet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, it felt like there was an explosion ripping up from his hand over the rest of his body. Jack cried out, almost dropping the button from his hand instinctively. He felt so much pain... and yet, oddly enough, the pain was almost mixed with a little bit of pleasure. Like there was also a nice heat making its way across his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his chest starting to strain a bit. At first, he thought it was because his heart was beating so fast. Well, his heart WAS doing that, but when he looked down, he could see that his chest was straining for a completely different reason - he was GROWING! Good, honest to god, straight up growing. It almost looked like he was taking breaths and his pectorals were just... staying there. And the cycle kept repeating itself. Right in front of his eyes, Jack was seeing his chest start to stretch out his Batman t-shirt, partially obscuring his view. Not letting that stop him, he reached down, smiling widely as he felt abdominals pop up on his stomach, forming a solid six-pack... which then split up and grew even further into an eight-pack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the increasing sound of stretching fabric, Jack reached down further and wrapped his hands around his swelling thighs. That task was becoming increasingly difficult as the muscles expanded in diameter - not only did they feel as big as grapefruits, they were getting insanely hard as well. Jack could tell that these muscles weren't just for show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack almost felt like having a heart attack when he realized that the best part was still to come - the biceps. Not wanting to miss the show, he raised both his arms, almost letting out a yell of happiness as even that minor action caused them to gain a couple of inches all around. It felt like he was watching something out of a cartoon - his arm muscles went from the size of a baseball, to the size of large rock... all the way to what almost looked like soccer balls stuffed under his skin! Even better than the sight of it was just the immense feeling of adrenaline and power Jack felt, knowing how strong he probably was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost as quickly as it started, Jack felt the growth fading, eventually dying out completely. He was just left to catch his breath, stand there, and dwell on everything that had just occurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven breathing made him feel like a titan, watching his pecs nearly burst out with every single inhale. And that wasn't even getting to the rest of his body. Getting curious as to how it would feel in motion, Jack took a cautious step forward. It was... an odd sensation. He knew his body was heavier, and he felt it, but at the same time his legs were so strong it felt like he could leap a mile in a single bound. This was unreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned, looking at a full-length mirror on the other side of the room. Seeing his full body just made him feel ten times better. He was AMAZING! It almost looked like some kind of cartoon 0 Jack was unbelievably swollen, but in all the right places. Humongous pecs, abs that looked as hard as steel, legitimately INSANE biceps... it almost took Jack a second to realize his leg growth had made him even taller. He was probably around 6' 6\" now, a tall height which just made his muscles look all the more intimidating. In fact, he was surprised his clothes had even survived the growth... though his Batman t-shirt was stretched so thin he could see his skin through it, and his shorts looked like they were painted on his body. Finally, Jack looked up at his own face, surprised to see that it had received minor changes as well. He now had a slightly more square jaw, and even a little bit of stubble on him. It was still obviously him, just a bit more... strong-looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stood there for a good while, admiring his own looks. This was all he had ever wanted! He didn't know how the button had actually worked, but he didn't care. He was huge, super strong, and quite good-looking, if he could say so himself. In fact, now he was thinking about - <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish that thought, there was a knock at the door.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'm back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze instantly. He could feel his heart starting to race again. Hannah was back. His feelings of euphoria suddenly turned into panic and desperation. What was he going to do? She was going to see him and then freak out and that would be no good for anyone. And how would he explain it? A magic button appeared at the door that granted his wishes? Even his girlfriend wouldn't believe that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the apartment wasn't that big, so there was nowhere for him to go. As Jack heard the doorknob twisting open, the only action he could manage was hiding the button behind his wide back before the door flung open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the sound of Hannah's shoes making their way across the wood floor. As she walked into the room Jack was in, he braced himself for the reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... What?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Um... hey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Jack's mind was racing even faster. This somehow made even less sense. Even if she had reacted well for whatever reason, he had expected her to... react. She seemed to be ignoring the fact that he was now some sort of giant super-bodybuilder. Why was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah's question snapped Jack out of his thoughts. If she was acting natural, well, he would have to as well until he figured out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... the usual stuff. Sitting around, mostly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah let out that little giggle of hers that he loved to hear. \"Well, you can't spend TOO much time sitting around, or you'll lose all that awesome bulk of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, he was getting more clues now. It wasn't like he was imagining his new size; she obviously saw it too. And yet she was still acting like it was completely normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... Wait, was his chair bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking sure Hannah wasn't looking (she was busy pulling various items out of her purse), Jack leaned over to get a better look at it. Yeah... it was definitely bigger. Probably big enough to completely fit his new size. Upon closer inspection, it was a bit nicer than the old chair as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut leaning in made Jack notice something else even more astonishing. The same picture as before was sitting on his desk... but next to the same-looking Hannah was the new, hulk-ified version of him. That picture had been taken months ago! Jack realized he had a lot more to learn about the mysterious button...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Hannah spoke up. \"Oh yeah, it's getting close to 4 o'clock. You should probably be heading off to...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Uh... my what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah rolled her eyes, though a smile was still plastered on her face. Apparently Jack being a somewhat forgetful dork was something that hadn't changed with his size. \"Don't tell me you forgot. You had an interview scheduled for that personal trainer position at the bodybuilding gym at 4:30, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, right!\" Jack said this with renewed enthusiasm, though he didn't really have clear memories of scheduling an interview... or much at all that had changed, really. At the same time, though, he felt like the memory was there, just hidden behind a hazy fog in his mind... maybe there were more memories there, just waiting for him to discover? This was more complicated than he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, why are you wearing those old clothes? I thought you outgrew those a couple weeks back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down at his own mighty chest, being reminded of just how tight his current shirt was, the Batman symbol stretched out probably too far. \"Uh... well, I just thought these clothes showed off my muscles well. That's important for a job at the gym, right?\" It looked like he would have to improve his lying skills if he wanted to avoid suspicion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, luckily, just chuckled a bit at his excuse. \"Oooooor you just wanted to show off... as usual,\" she replied, though he tone indicated she found it more endearing then annoying. His girlfriend then went into their apartment's living room, flopping down onto the couch and turning on the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing a sigh of relief, Jack looked over at the clock. It was a bit past 4 now, giving him a decent amount of time to make it to his interview. Plus, showing up early would be a good thing for him, right? It wasn't like he had much preparing to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading into the bathroom, Jack grabbed some spray-on deodorant, spreading it all over his pits and chest. The act definitely took longer than he was used to, with all the new space he had to cover. It was a tiny thing, but he loved the way his biceps smooshed up against his pecs as he brought the can across his body. Every movement he made seemed to send a jolt of energy up his superpowered body, and it was AMAZING. After that was done, Jack dug into the cabinets, pulling out a comb to make his hair all nice and proper. While doing this, he noticed another change, though minor and unexpected. Whereas before, his shared bathroom was filled with about 80% Hannah's stuff, 20% his, now it was more of an even 50/50 stuff. He didn't even recognize some of the stuff that was apparently his! Apparently he was more focused on his looks now... not that he would blame himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, all he did was wet his hair and comb it all to one side. Looking at himself in the mirror, Jack couldn't help but grin. In the attractiveness department, he was still far from perfect, but the stronger look to his face was definitely an improvement in his eyes. At the same time, he was still recognizably... Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed out of the bathroom, grabbing his keys and wallet and stuffing them into the tight pocket of his shorts. He paused... then went back over to his desk, grabbing the button and stuffing it into his pockets as well. There was the chance he could have another use for it... and even if he didn't, there was no way he was letting something that powerful out of his sight. Confidence filling him up, he puffed out his large chest and headed out of the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym was only a couple blocks from the residence, so Jack decided just to walk. Immediately, he noticed more changes. He felt himself walking with a bit more swagger to him, as well as a bit faster due to his longer strides. But most importantly, he noticed the stares. Before, he wasn't much to look at, so he was practically invisible when he was out on his own. But now he could feel eyes immediately attracted to his immense frame, and he could see the differing emotions emerge on people's faces - amazement, envy, jealousy, disbelief, lust... all of them just put a big grin on the hulking guy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time at all, Jack reached the gym. He pushed open the double glass doors that made up the entrance, finding that he needed to open both of them to squeeze in comfortably. Immediately, he noticed a man waiting in the lobby. He was dressed in a decent suit, but it did little to hide the bulging muscles that were underneath. Though he looked maybe a little soft, like he was out of season, the guy was clearly a bodybuilder or weightlifter of some kind. He was the sort of person Jack would've felt intimidated just being near before - he could hardly believe that he was BIGGER than him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack, correct? I'm Will Evans, great to meet you.\" Up close, Jack could see that the man had a tanned complexion, a near constant smiling face, and gelled up black hair. In a blink of inspiration, he remembered that Will was the owner of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill stuck his hand out for a handshake, and Jack smiled, doing the same. As he grasped the other man's hand, instincts suddenly kicked in to tell him not to squeeze too hard. Jack found this odd, considering how he normally shook hands, but once he had actually gripped and started shaking, he could see why he held back. Even when not using full force, he had an iron grip, prominent veins bulging out on his arm. There were so many little intricacies he had to learn...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill drew his arm back, flexing out his fingers a bit. Just how strong WAS Jack? \"Come on, we'll talk in my office.\" Jack nodded, following Will to the back of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner sat down in his modest office chair behind his desk, letting Jack sit in a chair opposite it. Luckily, such an impressive gym considered that they might get some very large patrons, and the chair had no problem holding Jack's weight. As he sat down, Will laid his arms out on the desk in a relaxed position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jack, I figure if you want to help our gym's members find the best way possible to get healthier and stronger, maybe you should tell me about your personal routine first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Jack's mind froze. His routine? His workout routine? Thanks to the button, he had gotten this body despite barely having picked up a weight in his life... he didn't know half the words one would even use to describe a workout routine. Was he just going to look like a big idiot in front of this guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then... the words started coming out. Like a waterfall, Jack opened his mouth and started monologuing about a very intense, rigorous routine he went through every day. It was a weird feeling... it was definitely him saying the words, but he felt like he was on autopilot. Still, wasn't like he was complaining - the crisis had been averted, after all. And it was interesting to hear himself talk about what he did to keep his size - did he really jog 5 miles a day?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill seemed please with it, nodding his head the whole way through. \"Very impressive. With a routine like that, I can see why you're so big.\" Jack couldn't help but chuckle a little, resisting the urge to cockily flex some of his muscles; doing so would probably rip the shirt he was wearing. Still, he was oddly proud of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interview took about an hour, with the two discussing how to best help customers, what the hours would be like, pay, benefits, all that sort of thing. When it was all over, the two stood up from their chairs, Jack giving the owner a big smile and a firm handshake before he left. He felt incredibly confident that he had the job in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the lobby of the gym, Jack couldn't help but sigh happily. He had never felt so good in his life. He was huge, had a nice job lined up, and everything seemed to be going his way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... And yet, his attention was drawn back to the all-powerful button. As if acting on instinct, he pulled the little device out of his pocket, turning it around in his strong, meaty hand. This was all great... but why not try for better? He didn't know of any limits the button had, so why not have some fun with it and improve his life even more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning almost uncontrollably, Jack's mind spun through the infinite possibilities, eventually landing on one to wish for. He could always reverse it or do something else if he felt like it, after all. Looking down, Jack let his finger hang over the button in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack was standing in the lobby of the gym at which he had just interviewed for a job. As amazing as his life had become with the help of the mysterious button he couldn't help but want a little more, and why not? He could have it. He could have anything he wished for. He strode over to one of the giant mirrors that lined the walls of the lobby and admired his new body. 6 feet 6 inches of super powerful, beefy muscles reflected back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder how much I weigh?\" he mumbled aloud. Suddenly the answer was right there in his mind: 320 pounds. He was going to have to get used to the idea of his current memories merging with those of his new life. It was a strange feeling that he was only just starting to trust like a safety net tied below the tightrope act he was now performing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised an arm and flexed his enormous bicep. His sleeve had already been forced up and off of the mighty peak but even so the quick expansion of his giant muscles were too much for the fabric to stand and a large rip opened up all the way up and onto his shoulder stopping just a few inches shy of the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops!\" he said a little louder than he'd intended to. In his reflection he noticed the receptionist at the desk was staring at him. She wore a tight polo shirt that seemed to be the uniform of the gym. Her shoulders were broad and her arms nicely toned with solid muscle. The shirt was tight across her chest where a fairly large pair of breasts were packed inside. She was easily the sort of person that Jack would have fantasized about mere hours ago but now the tables were turned. He could tell from her expression that she was imagining what his muscles must feel like to touch. Locking his eyes on hers he raised his other arm and flexed ripping the other sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pulled his eyes away from the receptionist for a moment and looked at his magnificent biceps once again. 26 inches, he knew it just by looking at them that his arms measured 26 incredible inches around. Was that a record? Brimming with a confidence he'd never felt before in his life Jack grabbed his shirt with one big hand right on the bat symbol on his chest and pulled. The shirt fell apart like tissue paper leaving his entire bulging upper body exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked back over his reflection's shoulder again and saw the beautiful receptionist's mouth was hanging wide open. That was the admiration he wanted, that was the adoration he deserved. He would have it on a global scale. He held the magical button in his hand and spoke loudly, not concerned with being heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was an incredibly successful pro bodybuilder.\" Then he pressed the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before his body was flooded with energy; however while the last time it had felt like an explosion deep within him this time it was more like electricity crackled through every muscle. He watched his reflection as his body grew again, but this time only slightly. Instead the biggest change was one of details. Moments ago he'd been huge, but bulky and not terribly defined. While his muscle groups were clearly discernible there he also carried a fair amount of fat. Now that fat was melting away while at the same time his sinew seemed to come to life with detail below his skin. Veins previously hidden rose to the surface creating a twisted roadmap across his chest, arms, and legs. At the same time he could feel his muscles getting even harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly at it began the energy stopped. Jack was panting and his body was covered in sweat. The first transformation had felt incredible but this one, this was beyond description. He looked at his reflection and his face erupted into a grin. His shirt was still gone and his shorts had morphed from denim into black spandex; his skin had also darkened into a bronzed tan symbolic of professional bodybuilders. He noted that he was the same height he'd been a moment ago but had actually gained a little weight now tipping the scales at 350 pounds. That was even more incredible considering the fact that he was insanely shredded. Every muscle stood out in stark detail as if it were ready to pop right off of his body. Each of his 8 abdominals was surrounded by a deep groove and his sides were lined with countless obliques that fed into the larger bricks that lined the front of his stomach. Jack reached down and pulled one leg of his shorts up and gave his leg a hard flex. Huge slabs of muscle surged outward solidifying into giant plates with steel cables running between and around them. He gave his thigh a squeeze and smiled when he felt no give at all, like he was made of solid stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stood back up and marveled once more at his new body, it was a physique unlike any he had ever seen before. Even the various morphs and drawings he'd been collecting from the internet over the years couldn't compare. He looked more like a marble statue of a greek god than a man, and he felt just as powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack,\" a women's voice spoke from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and found the receptionist he'd been making eyes at previously standing before him. Her clothes had changed as well, her polo being replaced with a skimpy bikini top. Jack quickly noted that her physique was even more impressive up close as were her breasts which were easily a C cup. \"Yes, Danielle?\" he replied almost without thinking. Also without thinking he let his eyes run over the rest of her body taking in her long and strong legs which flowed out of a short pleated skirt that was apparently also a new part of her uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl blushed. \"I was just curious about how things went with Mr. Evans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could answer Will Evans rounded the corner carrying a gym bag over his shoulder. He was no longer wearing a suit but instead in a tank top and cloth shorts. Just as Jack has suspected the man had a fairly giant physique. In fact, at the moment he looked pretty pumped and his body glistened having just come from the showers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack!\" Evans approached the pair with his hand outstretched. \"I just wanted to thank you again. I have to admit I've never done an interview while working out like that, but you're right: you can really learn a lot about someone out on the gym floor. I just hope you feel I'd be right for the job, you've got a hell of a gym here and I'm dying to be a part of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvans turned to Danielle and shook her hand. \"It was very nice to meet you my dear,\" he said then he raised her hand to his lips and gave it a kiss while resting his eyes firmly on her cleavage. After ending the handshake with Danielle he looked back at Jack. \"I have to tell you, great choice on the uniforms. I feel like I'm in paradise with angels like this running around.\" Evans then turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had to stifle a laugh. He'd come here looking for a job and now he was apparently the owner; and a somewhat pervy one at that forcing his buxom employees to wear bikini tops and skirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that answer your question?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, are you going to hire him? Should I get his paperwork started?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Jack said, \"he knows his stuff and gave some good answers. But did you see the way he was staring at your boobs at the end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle laughed, \"So? What do you care? You stare at my boobs all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but I'm your boss. I'm allowed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle feigned outrage. \"That's sexual harassment. I could sue you, you know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, I'll make it up to you.\" Jack put his hands on his hips and flexed his monstrous pecs, his chest swelling to an incredible 75 inches around. \"I'll let you stare at my boobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this job is not without its perks,\" she purred and reached up to put her hands on his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter letting her feel around for several seconds Jack spoke up, \"Alright, I said look. I didn't say you could feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sue me!\" Now she ran her hands down to his abs and moaned with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to work,\" Jack said. Danielle pouted and smiled at the same time as she returned to her desk. Jack noticed that right behind where she sat, where previously there had been a display documenting the various success stories to come out of this particular gym, there was now a shrine to himself. Trophies, medals, posters, pictures, magazines, newspapers all showed off Jack and his various success over the years. He spotted headlines proclaiming his first contest wins at age 16, others proclaimed him a mutant or a prodigy, several detailed his undefeated streak and complete dominance on the sport. Jack approached the display and quickly skimmed an excerpt from a magazine that talked about his unheard of strength. Bodybuilders, the article said, while strong are usually outclassed by powerlifters, those who value raw power over aesthetics. Jack, was an anomaly: the perfectly built bodybuilder with strength that no one on the planet could stand up to. The article went on to list the world record lifts that Jack currently held and the list was shockingly long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still your own biggest fan, I see.\" Danielle sniped. \"Haven't you seen enough pictures of yourself yet?\" Her comment was intended to bite but he could tell she was smiling when she said it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't even turn around to respond. \"And here I thought you were my biggest fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can't hold a candle to the love you have for yourself. Plus we both know Hannah comes before me any day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah! Suddenly Jack wanted to get back home to his girlfriend and feel her hands all over his massive muscles. His wildest fantasies were coming true and he needed to share it with the one woman who truly understood how he felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held his hand up and looked at the button that had given him so much. Should he share this gift with Hannah? Of course he would; but perhaps he'd wait until he'd let her pay her respects to the god he'd become.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack couldn't keep the enormous grin off of his face, his imagination swirling with ideas even as he slipped the button into his pocket, feeling his massive thighs pressing up against it and forcing it back against the fabric, along with his phone, keys, and wallet. There were certainly a whole host of potential uses for it... but for now, he wanted to enjoy what he had at the moment. Which was a whole lot by the looks of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle, what's my schedule looking like for the rest of the day?\" Jack called back to his receptionist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That interview was the last thing you had planned - you said you were going to spend the rest of the day e-mailing contractors about expanding the building, I believe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can do all that from home. I'm headed out for the day - be a dear and lock up for me, will you?\" Still not facing his conversation partner, Jack grunted and 'casually' spread his back muscles out, muscles bulging and rippling as his wall-like figure only became more massive and intimidating - he was pretty sure he could scare off a bear all by himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, of course...\" Danielle responded, followed by a huff of desire and excitement that she tried to hide but couldn't hold in enough to avoid letting it reach Jack's ears. Jack almost couldn't believe how easy it was - even being his own boss, just being able to leave work whenever and not be questioned on it was a crazy amount of power in its own right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll see you later then.\" With confident strides, Jack pushed open the glass doors to the gym - HIS gym - and strolled out into the warm open air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took Jack about half a block to realize that he had left the gym completely topless... and a whole lot less time for him to realize that he didn't care in the slightest. It wasn't like he was full-on nude, and besides, who was going to stop him? Who would WANT to? Indeed, the attention he got walking down the street, mountainous pectorals casually hefting and slightly bobbing with his heavy thumping footsteps, was just a more amplified version of what he got when he was originally going for the job interview. A whole lot of awe, curiosity, envy, and rather sexual feelings from a whole range of people. And there was the added effect of Jack not only being so huge but also so successful now, in that a couple of people seemed to have looks of recognition across their faces, especially those who were more muscular themselves. But there were even some non-gym rats who appeared to recognize him - was he so famous that he was known outside of just bodybuilding circles?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held his head high and even flashed a couple of smiles at the more openly awed of passerby as he walked the few blocks back to his apartment... only to realize after a few minutes that muscle memory had taken him a different route than he usually went. In fact, this wasn't just some alternate path back to his apartment, he was headed another direction entirely. There was a moment of internal confusion before a list of directions popped up in his head, like he had just been asked the way around his childhood hometown - it felt like the kind of thing he had done hundreds, even thousands of times before. This reality merging thing was definitely going to take some time to get used to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was somewhat apprehensive when he realized he was entering the wealthier part of town, but it made a sort of sense when he thought about it - if he was not only an undefeated champion bodybuilder but also the owner of a successful gym, he'd definitely be raking in enough money to afford better than a dinky apartment. And those thoughts were only confirmed when he finally strolled up to the place his mind told him was his place of residence - a sprawling, three story tall abode glimmering with white marble, not necessarily a mansion but certainly on the high upper end of available real estate. It was the kind of house Jack would usually gawk at and wonder how many millions of dollars its owner made as he strolled past... and now it was all his! Well, not ALL his...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he turned off the sidewalk and approached the few marble steps leading up to an elegant wooden front door, Jack felt the sight of his house filling his head up with his new memories, almost like an aroma overtaking his senses. This wasn't the kind of house that a college student could afford... because he wasn't a college student anymore. Once he started rising up the ranks of the bodybuilding world so quickly and being offered sponsorships and contracts left and right, Jack remembered making the decision to drop out of high school and focusing solely on competing - and judging by the results, it was the smartest decision he had ever made. Though the memory was still a bit hazy for some reason, he remembered meeting Hannah different now - now he had met her at the beach during one of his earlier bodybuilding contests, and to say they had latched onto each other quickly was an understatement. They had been a good couple before, but now he got the feeling their connection was stronger than ever... just like he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, Jack was pulling out his keys, quickly unlocking the large wooden door and pulling it open with a great level of ease. The newly minted titan even got a bit distracted watching his forearm bulge from even the simple action, covered in thick, brawny veins, only to snap himself back to reality a second later and step inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house looked just as stellar on the inside as it did on the outside. Jack was greeted with the sight of an impressive foyer, intricately tiled flooring beneath his feet, his gaze turning to see a number of open pathways leading to a whole lot of different places in the home - he was pretty sure he could see a glossy kitchen down the hall directly in front of him, and he was astounded at just how many rooms he was realizing there were. Instinctively, Jack found himself kicking off his shoes and placing them on a mat next to the doorway (oh man, even his FEET were huge now!), his socked feet settling into the plush carpet as he stepped forward. It was then that Jack noticed a few other details, like a photo of him blown up of him and put on the wall. He was standing with another person... wait... was that the PRESIDENT?! The shock subsided after a moment - oh yeah, he HAD met with the president, talked with them about their initiative to popularize exercise with young kids early... he could even remember just how tight that suit of his was, the feeling of dwarfing the most politically powerful person in the country... what more was there to discover?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah, I'm home!\" Jack called out as he took a step towards the large wooden staircase that made its way from the foyer up to the second floor, mindlessly looking up as he heard his own, now deeper voice booming and echoing around the house. It wasn't too long before he heard footsteps approaching the top of the stairs...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With his mind on Hanna, Jack barely acknowledged a pleasant nod and grin from a beautiful young woman walking into the workout area.  To say she was a knockout was undervaluing her entire package.  She was gorgeous, a model shaming beautiful in fact, with long blonde hair, neatly tied into a pony tail, deep blue eyes with long lashes and eye popping mascara, a small, narrow nose, full red lips, high cheek bones and a radiant, bright white smile.  This young woman was wearing a tight pink sports bra, matching tight spandex shorts and white sports shoes.  The outfit was established to showcase her tight young body and fitness level muscles that curved and bulged sexily across her 5 foot 4 inch frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle cleared her throat.  \u201cAh-hem, are you already forgetting your appointment with Lauren?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Jack turned toward Lauren, smiled at the angelic woman staring back at him and then over toward Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, I guess I did.  What is on the agenda?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle rolled her eyes.  \u201cYou\u2019re her personal trainer remember.  You just signed her two weeks ago to represent the gym.  She could have gone anywhere, but she wanted to train with the best, which according to you, is you.  And she bought it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned and sighed.  \u201cWell, you know, only the best for the best.  Uh, what is the plan for today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle snorted.  \u201cChest and arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, his brain once again catching up to the situation in front of him.  He walked over toward Lauren and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, Lauren, ready for the workout?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled back and his knees nearly buckled.  \u201cMy god,\u201d he thought, \u201cshe is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, and her body is already beyond fitness level.  This has become the best wish ever!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren looked over at the cables of the fly machine.  \u201cI\u2019ve already done my cardio and stretching, so if you\u2019re ready we can start with my chest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at her chest and was rewarded with a set of thick pectorals that melded with a pair of pleasantly sized, hard, gravity defying breasts.  The pectoral cleavage was on clear display as her top dipped low.  She wasn\u2019t ripped to shreds, but had some good definition as he now knew she was a few weeks out from competition, and she was well into her modified diet.  He also stared a bit too long, moving out to see her thick arms with veins popping out and moving down from her broad, sexy shoulders, across her biceps and triceps and down her strapping forearms.  Her six pack abs were clearly evident and her legs were thick with clean quad separation and calf muscles that pushed out beyond her shins.  Lauren sniffed, knowing full well what Jack was doing as he continued to stare at her physique and drool mentally.  But she also knew he got results so she put up with his somewhat boorish behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking we could do cable flies to start.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, the workout he had in mind flashing into his head.  He had sent it ahead to Lauren, so she was simply acknowledging what he had planned.  Lauren was his age, someone who began working out in earnest two years ago, inspired by Jack\u2019s accomplishments.  Her friends questioned her desire to work out so hard as she was already a knockout, but Lauren was someone who had incredible drive.  Sure she was beautiful and very intelligent, but even that wasn\u2019t enough for her.  Lauren had no desire to have anyone take advantage of her and in her mind, having a strong body was one way to accomplish her goals of not just being another pretty face, but a pretty face with strength and power.  And once she started working out, she loved the results and the feeling of strength.  Once she turned 18, sponsors were after her to promote their supplements and fashions.  She could have gone anywhere, but seeing as Jack was the original person to inspire her and an accomplished trainer, she accepted his offer.  The fact that he was a bit of a horndog was something she put up with, seeing as Jack had a solid girlfriend and so far had not hit on her.  Jack, for his part couldn\u2019t help but enjoy being the personal trainer of the biggest up and comer on the fitness scene, especially one so damn hot.  So with a smile he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack moved over and set the weights to levels that were very high for a woman, which were at 80 pounds, but of course this level was not in his league, which made him very happy.  He stood back and watched as Lauren gripped the first handle, walked over to the other and was soon standing in the correct position.  Jack stood in front of her and looked into her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Lauren, three sets of 15.  Then we move down the weight a bit for three more sets.  Ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren nodded and brought her arms forward and the handles down, pulling the weights up.  Jack kept his eyes on her face, but couldn\u2019t help but stare at the bulging pectorals, pulled to life with the stress against them.  As she moved through her workout it was more than apparent that Lauren represented the perfect woman in his fantasies.  Or at least a version of one.  She was beautiful, had an athletic, but womanly thin frame and certainly had plenty of well-proportioned muscle.  But in his mind, she could always have more.  His mind wandered to thoughts of Lauren being incredibly muscular with impossible strength while maintaining her feminine curves and gorgeous features.  Such was his fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren continued to pump the weights slowly to maximize the stress that would build her muscles, Jack\u2019s member was stiffening and he suddenly felt the button tightly placed in his pocket, now near his expanding penis.  As he counted out 14 and with his thoughts clearly on a stronger, more muscular Lauren, one who could gain strength and muscle size at a ridiculous rate, he didn\u2019t notice that his engorged penis pressed the button.  He blinked, as he hadn\u2019t used the button on anyone but himself before.  The room went blurry for a moment and as it slowly cleared, he was soon staring at\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As his vision cleared, he was still staring at Lauren, but she was now vastly different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lauren in front of him was no longer just a sexy fitness star, she was now the biggest, most muscular woman, hell, PERSON he had ever seen!  She was nothing short of a female version of himself, but her muscles were much larger, her muscular cuts were even deeper and as he glanced over at the weights, her muscles were much, MUCH stronger!  Lauren was now pulling forward an entire 500-pound stack with five more 100 pound disks on either side, chained on the machine.  The cable had been re-enforced to accommodate twice the weight it was originally set for.  Jack gulped at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren brought her still dainty and perfectly manicured hands forward, he absently said 15 and Lauren allowed the weights to head down carefully before releasing the handles.  However, the weights fell the final inches and slammed into the ground, shaking the entire gym!  Lauren stood up and brought her massive arms down to her side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Jack, I\u2019m glad the machine can handle that weight, but as you know, I want more.  Now that I\u2019ve broken all of your lifting records I don\u2019t want to stop now.  After all, these pecs are just aching to grow larger, stronger, harder and more shredded!  I am going to DESTROY the competition at the Mr. Olympia in two weeks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned at the wide-eyed Jack whose erection was now at full strength!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo offense Jack, seeing as you had your sights on the title, but after all, competing against the women now hardly seems fair.  And not that you seem to mind, as I can get you hard with a flex, but now that I\u2019m the strongest woman on the planet and stronger than you, I don\u2019t see why I should stop.  After all, I\u2019m only 18, having trained for a several years to get to fitness level.  Hard to believe that I\u2019ve made these massive gains since we\u2019ve been training together these last few weeks!  Talk about super human, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled and laughed as she pumped her massive, seven inch thick pecs of doom up and down, tearing threads away from the already overstressed pink top and sending the sports bra toward destruction, exposing the tanned, jagged, meaty, striated, vein engorges mega muscles in all of their superior glory!  And even more amazing was that her impromptu flexing session was adding even MORE staggering muscle to her already overloaded chest!  Jack\u2019s brain was ready to tilt as he caught up to his unintended activation of the magic button.  She really DID grow stronger and larger by impossible rates in just the last two weeks!  She was now well over 10 times stronger than she was just two weeks ago and her muscles exploded with new growth every time she worked out.  Her beauty was still clearly evident as her appearance above her neck was the same if not even better, but that model shaming head was attached to the most jacked up powerful feminine body the world had ever seen!  And just as amazing, she contained the most powerfully muscular body within feminine curves that made Jack suck in a breath to try and keep himself from ejaculating right there!  Her lats, shoulders, abs and oblique muscles had all transformed to balance out her growth, blowing her chest circumference to over 80 staggering inches around!  And that was two days ago.  She was even LARGER now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Jack stunned into a statue, Lauren finally let out a deep breath and stopped pumping her mighty chest as she was about to tear her top to shreds.  But if she cared, she didn\u2019t let on and glanced over at the weights on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know we had planned to head over to bench presses next, but I figured that this was chest and arm day, so I could work my biceps next.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack coughed as sweat was trickling down his cheek and his body jerked as his erection was now painful and begging for release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, sure thing Lauren.  I can, uh, remove some of the weight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLauren smiled broadly.  \u201cNo need.  I think I can handle these weights.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blinked and could only get out an \u201cUh\u201d before Lauren was once again pulling her slender fingers around the first handle and pulled the weights up and walking to one side, gripped the handle of the other stack and moved toward the center once again.  Jack now knew that this was twice as much as she had lifted just two days ago.  Superhuman indeed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack\u2019s eyes widened even further, Lauren pulled her forearms forward with a light feminine grunt and her face contorted a bit with effort and determination.  If she were to curl half a ton with each arm, it was not going to be easy.  His attention was now drawn to her arms and the largest, hardest set of biceps he, or for that matter, the world had ever seen!  They had measured them at 32 inches around just two days ago and as they quivered and tensed, Jacked gulped at the thought and sight that Lauren\u2019s mighty arms were now even larger!  And as her forearms reached vertical and a bit beyond, Lauren had completed the curls!  With a loud huff, Lauren held the weight and stared at Jack with strained eyes.  Jack nodded and squeaked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stared at the twin mountains of trembling muscles that rose on her arms.  Muscles that were ripped to shreds, clearly separated by a seismic fault between the front and rear bicep muscles, sported thick power pumping veins above her thin tanned skin, and showcased twin throbbing peaks just begging to push higher.  Jack estimated her arms were easily 34 impossible inches around and were now over twice as strong as his once record breaking muscles!  And she wasn\u2019t done!  Allowing the weights to head down, Lauren grit her teeth and repeated the feat.  Jack counted hypnotically and once she reached ten, the impossible happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of growing weaker against the stress, Lauren was growing STRONGER!  And she knew it!  Pausing as she held a ton of weight with her arms, she shook her head, bobbing her ponytail behind her and flipping off the sweat formed on her brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh this is just so AWESOME!  I can just FEEL my strength building and growing as my muscles harden and expand!  I\u2019m now stronger than when I started curling the weights!  I really AM Supergirl!  Add more weights Jack.  Add a LOT more weight!  Time to go mega super!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped as his straining penis pulsed and he began to ejaculate, shaking his huge body as he grunted.  Trying in vain not to give the obvious away, Jack lurched to the sides toward the stacks of weights and piled on as much weight as he dared.  Lauren was wiping off the beads of sweat and tugged a few times at her overstressed top before simply tearing the ruined rags away and tossing them to the ground.  As Jack finished adding another 500 pounds to each side, he returned to see her topless with a broad smile across her angelic face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry I ripped out of my top, but damn, I feel sooooooo strong and powerful now Jack!  And sexy as hell!  Like there isn\u2019t anything I can\u2019t do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s jaw dropped at the full sight of her otherworldly chest and with a gasp he ejaculated hard into his shorts, bucking his hips as he stared at the pumped up shreds across the eight inch thick expanse of Supergirl pectoral delight.  Her breasts had all but merged into the wall of pectorals power and her nipples, now free, pushed out over half an inch away from her inch and half diameter areolas.  Lauren pumped the mega muscles up and down a few times, moaning with delight at the feeling of power flooding into her dancing, rippling, raging pectorals.  Thoughts of bench-pressing a ton soon became thoughts of lifting several tons!  For reps!  With a rye smile, Lauren finally released her pectoral flex after seeing Jack finish his unintended ejaculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I guess no apology is necessary, hmmmmmm?  I\u2019m not sure what is different today, but whatever strength and muscle gains I\u2019ve experienced over the last two weeks, as seemingly impossible as they were, are now actually accelerating!  I can just FEEL my muscles throbbing with unearthly strength and power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped as he tried to catch his breath from his orgasm.  Lauren turned and reaching for each cable, set herself back in the center and smiled brightly at Jack as he struggled to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd even though you just added another 500 pounds to each side, which is 50% more weight than I just lifted\u2026\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s brain, already near tilt and trying to recover from Lauran\u2019s recent feats, went back toward disbelief as Lauren let out a light grunt and EASILY pulled both stacks and added disks upward into a double bicep curl that caused the bearings to groan and Lauren\u2019s bicep to EXPLODE upward with inches of additional girth!  Her biceps were now easily 36 world record crushing inches around and four times stronger than any man alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese weights feel more like warm up weights than a maximum weight!  I really AM becoming a Supergirl Jack!  And these muscles have only just begun to hit their potential!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack went back to heavy breathing and his seemingly spent penis started to grow hard again and the button, pushed to the side during his ejaculation, slid back toward the center and was once again near his hardening penis.  Watching Lauren allow the weights to head back down, he began to imagine Lauren making a super leap in abilities.  Stray thoughts also brought him back to his girlfriend Hanna.  How was she handling Lauren?  Would she be a rival or like Jack, a fan?  Could Hanna have the same abilities, or even greater abilities?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lauren giggled at how light the weights felt, she pumped the huge weights up and down just as Jack inadvertently pressed the button once again.  The room went hazy, and when it cleared\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lost in thought he jumped and let out a surprised yelp as Hanna opened the door to the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hanna walked in with a cloth bag of groceries in her left hand, she looked around the apartment, worried that Jack had yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?  Are you OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed, embarrassed that his reaction wasn\u2019t very manly.  \u201cEverything\u2019s OK.  I was just, uh, deep in thought.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna gave him a curious glance and brought the groceries into the small kitchen and began to put them away.  As she opened a cabinet door, she looked back at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what were you thinking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack licked his lips as he was still staring at the button.  He looked over at the screen and saw a very muscular morph of a beautiful female.  Sighing he smiled and looked up to finally give Hanna some attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apparently ordered this button over the internet and it, well, showed up right away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna finished putting some yogurt into the refrigerator, closed the door and walked toward Jack.  Jack let out a short breath.  Hanna had on tight jeans that formed nicely around her thin, but curvy legs that showcased her cute behind.  She had on a thick oversized t-shirt with the Captain America shield on the front.  Jack smirked as he realized it was his shirt and it hung loosely across her thin frame with the sleeves ending near her elbows.  As she had small breasts, he surmised she wasn\u2019t wearing a bra.  Her hair had a couple of Superman braids on the sides to keep her bangs from her long dark hair at bay.  Even with little make-up she was very pretty, with those bright green eyes, cute button nose, narrow chin and warm smile.  Sliding next to Jack, Hanna gave him a peck on the cheek and took a step back to look down at the button Jack had been staring at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo tell me, how can you \u2018apparently\u2019 order something over the internet?  How much did this button cost you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack squirmed uncomfortably.  \u201cNothing.  I didn\u2019t put in any credit card information and it, well showed up right away.  It\u2019s supposed to be a reality button, so I guess you think of something and hit the button, reality will change to match your thoughts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna gave him a disbelieving look.  \u201cWell that makes it appear to be some kind of joke.  Did one of your engineering friends do this to you by hacking your computer and then setting you up?  I mean, what happened when you pressed the button?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed again.  \u201cI, uh, haven\u2019t tried it yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna chuckled lightly.  Normally he found that chuckle very sexy, but it held a bit of a condescending tone this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing it will just make some rude noise and alert your friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack scrunched his face.  He had to admit, Hanna\u2019s assessment did make more sense than having a magical reality button appear on his doorstep after clicking a button on his computer.  So with things making more sense for the moment, Jack sat down at his desk and smiled up at Hanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re probably right.  But before I push the button to see which one of my friends did this to me, if this thing really could change reality, what would want to change?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna smiled and walked around the desk to look at Jack.  \u201cOh, I think you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled back.  He did.  Even though neither of them had put together a workout routine to at least try to build up their bodies, they still had their muscle growth fantasies.  Recently, Jack had been leaning toward fantasies of Hanna growing huge muscles, giving him the opportunity to touch and probe her pumped up body, and to give Hanna a chance to save him from some kind of danger, or from a super villain or maybe a superhero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack glanced at the screen, the image staring back at him burned in his brain.  What if Hanna became like the woman on his screen?  Nodding his head to agree with Hanna\u2019s comment he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, since I\u2019m the one who\u2019s going to push the button and we\u2019re playing a fantasy game, I was thinking about changing you first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna raised her eyebrows.  \u201cOh really?  And what did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled back.  \u201cLet me think about it and push the button.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHanna laughed.  \u201cOh, a surprise, huh?  Well OK then, go ahead and hit the button.  I can hardly wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack laughed back.  \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll love it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his fantasy fully planted in his head, Jack smiled, reached over and hit the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a blue wave of light emanated from the button and instantly spread across the room.  And to the surprise of both Jack and Hanna, Hanna began to change into\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had to admit, that was a pretty good trick.  Looking at the button, he tried to figure out where the LED emitters were that created the blue light.  But as he stared at the button, Hannah let out a surprised, but lustful high pitch groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Jack.  What exactly were you thinking about when you hit the button?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held his attention to the button.  \u201cWell you know the one forum with the superhero muscle growth?  I was looking over pictures of muscled up Supergirls.  I found A REALLY muscled up Supergirl.  And, well, I thought about you having the power of Supergirl with those muscles so you\u2019d be much stronger than Superman or Doomsday or well, any other hero or villain.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack heard what sounded like treads popping coming from where Hannah was standing and his attention on the button waned as Hannah asked him a question with a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd was she wearing any clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slowly looked up.  \u201cUh, heh, no, not in the picture.  She had, well burst out of her uniform and\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack\u2019s gaze reached Hannah he stopped talking as he saw Hannah staring back at him.  Her clothes were at the breaking point across her frame as it appeared that her body was growing.  No, check that, it was her MUSCLES that were growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, it couldn\u2019t be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCould it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading his mind, Hannah let out a breath and now smiled as the power of a comic book hero flooded her body and her muscles continued to expand.  \u201cMaybe there\u2019s something to that button after all!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jeans ripped loudly as her legs piled on mounds of knee weakening muscles that pounded forward, shredding the tough denim until it fell to the floor around her bare feet, leaving her in barely there short shorts.  Hannah flexed her legs and the muscles exploded forth into slabs of cut beef big enough and hard enough to shame most any bodybuilding man, much less a female bodybuilder.  As Hannah pulled her right foot up she twisted down on her toes, bloating her calf to the size of a cantaloupe and expanding her thigh into devastatingly cut quads of steel a good foot thick!  Hanna smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I see you wanted to give me some really big legs.  And really cut legs too, I mean these quads are just bulging with rippling muscle!  Was this what you were thinking?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded, currently too stunned for words.  Hannah sighed again as the muscle growth continued on her upper body, tearing the t-shirt in multiple places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what about my upper body?  Pretty big there too?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blinked as his mouth opened slightly.  \u201cYeah,\u201d he thought, \u201ceven bigger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah held her arms down at her side as she was getting into the growth now.  Tensing her upper body, her lats spread outward and as she leaned forward a bit to tense her chest and arms, her pecs rolled outward, her traps and deltoids rose and widened while her arms added mounds of muscle across her forearms and triceps as her biceps bulged bigger than each calf, shredding the sleeves as her each arm expanded to over 20 inches around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah let out a breath and snickered.  \u201cBigger you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hard inhale, the t-shirt tore off her body with a loud rip, completely exposing her now Herculean upper body.  Her back was spread out a good 3 feet wide, curving wildly down to her narrow, muscle laden 8 pack abs and rippling oblique muscles.  Hannah chuckled as she tensed her chest and the pectoral muscles solidified and rippled as striations pumped their way across her upper body, her pectorals flexed out four inches thick and newly minted DD boobs of steel with erect thimble nipples melded perfectly with into her pecs, giving her the sexiest, most powerful looking chest Jack had ever seen on a breathing being.  Was all of this real?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah let out a satisfied moan as not only was she enjoying the muscle growth, but the feeling of super strength that continued to surge throughout her body.  Slowly pulled her arms up, Hannah smiled at Jack and his stunned expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, if I know you.  And I think I do.  This Supergirl you were thinking about from the artwork or morph.  Was she flexing her biceps?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack\u2019s eyes widened as he glanced at the picture on the screen and then back at Hanna.  Oh, good lord.  He had.  And being a bicep fiend, Hanna wasn\u2019t just flexing up biceps proportional to the large muscles she was currently sporting, but\u2026..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah let out a satisfying \u201cMmmmmmmm\u201d as her thick forearms reached vertical and she tensed her small hands into twin fists, flexing her biceps up into twin mounds of unreal muscle that expanded up over her shoulders and peaked 6 inches into the air.  The splits carved their way across her mighty muscle as Hannah felt her strength build as she held her flex and her biceps ground upward, pushing her peak even higher as enough muscle to out flex most any man was now at her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m also guessing these bulging biceps can grow even bigger if I flex them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah brought her forearms back slightly to release her flex, smiling broadly at the stunned Jack before pulling her fists higher and squeezing down.  The biceps, redefining their reality, pushed up another six inches until the peaks reached the top of her fists, showcasing twin mountains of cut, rippling power packed muscles!  Hannah smiled as she looked from one massive bicep to the next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah!  Check these bad boys out!  They\u2019ve got to be over 50 inches around!  This is so awesome!  And I feel soooooo strong!  Like I could curl a building or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah popped her bicep peaks up and down a few times to accentuate the incredible muscles size and control, driving throbbing muscle fibers up and down her biceps and rippling down her triceps.  Smiling broadly at the still stunned Jack, Hannah released her flex even though she was sure she could flex her biceps even bigger.  The muscles reduced someone, but enough muscle remained to showcase the oversized nature of her arms.  Hannah truly looked Uber powerful and sexy as hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo Jack, now that we apparently know that button of yours works, what would you like to do next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack glanced over at the TV he had forgot he had on and saw a news story flash onto the screen that made him smile.  He then looked back at his muscle bulging girlfriend.  Decisions, decisions\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cleared his throat and said\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I'd say the gym would be the best place to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah gave a sly smile, thinking about the prospect Jack was offering. Not only was she as into it as he was, the growth had also given her a massive spike in confidence, as evidenced by her boastful talk while she was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that would be great for both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack beamed. Now they had a plan, and the means to enact pretty much whatever they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! But, uh, as much as I love your... full form...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack had to shift a bit to quell the near uncomfortable erection he got from looking at those stellar boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... We should probably get you into some clothes. Just so you don't get arrested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah looked disappointed. It was clear she was enjoying her own body more than she ever had before. \"I guess you're right. But we don't have anything that could fit me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could have sworn she flexed her biceps a bit right at that moment just to tease him. Somehow, he managed to tear his attention away from that and onto the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Well, let's see if this button can do some more... minor changes...\" Jack stated before pressing the button once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother flash occurred, causing Jack to blink rapidly a couple of times to clear his vision. This time, the change was instant. Jack had replicated the outfit Hannah had been wearing before, only now it was a bit more... fun. Far from being oversized now, the Captain America shirt was a lot more like a tank top, only covering the bare necessities of her chest and not even bothering with her titanic abs. Her denim shorts were paltry compared to her knockout thighs and bubble butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Hannah complimented, giving her chest an experimental flex that made Jack's heart skip a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, shall we head off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded eagerly, following Hannah as she made her way to the apartment door. The two of them now had complete control of reality; the possibilities were endless. They still didn't know the full extent of the button, though. Jack had noticed a story on the news about a superhero stopping some crime; definitely something that hadn't existed before. It probably had to do with his thoughts about Supergirl while changing Hannah. He would have to be a bit careful about what he wished for...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe campus gym was fairly close to their apartment, and the two of them took a more discrete route, not wanting Hannah to be noticed quite yet. Both of them were suckers for a good surprise. Even though Hannah was just lightly walking, Jack had to jog quickly to keep up with her long, powerful strides. Still, he didn't mind; the view from behind was quite nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn no time, they reached the gym. Before heading inside, Jack turned to Hannah (he now had to look UP at her; she had definitely gained some height too). \"Let's go around the side, I want to look through the window before we make our entrance.\" Smiling happily in agreement, Hannah walked with Jack around the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack peered in at the patrons of the gym. The gym was mostly empty, but Jack did spot one person he recognized: Noah. Noah was a big football star at their university, so he was pretty popular. However, he also fit well into the \"jerk jock\" stereotype. Jack had definitely seen his fair share of people get tormented by the athlete. Noah was currently hitting the weights, surrounded by some of his football buddies. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack motioned for Hannah to bring him to the ground (as amazing as being lifted felt), and Hannah happily obliged. He then explained who was in there and what he had planned. Hannah was eager; any opportunity to show off her body AND do some good was appreciated. \"Sounds excellent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled. \"Excellent. Stay outside until I call for you. Then the fun starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next minute, Jack was inside the gym, strolling past the main desk and into the lifting area. There was every kind of workout machine you could think of, but Jack only moved closer to where Noah was. He figured just his presence would be enough to entice the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, he was right. The next time Noah finished his reps, he sat up from the bench, immediately taking notice of the scrawny nerd standing close to him. He had an incredulous look on his face. \"Jack? What's a guy like you doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was honestly surprised the guy even remembered his name. Still, that would just make it all the more fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, just having a look around. Thinking about starting to work out a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah stood up, letting out an obnoxious snort. \"You? Really? C'mon, you've got to be kidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack would have been more annoyed if he didn't know what was in store. \"Hey, what's the harm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoah's two friends were smiling broadly. \"Let me give you some advice,\" Noah continued. \"You can work out, but don't do it here. This is a place for people who can actually lift more than 10 lbs., so until you've got any sort of meat on your bones, keep out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rolled his eyes, not even bothering to point out how flawed the logic was. \"Oh yeah? ... How about a lift-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them simply burst out laughing in response. \"Really? If you want to get destroyed so hard you'll be in a coma for a couple days, then sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Jack who couldn't help but grin wildly. \"Hey... who said *I* was going to be the one lifting against you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned towards the entrance, cupping his hands together to get the maximum volume out of his voice. \"Hannah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned around the other way just in time to see the jocks' jaws drop to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe simply smiled and didn't even bother turning around again. In a few seconds, he could just feel the monstrous presence of the woman behind him radiate with pure strength. He was sure Hannah felt that feeling a million times over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, a lift-off?\" Hannah inquired playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three jerks were way too stunned to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super woman gave off a smirk, simply making her way past the now silent athletes. \"So, how much is on here Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say around 300 pounds,\" Jack responded, trying to hold back his excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if that's the best you've got...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles bulging with slight veins already, Hannah slightly bent down with her inflated legs and picked up the bar, hoisting it up like it was nothing. It was a 300 pound bar meant to be benched, and she was curling it with one hand like it was air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously the weight meant nothing to her, but she started lifting it up and down, just enjoying the sensation of her biceps bulging and pushing up against the rest of her body. She let out a moan of pleasure, giving her lips a little sensual lick before placing the bar back on the rack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was pathetic. Hold on, I'm going to see if I can make this a little more... interesting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and the jocks looked on (him with anticipation, them with astonishment) as Hannah quickly went around the gym, picking up every spare weight available and loading it up onto the bar. By then, most of the other gym patrons had stopped their workouts, looking curiously to see this mysterious woman bigger than any person they had ever seen before. In no time flat, Hannah had loaded the bar up with so much weight it looked like it was going to snap in half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jack, how much weight is on the bar NOW?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1650 pounds,\" Jack quickly responded. It was obvious he had been eagerly counting the entire time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah smiled. Not needing any more of an introduction, she reached down and hoisted up the bar once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly, the bar still weighed practically nothing to her, and she was still loving it. Despite this, her muscles were obviously bulging out even more due to the pressure, swelling up and out in a manner that REALLY enticed Jack like you wouldn't believe. She brought the bar all the way above her head, giving a little roar of triumph as her biceps nearly hit the side of her head. It looked like half of the gym was going to faint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't done there. With just a little groan, the once petite college girl pulled inwards, the metal instantly warping to her whim. In about a second, the bar wrapped all the way around into a loop, defying seemingly all laws of human limitation. Jack knew Hannah was simply the strongest there was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like she had the energy of a thousand suns but feigning a look of boredom, Hannah dropped the weight onto the ground. The weight smacked into the carpet with an enormous THUD which made everyone but the titan herself jump into the air. She then turned to the group of guys, who had nearly pissed their pants at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's obvious who the weaker ones are here. Now, you three are going to get out of here like the pushovers you are, and if I ever see you picking on anyone ever again, ESPECIALLY me or my boyfriend, you're going to be in world of trouble. GOT IT?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks got out of the gym like it was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out a laugh as the bullies high-tailed it out. He was going to go congratulate Hannah on he amazing-ness when they were interrupted by...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He quickly shoved the button into his pocket before heading out to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, babe.\"  He heard Hannah say as he opened the door.  \"I ran in to Brit at the store and we decided to have a movie night.  You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rounded the corner and saw their neighbor helping his girlfriend carry in groceries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Sounds fun.\"  He dumbly responded, still a little unnerved and embarrassed by the device at his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\"  shouted Brit.  \"I just grabbed The Avengers on Blu-Ray.  Such a great movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first glance, Brittany was an unlikely friend for her two next-door neighbors.  A model's face framed by shoulder-length golden blonde hair sat atop a body that appeared to belong to a top-class cheerleader, which made sense because she was on the squad at NSU.  She had lately been spending more time hanging out with Jack and Hannah than her teammates, though.  She had been in the same class at NCHS (Northern City High School) as Hannah, but Brittany had naturally spent more time with the jocks and other cheerleaders instead of the nerdy crowd.  When she moved in to her new college apartment, however, it was discovered that she shared more interests with her neighbors than she did with the other girls she practiced with, having hidden her nerdy habits from ruthless high school cliques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here ya go.\"  Brit handed him the disc before turning back to help Hanna in the kitchen.  Jack caught himself staring as she walked away.  Her tiny denim shorts clung tightly to an impossibly perfect bubble butt that bounces joyously with every step.  The shorts only covered her butt, though, leaving in full view the best pair of legs Jack had ever seen not on a computer monitor.  She went to her toes on every step,  bringing out impressive definition on her athletic calves.  Jack and Hannah had often spoke of those legs and the rest of her toned body after hanging out with the girl.  They went on about how it was lucky they were to live next to a girl that fit their fetish, often lusting together over the thought of her adding mass to her impressively defined muscles.  They had gone so far as to browse her Facebook page just for bikini pictures.  Last week, Jack had walked in on Hannah \"just looking\" at one such photo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack inserted the disc and sat on the loveseat.  The girls entered shortly with Hannah snuggling up to him on the small couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scootch over,\" Brit said. \"None of your other chairs have a good angle on the tv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader didn't wait for him to move and started to squeeze in next to him.  Hannah started to shift and Jack thought she was getting up to make room.  He was wrong, though.  She slung her slender legs over his and reached her arm around his shoulder pulling herself onto his lap, putting her own firm butt directly on his crotch.  It wasn't in the same league as Brit's magnificent ass, but then again, nobody's was.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel firmness of Brit's thighs press against his.  He could feel her strong shoulders pressing into his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel Hannah's modest, but perky breasts press against his chest.  He could feel her firm behind pressing against his penis, which was rapidly beginning to push back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't going to be able to focus on the film.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to get comfortable, Brit adjusted her arms putting one over the back of the couch and the other behind Jack, overlapping Hannah's.  This position pulled her already short shirt up revealing the most of her tight six-pack abs.  Jack caught this immediately and observed by way of a mirror that hung beside the TV.  He also noticed that her abs seemed more defined than before  Previously they had been impressive, but she hadn't had a full-blown six-pack.  Granted he had never gotten this good of a view in person, he and Hannah had seen plenty on Facebook.  Especially since Brit had gone to the beach this summer and spammed social media with pictures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of Brit improving her physique took his mind to the fantasy that he and Hannah shared about their neighbor, hardening his cock further.  Hannah must have noticed that because she looked him right in the eyes and gave a quick glance down and back up.  Jack smiled and Hannah gestured with her eyes at the mirror and raised her brows, while sensually wiggling her butt on his lap.  She noticed that, too.  The thought of Brit expanding her muscles along with all of the flesh he was touching brought his mind back to the device in his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could his life possibly get better?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>So.  This thing can grant wishes, eh.</i>  Jack thought to himself.  <i>God, look at those abs.  Brit is so ripped.  What if she had some mass to go with that tone?</i>  He squeezed his hand into his pocket to push the miracle button on the off chance it worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he worked his had over the device, Hannah started gyrating her hips on his lap again.  He looked up into the mirror and the locked eyes.  His girlfriend didn't hold the raw sex appeal of Brittany, but she was no doubt pretty.  Her body, though not up to the standards of their shared fetish, was not completely devoid of curves.  She was naturally slender with narrow shoulders and a skinny waistline, which made her smallish, but perky, breasts appear larger than they were. Her butt and thighs were actually above average for her size, and she often jokingly theorized that if they were to go to the gym, she'd be able to outsquat Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose jokes came to mind as she ground her glutes into his burgeoning erection.  <i>What if she really could outsquat him?  Hell, what if she was just as fit as Brit?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts he absentmindedly pressed the button.  Time seemed to freeze for a moment, and then it was as if a flashbang was thrown into the room.  His vision was flooded with whiteness and his ears began to ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he shook his head and cleared his senses, he found he was sitting back at his desk again with the button sitting in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard the door creak, but was too busy contemplating his change of location to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey babe!\"  He heard Hannah shout from the other room.  \"Brit decided to come back with me for a movie night?  You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.  Sure. Sounds fun.\" He dumbly responded, trying to shake the deja vu out of his head.  But it wasn't deja vu, he knew.  This had literally just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" shouted Brit. \"I just grabbed The Avengers on Blu-Ray. Such a great movie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.  I'm going to shower first.  You mind coming out here to keep Brit company until I get out?\"  Hannah said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe quickly shoved the button into his pocket before heading out to the living room.  He opened the bedroom door just as he heard the bathroom door shut and the shower start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit was... different from before.  Most noticeably she was dressed differently.  Instead of daisy dukes and a tight t-shirt that barely showed her stomach, she now wore just a sports bra and tight lycra shorts.  He must have been staring, he was confused after all, because Brit broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" She said with a chuckle \"I showered at the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just gave a nervous chuckle back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gym.  That explained the outfit, and a little bit more.  Her clothes left little to the imagination.  The six-pack that he had been marveling at just moments ago was just a little bit more defined.  Her legs, which before had thought to be perfect, were just a little thicker with alluring muscle.  Her golden hair, which she normally let flow, was pulled up into a ponytail revealing shoulders and traps that were noticeably stronger.  He still hadn't spoken, too distracted by the beauty standing before him, so Brit continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I've said it before, but I'm glad Hannah asked me about the gym.  It's funny that she assumed I got my body from working out when really it was all from cheerleading and fad diets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It had all been from cheerleading?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've made some good progress these past few months,\" Brit said with a pause while demonstrably tensing her muscles and melting Jacks brain \"But your girl is like a weightlifting demon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought my ears were burning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing Hannah' voice, Jack whipped around.  He had been too enraptured by Brit's flexing display to notice the shower had turned off.  He might have been concerned about whiplash from jerking his head too fast, but what was in front of his wide open eyes had his complete attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore him stood his girlfriend.  It was unmistakably her, with the same cute face with green eyes and long black hair.  Different, though, was where her hair landed.  Her wet raven locks rested on shoulders much different than before.  She still appeared to have the same naturally narrow frame, but her delts had added a considerable amount of shredded mass.  She was wearing nothing but a towel, which covered the important bits up top and hung just low enough to cover the lower ones as well, but not much further.  From the bottom edge of the towel came legs that ended the theory of her outsquatting him.  It was no longer a joke, with these thighs it was obvious she could outlift him at any challenge requiring the lower body.  He was stunned.  He jaw stood wide.  The best reference for her body was... well, it looked just as impressive as Brit's did, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, Brit broke the silence again.  \"Yep.  I was just talking about how you've been killing it at the gym.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really was a good day wasn't it,\" Hannah responded  \"I love arm day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she held her towel with her left hand and raised her right into perfect bicep flex.  Years of looking at them online had taught her how to do it just right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl!  And to think, less than three months ago you were as thin as a twig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I have to say I'm proud of myself.  Pretty soon I'll catch up to you, even with your athletic head start.\" Hannah joked with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me say, I think you already have, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit walked around Jack and threw up a rear flex with her right arm next to Hannah's still flexed bicep.  The blonde's arm was just marginally larger and more defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost.  I'll get you soon.\" With that, Hannah dropped her flex and smack Brit square on her world class glutes, bringing them to Jack's attention.  Previously Brit's ass was huge with a pleasing bounce to it.  Now it was somehow even larger, and it barely reacted to the smack.  Instead of the hard slap hitting juicy fat, it landed on a solid slab of muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you go get dressed so loverboy stops drooling over you and we'll get the movie started.\" Brit inserted the disc and made her way to the couch where Jack had landed trying to unscramble his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could once again feel the firmness of Brit's thighs press against his. He could again feel her strong shoulders pressing into his.  Only now, whatever tiny bit of softness had been in the blonde athlete's body was gone.  He only felt pure muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah quickly came out of the bedroom wearing short cotton shorts and one of his Star Wars t-shirts.  Through the haze of lust he noticed that the shirt didn't fit her like most girl's boyfriend's shirts would.  Instead of draping from her like a curtain, it now clung tight to shoulders which filled the sleeves better than he ever had.  It was also visibly stretched across her back, probably stretching it out of shape.  He liked his shirts tight, but before... this, they were still too large for Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, his girlfriend positioned herself on his lap.  He could feel Hannah's modest, but perky breasts press against his chest, along with the strength practically radiating from her pecs. He could feel her firm behind, now seemingly equal to Brit's in all it's splendor, pressing against his penis.  This time though, his penis wasn't getting any harder.  Not because he wasn't turned on, quite the opposite.  His boner had been growing since before she even finished her shower and he was staring lustfully at their scantily clad neighbor.  It had long ago reached maximum size.  Hannah must have noticed, too. Even though the movie was starting, she continually tensed and relaxed her powerful glutes against his member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, He wasn't able to focus on the film<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>What next?</b></span></div></div>",

Almost everything else was differnt. Her wet raven locks rested on shoulders that looked like they'd been pulled from his internet sites. She still appeared to have the same naturally narrow frame, but he was quite sure the towel was pressed out further from her body than it had been. He was also certain that her 2 inch height advantage over Brittany was something new. The towel must have been bigger than before as it still seemed to hang to just low enough to cover her privates, but the legs coming out from the bottom looked like they'd be able to not just outsquat him but probably set some records. He was stunned. His jaw stood wide. The best reference for her body was some of the hotter internet sites he'd visited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, Brit broke the silence again. \"Yep.

To Jack's increased arousal, his girlfriends bicep was noticeably larger than the blondes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost. We'll see if you can keep it this close.\" With that, Hannah dropped her flex and smack Brit square on her world class glutes, bringing them to Jack's attention. Brit's even fuller,  shapelier ass didn't move at all from Hannah's firm slap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you go get dressed so loverboy stops drooling over you and we'll get the movie started.\" Brit inserted the disc and made her way to the couch where Jack had landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could once again feel the firmness of Brit's thighs press against his.

But now there wasn't a hint of give to her body, it was like he was sitting against warm, curved granite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah quickly came out of the bedroom wearing short cotton shorts and one of his Star Wars t-shirts. Now it was visibly stretched and distorted by her upper body, pulled so tight against her shoulders and breasts that it barely remained modest where it ended, showing off a 6 pack that was like etched steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before, his girlfriend positioned herself on his lap. He could feel Hannah's perky breasts press against his chest and now unequivically could say they were bigger than before, bigger than Brittany's. He realized he'd wished that she outclass Brittany in every way and so she'd become taller and bustier than their neighbor. He could feel her firm behind, now even more magnificent than Brit's in all it's splendor, pressing against his penis. This time though, his penis wasn't getting any harder. Not because he wasn't turned on, quite the opposite. His boner had been growing since before she even finished her shower and he was staring lustfully at their scantily clad neighbor. It had long ago reached maximum size. This time he came in his pants as soon as his girlfriend pressed her butt against him. She immediately noticed this and flexed her glutes against him, causing him to shoot another load before he began to soften - though with both girls bodies pressing into him he wasn't going to remain soft for long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, He wasn't able to focus on the film</span></div></div>",

And what if that turned her on?&lt;/i&gt;<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those thoughts he pressed the button.

The shorts only covered her butt, though, leaving in full view the best pair of legs Jack had ever seen. He remembered them being well defined, but these were incredible, showing even more fitness and strength than he remembered.

Jack noticed his girlfriend seemed very excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every day babe.\", Brit responded before flexing her bicep, \"I just seem to keep getting bigger since I started really working out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gulped at the sight of Brit's arm showing a bicep that probably put his own arms to shame, and then his eyes widened as his girlfriend began caressing their friends bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's so hard.\", Hanna nearly moaned, trying to squeeze her sexy friends muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harder than you think.\", Brit replied, tensing her arm even more as her bicep pushed outward against Hanna's hand making the other girl purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scootch over,\" Brit said. \"None of your other chairs have a good angle on the tv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader didn't wait for him to move and started to squeeze in next to him.  Hanna started to approach the love seat and Jack figured she'd sit on his lap again. He was wrong though.

This position pulled her already tight tank top even tighter. In this position she wrapped her arm around him and flexed, causing him to feel her swelling bicep press against him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was now sporting quite a hard on, and this time he didn't have his girlfriends body to hide it from the sexy neighbor, but a glance at Brit told him she wouldn't have wanted him to hide it. She kept stealing glances at his crotch with a sly smile, and anytime it looked like his hard on was flagging she'd tense her muscles again, or pull Hanna nearly into a kiss and he'd be back to full mast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe device worked - Brit was getting off on how much she turned him and Hanna on - and she'd started working out to make herself even more their fantasy. Could it do more?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone seemed to be happy, Hanna didn't show any sign of jealousy and Brit was sexier than ever. Why not make this whole situation a little better still? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if she is even more of a natural gainer? Making even more progress even faster?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was just about to press the button with those thoughts in mind as he glanced over to Hanna and Brit, the 2 of them nearly meeting lips again. Jack imagined the 2 of them closing the final inches, their lips pressing onto each other, his thumb absentmindedly pressing the button, the blinding light appearing again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was back at his desk, blinking as his eyes readjusted to the light level. \"Damn, my thumb slipped... I hope imagining them kissing doesn't mean they're the couple now. I better check quickly.\" He got up and walked towards the living room as her heard the door creak open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jack.\" He heard Hannah shout from the other room. \"Brit picked me up from work and we wanted to do a movie night, you i- hnhhhm!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickened his pace and as he entered the living room his heart sunk a bit. There was Brit, holding Hanna in her arms and giving her a deep passionate kiss. He did mess something up with his stray thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 girls parted lips and Brit took her arms off Hanna. She started walking towards Jack and only now he noticed the actual changes he had wanted to achieve with the button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit looked stunning, her body brimming with strength and sex-appeal. While in the previous iteration she had looked like a top tier fitness model, she had definitely surpassed that stage this time. She still seemed to be wearing the same clothes as before, though they were a few numbers too small for her now. Her perky, sculpted rear barely fit into the tiny shorts, a considerable amount of cheek peeking out at the bottom and a small tear on either side of the shorts allowing her amazingly defined, thick legs to even fit in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tank top seemed to be straining and fighting from the smallest of movements, her breasts, even fuller and smoother than before, were spilling out at the top, and even a silver of the silky skin peeking out on the underside. Her abs looked like chiseled from stone, 6 perfect bumps covering her relatively thin waist, obliques lining them on either side like gemstones. Due to her new size and too small clothes, Jack could follow the course of her abs down and down and down, the button of her shorts even undone to allow her widened hips some space. Jack almost drooled as he saw those perfect abdominal muscles stretch down deep into her shorts. He was rock hard, despite the heart wrenching thought of having lost his girlfriend, his mind almost numb from all those feelings and sensations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped aside, assuming Hanna wanted to go to the kitchen to put the groceries away, still not able to take his eyes off of her. Though to his surprise she stepped directly up to him, putting one hand onto his growing tent and kissed him just as deeply as she did with Hanna, raising her heels a little to make up the few inches. Her perfect, diamond shaped calves flared out as she eagerly explored Jack's mouth, with him still trying to process what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a eternity for Jack, Hanna broke the kiss and smiled up at him. \"What's with the depressed look?\" She asked \"So jealous that Hanna got her kiss first? I would have done it on the here, but you guys don't want people to know you have a mistress.\" She giggled, though was interrupted as Hanna came from behind and gave her a little slap on the back of the head. \"Stop pretending like you're our mistress. If anything, we're Master and Mistress, you're the one that does all that hard work at the gym to please us\" Hanna smirked slyly and Brit stuck her tongue out while jokingly rubbing the slapped spot. \"You just wait until I can lift both of you with one arm!\" Both of them giggled and went to the kitchen to put away the groceries, Hanna giving jack a kiss as she walked by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stood there for a moment, blinking and processing what was happening. As it seems, he was having a triangle relationship with the woman he loved and his literal dream woman. The heaviness in his heart disappeared and was replaced with excitement, this was the best possible outcome his stray thought could have had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his hands, he was holding the Avengers Blu-ray, Brit must have given it to him while he was sunken in thought. He put it into the player and sat down on the love seat, the girls coming back from the kitchen soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said it before,\" Brit started again for the 3rd time in Jacks memory. \"But I'm glad Hannah asked me about the gym. It's funny that she assumed I got my body from working out when really it was all from cheerleading and fad diets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis had <i><b>still</b></i> all been from cheerleading?!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made good progress this past few weeks\" She, once again, demonstrated by lifting her arms and flexing. Jack just watched in awe as her biceps bunched up into balls of power the size of a softball. She was easily the size of a professional fbb, but still retained the curves off a fitness model. The tent in Jack's pants rose, starting to become uncomfortably hard as he just watched Brit show off her body. Hanna too wasn't going to let the show pass buy, eagerly rushing from the kitchen to their muscled lover and starting to feel those hard muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, every time you're at the gym you seem even bigger!\" Hanna swooned as she ran her fingers through the grooves and along the veins of Hanna's arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even bigger than you think\" Brit clenched her fist and pulled her forearm towards herself harder, the peaks of her biceps rising another half inch at least, and Jack could see Hanna's knees getting weak as she moaned, feeling the hard, perfect muscle rise even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrit let Hanna explore her pumped muscles a bit further, before grabbing her by the waist and pulling her over to Jack. Before he could react, Brit already planted her shapely rear onto his lap, pulling Hanna onto her lap herself. Jack groaned, all that muscle made Brit rather heavy, and she was pressing down onto his erect cock. Though, as Brit started to wiggle her hips around on his lap, one could assume she did that intentionally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of them could, or wanted to concentrate on the movie, Hanna was enjoying the embrace of those strong arms of Brit, running her hands up and down them, feeling their girth and hardness. And Brit enjoyed wiggling her hips and flexing her thighs, feeling Jack's raging boner press against her underside. Jack managed to get comfortable himself even, his tent settling between those muscled thighs, each flex making him groan in pleasure and lust. All 3 of them were starting to get heated, Hanna couldn't believe her and Jack's luck having found someone that was fulfilling their sexual fantasies. Brit just couldn't get enough from all the attention her body got from the two others, and Jack's thoughts were spinning with all the possibilities the button brought, of course, his literal wet dream sitting on his lap and teasing his cock wasn't helping either. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Finally, Jack closed his eyes, took a deep breath and composed himself, shaking his head as if to shake off the jitters that came with his sudden excitement. He was almost certainly getting ahead of himself. The feeling when he touched the button was something he couldn't quite describe, but c'mon - what it was supposed to be was something that was, like, godly levels of power. Why would something like that be given away in a pop-up ad of all things - and how? He couldn't help but smirk as he rolled his eyes - he was letting his imagination run away like always.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill... what was the harm in having a little fun? His gaze fell down to the button in his hand again, squeezing his palm around it a little tighter. It was surprisingly sturdy, and felt pretty durable. Not what he expected from a free thing like this. Jack sighed, turning it over in his hand a bit more. It was silly, sure, but what was the harm in indulging a little bit? Worst case scenario, he would just feel like a bit of a dummy and move on. But if it did somehow work...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned in a circle in his room, looking for something he could test this power out on. He didn't want to try anything too major yet, that seemed like he would be getting ahead of himself; something minor but unmistakable would work best for a test run. Finally, Jack's vision landed on a plain, plastic bottle of water sitting next to his computer, half-empty and probably rather warm at this point, having been sitting by his side the whole day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that bottle of water was... an unopened can of Red Bull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack clicked the button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was an instant flash that filled Jack's vision with pure white, causing him to cry out in surprise and stumble back a step, holding his hands up to shield his eyes. The flash didn't seem to have a source, though, and was over as soon as it began. The spots quickly faded from Jack's eyes, and after a quick rub to clear his vision Jack lowered his hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find that sitting on his desk was an unopened, glossy can of Red Bull energy drink, the bottle of water nowhere in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack's jaw dropped, but he couldn't find the words, not even a little gasp of surprise. Not even able to begin comprehending this, he took a few steps up to the desk, picking up the can and examining it. It was a Red Bull can alright, not only feeling filled to the brim but cold to the touch as well, like it had just been pulled out of the fridge. Jack quickly glanced around, but of course, he didn't see anyone. He even raced over to the front door to check it, but sure enough, it was locked as always. No one would have been able to get in and out quickly enough to make the swap, much less the many other things that made it impossible...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, Jack cracked the can open, the sound echoing throughout the lonely apartment. He brought it up to his lips and took a sip - yup, that was Red Bull alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack let out another exhale, heading back over to his computer and setting the can down, going back to his frantic pacing back and forth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way... no way... no WAY...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack muttered to himself... but by the end of it, he found himself smiling. He didn't know how it was possible, but by a miracle, it had worked. This thing really DID work like it said it would! At least, it seemed like it did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flood gates of his imagination opened once more, Jack spun around, trying to fix his gaze on something else he could exert this power over. Starting off simple was good, but now that he found out this button was actually all it claimed to be, he wanted to push it further, see what the extent of its abilities really was. In a few moments, he landed on his laundry basket, currently filled to the brim with all sorts of clothing, most of it his but some of it Hannah's too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish all of the laundry was done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack pushed the button again, but this time he was prepared, shutting his eyes right as the flash overtook everything. Thanks to this, he didn't feel the sting of blindness - in fact, there was no pain or discomfort at all. He opened his eyes as fast as he could, seeing if he could catch some magic in action; but to his amazement, in less than a second, the pile had completely disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack practically sprinted the few feet over to the laundry basket, confirming that there wasn't even a sock left behind. Then he ran over to his dresser, hands shaking as he pulled open one of the drawers, finding all of his shirts neatly folded up, even neater than he normally would! And he quickly confirmed that most of these were definitely ones he had wore recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Jack couldn't help but let out a laugh, stumbling backwards and putting his hands on his head in shock - only to be reminded of the little button still in his palm. He was practically jumping up and down at this point - nothing seemed out of his reach! All that was on his mind was going bigger, more extravagant...</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As his heart continued to race over the immeasurable potential the button in his hand had, he looked to what had got him the button in the first place, his computer.  Looking at it, he began to look at it and reminisce over all he's done with it...all as he realizes how long he's had it for.  The computer has been used for a few years at least, even before he met Hannah, and from a quick glance, it showed.  The keys seemed overused at this point, some letters being faded while other keys were a bit stiff to press, and would need more than a simple tap to make them work.  Not only that, but using the computer for too long would cause the internal fan to roar loudly, and it was quite the mood killer whenever he was exploring forums with his girlfriend, or even on his own.  But despite that, he still had some sentimental attachment to it, since if it wasn't for that computer, he would have never met Hannah, after all.  He looked to the button, and back to the computer, and decided he needed to make some changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my computer worked as well as it did when I bought it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with another click of the button, followed by the blinding flash of light, he looks to his computer and stares in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe puts the button down and looks over his computer in joy.  His keys all looked brand new, with no issues occurring whenever he tapped them.  All the letters and numbers worked, and as he explores all the fixes, he also notices some files on his desktop.  He opens them up, and lo and behold, all of the files he opened up were the exact files on the computer prior to the button press, from his assignments for class to some of the buff women images he downloaded for 'safe keeping'.  He was ecstatic over how well the computer was touched up, and begins to grin to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, works like a charm! And not a single loss of data on it!  Now, what to do next...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around the room, and looks to the bed he and Hannah shared.  It was a nice bed, sure, but sometimes it could seem a bit too small, or a tad too stiff. He didn't even need to think before he picked up the button, and made another request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish me and Hannah had a queen...no, King Sized Bed instead of this one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button is pushed once more, and with another flash, he takes a look at the bed, and happily jumps into it.  The bed is much larger, and the mattress he lays on feels perfect, with just enough softness to rest in, but just enough firmness to hold someone's weight.  He sighs in bliss as he rests on the bed for a little while, before slowly getting up, looking around the apartment, and realizing how out of place the new bed seems.  He chuckles to himself as he simply grabs the button, and makes another wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish my apartment matched the quality of this bed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother click, another flash, and Jack smiles to himself at how the apartment has changed.  The walls were repainted brighter shades of colour, making a more vibrate environment, while the room itself seems to have grown in size.  The floor is cleaned up, and as Jack explores the apartment, he discovers more than just changes to the apartment.  Checking the bathroom, not only is the toilet clean and upgraded, with the shower being expanded to a bathtub of sorts, but even the toiletries are all changed, seemingly for the better with higher quality products everywhere, from softer, thicker toilet paper to better soap.  Exploring more, the clothing he and Hannah owned within the expanded closet are all changed as well, some looking newer than usual, others changing logo and brand to better suit their tastes, with Jack's She-Hulk shirt showing a more dominant and buff She-Hulk posing on the front, causing him to redden a bit upon seeing it.  More exploring reveals similar results; the fridge is restocked with some enjoyable sweets and meals, the laundry machines are top of the line, so on and so forth.  His apartment has gone from average at worst, to high class and over-the-top.  It looked beyond his budget, but with this button in his hand, he couldn't care less.  All he could do now was sit back in his chair, relax, and think of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Jack and Hannah are two budding 18 year old lovers attending college together and living in the same apartment. Together they share a common trait - both are muscle growth fanatics, with the bigger the better being their philosophy. While neither of them are at all fit, they still spend their time going through the Internet looking at art, morphs, and stories about insanely muscular guys and girls. But all that stuff's just a fantasy, right? No one could REALLY get that big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, you'd THINK that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couples' views on everything completely changes when a button arrives at their door that claims it can literally change any aspect of reality they wish, just with a thought! Jack and Hannah must then decide how best to use the button, hoping to achieve their wildest dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, here's some facts about our leads:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 5' 11\"<br>\r\nWeight: 150 lbs.<br>\r\nBuild: Skinny<br>\r\nHair Color: Brown<br>\r\nHair Length: Short<br>\r\nEye Color: Brown<br>\r\nAccessories: Glasses<br>\r\nHobbies: Muscle art, muscle fiction, general nerdy activities (comics, movies, TV, conventions, etc.)<br>\r\nSchool: Northern State University (NSU)<br>\r\nRomantic Partner: Hannah<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah<br>\r\nAge: 18<br>\r\nHeight: 5' 6\"<br>\r\nWeight: 125<br>\r\nBuild: Slender<br>\r\nHair Color: Black<br>\r\nHair Length: Long<br>\r\nEye Color: Green<br>\r\nAccessories: None<br>\r\nHobbies: See Jack<br>\r\nSchool: Northern State University (NSU)<br>\r\nRomantic Partner: Jack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf there's any other info you think should be on here, just contact me and I'll try to get it up. Now, onto the rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- This is a muscle growth-based story, meaning fetishes of other kinds (macro, micro, weight gain, etc.) are most likely not allowed. Fetishes that usually go along with muscle growth (breast growth, penis growth, etc.) are allowed as long as they coincide with the muscle growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- That being said, due to the nature of the button, other changes may be made to the universe as long as muscle growth is still the main focus of the story. This means you can make them richer, make everyone accept their new growth, whatever you can think of. Creativity is very much welcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Other characters may be grown, but Jack and Hannah must remain part of the story, as they are the main characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Each chapter added MUST be of noticeable length, as determined by me, the story's original creator. I reserve the right to remove any chapter that I feel is not of considerable content. Don't let this rule make you sweat too much, though - I'm pretty lenient and have never had to make use of this rule. Just write at least a good paragraph or two and you're good - though remember that longer is better ;)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that's all the rules I have for now, but I may update this section should I think of anymore, so try and check back just to make sure you aren't accidentally breaking anything new. Besides that, though, have fun writing!</td>",
