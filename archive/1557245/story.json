Upon arrival, you are ushered inside and seated infront of the council. \"There are reports of a demon in a school on Sol-3, and we need you to go and capture the demon. This demon belongs to the inner levels of hell and it is using the human females as vessels for some hybrid demons. This needs to be handled discreetly... do you understand?\" Rising from your seat you bow to the councilors and accept. \"Good... now go to the armory and choose your weapons and armor. You'll need them.\" You bow your self out and walk to the armory. Your story begins now but...

Eventually you finish getting your armor on and pushing a pair of blood red shades on your face. You unfold your wings and take off just circling the sky when a message strikes your brain the same way the first did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.. Angela... Angela... Council says to reinstate your essence.. It might be fun just to mess up some thoughts on this trip.\" You suck your teeth and block out the message. You blink a few times as you begin riding the flow of natural essence.  It's a extremely arousing feeling becoming one with the entire angel population. All their thoughts and feelings merge with yours for a brief moment as you become pure light and vanish from Elysium. A sharp feeling of pain passes through your body as you reform on a completely different world. You look around and notice the subtle differences between Sol-3 and Elysium. You think of just forgetting the job and living your life on earth as you catch a putrid stench. You keel over as the smell ravages your nostrils. Following the horrible aroma you eventually come across a High School. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step up to the school and look around. There is no one in the yard so it has to be after 12 noon. Hopping over the school gate you look around and pull in your wings. Looking around you tap a button on your shades and see a projection of what you look like at the moment. \"Hmm.. passable.\" You look like a young teen. Long Red flowing hair, Black Rimmed glasses on. A black skirt, with red roses on it and a white button down with bleach white rosettes around the collar. You could actually pass for a human, in this state. Pressing a second button on your shades you feel a backpack appear on your back. Stepping towards the school again you are struck with a hard blow to the head. A massive wave of essence, more powerful than your own, is assaulting and smothering your entire body. You try to fight it but it's overpowering you. You can feel it force it's way down your throat as your breathing becomes short and raspy. You fall to your knees as a dark vision fills your mind. Falling backwards you black out dropping your bag and your shades to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next?</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes, burning from the sunlight. A middle-aged woman is hovering over you with a stethoscope. \"Miss? Miss, can you hear me?\" She crouched over you and shined a tiny light into your eyes, peeling your eyelid. You blink and say \"Yes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries to help to your feet. But, you stumble with the first few steps. \"C'mon now, We need to get you to a bed.\" Your body feels very drowsy and head begins to bob. \"Just a little farther\" the nurse encourages. At last, she sets you down onto a flat cushioned surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell me what happened? Let's see...Angela, is it? Please dear, lie down. Now, tell me.\" \"I don't know what happened...I remember arriving at the school. I went through the gate...There was anyone around...and then.\" A shriek rang through your head. Your head began to ache and throb. \"Then what?\" the nurse asks. \"Then...I woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nurse turned around toward her desk. \"I think you should stay here for awhile. Maybe you should go home for the day. I'll call her parents\" the nurse states. You sit up. \"No! Don't call my parents. I'm fine. I can go to class.\" The nurse puts down the phone and says \"Ok. You're fine. Go to class now.\" You stare at her mystified. You grab your backpack and leave the nurse's office.</span></div></div>",

A couple boys... maybe even a couple girls... Only the Metatron can tell.\" When you finished suiting up you walked out of the armory with a wide smile on your face before you were stopped by a soft voice. \"Hey.. Nyx.\" As you turn around you see your Older Sister, Persephone, carrying a necklace. \"Nyx... Council says to reinstate your essence.. stealth is a key factor this trip.\" You're smile grew as did your plans. Taking the jet black necklace and putting it around your neck, you feel your essence flow through your veins. Nodding to your sister you unfold your wings and take off. Before long you click the center piece on your armor. As you do your body becomes pure light and vanishes. When you reform you are back on Sol-3 and ready to party. Hiding your wings, you walk out trying to hone in on the demon's scent. Following the horrible aroma you eventually come across a High School. \"Jackpot... Hormonally charged Teenagers... I'm blessed.\" Stepping towards the school, you suddenly feel something. A massive wave of essence, more powerful than your own and its smothering you! You try to fight it, but its inevitable.

What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were found out in the parking lot unconscious. We brought you in to keep an eye on you.\" You start to look around for the source of the voice when she came into view. She wore a thin white coat over slim shoulders and a casual blouse. Your eyes were drawn to hers, noticing how kind they looked and how at ease they made you.\"So, since we found you unconscious, we have to check for a concussion. Here, follow my finger,\" she said holding one up. She moved it up and down, left and right, and closer then further away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good news, no concussion,\" she sat back in her rolling chair,\"you have very pretty eyes. They almost seemed to change colors. Now, what is your name, honey?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm not sure.\"  Your voice comes out in a nice medium tone. \" Your parents having trouble, huh? That's alright, I just wanted your first name. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know that either. I don't even know how many names I've had. I can't remember anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now. There must be something? How did you get to the school?\" You try to dig deep for anything about yourself, \"I had something very important to do. But I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, hun. Well, you had this pack with you when we found you and the notebook has Nyx on the front. Does that sound like your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... maybe it's a nickname. Nyx...Nyx... Something like it though. Onyx? Alex? Yeah...that sounds right, Alex.\" You smile slightly, thankful that you have some piece of yourself back. You feel a warmth in your chest and hear a high pitched ringing in your ears. The nurse asked you to stay there while she went to ask the secretary about any new students named Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was gone you went over to the small bathroom to look in the mirror. Looking back at you was a face that seemed wrong, it had no distinguishing features to tell if you were male or female. It was a perfect medium. All except for the eyes, they were soft and kind like the nurse's. You liked that you had the same kind eyes. Greenish blue with a hint of violet on the edges. Looking farther down, you saw a jet black gem, fastened in a wire clasp with a silver necklace running off each side and up around your neck. It felt like it was a part of you, like it meant something to you specifically.  You reach up to touch it when you heard the nurse come back. As you turn, you catch something out of the corner of your eye. A shadow of something on your back. You look again but it's gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, it turns out that your name is Alex Angelou and you just transferred from a Church school to here. Your father is away most of the time and you live with your uncle. Is any of this ringing a bell?\" You feel that you have got to move on, so you lie, \"yeah, it is. I was...skipping the rest of the day when someone attacked ear I didn't see their face, but they hit me over the head.\" You reach up to touch one of your temples and winced when you brushed the skin. A large tender bump the size of a half dollar, sat just above your right ear. \"Here, let me look at that.\" The woman with the kind eyes took your chin in her hand,\" It doesn't seem too bad. I think you'll be fine. Stop by the front desk and pick up up your new schedule.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou agreed and left with your backpack. Your schedule had 5 classes on it and today was half over. Your next class was________</span></div></div>",

Surprisingly quickly, the hallway was flooded with teenagers going in every direction. You tried to ask where the gym was but nobody seemed to notice you. They all just past you without a second glance, all except for one guy. He was standing near his locker putting some books away while watching you try to ask for help. When he finished, he walked over asking, \"Hey, there. You need some help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you handed him your schedule. While he looked it over, you look him over. He was about an inch taller than you with shaggy brown hair haphazardly combed back. He was wearing a thin zip up hoodie and faded jeans with grubby sneakers. \"So it looks like you have gym next\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I figured that out, but I don't know where it is. \" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well it's just this way. I'll take you there.\" He motioned down a side hall.  You hiked up your backpack strap and hurried to follow. He led you passed the cafeteria and the band room. \"Here is the gym.

You knock on the door to get their attention, \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Alex. I was told to come here for a lock.\" They checked a clipboard and found a lock for you.

You've been laying down there... for... a long time... school's over now...\" She said a bit rapid-fire. Noir had short grey hair, dark skin and candy green eyes. She was about 5 foot 7 a bit tall for a girl her stature. She was wearing the school's traditional Monochromatic Sailor Fuku, type uniform. She had about...
