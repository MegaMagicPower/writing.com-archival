After each successful contract they will return to their home base and prepare for their next mission. Most of the money they earn goes straight into the vault but some can be used for recreational purposes. How much is saved and how much is spent is entirely up to the reader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a character has saved up enough money by doing missions the reader can then initiate the final phase of the story where they settle things with the people they owe money to. They can pay back the money and be on their way, double cross their boss and try run with the money or something else entirely. This is your story, only you can choose how it ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo select a character merely click on their name at the bottom of the page to read their profile. If you find someone you like you may then select a contract for them to begin. After that everything is entirely up to you. Listed below are some of the universal contacts all the mercenaries have access to as well as additional allies, enemies and other characters. Good luck!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImportant Characters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Patriot: A mysterious figure who can be contacted through a special website on the deep web. They represent the government you owe money to and are very eager to collect. If not kept in the loop on your progress and status they may send trouble your way but can also be a valuable ally if you need special government assistance on something. Of course, asking them for help will just add more to your debt...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Black: A world renowned arms dealer who has several dictators and politicians on his payroll. He is a friendly and jolly guy normally, but can be dangerous when angered. He can deliver and ship guns, ammo and other equipment all over the world quick and efficiently... for a price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy: A playful FBI agent and hacker who spends most of her free time playing MMOs and reading graphic novels. She helps keep your mercenary network safe and secure and protects it from going offline. She also helps set you up with contracts from members of the US government.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Ling: A wealthy woman who controls a large part of the criminal underground in China. She will buy and sell stolen and illegal items from anywhere at anytime no questions asked. She also offers plenty of black market goods that can't be bought anywhere else and even provides contracts from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Barlov: A mysterious Russian man with criminal connections all over the world. From the yakuza to the mafia he provides contracts to mercenaries all over the world and sets up meetings with all the right people to know in this line of work. He also has a side business of providing secretive transport and forged documents to help his contacts travel anywhere they need to be without worrying about border patrols or homeland security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSue: A young woman from Australia who is currently living somewhere in South America. She provides reliable vehicle shipment and repair work at cheap prices along with an assortment of mods both legal and illegal. She also sells weapon mods and can install guns, traps or other useful gadgets on whatever type of vehicle you might need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmith: A man who worked for years in criminal science and police work. He can remove evidence, provide cleaners to dispose of bodies, mislead the police... whatever you might need to get away with your illegal activities. He can even provide getaway drivers and distractions to help keep law enforcement off your back. He isn't a miracle worker though, and can't do much to protect you from serious crimes like political assassination or terrorism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Weston: Lucy's loyal butler who is in charge of maintaining her base of operations while she is away. In addition to being skilled in various domestic areas such as cleaning, sewing, cooking and even gardening he is also highly trained in hand to hand combat and long distance marksmanship. He rarely gets his hands dirty, but many have made the fatal mistake of underestimating him as a harmless old man. He's rarely off the clock, but his two favorite hobbies are knitting and listening to classical music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu: Micheal's boss and the leader of the SGY. Not much is known about him other than the fact that he has a reputation as a fair and honorable man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisuke: Micheal's main rival. Dai has been with the SGY for years before Micheal had even showed up and treats him with little respect despite the fact that they both share the same rank. Rude and arrogant he is fairly unpopular even among his henchmen and has few friends, preferring to use scare tactics and intimidation to get what he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai: One of Micheal's yakuza buddies who often accompanies him when he hits the town. Sai is a bit mischievous and sneaky, but has proven his loyalty multiple times while working with Micheal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkira: A tall fat yakuza man with a stern and focused disposition. He is good friends with Micheal and Sai, but prefers to avoid partying and drinking as he see those activities as frivolous vices. Instead he focuses his time into helping his boss and making sure the SGY are staying productive and expanding their reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMari: A young woman who Desmond developed a bit of a crush on when he met her in an online game a few years back. She provides him intel and occasionally sends him tech that she thinks he might have an interest in. Despite being pretty good friends neither she or Desmond have actually meet the other in real life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFactions<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRed Torch Mercenaries: The mercenary company you used to belong to before taking a government loan and setting out on your own. They have a high standard of morals as well as a strong reputation for getting the job done. If you have some spare cash they can be called in to help you on missions. They can also provide intel and a safe place to rest if you need it. Their bases can be found in nearly every major country. They have no official dress code but most of their members dress in red uniforms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreen Leaf Mercenaries: A splinter faction that broke off from the Red Torch Mercenaries. They care less about collateral damage and discipline and only seem to be concerned about getting paid. They still have standards and will avoid taking unnecessary risks or causing avoidable damage, though they don't mind if things get messy. Many of them have a strong rivalry with Red Torch but will still work with them if they need to as long as they get compensated for their time. They have a strong army motif and many of their members dress like traditional soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreed Demon Mercenaries: A small but very well equipped mercenary company that works with several world governments off the books. They have no morals and will do anything they are asked to as long as the cash is good. They have strong levels of discipline and punish failure harshly. They tend to have the most cutting edge gear and are infamous for committing atrocities and war crimes. While they mostly work with powerful countries during wars and rebellions they have no loyalty to any particular group and will gladly betray even their own employers for the right price. They are easily identified by their black and silver body armor and typically appear in three or six man groups on smaller jobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlobal Police: The global police are a group of highly skilled soldiers and law enforcers from around the world. The group was created by the G.P.I. (Global Peace Initiative) to combat terrorism, corrupt dictators and all forms of international crime. They are extremely elite and the best at what they do. Their members are mostly comprised of former Army Rangers, FBI/CIA/KGB agents, Marines, SWAT commanders, reformed hackers and just about any and every other kind of badass you can think of. They tend to carry heavy weapons and armor and dress primarily in blue and gold uniforms. Specialist agents, such as combat engineers and explosives experts tend to wear white and gold instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura Garden Yakuza: The yakuza group Micheal is currently working for. They own much of the criminal empire in and around Tokyo but still have a ways to go before they can compete with the bigger groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gun Club: A large network of elite soldiers who have retired from the army but not their work. The Gun Club is a freelance group of weapon enthusiasts who specialize in dealing with official army weapons, vehicles and gadgets. Due to the nature of their organization they often work outside the law, but try to avoid committing crimes whenever possible. Their main goal is to uphold the peace, keep america safe and provide support to veterans and wounded soldiers who desperately need it. Jeff Boone is a close associate of theirs and is on a first name basis with about half of their members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdditional Resources<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_firearms\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fi...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vehicles_of_the_United_States_Marine_Corps\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ve...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_action_films\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_a...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_criminal_enterprises,_gangs_and_syndicates\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cr...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.imfdb.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></span></div></div>",

He tries to stay in shape and typically dresses the part of a soldier when not relaxing at home. He is very fond of his fatigues and beret, but knows when to swap them out during the tough jobs in exchange for body armor and a helmet. He is often clean shaven but is fond of growing a small mustache or even full beard from time to time. He has amber eyes that he tends to hide behind sunglases or goggles when on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: L.A. Apartment. This luxury apartment is big and spacious but also discreet and with a lot of security patrolling 24/7. It comes stocked with a full kitchen, living room, bed room, bathroom and even an outdoor balcony. Despite it being high class it has very little furniture and decorations as Jeff lives alone and mostly just uses it as a giant storage closet and trophy room. Aside from a few tables, chairs and a mini-bar the living room is stacked with boxes and a large wall safe locked by a security pass code. One of the few luxuries Jeff allows himself is a small game corner complete with a pool table, pinball machine and a fancy poker set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Jeff has served in the army for over 20 years and has retained many close friends in very high positions throughout the years. This allows him to call in emergency aid or support whenever he needs it and provides him with access to military grade equipment that other people struggle to obtain. His combat training makes him deadly both in close range and at a distance and gives him the skills to use any type of weapon effectively. He also has the knowledge required to pilot helicopters, tanks and other types of military vehicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: His age has slightly dulled his senses and agility, which means he tends to react a little slower and tire out a little quicker than the other mercenaries. He also has a bit of a drinking problem and isn't at his best unless he has a little alcohol in his system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: Several military firearms such as assault rifles and automatic shotguns as well as a few pistols. A crate of ammo for each of his guns. Military grade body armor. An RPG with a dozen rounds. A private helicopter docked at a nearby airfield that is equipped with both turret and missile defenses. A jeep in his garage stocked with supplies such as MREs, canteens and an extra tank of fuel. A two way field radio to keep in contact with fire support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMissing In Action - An old army buddy of Jeff's has recently disappeared from his home town in New Mexico without a trace. The man's wife and sons think a local biker gang may be behind it but are not sure. To complete this mission Jeff will need to head to his buddies house to gather clues and intel and hopefully find his friend. This contract poses unknown risks and unknown rewards. Pay: $1,000,000- $25,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wall - A mexican drug cartel has recently run into trouble with border security and needs help transporting their crew across the border. In addition to drugs and guns the cartel has several customers that have paid for transport and need to get them safely to their destination. The main priority is the safety of the customers, but the cartel will pay extra for any guns and drugs that survive the trip. In addition to border security and the DEA Jeff may need to contend with local police or even rival cartels seeking to undermine their rivals. The job has a lot of risks, but high rewards for a job well done. Pay: $50,000,000 - $125,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCar Collection - A big shipment of imported luxury cars has arrived at a large dealership in downtown L.A. and several have caught Mr. Barlov's eye. If Jeff can gather a crew to boost some of the rides he can expect a large payday. This job poses moderate risks and rewards depending on the number and state of the cars delivered. Going alone reduces the risks, but getting all of the cars will require a team. Pay: $1,000,000 - $20,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHellfire And Ash - A mafia group in New York city have recently acquired a large supply of experimental incendiary ammunition and are terrorizing the criminal underground with it. Desperate times call for desperate measures so several big criminal groups have pulled together a bounty for anyone who can stop them and put an end to their reign for good. This job will be extremely dangerous and will require careful planning and tactics. Brute force may work, but opens lots of potential for retaliation by the mob's enforcers. To complete the job all of the experimental ammo must be taken or destroyed without the mafia being able to trace who is responsible. Major risks and rewards for this one, maybe even a new way to start up a BBQ. Pay: $10,000,000 - $50,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIce Storm - A large blizzard has hit a crew of drug runners up near the canadian border, grounding their escape chopper and forcing them to flee from the police. Luckily, they were able to reach an isolated ski resort in the mountains and are currently engaged in a standoff with the cops that has lasted several hours. To complete this contract Jeff needs to secure as much of their coke as possible and make sure that the drug runners escape the police. Things will almost certainly get messy so plan ahead and be careful how you go about this. Pay: $100,000,000 - $125,000,000</span></div></div>",

It was a nice enough place for a pitstop along the highway, it had a large general store, a bowling alley and, most importantly, a local watering hole called Vulture's Rest. You blow a ring of smoke as you point your driver down a road leading to a long row of houses with wooden fences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a good neighborhood, kids were playing in yards as the sun began setting on the western horizon and some of the adults were enjoying beers and cook outs, but looks could be deceiving... as you had learned during your long tour of military service. \"Up here, pull up to the driveway with the blue pickup out front.\" you say as a familiar house came into view. Your driver nodded wordlessly and pulled over to the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some gas and pick up a snack if you want, I'll probably be done in an hour or so. Be back in 45 minutes or less, alright?\" you request as you open the door and began walking up the driveway. \"Will do, Jeff. I'll see you in 40, man.\" the driver called back as he pulled out and disappeared around the corner. You stub out your cigar and put it away to finish later before removing your sunglasses and ringing the doorbell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarely a few seconds passed before a mousy young woman with long blonde hair and a floral print skirt stepped out to greet you. \"Oh Jeff, thank god you're here. I think something terrible has happened.\" she said in a shaky voice, clearly on the verge of a breakdown. You merely nodded and asked to come in. \"Of course, please have a seat in the living room.\" she replied with an attempted smile as she opened the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Sera. I'll do what I can to find Hank, our squad owes him that much for all he's done for us. I've already radioed the boys, they'll all be here by tomorrow.\" you promise as you take a seat on a leather couch next to a beautiful aquarium. After sending her two young sons into their room to play Sera joined you on the opposite side of the tiny coffee table. \"Would you like a beer Jeff? I think my husband got a fresh six pack before he went missing last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you, Sera.\" you reply quickly, noticing the struggle it took to mention her husband. \"I'd prefer to be sober for this. Now before I can get started I need to ask you some questions, alright?\" Sera merely nodded her head as she grabbed a tissue off of the arm of the chair she was sitting in and blew her nose. \"Of course, ask away. I'll do whatever I can to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought for a moment and then began your investigation with the first question.</span></div></div>",

He had just got back from his job and left to pick up a friend of his for a night of drinking and partying. They were going to watch a movie at the new theater about 20 miles up the road after getting a few drinks at Vultures's Rest. I expected him to be gone for most of the night, but when he didn't come back the day after I started to worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown as you memorized the addresses and directions Sera gave you. \"Not much to go on, but I can work with this.\" you note as you withdraw a tiny notebook from your pocket and write a few things down. \"Can you give me any details that people might recognize? His license plate number, their clothes, the model of vehicle they were driving, things like that?\" Sera thought for a few seconds as she desperately tried to remember everything she could. \"I don't remember much, but I do recall a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both of them were clean shaven and were wearing jackets. Hank had his black cowboy hat on, the one with the tiny tear near the back. I didn't see what they left in, but I think Robert was driving his sportscar, the new blue one he got a few months back. I don't know the model or license plate, but it has these bright green flames painted on both sides. It should be easy to identify.\" she continued as you took more notes. The picture was starting to come together a little now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, this really helps, can you tell me what time they left? Try to be as exact as possible.\" you ask as you write down some addresses of local car mechanics and auto shops in the area you had looked up before arriving. \"I've got a pretty good idea of how we can identify where they went, I just need a good time frame and I can get started.\" Sera rubbed her head as she tried desperately to recall when she last saw her husbands smiling face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was fairly late, probably before nine but after seven. I was in the middle of watching a show, so it was likely about seven or eight thirty. Oh god, I wish I could remember more... I should be able to remember more.\" she said as a few fresh tears formed in her eyes. You took a moment to calm her down and finished writing the last few clues she could give you. After looking over your notes to make sure everything was right you asked Sera to double check everything she had given you. It was all accurate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think I can get the ball rolling now. Thank you Sera, I'll do everything I can to find Hank.\" you say with a smile as you pocket the notebook and stand up. \"Now that that's done I'll have a beer or two if you don't mind. You might want to have one yourself. It'll help with the stress a bit.\" She nodded and headed over to the kitchen to grab the drinks from the fridge while you checked in with your driver. After about twenty minutes of talking a jeep pulled up in the driveway outside and honked its horn once to signify its arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my ride, I'll see you when I have an update. Take care of yourself Sera.\" you say as you crush your empty beer can and toss it into the nearby trashcan. \"Thank you Jeff, be careful out there.\" Sera called from the kitchen as you stepped outside into the cool evening air and waved goodbye from the door way. In less than five minutes you'd be back on the road heading to your first stop...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Let's watch ourselves once we get inside.\" You nodded and lit your cigar back up. \"Shithole or not, someone there probably saw something. Plus I can grab a drink while we're there, I could use a nice Old Fashioned or Tequila Sunrise right about now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour driver pulled into the parking lot of a crowded two-story building just off the freeway.

I've only got about fifty bucks left, that damn gas was about five bucks a gallon.\" You laugh and pull a few hundred dollar bills out of your pocket. \"Yeah, yeah. I still owe you for that bet you won about the IED anyway, two hundred I believe?\" you reply as you hand him the cash. He grins as he remembers how he almost got his arm blown off. \"Oh yeah, wasn't that bet five hundred though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh as you finish off your cigar and toss the stub into a nearby trashcan. \"Don't push your luck... and don't forget why we're here.

There were about a dozen wooden tables in front of a large counter lined with various white collar workers waiting on drinks after a long day. Off to your left was a side room stocked with a couple pool tables, a jukebox and dart boards. To the right was a small dining area where a few folks were enjoying meals before heading to their night shifts or a long drive home. It was pleasant, but made you feel a bit uneasy. There were definitely a few shady things that went on here each night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stick close, let me do most of the talking.\" you whisper to your partner as you walk past the tables up to the bar. \"Gotcha, I'll follow your lead.\" Hal whispers back as you grab two empty seats at the end of the counter near a man who was either passed out drunk or trying to catch up on a few hours of missed sleep. A few slow minutes passed as the bartender served a few beers to the other patrons before noticing the two of you sitting alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening boys.\" she says in a sultry voice as she walks over. \"What can I get y'all this evening?\" She seemed nice enough but you figured it was best to be careful with your words. If she had any information on Hank she might not be willing to give it up so easily. \"I'll take a Tequila Sunrise.\" you reply as you place a few bills on the table. \"Just a cold coke for me, I'm the driver.\" Hal quickly added. The bartender smiled and walked off to get your orders as you and Hal discussed what your next move should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think she knows anything about Hank?\" you ask in a hushed tone.

I heard from one of the guys at the gas station that she works the late shift here each night, if anyone here saw something it'd have to be her.\" You frown as you rub your chin. \"I think your right, this place made my skin crawl ever since we walked in. Something isn't right here... that's for damn sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue talking as the bartender delivers your drinks and gives you another warm smile. \"Anything else y'all need you just let me know, okay?\" You are about to speak up when a drunken man near one of the pool tables gets into an argument with a biker and throws one of the pool cues at him. The biker then retaliates by kicking him to the ground as his buddies egg him on. \"Oh shit, not again...\" the bartender mutters under her breath as she heads over to break up the fight. \"That's enough of that! Hey, I said stop it you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHal takes a sip out of his coke and gestures over to the back shelf of the bar with his eyes. You take a moment to look over and notice an unattended record book the bartender must have forgotten to put away. With everyone distracted with the fight you could easily swipe it and maybe find a record of your friend's visit... or get thrown out on your ass if the bartender catches you reading it. You take a quick sip out of your drink and decide to...</span></div></div>",

You take a long sip of your drink as the bartender slaps one of the men across the face then throws both men out with the help of a burly man you took to be a security guard of some type. After a few seconds of tense silence everyone moved back to their own drinks and food like nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you feel things have calmed down enough you gesture for the bartender to come over to your table again. \"Sorry about that folks, we get trouble occasionally from a local biker gang. I swear, those assholes think they own this town sometimes. Anyway, what can I get y'all now?\" she asks sweetly as you finish off the last of your drink. \"I think I'll just have one more Tequila Sunrise and call it a night. Say, what time do you get off work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not til' tomorrow morning, I work the night shift after all.\" she replies in a flirty tone. \"Why? You asking me out on a date, handsome?\" You laugh as you pull out a few hundred dollar bills and give them to her as a tip. \"Not quite, ma'am. Me and my buddy are just in town seeing a friend and we could a tour guide is all... who better than a local? Especially one that's so easy on the eyes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender chuckles softly as she puts her hands on her hips. \"You willing to wait another several hours for my shift to end or were you asking me to head out with you now?\" You shrug your shoulders as Hal gives her a smile while sipping on his coke. \"We just got back from deployment, I think we can wait for you for a couple more hours.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender smiles as she looks you both over. Hal wasn't much of a looker, but you were still in pretty good shape for someone rapidly approaching old age. \"A couple of soldiers, huh? Alright, I guess I can take a night off. Let me just go tell the boss to ring up my replacement and I'll be right back with your drink.\" With that she disappears behind the counter and heads into a back room to talk with her boss. After about five minutes she was walking over to your table with your Tequila Sunrise, now dressed in jeans and a t-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to head out when you two are, I know a few great places to party in this little one horse town of ours.\" she replies as she leans in to give you a kiss on the cheek. \"We can leave here in a few just as soon as me and my buddy Hal finish our drinks, I'm Jeff by the way. Nice to meet you.\" you say with another smile. The bartender giggles. \"I'm Cynthia, good to meet ya Jeff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chat her up for a few minutes as Hal tells a few dirty jokes before the three of you head back out to the parking lot. You follow Cynthia back to her car as Hal heads over to get the jeep. The plan for tonight was to head back to Cynthia's place for a few minutes while she changed clothes and then decide where to go from there. Unbeknownst to her, you had more on your mind than just a night of partying and fun however. She definitely knew something, you just needed to get her to talk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a short drive you pull into the long driveway of a modest two story house about a mile out of town and step out into the cool night air once again. Hal was coming up the driveway behind you as you walked Cynthia over to the door and went inside. \"Head into the kitchen and help yourself to anything you want inside the fridge, I'll be back down in a minute.\" she whispers in your ear as she begins heading up the stairs. Hal walks through the door just as she disappears upstairs. Time to make your move.</span></div></div>",

The room was pretty small but quite comfy with a sort of rustic charm to it. Behind Hal was a large bookshelf stacked with everything from cooking and gardening books to old family photos and a few small potted plants. Aside from a small lamp the only light came from a full moon bleeding through the curtains covering a large window on the far wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a pretty nice house for a waitress.\" Hal wonders aloud as he stares out the window at the lonely stretch of darkened terrain surrounding the house. \"Maybe this house has been in the family a while.\" he adds as he looks over at a tiny coffee table next to the window that had a big group photo of a large family on it. \"Could be.\" you reply as you grab a hunting magazine from the end table next to the sofa and give it a quick skim. \"Just keep your guard up and remember why we're here. Let me do the talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about five minutes of quiet silence Cynthia walks back down the stairs carrying a small briefcase and wearing nothing but a bathrobe. \"Hey there, gentlemen.\" she cooed softly. \"Sorry to keep y'all waiting but I decided to freshen up a bit and have a shower.\" You give her a quick look over to make sure she isn't hiding any concealed weapons as she took a seat in the remaining chair and opened the brief case on the small coffee table in front of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was a wide assortment of strange and colorful substances in bottles, bags and vials of all shapes and sizes. You could easily make out what looked like some common street drugs like cocaine and marijuana, but most of it wasn't immediately identifiable. \"Normally, I only accept appointments on the deals I make but since you two party animals just rolled into town I'll go ahead and lay it all out on the table for ya.\" she says with a mischievous grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou aren't sure quite how it happened but your new girlfriend here apparently mistook you and Hal for a couple of druggies looking for something to take the edge off. It made sense, of course, there probably wasn't much else to do in this one horse town beyond getting high, though her boldness was definitely a surprise. Hal shoots you a quick \"What do you wanna do?\" look while Cynthia has her back turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boys, what'll you be having this evening? I can offer ya a discount on half this shit, just let me know what you're in the mood for.\" Cynthia offers as she begins removing a few of her top sellers out of the case and begins placing them on the table. You give her a fake interested smile as you think over your options.</span></div></div>",

Otherwise I'm afraid y'all will have to make do with what I got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a perverted grin as you pretend to look over the drugs she had scattered over the table. \"Let's see now, I've had LSD, ecstasy, opium... hell, even a little crystal meth... but I don't even recognize half this stuff you got on the table, Mind filling in a few blanks for us so we can get to know the product a little better?\" you inquire with the same politely curious tone as before. She seems to be buying your act hook, line and sinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a real party animal, huh darling?\" she replies with a laugh. \"Let's see, I've got uppers, downers, stimulants of all kinds, performance enhancers, pain meds, relaxants, sedatives, hallucinogenics... just about anything you need. If you've got the cash I've also got a few samples of some high quality designer chemicals that might be what you're looking for. What's your current price range?\"   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a minute as you pretend to think. \"Uh, lets see here. Well, to be perfectly honest money isn't an issue... we just thought we'd grab something for our buddy from the service. He likes all kinds of shit but he's got a few very specific tastes. Come to think of it we expected to meet up with him in town but haven't been able to get in touch with him yet. Maybe you can help us, a local said they saw him visit your bar a few nights back...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCynthia frowns a bit as she looks you over, seemingly searching for a hint of dishonesty. \"Uh, a lot of guys come by there. Was he an army type like yourselves?\" she asks in a somewhat nervous tone. You take a deep breath as you consider your next words carefully. \"Yeah, he was with his friend, drove a real fancy car. Bunch of flames painted on the side. Hang on, I can check the make and model for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull out a piece of paper with notes on the car and put it onto the table along with a hundred dollar bill. \"We'd like to find him soon. If he had a bad trip and hurt himself he might need our help... does any of that information ring a bell?\" Cynthia bit her lip as she read the note and began to grow a shade or two paler. \"Yeah... yeah, I know this guy.\" she finally answers as she puts the note down and gives you a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember your friend and his buddy arriving the other night. One of the two got drunk and started a fight with a couple members of the local biker gang. Real mean sons o' bitches. I had to throw them all out but I heard them arguing out in the parking lot. After a few minutes I also heard some breaking glass and some sort of loud thumping so I called the police. By the time they showed up all of the men were gone.\" she replied in a hushed tone, seemingly afraid to speak about the biker gang out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we're getting somewhere.\" Hal piped up as he leaned in closer. \"Do you know who these guys are?\" A deathly silence fell over the entire room for a few seconds as Cynthia put both her hands on her knees. It looked like she was struggling to say something but no words came out. \"I'm sorry, but I can't say anything else...\" she finally replied with a weary sigh.

You were just about to light up a cigar when your phone rang from the nearby table, forcing you to get out of the warm water into the cool night air. \"Every single time I try to relax, without fail...\" you mutter to yourself as you grab a towel and drape it over your shoulders. \"I hope this is at least something important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a click a deep voiced Russian man with a thick accent greeted you on the other side of the line. \"Hello my friend, I hope I am not interrupting anything?\" You sigh as you take a sip out of your drink and sit the glass down on the table. \"No, no, I was just about to grab a quick soak in the hot tub and relax a bit. If this is work related, let me have the details and I'll get back to you with my answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good, my friend. I'll have the contract sent to your private inbox, please enjoy the rest of your evening.\" came the reply as the man gave a quick laugh and wrote something down on his notepad. \"Of course Mr. Barlov, thank you for considering me. You have yourself a nice night.\" you reply as you hang up and walk back over to the hot tub. After about an hour you finish up your last cigar, get dressed and boot up your laptop. Sure enough, a new contract was waiting for you when you logged in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, a shipment of rare and expensive cars was being delivered to a secret warehouse tomorrow evening on the far side of L.A. for an upcoming car show. Whoever footed the bill for these beauties clearly didn't skimp on getting them delivered, all of the vehicles had been shipped first class with extreme care given by their handlers to make sure none were lost or damaged. The list of special modifications made to several of the cars boosted their value even further... you wondered if some of these changes were even legal in this state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Barlov's not offering much, but a simple job like this'll help get me back into the swing of things. I've been taking it easy a bit too much while I wait for jobs to come in.\" you say to yourself as you send your employer a confirmation email and go over the details of the job. This wouldn't be too hard to do by yourself, but there was no way you'd be able to retrieve all of the cars even if you used stealth. To get them all you'd need a proper crew... all of whom would expect a sizable chunk of the profits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother factor to consider was security, judging by all of the expenses paid to keep these cars off the radar and safe it was a good bet that their owners would be pulling out all the stops to protect them. Locks, keycards, cameras, security patrols... who knows what you'd have to get past. Calling in some specialists might help in this area as well, but they'd all want to be paid too. You could either take some big risks and hope they pay off or do things the smart yet expensive way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you want to do it?</span></div></div>",

A cool breeze blew across the balcony as you opened your laptop and brought up your contract database on the dark web. There was a lot of shady shit that went on there, but it provided discretion and plentiful clients in need of an experienced combat veteran like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou checked your inbox and scrolled down the list of potential contracts. Some jobs were too dirty for you to consider and others just didn't offer the cash you needed. The hardest part of finding a new job was always balancing time investment with worthwhile payment. Lots of people offered millions to keep their dirty secrets from surfacing, but that mattered little when doing a cover up required weeks of planning, bribing and searching. You always preferred the simpler jobs... shoot some guys, steal some stuff... blow up a building or two... all of this spy and espionage horseshit got on your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile deleting a message from some guy who wanted your help shooting up a government building you came across an email from an unidentified agent asking for help with some kind of experimental new ammo. Interested at the prospect of discovering a practical new type of ammunition you immediately clicked the open tab and read over the contract. The pay was good and you would be allowed to keep some of the goodies for yourself once the job was over... the only catch was that this would be a tougher mission to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the mafia involved and god knows how many underworld criminals things were sure to get messy at some point. While you were never a man to back away from a challenge you were getting a bit older and had to take care that you didn't step into something you'd have trouble finishing.

In addition to a suit of proper combat armor and your best rifle you had brought along some flares, a canteen of water, your prized bowie knife and a silenced pistol, along with a few other emergency supplies like matches and a radio. You also brought a stun gun and cable ties in case you needed to go the nonlethal route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jeff, I put out the call to our contact with the cops, he'll keep em' distracted on the ski resort while I drop you off about a mile or two away near the road.\" a loud voice said over the loudspeaker. \"Be ready to jump in five minutes, we'll only get one shot at this.\" As the voice shut off you equipped your parachute and backpack and headed over to the rear of the plane as the pilot slowed his descent over the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes the hatch opened up, letting in a flurry of snowflakes as you prepared for the jump. The bright lights of the ski lodge cut through the inky black sky and pointed treetops like a knife surrounded by the glittering flicker of blue and red lights. \"Go ahead and aim for the hill up ahead, those boys likely won't be able to hold out for too much longer. Good luck out there!\" the pilot announced as you made the leap and soared towards the abandoned ranger outpost sitting at the top of a nearby hillside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick flick of the wrist you unleashed your parachute and drifted softly towards your target. The lights of the ski resort slowly faded from sight as you brushed past a tall pine tree and landed firmly on solid ground. After taking a moment to reorient yourself you pushed past some snow covered bushes and began climbing the rickety wooden stairs of the long forgotten ranger outpost. When you got to the top you then pulled out a pair of binoculars and walked over to the flimsy railing and tried to get a good look at the resort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to make out any human figures, but the front of the parking lot was swarming with police cars and SWAT vans, not a good sign. \"Let's hope by the time I get there I find something worth saving.\" you whisper as your breath chilled to fog in front of you. After scoping out the layout of the building you took a few minutes to come up with a plan of action that could effectively deal with the situation.</span></div></div>",

This blizzard would probably last for several more hours, at least, so any form of air travel was probably out of the question. At some point you would have to figure out an alternate method of escape, which wouldn't be easy given your severely limited resources. Oh well, that was a problem for later, right now you were only concerned about getting inside to fully assess the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you carefully made your way through the snowy forest you made sure to make as little noise as possible. Luckily, it was late and most animals had taken shelter from the hostile weather. As the lights of the police cars became visible again through the dense snowy foliage you slowed your pace a bit and drew your knife and stun gun. You didn't like the idea of having a big shootout with the cops and drawing attention, but at least now you'd be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large SWAT van was parked near the far edge of the parking lot and would provide some good cover, but there were a few agents talking nearby while looking off towards the woods. They must be guards, keeping an eye out for any members of the gang that ran off and decided to come back. They were looking away from you but could turn around at any moment and it was a good ten or twenty feet between the cover of the SWAT van and the nearest bush. Quite a risky way to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for more options you looked around at the cops and law enforcement agents keeping their eyes peeled on the building. No shooting had broken out yet, but that could change in a second, especially if you didn't hurry. The original plan was to sneak around back to avoid most of the assault crew, though it would be pretty tricky to accomplish that task if you couldn't find any safe avenues of infiltration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were a few thick bushes and elevated stone planters lining the parking lot, but a few other guards were patrolling them. Still pretty dangerous, one wrong turn and a fight could break out... and you weren't properly prepared for a fight on this scale, not even close. \"There must be a safer way around.\" you whisper under your breath as you look at the woods surrounding the rest of the ski resort. It was probably too thick to sneak through quietly, but it could be the quickest option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and make your move...</span></div></div>",

Lucy loves wearing anything elegant and stylish, but has a particular fondness for red or black dresses. Always a tease she especially enjoys outfits that expose her ample cleavage and accentuate her butt and legs. She usually doesn't wear anything on her head, but ribbons and scarves are not unheard of. She also prefers to wear light makeup, usually just a bit of red lipstick and some nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Mansion. A small mansion located just outside Paris, France. It isn't very large, but is equipped with just about every luxury you can think of including a spa, bathhouse, twelve bedrooms, a wine cellar and a large garden out front. The mansion also has a few secret rooms accessible only with a keycard such as a firing range, armory, panic room and vault. There are also many hidden traps and security measures that can be activated with hidden switches and levers. Lastly, the whole facility is staffed with highly paid and well trusted butlers, maids and chefs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Lucy is well known for her beauty and isn't afraid to use it to her advantage, but what makes her truly deadly is her silver tongue and keen intellect. She can speak fluent english, french, spanish, japanese, chinese and russian along with knowing several words in many other languages. She also has training with knives, lockpicking, small firearms (such as handguns, machine pistols and revolvers) and poisons. She knows basic first aid and can make antidotes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: Physically, Lucy is very weak and only has a basic grasp of martial arts, which forces her to rely on subversive or indirect means of eliminating her foes. She can handle herself pretty well in a firefight, but can be overwhelmed by large numbers of powerful opponents. She also prefers to work alone, which means she doesn't get along well with others and shuns teamwork. She may even abandon her comrades if things get too intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: A large assortment of pistols and handguns, many of which are engraved in silver or gold. A few light machine guns. Ammo for all of her weapons. A massive collection of knives and various chemicals and lab equipment. A massive wardrobe filled with all manner of clothes for any situation, be it gunfights on a mountain top or a cocktail party downtown. Several flak jackets and some specially designed flameproof dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunch Money - An underground counterfeiting operation has been discovered by the local authorities and always manages to give the cops the slip before they can be captured. The government suspects that someone in the group is paying off officials to stay one step ahead of the police and has decided to put out a discreet contract on the group. The job is simple, stop the counterfeiting and either kill or capture the crooks before they escape. Bringing the criminals in alive pays more however. Moderate risk is involved. Pay: $1,000,000 - $75,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood Diamonds - A meeting between an african warlord and a crooked american businessman is set to go down in a motel outside of paris involving blood diamonds. The person who posted this contract doesn't have any info on security so expect anything and everything. The mission will be considered complete once both of the men and their associates are dead. In addition to the contract pay the merc who completes the assignment is entitled to any blood diamonds they can recover. Pay: $10,000,000 - $15,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff The Rails - A train transporting a world renowned musician and their entourage is scheduled to make a stop in paris on their most recent tour. To do this one Lucy will need to find a way to board the train before it arrives at its destination and hold it up. Having a crew and a way to transport stolen goods would be useful here, but it can be done solo for less loot. Aside from some body guards security should be pretty standard, making this a fairly low risk job. Pay: $20,000,000 - $100,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\n420 Degrees - A local pot farmer has set up what she thinks will grow into a major operation in the downtown district. In an abandoned warehouse and nearby hotel she has set up a massive weed garden staffed by guards and growers. The place has started to bring in some serious cash and the other drug dealers are having trouble keeping up with her prices. All you have to do is stop by a locker on the way to the garden which will be stocked with goodies to help you burn down this little farm. Upon completion of the job you will be sent you pay and may keep anything you acquire from the locker. Risk level is moderate. Pay: $1,000,000 - $5,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust Plane Wrong - An ultra high tech fighter plane is being developed by the french military and a prototype model is scheduled for a test run at a local airport. This mission is pretty standard, protect and escort two pilots to the plane so that they can hijack it for their boss. It doesn't matter if things go loud or you complete the whole job unnoticed so long as the pilots get away with the aircraft. Expect heavily security and tons of resistance if you are found. Needless to say, this one is pretty dangerous but also highly rewarding if you can get the job done. Pay: $100,000,000 - $150,000,000</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked over the scope on a modified SMG and checked the clip before putting it back in its case. You had spent the last two hours overlooking weapons in your armory trying to find something to use on your newest contract. According to the intel you were given the guys you were after were a bunch of small time crooks who where paying off someone in the government to stay ahead of police raids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, they started out small... now they were starting to buy their way into the big leagues with tons of counterfeit cash. Unfortunately for them the government got tired of them avoiding the law and hired you to put a stop to their little money making operation. After adjusting the silencer on a pistol you became frustrated and decided to head out into the garden for a bit to relax and clear your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were hundreds of ways you could go about this assignment, but it was hard to know exactly what to expect. Most small jobs like this had about a dozen guards and maybe a couple heavies in body armor, but something about this one seemed somehow off. You weren't worried about running into trouble but not packing the right equipment could make things much harder. More than anything you wanted to get some of that counterfeit cash for yourself and if you didn't approach the situation just right you could end up losing that opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStealth seemed like the best option, since it would prevent them from destroying or locking away the counterfeiter to spite you. On the other hand, taking everyone out silently could leave you with no one to help you access and make the counterfeit cash. It all depended on what they were using to counterfeit the money, where it was located and how secure it was. If it was just one or two guys doing it they'd probably be surrounded by armed guards, if it was a machine it was probably hidden or locked away somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sip a glass of wine as you reflect on what information you had been given on the assignment. The location was a run down theater on the far end of Paris on a condemned city block that was due for demolition in a few weeks. The government had managed to get a last minute tip off to their location but they were already packing up to move, in another night they'd have gone to some new place. This job had to happen tonight or not at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it wasn't usually your style you figured you could just go the Rambo route and gun everyone down since it was such a small gang. Of course that posed a few risks you didn't like taking. On the other hand, the group might be big enough that going in under equipped with just a silenced handgun may prove difficult. One option would be to compromise with a versatile light weapon like a silenced SMG or a scoped revolver. You could also carry a small back up weapon if you need to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing your wine you decided on a plan of action and head back to the armory to grab some equipment and a proper weapon to do the job with. Once you have everything you would need you get into your limo and give the address to your driver. In just a few hours you would arrive... hopefully with the right plan of action to guarantee your success.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You waved over your limo driver as a man in a butler uniform with an arm full of packages hurried to keep up with you. \"Put those in the back seat, sweetie. Thanks for your help.\" you say as you head over to the other side of the car and open the door to the backseat. The young man carefully placed the last package on the seat next to you and gives you a smile. \"That should be all the ones we agreed on, will my payment be ready soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you take your cigarette case and lighter out of your purse. \"Of course, dear. The money should be in your account by six, nice working with ya handsome.\" The man blushed a little and nodded his head as you pulled the door closed and waved goodbye. \"Thank you very much, I better get back to the show then.\" he called as the limo driver started to drive off. You blow him a kiss before turning towards the packages and lighting up a cigarette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do so enjoy the arts.\" you muse as you exhale a thin cloud of smoke and opened up your personal computer. \"But its not even noon yet, I still have plenty of time to get some more work done.\" After nearly half an hour of looking at job listings and contracts from your associates you decided on a job going down in a few hours just outside of Paris. The route would take you right by your mansion so you would have plenty of time to gear up as well, perfect for a day like today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Swing by the mansion, I found a great new contract to finish up the day.\" you call out to your driver as he pulled off the main road and began heading towards the countryside. With that you closed your computer and relaxed for the rest of the trip home. Roughly an hour later your limo was pulling through a small stone gatehouse at the end of a long driveway in the beautiful french countryside. \"We're here, Ms. Red.\" the driver called back as you put out your cigarette and stepped outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay put, someone will be out to collect the paintings while I prepare for my next little assignment. I might be a little while so go ahead and shut off the engine. If I'm not back in an hour go ahead and put it in the garage.\" you instructed as you slam your door shut and began walking up the steps to your mansion. \"Take a break as well, there should be some fresh lemonade in the kitchen.\" The driver nodded his head and thanked you as a young man in a sweater vest walked past you towards the limo with a maid close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful with those paintings now, I hired you to appraise them, not drop them.\" you called sternly as you open the front door to your mansion. \"Of course, Ms. Red. We'll be very careful!\" the maid called back as the door gently closed behind her. You let out a sigh as you head upstairs and take a moment to look over your central courtyard garden from the second floor balcony. Below were a few gardeners tending to rose bushes and overhanging vines while a few butlers and maids walked down the stony walkways to their various destinations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame I can't say and relax here a little longer, but I can't really say no to a payday this good.\" you say to yourself as you walk away and head back downstairs. After making a few sharp turns down some hallways you came to a small lobby area next to a pair of large hardwood doors secured with a security lock. After digging a keycard out of your purse and swiping it through the reader the large doors opened with a soft click and you continued through a second pair of metal doors into a large metal room stacked with lockers and a few tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the lockers were closed shut except for one filled with shelves of ammo and a few gun accessories such as scopes and silencers. The tables had large metal cases resting on top, which were all shut as well save for one containing a collapsible sniper rifle and a few small boxes of equipment. Lastly, there were two men in body armor, one of whom was inspecting a handgun next to the open locker while the other was assembling the sniper rifle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon boys, how's target practice been today?\" you ask as you walk over to one of the lockers and swipe it open with your keycard. \"Not bad ma'am. We just got in a new shipment of incendiary ammo from our supplier along with some new accessories for our rifles and handguns. You should check out what we got when you have the time.\" the man with the handgun replied as he flicked on a laser sight. \"Sounds like a good time for another day, I just accepted a new job.\" you say as you grab a small key from inside the locker. \"I'm just here to pick up some gear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good luck then ma'am.\" the man with the sniper rifle says with a nod as he shut the metal case on the table. \"Thanks, but I don't think I'll be needing any luck for this job.\" you reply as you unlock a door on the far side of the room and step inside. After walking down a short hallway and some stairs you came to a massive underground supply room. The ceiling was only about ten or eleven feet high but the room stretched out so far it looked like a couple of warehouses were stacked side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing here was particularly glamorous like the rest of the mansion, but what it lacked in style it made up for in practicality. Various workers took inventory as they moved crates and stacked tables and desks with boxes. Most of the stuff here was new, fresh off the black market and still waiting to be sorted, which made it the perfect place to pick up and try out some new gear. You walked over to a table with some papers on it and picked up a sheet near the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a list of your most recent acquisitions purchased the other day when you got in contact with a friend who could get you a discount on some premium stuff he just got in. You had spent well over a million dollars on new toys, but it was all worth it, especially at such a great price. \"Let's see here...\" you whisper as you look over the list. \"I've got the stuff to do things any way I want... I just need to decide on a plan and gear up and I can head out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you plan to do this job?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You figured stealth would be the quickest and cleanest way to get this job done and begin planning accordingly. Both parties would probably bring their own security so you were most likely looking at about ten to twenty guys with guns and maybe some other hardware. Nothing too dangerous if you you were smart and careful but too many to effectively deal with using a sniper rifle or something slow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you decide to pack a new silenced SMG with armor piercing rounds and a couple spare mags as well as a suit of light combat armor. This way you could move through any resistance quickly and efficiently and still keep the element of surprise. You also grabbed some throwing knives, a combat knife and a frag grenade just to be on the safe side and headed out. As you passed by your limo driver on you way to the garage you waved him over to see you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of plans, I'm gonna handle this job the quiet way.\" you inform him as you grab a biker helmet off a nearby shelf and hop on your motorcycle. \"Trail me for about an hour and then find a place to park. I might need back up or a quick escape so be ready to move. If you receive a text with an address head there immediately, understood?\" The driver nodded his head and walked back over to the limo as you revved up your bike and began speeding down the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour driver kept up a good pace as you raced through the french countryside with the wind kissing your face as you darted around sharp turns and past billowing trees. You had about half an hour before the deal was set to go down when your limo driver broke away into the parking lot of a small store next to a gas station, leaving you alone on the road for the last few miles. After slowing your pace through a thick forest area you pull off the main road onto a dirt trail and parked your bike near the peak of a small hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith about twenty minutes to go you hurried down the nearby foot path until you came to a small outcropping of rock near the base of the hill that was flat enough to serve as a temporary lookout. You peered through the medium range scope you had affixed to your SMG before leaving home and gazed through the trees and bushes until you spotted a building down below near the road. \"Ah, there we go.\" you whisper as you head further down the trail to get a bit closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large military vehicle pulled into the parking lot of the motel just as you took cover in the dense foliage near the end of the trail. A second vehicle soon arrived behind it and several men in fatigues and berets climbed out. A man with a thick beard and a chest full of shiny medals stepped out and was immediately saluted by the others before heading around to the main entrance of the building. \"I think I found the warlord, now I just need to find the other guy and I'll be ready to move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look through the scope at the parking lot and notice two men in suits and sunglasses talking near a red, white and blue limo parked near the back of the lot. \"Hmmm, looks like the suit was already here. I better move before they wrap this up and decide to pull out.\" you say softly as you take a quick look around the motel. In addition to the two guys near the limo there was a sniper on the roof, two more guys in suits doing patrols along the second floor, two guys in fatigues patrolling the ground floor and a suit with a shotgun stationed near the back entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About half a dozen guys guarding the outside with probably a dozen or so either inside or at spots I can't see, this shouldn't be too hard.\" you say to yourself as you move down to the end of the trail and take cover in the tall weeds alongside the road. Time to get to work...</span></div></div>",

You look around and zone in on the sniper with your scope. He was clearly the most dangerous target, but taking him out would greatly eliminate the threat the others posed. The only problem is that his death carried a great risk of alerting the others, you'd have to time this just right if you were going to pull it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a few moments for another guard to open the door to the room where your targets were and take careful aim with your silenced SMG. Just as the guard is about to close the door you open fire and unleash a quick burst of rounds at the sniper. The bullets find their mark instantly and the sniper collapses onto the roof as tiny trails of red burst from the back of his head. The door slams shut just as his body falls with a loud thud. The guard pauses to look at the door for a moment before shrugging and moving on with his patrol. None of them suspected a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou breathe a quick sigh of relief as you reload your SMG with a fresh clip and move to a slightly better vantage point. Two more bursts of fire cut down two men patrolling the side of the motel with ease and you sneak across the road once you are sure no one will spot you. Another guard approaches you from the back as you close in on the bodies and you pop off some more rounds just as he turns around the corner. Luckily, no one saw his body go down and you quickly move his corpse before another guy checks on the back of the motel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drag the bodies behind a nearby bush where they wouldn't be easily spotted and pile their guns under a few other bushes nearby. Your SMG still had plenty of ammo left but something heavier could be useful if things went sideways and nothing beat a shotgun or an assault rifle in a close range firefight. Once the dead guards and their weapons were secured you sneak around to the back of the motel and slip into the dense foliage as you move onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother guy slips away to enjoy a smoke break and you put him down with a quick knife throw that pierces his heart. He lets out a single grunt as he he drops his cigarette and clutches his chest. You walk over and stomp out the cigarette as he tries to raise his revolver. You merely grab it from him before he can fire and finish him off by putting your combat knife through his throat. This made for a quiet, if messy, end and his lifeless body slumps to the ground as you place the revolver near a rock at the base of a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were making good progress but it seemed like the remaining guards were starting to get a bit suspicious. A few men with rifles and shotguns grouped together near the cars as another group headed around the motel towards the spot you came in at. It probably wouldn't take them long to find the bodies and even if they didn't you couldn't exactly scrub away some blood off the wall from your most recent kill. Sooner or later they would find you, it was just a matter of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking quickly, you scope out the guys near the cars. There were five in total, decently armed but clustered together. You could take them all out but that ran the risk of drawing attention, even if none of them alerted the others their bodies could set off a car alarm by accident. The other group was smaller, only three or four, but they were actively looking for you and on alert, making them much harder to surprise. Once false move and they'd light you up like a christmas tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever move you're gonna make, better do it quick!</span></div></div>",

It sounded like they were all together but you couldn't be completely sure, unfortunately it look'd like you would just have to take a chance and hope your presence isn't detected just yet. With a deep breath you run forward and make a quick dive as you round the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo surprised goons raised their guns but your SMG fire lit them up before they could get off a shot. The bodies fell with a soft thud as the third guy quickly turned his head to see what the commotion was. You gaze through the scope and pull the trigger just as he points his gun in your direction. He was a good distance away and partially obscured by a thin tree but the last few rounds in your clip peppered his body and dropped him before he could fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go in to move closer as you load a fresh clip and toss the empty mag when a shot rings out from a revolver and almost grazes your shoulder. Shit! This guy wasn't dead yet, the bullets must have missed his vitals! \"What the hell was that?\" one of the men by the vehicles shouted as he and a couple other guys began running around the front of the motel to check on their allies. \"Goddamn it!\" you curse under your breath as you run up and finish off the guy with a knife to the throat. \"Here they come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you realized all bets were off and these guys were now out for blood so you dropped your SMG and picked up the assault rifle you had stashed nearby before ducking behind some bushes. Three new guards carrying a shotgun, pistols and an assault rifle rounded the corner and immediately screamed in surprise at seeing the carnage you had laid out in front of them. \"Someone took out our guys, one of you two dumb fucks go warn the boss while the other helps me find this little cunt, they can't have gone far!\" the man in charge yells as one of his underlings turns to run back to get the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast...\" you think to yourself as you target the guy who was turned around and open fire. A loud roar shattered the silence as you drilled several new holes into his back and then spray his two friends with the remainder of the magazine. All three men let out soft grunts of pain as they fell and you rushed out of your hiding place to confront the others. No doubt they were all alerted now and even with half their number dead could still assist their bosses in an escape attempt. You couldn't allow that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore voices began shouting from the top floor of the motel as more security personnel rushed out to deal with the threat. You were in the homestretch now, you just had to finish off the last dozen or so soldiers and you'd be ready to claim one hell of a nice payday. Time to set up your final move...</span></div></div>",

Once there you head over to a large locker marked with the number you had been given. \"Yep, looks like this is the place.\" you note as you fish a keycard out of your purse and swipe it through the reader. With a soft ding the locker clicked open and you pulled away the door to find yourself staring at a small armory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe top shelf was lined with molotovs, incendiary grenades and matches while the bottom of the locker contained a compact flamethrower with a nozzle extension sitting right beside it. \"Well well now, what do we have here?\" you grin as you pick up the flamethrower and check its fuel tank. \"It's full and I've got an extra in here just in case... plus a nozzle extension that'll probably boost the range of this little beauty by at least 30 feet. Nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stocking up on what you could carry you notice a small paper note on the top shelf and quickly unfold it. It contained instructions on how to get to the pot farm without being seen from the storage facility. There were a few different options, but each posed some sort of risk. After deciding what path to take you head out the back door around the storage facility guards and took cover behind a nearby delivery truck while they passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the area was clear again you moved to a nearby stone wall and carefully moved through a few thick bushes to a large gap that had been knocked out of it. It was a bit difficult to climb over with the flamethrower in hand but you managed to get through without making a single sound. You were now in a large grassy lot filled with a few small trees and vines growing along the sides of the wall. From here you would have to choose your path carefully to get to your target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the note the building next to the lot's main gate was abandoned and connected to the warehouse itself, but was likely patrolled by guards. The second direction you could go was through a small hole in the wall of the far side of the lot, which would take you directly to the warehouse. It was the quickest route, but also lacked cover, which would make you easier to spot. Lastly, you could open a manhole cover in the corner of the lot and travel though the sewer. This was probably the safest and stealthiest route, but also the dirtiest and ran the risk of damaging some of your supplies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich way should you go?</span></div></div>",

He may sometimes wear a short goatee or some stubble, but usually just to serve as a disguise or help hide his identity. His most distinguishing features are his beautiful light blue eyes and calming smile. He doesn't particularly care about fashion, but always wears stylish clothing whenever he's on a job, be it a simple suit and tie or designer jacket and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Hacker Cave. An unknown location somewhere in South America. Desmond prefers to constantly stay on the move and has many safe houses all across the world, but he keeps returning to the Hacker Cave again and again. The place is fairly small due to being built into a cave on a remote hillside, though it has everything Desmond could ask for. The whole thing is comprised of only two rooms, a computer room and a small bathroom. The walls are all lined with monitors and various screens and speakers and the floor is littered with dirty clothes and various empty snack boxes. Of note are the thick reinforced walls and concealed and password locked front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Desmond is a master hacker and tech expert. In addition to building his own drones and specialized robots he has an extensive knowledge of computers and security systems. Basically, he can rewire anything more advanced than a wristwatch and disable anything that he can't reprogram. He also has an extensive grasp of cryptography and can decode almost anything. His skill with technology is so good that he often makes his own gear and even improves the gear of his allies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: He isn't particularly bad at anything, but not particularly good either. He can drive, shoot and improvise decently enough, but he doesn't excel at any of those things. He works great as part of a team or in a support role, but is under-equipped to deal with most missions by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: An advanced computer network that provides top of the line security and internet access. Several drones, turrets and basic combat robots. A secure bank account with a moderate amount of every currency on the planet for last minute expenses and trips. Several civilian grade firearms such as hunting rifles, handguns and the odd shotgun. A selection of computer viruses and a logbook with blackmail information. Finally, a weapon workstation for maintenance and crafting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepossession - A recent client of Sue's has stiffed her for all of the work she did on his new sports car. For revenge she wants you to steal back or destroy the car, along with any of his friend's cars that you can get your hands on. Risk here is minimal and so is the reward unless you bring back a lot of the cars. Pay: $1,000,000 - $5,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlu Shot - A massive technological company is giving Desmond a lot of trouble with their new computer security systems. If this keeps up for much longer Desmond's virus won't be any match for their protection systems. The goal here is simple, infiltrate their company H.Q. in Brazil and get a copy of their master program before they can cause any more trouble. It'll be a pretty hard job, especially if it goes loud. Getting a hold of that master program will be well worth it though, not to mention the money you could drain from their accounts while you're there. Pay: $5,000,000 - $50,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCyber Heist - A group of famous bank robbers are planning one of the biggest heists in recent memory by knocking over the Blue Siren casino in Las Vegas. The only catch is that the casino has an entirely digital vault security system and they need a master hacker to help them reach and open it. In addition to providing intel and support Desmond will need to make sure the crew gets the job done and escapes in one piece. This one will be tricky, but the potential rewards are pretty damn tempting. Pay: $150,000,000 - $250,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeer Run - Some outlaw moonshiners in one of Brazil's biggest slums have stumbled upon a potent and dangerous formula. They call their secret blend Ambrosia and it's become quite popular thanks to its cheap cost and potent kick. Busting up this little operation would make for a nice little payday and the recipe to make this stuff would be a nice bonus. Fairly low risk and with good rewards, but you never know what kind of heat these guys might be packing. Pay: $10,000,000 - $20,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost And Found - A recent spike in missing persons has Brazilian authorities worried that a serial killer or human trafficker may be at work. Luckily, Desmond has a special tracking program that might just lead him to the culprit. All of the missing people are college aged kids, some local and some tourists. This contract offers good rewards, but its unknown just what kind of danger may be in store making this a risky job to complete. Pay: $5,000,000 - $25,000,000</span></div></div>",

You had planned to take the weekend off, but some dumb douche decided to try and fuck over Sue, one of your more important contacts and you ended up accepting a last minute job to teach the guy some manners. This wouldn't be a big job, just some street punks and maybe some cops if they got involved, though Sue offered a decent paycheck for the work, which you were happy to accept.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back trunk were a pair of drones, a remote car, some tech gadgets and a few spare sets of clothes in case you needed a disguise. You also had a backpack in the front passenger seat with a switchblade and handgun inside it, along with a couple bats in the back, one aluminum and one wood. Sue had made it clear she wanted the car retrieved if possible, though sending a message not to screw her again would suffice if you felt like getting messy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ring echoed on your cellphone as you swerved around a tight turn that hugged the hillside running along the coast. \"Hello, it's D.\" you answered as you pulled aside for another car to pass by on the narrow road. \"Hey, its Sue, I just got word that our boy and his buddies are heading down to the beach just outside the city. They should have some of their best vehicles there, so I'll be happy to pay for any extras you can grab.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you pulled over to the side of the road to program your GPS with the new coordinates. \"Damn girl, I didn't bring the equipment for extra targets, but I might be able to set something up. I know a few guys in the area who may be able to help me. Let me call you back once I access the situation.\" you reply as you write down the info on the other cars. Sue tells you not to worry as long as you deal with the guy who stiffed her before excusing herself to take another call and hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well alright then...\" you say happily as you examine the car models you had been given on your laptop. All of the vehicles were high end model sportscars made during the past decade, real quality merch even without the upgrades and work they would have done on them. This could end up being a very lucrative endeavor if you played your cards right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were done with the intel you pulled back onto the road and headed down the hill towards a beach that stretched all the way from the distant coast to the city on the far horizon. \"I'm just about there, I better make some calls before I arrive and see what I can do about these extra rides they got.\" you note as you dial up a number. After a few quick conversations you had a whole crew on standby to help out if needed. You were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou parked your own car near the far side of a lot on the edge of the beach near a strip mall. You got out and headed into a nearby liquor store to buy a case of beer and then headed back to your vehicle. After pouring one of the beers out you filled it up with a water bottle and made sure you had your handgun in your backpack before heading out onto the beach. As you strolled past a few people packing up for the night you take a few sips of your fake drink and try to act casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff near the docks were a few young collage age girls talking with a group of people in their early to late twenties. One of the men in the group had a dyed red beard, sunglasses and a blue baseball cap... this was your guy. You watched the group for a few minutes as they walked off towards a cluster of small house boats where someone was barbecuing some hamburgers. With a sly smile you then headed back to your car to plan your next move.</span></div></div>",

It was just five minutes past 9:00am and the weather would likely be heating up tremendously by noon. Just another day in Las Vegas. You chuckled to yourself as you checked out and reclaimed your luggage. It was amazing what you could smuggle into the country with a few greased palms and a fake passport. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun began slowly climbing into the sky from the distant horizon as various big shots and gamblers collected their bags and chatted on their cell phones. It felt strange to be back on American soil after everything that happened before, but with airport security out of the way you were confident in things going smoothly today. As you walked out of the main lobby onto the sidewalk outside you were quickly approached by a man in a black suit and tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Desmond?\" the guy asked with a slight cockney accent as he took a drag off his cigarette. You simply nodded your head and replied \"Yeah, you the driver?\" The guy gestured for you to follow him and led you to an impressive limo decked out with a cyberpunk paintjob on the front hood. \"Oh shit, that's a nice ride man.\" you say in an impressed tone as you climb into the backseat while the driver put out his cigarette and climbed in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you liked the ride, D.\" he replied as he revved up the engine and pulled out of the airport. \"The other guys are waiting at a local hotel near the outskirts of Vegas. It cost us a pretty penny, but we'll have all of the privacy we need to plan the job. I'm K, by the way.\" he finished as he turned on the radio. You smile as you kick your feet back and take a bottle of champagne out of a tray of ice and pop the cork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, K.\" you reply as you pour yourself a drink. \"Sounds like the crew has done a good job getting things set up. I couldn't bring all of my toys on the flight, but we'll make due. I just need to pick up some stuff from the tech store and I'll have everything covered. Jammers, recorders, bugs, robotics... you name it.\" You spend the rest of the drive chatting about the heist and discussing what you'd each do with your share of the money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at the hotel K dropped you off to go meet the rest of the crew while he parked the car. After thanking him for the ride you watched him drive around to the back and turned to face the main building. It was an impressive structure with a tropical theme judging by the exotic plants and palm trees planted along the sidewalk. It wasn't particularly tall but everything from the windows to the front doors screamed luxury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, I gotta give it to the crew... they sure have good taste in accommodations.\" you say happily as you take out your cell phone and check the time. It was about two hours until noon and the temperature was already rising. Should you get your shopping done now before it gets too hot or wait and do it after meeting your new partners?</span></div></div>",

After all, it was important for a team to get along and have each other's backs if it wanted to succeed, something you had learned in the past from working with crews who only had the score in mind. If everyone manage to do a good job on this Blue Siren heist you'd all soon be millionaires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed into the main lobby and basked in the refreshingly cool air that washed over you while admiring the interior design of the hotel. It was a bit cheesy with palm tree silhouettes painted on the walls and employees wearing tropical floral print shirts but it was still a pretty nice place for being so far from the main strip. After checking in at the front desk you hopped onto the elevator and took it up to room 311 on one of the upper floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approached the door you heard cheering and hoots of laughter on the other side. It sounded almost like some sort of big party was going on, which was strange. You checked the room number that had been sent by the crew and sure enough it was the right place. \"Alright then, here goes nothing I guess...\" you mumble to yourself as you swipe your keycard in the slot and turn the handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room were three men in suits, a lean Asian man in a white leisure suit with black undershirt, a Caucasian man with a light blue pinstripe suit and blue tie and another Caucasian man with a goatee and gold necklace in a casual brown suit. All of them were enjoying some booze and barely noticed you walk in. What really caught your eye though, was the buxom stripper dancing on a thick wooden coffee table while her partner gave the Asian guy a lap dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hey hey, you D?!\" the Asian guy shouts cheerfully as he pours himself a fresh glass of bourbon. The other two guys look you over as they take a sip out of their own drinks, a martini and a glass of rum and coke. This wasn't what you expected, but as long as these guys were professional once the job started you didn't mind a little bit of celebrating early. \"Yeah, I'm D. Nice to meet you all.\" you reply as you sit your stuff down in an empty chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do now?</span></div></div>",

I just flew in from South America, I'm the tech expert for this little job if you hadn't guessed yet. I'll still need to pick up some supplies before I'll be ready to get to work but that shouldn't be a problem. I'm looking forward to working with you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asian guy nods as he takes a sip of his drink and then gestures for the stripper giving him a lap dance to take a break. \"Cool, so you're the hacker then? Nice.\" he replies as he leans forward to shake your hand. \"I'm T, the guy who organized this little group and the one who's in charge of securing our equipment. The guys over on the other couch are O and B, O's the guy in blue and B's the guy in brown. O's our resident stealth expert and B's been an off the radar doctor for going on ten years now, he'll keep us patched up if things get dicey. Say hello boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men nod in your direction as you take a sip out of your Mojito. \"Like I said, good to meet you all. I take it K is our getaway driver?\" you ask as the man himself walks through the door. \"Yep, our friend K here is the best in the business, hasn't let us down yet.\" T replies as K takes a spot on the couch next to you. \"You flatter me T, I'm glad my work here is appreciated. Now, hand me a damn drink already, while you lot were partying some of us were busy running errands... like picking up our guest here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all share a laugh as you pass K a few of the bottles off the tray. You spend the next few hours talking and by the time you realize how long you've spent getting to know each other it was already the hot part of the day. \"Guess those supplies will have to wait until tomorrow.\" you think to yourself as you down your third Mojito. \"Ah well, today we'll party and tomorrow we can start preparing for the job.\" As the afternoon fades into the evening you set up a schedule with K and plan out a course of action for the next day. </span></div></div>",

You knew this was a bad part of town but his eagerness to leave made you somewhat uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned away from the main road with a sigh and looked at the crowded and congested backstreet that stood before you. Tall rundown buildings lined the narrow path forward and several bums and vagrants were sitting around on loose piles of trash such as old tires or broken wooden chairs. A few were gambling or drinking, some were passed out on cardboard boxes and one was in the process of injecting a needle into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This looks like a pretty rough neighborhood, glad I came prepared.\" you whisper to yourself as you begin walking past a couple of kids playing with small spinning tops. Most of the residents ignored you as you moved past them but a few gave you dirty glares and one even brandished a small knife as you passed by his shop. You kept your hand on the gun in your front jacket pocket, just in case someone tried to pull a weapon on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn addition to the 9mm handgun you had also packed a detachable silencer, taser and multi-tool with a small knife blade as well to give yourself a good variety of protection. You also had a flying drone in your backpack along with a small robotic remote car that you could equip with various attachments, like a camera or flashlight. More important than all of that however, was a lightweight flak jacket you had purchased off the black market before arriving here. It was a bit old and worn but it could easily save your life against smaller caliber firearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a moment to rest near a telephone pole and pulled out your phone. After checking the map app you had installed the other day you see that your current destination was just a quarter of a mile up the road. The building was an old slaughter house that closed down about a decade ago before being bought by a local gang leader to use as a storage facility and meeting place. It wasn't even a secret that the place was being used for smuggling and drug running, the gang had the local cops on their payroll and most residents knew what would happen if anyone tried to mess with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess there's a few ways I can do this...\" you think to yourself as you download a blueprint of the building. \"The place has two floors, a lower factory area and some offices on the upper level. Probably about a dozen guys in total including their boss, unlikely to be too well armed but probably carrying some decent street guns like uzis or sawn-off shotguns. I could try talking to them, I have enough money to offer a good bribe... but things could get ugly if negotiations went south. Let's see, how am I gonna do this...?\"</span></div></div>",

Two days ago you had accepted a job looking into some missing people and traced most of the disappearances to a shady part of some backwater city know for its high crime rates and police corruption. A perfect place for some sicko to kidnap victims and take them back to their lair to do god knows what... hopefully that was coming to a close now that a skilled merc was involved with the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got everything?\" you ask over a hidden speaker your contact Chris had hidden in his ear. After a brief hiss of static a familiar voice came over the two way communicator. \"Yeah, I got my gun and taser and I've been tryin' to keep a low profile. I'm definitely starting to get a good picture of our culprit though. Most of the missing persons came into contact with a middle aged drifter type in a suit. I've been keeping an eye out, I'll let you know when anything turns up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a quick sip out of your drink and open up a video feed from a secret camera Chris had in his hat and took a look around at the busy city streets. \"Alright, man.\" you reply as you take note of a nearby street address. \"You're heading into some dangerous territory, be careful.\" Chris laughed and replied that he would before cutting off the mic and heading into a nearby bar. You quickly opened a new feed of the interior and looked around at the patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the drunks and bums looked shady, but none fit the profile of the suspect. \"I don't think the guy we're looking for is here, boss. I'm going to head out and try some of the other places nearby.\" Chris reported as he walked back out the front door. For the next hour you both had little luck as most of the people he encountered were too drunk, horny or stupid to be the suave mystery man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when Chris was about to call it quits for the night he noticed a man in a trenchcoat and fedora walking down the opposite side of the street. It was hard to see his face but he looked like a dead ringer for the description provided by most of your contacts. \"Boss, do you see-\" \"I do.\" you cut him off as you try to get a zoom in on his face from a nearby street camera. \"Follow him, see if you can get some kind of ID on him, a license plate or credit card number, anything like that and we'll have a good lead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded as he followed the guy around the block to a library and down a narrow alleyway leading to a small parking lot where another man was waiting for him. Chris could get closer, but it would be very risky so he took cover behind a nearby dumpster as the men began talking. Unfortunately, there were no cameras in the immediate area and it was hard to hear anything either of them said. \"What's the call boss? They won't be here long and we need to make a move.\" Chris warned as he peeked around the corner.</span></div></div>",

Even if he and you couldn't hear the men talking a phone might be able to pick up something useful you could use later. You and Chris waited anxiously as the two shady guys chatted for a few minutes before walking over to a car parked near the far end of the parking lot. \"Shit, boss... I think they're leaving!\" Chris whispered urgently as he tried to move closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, don't lose them now!\" you whisper back a bit louder than you intended. \"Try to get a photo of the vehicle, a license plate, a fucking bumper sticker, anything to identify their ride!\" Chris panted nervously as he rushed behind a parked truck and waited for the rev of an engine. As the car pulled out of the lot he leaned past the rear of the truck just enough to snap a few quick photos as the suspects disappeared from sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sure he was in the clear Chris reported in. \"Yo boss, they're gone. What's our next move?\" he asks as he looks over the photos he took on his phone. \"Did you get any good shots of the car?\" you reply as you dig a spare memory drive out of a drawer and stick it in your laptop. \"Not really, I got a couple pictures, but they're a little blurry. We should be able to get a solid read on the model of car though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub your chin as a folder containing a list of car models from 1990-2008 pops up on your desktop. \"Alright, alright I think we can work with this. Get back when you can and send me what you have. If I can at least identify the vehicle it'll be a decent start.\" Chris replies in the affirmative and begins heading back to his own car. In a few minutes a fresh notification popped up on your computer with the photos and recorded audio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Chris, let's see what you got us...\" you wonder aloud as you open the files.</span></div></div>",

Micheal always wears exquisite suits and jackets whenever he has the opportunity and hates dressing in plain or low quality clothing. He is typically clean shaven though he often grows a bit of stubble or a small goatee as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Sakura Resort. An inn and hot springs located in the countryside near the forest and mountains. It gets its name from the dozens of beautiful cherry blossom trees planted around the property. While the main bath house, rooms, courtyard and mountain trail are open to the public Michael has taken several steps to secure a private manor house for himself nearby along with an extensive cave network containing a small facility and panic room. It has many luxuries and the money Micheal pulls in from tourists and guests makes sure it stays in top condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: Micheal is a very suave, roguish and handsome man with stylish dark brown hair and beautiful blue eyes. He knows just what to say to a woman to get her to do what he wants and is genuinely friendly and polite to the people he meets, which makes him seem very trustworthy. He isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and is deadly skilled with revolvers and shotguns in particular. He can also speak fluent Japanese from his time in Japan and is well connected with many local yakuza groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: His skill with the ladies doesn't really translate well to men or lesbians due to a lot of it being based on sex appeal and looks. He also tends to get carried away sometimes and spend too much time flirting instead of making progress towards his goals or getting distracted by money. Sleeping around with the wrong women has also gotten him into trouble in the past and his judgement can be lacking when it comes to sex or cash. Lastly, he isn't good with automatic weapons and strongly prefers guns with good accuracy like rifles and handguns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: A trophy room filled with rare weapons like engraved handguns and katanas. A massive collection of fancy suits and expensive hats. A network of security personnel and yakuza bodyguards to watch over his assets. A harem of sexy informants to keep him up to date on information and a large garage filled with luxury sports cars and performance vehicles of all types. He also has a fully stocked shooting range and a private jet on standby for emergency escapes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tokyo Hotel Heist - Micheal's yakuza boss wants him to infiltrate one of the largest and most famous hotels in japan and rob their safe of a very rare suit of samurai armor that was recently auctioned off for over ten million dollars. To secure the suit Micheal will have to put together a team that can either steal the suit right from under their noses or go in guns blazing and take the rare treasure by force. Pay: $15,000,000 - $30,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurf War - A rival yakuza group has been moving in on territory owned by Micheal's boss for months now and finally crossed a line by shaking down one of his restaurants for protection money. The job should be fairly simple and easy with a modest cash reward. To complete the mission Micheal either has to get the rival yakuza to back off or take them out  so that don't come back. Pay: $1,000,000 - $5,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDream Date - A large triad is visiting from china and seeking to form an alliance with Micheal's boss. To seal the deal the head of the triad and his brother plan on meeting up with the yakuza on their home turf to see if they would make good allies. Unfortunately, the brother of the triad boss has brought along his 19 year old daughter and needs some additional last minute protection to make sure she stays safe and has a good time. This job is risky as even the smallest error could invite the wrath of the triad, something the yakuza do not need. Expect a big payday if all goes well, but extreme caution and alertness will be needed to succeed. Pay: $80,000,000 - $150,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice Boat - A large shipment of luxury items is being brought in by a rival triad and intercepting it for the boss would likely do wonders for Micheal's reputation. The boat is set to come in during the early hours of the morning and will be headed for an offshore loading dock. To succeed here Micheal needs to get on board the boat and find a way to transport the goods to a safehouse until he can get some of his underlings to move them. The boat is sure to have armed guards so the contract poses moderate risks and greater rewards depending on how much of the cargo can be claimed. Pay: $20,000,000 - $100,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLove Hotel - The boss recently came into a large love hotel after one of his gambling debtors came up short on payday. The place isn't too bad on its own but the boss wants Micheal to find some girls to works as prostitutes to get a leg up on the competition. The place doesn't need anyone fancy, but the cuter the girls are the more money they'll earn so it'll pay to find the best of the best. Minimal risk and a low but still respectable cash reward for completion. Pay: $5,000,000 - $10,000,000</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You took down a few notes as you walked through the long hallway to your room on the 18th floor of Tokyo's world famous Blue Garden Hotel and Resort. You had been posing as a guest for the past weekend and had observed an auction taking place in the back lobby. In addition to various antiques and relics there was a near pristine suit of valuable samurai armor... just as your boss Ryu had predicted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing had been sold to a wealthy historical club who would no doubt seal it away in some private museum for their eyes only. At least, that was probably their plan. If you and the Sakura Garden Yakuza had a say the treasure would soon be finding a new home safe and sound in Ryu's office, where it would likely be departing to a rich underground collector shortly afterwards. Whatever its fate, you had been promised a large payday for securing the armor by any means necessary and you intended to collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you swipe your keycard through the scanner on your door you take a moment to reflect on your days working for the mafia back in America. Your old boss wasn't as friendly as Ryu, but the guy had a strong moral code and did a lot to look out for his crew. You had actually been up for a big promotion before you ended up getting sent overseas to oversee a budding partnership with the local yakuza. Nearly two years later and you had succeeded in establishing strong ties between the two groups, but the SGY still had a ways to go before they'd be the dominant players in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been instructed to return once you had helped remove any rival factions and ensure a long prosperous future between the two organizations. Things were progressing smoothly enough with the SGY now one of the bigger gangs in Japan, but you still had a few more years worth of work before you could return home. You weren't complaining though, with the loans you had to take out to help build your empire you saw this assignment as one big extended vacation. Yeah, you were starting to receive a few angry messages about paying back your debt, but that's what this job was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once I pay back that loan and smooth things out with the boys in the SGY I'll be heading back out west so I should enjoy the time I've got left here.\" you note as you change into a silk robe and order a bottle of champagne and ice to be brought up to the room. The boss man had provided you plenty of extra cash to case this place and you weren't going to let a single yen go to waste. Just as you lit up a cigar you hear a soft knock at the door and get up to answer it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" you call as you exhale a cloud of smoke. A young woman's voice then piped up from the other side. It was sweet and smooth like honey, but hid a tinge of venom that you were quick to pick up on. \"Mr. David? Is that you? It's room service, I have your order for you.\" she replied sweetly. \"Ah, that was quick.\" you joke as you open the door and gesture to an open seat near a wooden table sitting next to the bed. The woman silently walked in and took a seat before lighting up a cigarette and relaxing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have a cigar or two if you like, I don't buy the cheap stuff.\" you offer as you sit down in your own chair and pull a small box off a nearby shelf. \"How kind, you really are a gentleman.\" the woman replied as she stubbed out her cigarette and took a cigar from the box. You picked up your lighter off the table and lit it for her. After exhaling a plume of smoke she crossed her legs and straightened her posture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, now are you ready for your order?\" the woman asked with a sly smile. \"I have a few other \"rooms\" to visit yet and I want to keep on schedule.\" You nod and lean back in your chair as you pull out your notebook. \"I was only able to get a few looks at the armor before it got packed up inside the safe, but they're keeping it in a massive vault near the top floor. Expect at least a dozen guards and security personnel. The lock is entirely electronic, no lockpicking I'm afraid, you'll need to figure out how to open it or get something that can get through it. Looks pretty sturdy, I doubt a drill would cut it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scribbled down a few more details she gave as another knock came from the door. It was the actual room service this time, a man in a suit with your champagne and ice. You quickly thank him with a 10,000 yen tip and send him on his way while your lovely guest resumes talking. From the sound of things you would ultimately need three separate keycards from the guards and a password or something powerful enough to crack over 5 inches of hard metal. No easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you my dear, you've been most helpful. I believe the price we agreed on was 100,000 yen?\" The woman nodded as you popped the cork on the champagne and grabbed a few glasses. You both declare a toast to new fortunes and take a sip from your glasses. After finishing her drink the woman pocketed the money you had laid out on the table and checked her address book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I have a few friends who might be able to provide some of what you need to get this suit of armor you're after. If you cut me a small piece of the pie I can provide you a lot of help.\" she offered as she gave you a piece of paper with a few phone numbers on it. \"They don't come cheap, but I can probably negotiate a few big discounts here and there, plus it'll save you some expenses in the long run, what do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of thinking you finish off the rest of your glass and pour another for the both of you. \"I'm not sure, the boss laid out a very precise expense plan for this job. If I hire any outside help it comes from my own pocket.\" you finally say as you take a drag off your cigar. \"Look, think about it a little more. My help won't be cheap but it'll pay off in the long run, I promise. I'm gonna pay a quick trip to the ladies room, give me your answer when I get out.\" she replied as she got up and excused herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't an expert when it came to things like this, a little help from some actual experts with high end equipment would make things a lot easier. On the other hand, it would eat up a good chunk of your profits once the job was actually completed. The woman would be back in a few minutes and you needed to decide on an answer for her. Should you let her join the crew or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Paying a few professionals to help would make things go smoother and would probably pay off in the long run, even with the large hit to your cut of the profits. You begin sipping on your third glass of champagne as the woman returns to the table and give her a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you've got a deal.\" you say as you pour her another drink. \"I'm covering the extra cost though, so you'll need to have your friends check in with Ryu, the leader of the Sakura Garden Yakuza. If he thinks they're good enough for the job I'll add them to the crew, just don't make me regret this.\" The woman smiles as she stubs our her cigar and gives you a kiss on the cheek. \"Thanks handsome, I only bring the best so we should have no problems. Just call those numbers and tell them Sakura sent you. They'll know what to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh as you both toast your new business partnership and finish off your cigar. \"Something tells me Sakura isn't your real name.\" you say confidently. \"Mind telling me who I'll be working with on this little caper of ours?\" The woman smiles again as she swirls the champagne in her glass and gives you a sultry look. You could detect a bit more venom bleeding through her sweet exterior as she gave you a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I can't give you my real name just yet, maybe that'll change before this is over. \"Sakura\" is just a code word I use to confirm my identity to the people I work with, don't forget it. Now, if you'll excuse me I have to get going before the hotel expects anything is up. I'll be seeing you again very soon, handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a kiss on the cheek as she gets up from her chair and follow her over to the door. \"I'll work on squaring things away with the boss and give your people a call tomorrow. They'll be ready to move on such short notice?\" you ask as she begins heading down the hall. \"Like I said, I only work with the best.\" she replies with a wink before disappearing around a corner. An older guy in a business suit grins and gives you a thumbs up as you awkwardly wave to him and close your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess tomorrow will be a big day, better get some sleep.\" you note to yourself as you down the last of your champagne and head off to the bathroom. After a quick shower you change into some fresh clothes and climb into your luxury bed. After double-checking your schedule for tomorrow you quickly drift off to sleep. What does the next day have in store for you first?</span></div></div>",

Your boss had called ahead to tell you he'd be dropping by to collect his cut of the resort money early this month. You knew this wasn't about money though, since your boss was usually patient when it came time to pay the rent. No, there was something else your boss wanted to discuss with you face to face, otherwise he would have just waited until the next meeting to bring it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back in your chair and blow a ring of smoke as you finish counting the stack of bills on your desk. This had been a productive month, if nothing else Ryu wouldn't be able to complain about his employees work ethic. A knock then came from the door and distracted you from your thoughts of profits. \"Sorry for the interruption. May I come in, sir?\" came the voice of a yakuza guard through a two-way speaker near the door. You sigh and buzz him in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss here?\" you ask as you put away most of the cash on the desk and lock everything up. \"Yes, sir. He arrived just a minute ago and headed to the onsen, the private indoor one. He requests your presence immediately.\" the guard says with a bow as you put out your cigar and get up from the desk. \"Sure thing, its not polite to keep the boss man waiting.\" you smile as you pick up the money you had left out on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay here and lock the place up for me. I won't be coming back to the office tonight.\" you say cheerfully as you begin heading down the stairs. The man nodded and headed back to secure everything for the night. \"Thanks.\" you call back as you step off the last step and head out the front door of your luxury manor home. \"The big man usually saves personal visits for special occasions, I'm kinda excited to see what's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took you a few minutes to walk down the narrow stone pathway from the front of your home though the garden next to the main resort. Once you arrived at the onsen you find a young woman in a formal kimono waiting for you outside the front door. \"Good evening, sir. The boss is waiting for you in the private bath.\" she greeted as she opened the door for you and followed you inside. Before heading off to the locker room you hand the woman this months take and tell her to deliver it straight to the boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, sir. Have a good evening.\" she replies as you thank her and close the door. After storing your clothes in your private locker you head through the door to the hallway leading to the private indoor bath. The room wasn't particularly small, but it paled in comparison to the grand outdoor bath and hot springs that drew most of the Sakura Resort's business. Still, it couldn't be beat for privacy with its soundproof walls and expertly decorated interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting inside the large bath pool were three people, two women and a man along with two other men in suits standing near the door. The man sitting in the water was covered in tattoos from his neck to his feet and was wearing a pair of thin gold-rimmed pitch black sunglasses. Both of the two women bathing next to him were buxom and slender, one had almost as many tattoos as the man she was leaning on while the other was fair skinned without so much as a beauty mark. Each woman was attractive and young though the woman with tattoos was a bit older than her counterpart, looking to be in her late twenties or early thirties while the other looked to be barely eighteen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Micheal my friend. So good of you to join us on such short notice. Please have a seat, we've much business to discuss.\" Ryu said as he leaned back and put his arms around the women beside him. You flashed them both a smile. \"Isn't it against the rules to wear sunglasses in the onsen? Also, you sure you want me to join you in there? Your company might get... distracted...\" you reply slyly as you gently tug your bath towel loose. The two women giggled in admiration as Ryu let out a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can break a few of the rules when you own the place.\" Ryu said as he gestured for one of his men to bring refreshments. \"Now quit worrying about modesty and get in here already so we can talk.\" The women began laughing as you walked over and threw the towel off, which caused them to start laughing in a more awkward tone as you dipped into the water while they both blushed slightly. \"You ladies feel free to join me over here if you get cold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women smile as Ryu hugged them closer and lowered his glasses a little. \"Alright, playboy. If you're done joking around I need you to listen, or should I be trusting Dai with this job?\" The mention of your rival's name almost made you frown, but you managed to keep your cool and merely crossed your arms. \"Alright alright, boss man. Fun's over. I'm listening.\" you reply as you did your best to look serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Ryu replied as he took two highball glasses off a tray his guard had sat down near the edge of the bath. \"Truth be told, I doubt Daisuke could find his own ass if he fell in a toilet. The man has brawn and attitude... but no finesse or subtlety.\" Ryu laments as he pours some expensive imported rum into each glass and garnished them with a slice of lemon. \"I need my best man on this job. No fuck ups, you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell by the tone in his voice that this was something big you were about to discuss. \"I'm all ears, sir. What do you need done?\" you ask politely as a guard handed you a glass of rum. Ryu smiled and continued. \"Just last week I met with a man working for one of the bigger triads in china, Golden Ocean. You heard of them?\" You nodded your head and took a sip out of your glass. \"Good. I don't have to tell you how much it would benefit us to work with them, especially after most of our rivals failed to impress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow as you recalled the news you'd heard that Golden Ocean was expanding into japan. These guys didn't play around and were pretty ruthless... they could be a great ally or a deadly foe. \"You've made contact with them?\" you ask as you take another sip of your drink. \"Yes.\" Ryu answered as he folded his fingers together and leaned forward. \"This could be big, Micheal. We need the support right now, especially with how much expanding we've done in the past few months. We need to keep the pressure on the other yakuza.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you stretch your arms out and take a deep breath. \"I take it they want to set up a get together? You want me to run security for a little meet and greet?\" You take another long sip out of your drink as Ryu smiled back and nodded. \"Indeed, I just received a call from a man named Mr. Hong, he is a red pole for the Golden Ocean and answers directly to their leader. His brother, a fellow red pole who goes by \"Scarface\" wants to bring his daughter as a last minute guest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you reply with a smirk. \"Poor guy couldn't find a sitter for his kid so I'm gonna be stuck on babysitting duty? What's the little brat's name?\" Ryu let out a laugh as he relaxed in the warm water of the onsen. \"Mei Hong, she isn't a brat though. She's well behaved if her father is to be believed. Look, I don't expect you to like her, just get along. Put your pride aside and indulge her, take her on a shopping spree if she wants, see a movie, whatever. Just keep her safe and content. Can you do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a big sigh and finish off your drink. \"How can I say no boss? This is big, something that could put us on the map. I'm used to having more fun on the job, but screw it. If keeping the kid from taking a bullet puts us in her daddy's good graces I'll do it. Me and the guys won't let so much as a fly land on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyu smiled as he downed the last of his own drink and poured another. \"Excellent, you haven't disappointed me yet... I know you can do this. Their plane will be arriving in at noon tomorrow at a secret location. I'll make sure you get the address, now go ahead and retire for the night. You'll need to get up early to be on time to pick them up.\" You nod to your boss and give the two women one last wink before climbing out of the water and putting your towel back on. After sharing one last drink you headed back into the locker room to get changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting dressed you then head back to your manor house and enjoy a modest supper before going to bed. Tomorrow was going to be a big day for sure... one way or another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow should you prepare?</span></div></div>",

You figured it would be best to do the whole pick up and transport in stealth to make sure the girl stayed safe, a convoy of yakuza would be too much of a red flag and attract way too much attention. If you had some of your boys as backup and were careful things should go pretty smoothly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter selecting one of your more elegant and fashionable suits you head off to the bathroom for a quick shave and make sure you look presentable. You'd only have one chance at a first impression with these guys and you knew how important appearances were in situations like this. Getting the job done was only half the mission, if you didn't impress your new associates they might turn to someone else. That wouldn't be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing...\" you whisper confidently to yourself as you head out to meet the limo that pulled up to greet you. \"Hey Mike, get in and let's head out, don't want to keep the princess waiting for her carriage.\" the driver said with a smile as he rolled down the window to wave. You grinned as you leaned down to greet your friend. \"Hey Sai, are the others ready? They'll be expecting us in just a few more hours and I'd like to arrive early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSai nodded and unlocked the back doors on the limo. \"Yep, they'll be meeting us there. As soon as you get in we'll be ready to go.\" he replied as you open the door and climb in. \"Good work, Sai. You did have time to outfit this ride like I asked, right?\" you inquire as you stretch out your feet and relax a bit. \"Bulletproof glass windows, reinforced frame, upgraded engine... everything you told me to. Just wait til' our girl sees her escort for the day.\" Sai replied as he tapped the windshield. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both share a laugh as you set out for the airport to meet your new business partners. Sai turns on the radio and begins singing along to a new pop song that just got released as you look out at the scenery passing by just outside the window. You thought about what your boss Ryu had told you about the night before and carefully thought about what you'd do once you meet up with the girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been in Japan long enough to pick up on the culture and rules of being a yakuza, but triads were something you had little to no experience with. Would they be more like the SGY with an honor code and morals... or more like the mafia you left back in America, ruthless and fearsome? Maybe a bit of both? Whatever the case you'd have to be careful how you played your cards if you want to make some new friends instead of enemies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the limo pulled into the airport you straightened your tie and made sure everything in the limo was ready for your guests. \"Alright Sai, drop me off and get ready to pull back around when I come out with our new associates. We'll give em' the five star treatment and show them they made the right choice in trusting us.\" you instruct as Sai pulls up to the front sidewalk and comes to a stop. \"Sounds good, I'll be waiting. Don't take too long.\" Sai replied as he drove off and you turned to face the front doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go.\" you say with a sly smile as you walk into the main lobby. \"Hope you guys are ready.\"</span></div></div>",

How may I assist you today?\" You give her a smile and compliment her hair as you tell her about your friends flight arriving soon. \"Oh yes, a group of gentlemen in suits and sunglasses asked about that flight too. I believe it docked just a minute or so ago.\" she replies as you turn towards the terminal and whisper a curse under your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, my friends have lots of admirers.\" you reply quickly as you immediately head off to find the girl before any hired goons do. You couldn't run or do anything to raise suspicion, you just had to hope that you could find her before any rival triads or thugs do. As you approach the main gate you notice a group of men in suits arguing over which way they should go to find the correct arriving flight. \"I think my luck just changed for the better.\" you whisper as you head over to greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, gents. I overheard you debating over the arrival of a flight.\" you say casually as you give them a friendly smile and wave as you approach. \"I believe the flight you are looking for arrives on the other side of the main lobby near the northeastern gate. Better hurry, it docks in just a few minutes.\" The men take turns looking at each before one of them mutters a quick word of thanks as they rush off towards the direction you just came from. Looks like they bought your lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly move past a crowd of people heading for the lobby and began scanning the passengers for anyone who liked like they could be from the Golden Ocean triad. \"Excuse me, sir... are you with the SGY by any chance?\" comes a feminine voice from behind you. You quickly turn around to see a young woman in a stylish qipao standing behind you next to two men in casual suits. \"Are you with the GOT?\" you reply as you take a quick look around to make sure no one was listening in on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman nods as she goes to introduce herself but you quickly grab her hand and instruct her to follow you. \"Wait, where are we going?\" she asks in a surprised and nervous tone as you try to blend in with the exiting crowd of people leaving the airport. \"Sorry, but not now. I'll explain once we get out of here, but you're in grave danger.\" you whisper as you text Sai to pull the limo around to the front exit and be ready to go in one minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure about this?\" one of the bodyguards asks as you escort the girl past a group of businessmen heading towards a coffee shop. \"Yes, I'm Micheal. I'm one of your new business partners. Look, we can talk once we get out of here, for now you'll need to just trust me.\" you reply as you check your phone. Sai sent a confirmation text back and would meet you outside. \"Good, we're almost there.\" you think to yourself as you renter the front lobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to head outside the goons from before spot you and begin running through the crowd to catch up. \"Hey, he's got the girl! Stop him!\" one yells as he draws a knife and begins closing the distance between you. Better think of something quick...</span></div></div>",

She was a tourist visiting from Europe, a college aged woman in her mid twenties who ran into you on her way out of the Sakura Resort courtyard. You had been in a hurry to deposit the spoils of a recent job into your safe, but you somehow always managed to find some time for the ladies. The fact that she looked like she just walked out of a playboy shoot didn't hurt either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you own this place?\" she asked as she snuggled up to you in her tight string bikini while you poured yourself a glass of scotch. \"Yep, well not entirely, I must confess. I run the place but I work for a guy who keeps the lights on and the springs steamy.\" you reply as the woman laughed and admired the view from your upper deck. \"He must work you pretty hard if he trusts you to take care of a beautiful place like this.\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a chuckle as you remembered your first introduction to your new boss during a meeting between the yakuza and the american mob. \"You don't know the half of it.\" you laugh as you take a sip of your drink. \"He's definitely a good guy though. I'm glad I work for him, though some of his other employees are a real pain in the ass.\" The woman chuckles and leans in for a kiss when your cell phone rings from the nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh you get out of the water and dry off your hand before flipping the phone open and checking the I.D. Sure enough, it was your boss sending you a lead about a new job opportunity with a juicy payday. You sighed again as the woman crossed her arms and took a sip of your scotch. \"It's about work, isn't it?\" she asked in an annoyed tone. You nodded your head and began drying off. \"Sorry, you know how it is. Boss man cracks the whip and I gotta get my ass in gear. We got a surprise contract and I need to head into the office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman frowned for a moment before giving you a resigned smile. \"Yeah, I know how it is. Bosses can be real jerks sometimes.\" She sighs as you head inside the house to get dressed. \"Do you want my number so we can continue this little date sometime or should I just head out too?\" she asks as she leans back in the tub to take in the view of the mountains. \"How's the day after tomorrow sound? I should be free this weekend.\" you call out as you pick a suit from your closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman rolls her eyes and grins as she takes another sip of your scotch. \"Sure, I'm in town until next week. How's eight sound?\" she calls from outside as you head back over to say goodbye. \"It's a date honey, see you then.\" you reply as you give her a light kiss on the cheek and take a quick swig out of your bottle of scotch. \"Feel free to stay here as long as you like and help yourself to anything in the kitchen. Security will see you out when you're ready to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman thanks you for being such a gentleman and goes back to relaxing while you head downstairs to meet up with your driver. This job was big, a whole shipment of goods would be arriving in the harbor tomorrow and if you planned this out right you could walk away with a literal kings ransom. You climbed into a limo as the boss called up again to discuss the details of the job. Apparently, the boat was set to arrive at the docks in the early hours of the morning with a crew of armed guards and possibly other security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you talked you slowly began to formulate a plan of action...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You sigh to yourself as you walk through Tokyo's red light district in search of employees for your boss' newest enterprise: a fancy love hotel. Ryu had gotten the place off of a man who loved to gamble who came up short with his more recent payments and had the bright idea to hire actual prostitutes to get an advantage over the competition in the area. Unfortunately, this job was proving to be a bit harder than you originally anticipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been to five separate brothels, all of which had reasonably cute girls, but they were all either uninterested in working for a yakuza or simply not up to the standards your boss had laid out for you. They had to be clean, no STDs, no addictions and had to pass a high standard of beauty. You had also been instructed to keep an eye out for girls who could tend to... particular requests from high profile customers. That would be fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hated the idea of returning to the boss empty handed and telling him you failed, but at this rate you'd be out here for weeks without landing a single new hire. You chuckle to yourself as you walk into yet another brothel and are greeted by women in bikinis. \"The boss always did have high standards, but even I'm not this picky...\" You ask the women a few questions as they give you a lap dance and offer them the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I already agreed to work here for the next year or so, my boss would destroy my reputation if I went back on our deal.\" one of the girls replied with a regretful smile. \"Same for most of the rest of us, we earn good money and can't afford to jeopardize it.\" You rub your forehead as you hand them each a ten thousand yen note and thank them for their time. This was getting pretty frustrating. With a brief yawn you decide to take a quick break and head over to a nearby bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a bottle of good sake, please.\" you call over to the bartender as she wipes a glass. \"Right away, sir!\" comes the cheerful reply. You light up a cigar and put another ten thousand yen note on the table while the bartender gets your drink. \"Drowning your sorrows, sir? We have some stronger stuff if you'd like?\" she asks as she puts the bottle and a glass in front of you. A laugh escapes your lips as you exhale a cloud of smoke and begin pouring your drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, ha, nothing like that... I'm just having a hard time finding suitable clients for my boss. He needs me to find some workers and I haven't had any luck all night, just thought I'd take a break.\" you reply with a smile. The woman quickly looks around to make sure no one else can hear her before leaning in. \"You don't need... sex workers, do you?\" she whispers in a hushed tone. This gets your attention and you nod your head as you exhale a puff of smoke. \"Yeah, I guess so.\" you whisper back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For 100,000 yen I might be able to set you up with a guy who can find what you need. All his girls and guys are clean, no diseases, no human trafficking and no sexual hang ups. What do you say?\" she offers. You take a deep breath and down a large sip of your drink. \"What's the catch? You're asking a lot of money for some guy I've never even met.\" you finally reply as the bartender writes down an address on a napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's risky, but 100,000 yen is half of what I normally charge for his address. His workers won't come cheap, but you won't find better anywhere in Japan. I'm offering this price because I know you can afford it and you'll provide me and my boss lots of money. If I'm lying... hey, it's only 100,000 yen, or you can go back to skimming the local brothels for amateurs, your call handsome.\" She then folds the napkin up and holds it out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another sip of your drink as you think over her offer. You didn't have much money to spare and she was asking for a pretty huge amount... but the idea of going back out there and spending the rest of the night going to various sex clubs wasn't very appealing either...</span></div></div>",

The woman frowns and withdraws the napkin from your reach. \"Sorry, honey. If you're that broke I doubt you'd be able to afford anything my boss is offering. Maybe come back when you got more cash.\" she replies as she pours herself a glass of sake from your bottle. \"The offer is on the table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou groan as you count up how much cash you had on you at the moment. You could definitely afford the price, though it wouldn't leave you anywhere near enough to keep searching brothels and clubs and there was no way you were bringing any of your own money into this. \"Look, it's not that I can't pay... I just don't have enough on me at the moment.\" you reply with a smile. \"How about 75,000 or maybe 80,000? I can afford that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman merely shakes her head and stuffs the napkin into her cleavage. \"I'm already giving you a discount at 100,000 yen, I can't go lower than that. However, I do have a task I could use some help with. I've set aside about 45,000 yen as a reward that I can pay from my personal fund. Do the job and I'll knock the price down to an even 50,000 yen, sound good?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and take a long drag off your cigar as you consider your options. You didn't like the idea of running errands for someone you just met, but the thought of going on an endless slog through Tokyo's red light district wasn't very appealing either. You had already been to several places already and none of them stacked up to Ryu's demanding specifications. This bartender and her boss might be your only shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've got some free time. Tell me a little more about the job and maybe I'll take care of it for you.\" you reply as you stub out your cigar and finish off your drink. \"If you're only offering 50,000 yen as a reward it can't be too hard.\" The bartender smiles as she leans over the counter and takes a sip of her drink. \"Alright then, I actually think you might be perfect for this job, but we'll see, won't we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pour yourself a fresh drink and listen to her story. \"Let's see, when did this all start...\" she began as she rubbed her chin. \"I think it was about three or four months back. These prostitutes started robbing gullible customers all around the red light district. They'd promise them a good time and then steal all of their money and valuables once their clothes were off. These chicks are most likely part of a gang, they're all pretty tough and have kicked the shit out of anyone who tried to fight back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallow a large gulp of your drink as you listen to her continue. This was getting interesting. \"At first nobody really minded since most of the victims where drunks and losers, in fact some of us bartenders actually made a bit of extra profit from guys who wanted to drown their sorrows. That only lasted a few weeks though, and now me and several of my friends are losing profits because fewer and fewer people come around here for fear of getting robbed. No one has died or anything, but people are still worried about losing all their stuff to these gals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" you say with a light chuckle. \"Like you said, these ladies are probably either part of a gang or working for someone else. No way ordinary sex workers would be able to pull something like this off.\" The bartender nods her head as she finishes off her drink and lets out a sigh. \"Probably, the cops either don't care or were bought off, I doubt they'd take this long to deal with the problem if they were really trying, something's up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can do this. Find the girls, get them to stop what they're doing and maybe find out who's behind this in the first place.\" you reply with a grin. \"It's a deal. Just tell me where to start.\" The bartender breathes a sigh of relief and writes down a new address on a napkin and hands it to you. \"Thanks, I was honestly worried about this problem getting out of hand. Here's the address of one of their more recent victims, poor bastard lost his wife's wedding ring and half the price of a new car. He'll help you get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the napkin and check the address, which was thankfully close by. \"Alright then, I think I'll head out. Thanks for the info.\" you say as you get up to leave. \"Good luck, if you need any further help I'll be here all night.\" the bartender replies with a wave. In just a few minutes you were back out in the crowded streets as a light rain began to fall. Time to make your first move...</span></div></div>",

She has short black hair, pale skin and smokey grey eyes. She favors simple clothing such as tank tops, track pants, jeans and plain shirts and dislikes makeup. Her arms and part of her torso are decorated with extensive and intricate tattoos detailing her past, family ties and love of explosives. She tends to wear light jewelry such as earrings and necklaces from time to time as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHome Base: Crown Castle, a large abandoned military base high atop a remove cliff in rural Australia. The base isn't much to look at but makes an excellent place to field test new explosives and gadgets. Outside the ruins of the base is a large three story house where Samantha lives at. The place is stocked with all manor of modern luxuries such as a large flatscreen in the living room and a botanical garden on the upper balcony. It also has a large basement equipped with a panic room and armory. Lastly, there is a staff of six butlers, six maids, two chefs, two repairmen and two mechanics who maintain everything. These servants are all trained in self defense and and have their own private quarters outside the main house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkills/Perks: A master of everything explosive, be it cherry bombs or warheads. Samantha has dedicated her life to researching newer and better ways to make things go boom. It addition to knowing how to make bombs she has the knowledge to disarm or delay them as well. Somewhat unexpectedly she also has an interest in botanical research and is often found experimenting on plants. Through much research and hard work she has uncovered many new types of organic weaponry, such as nonlethal grenades infused with plant extracts that can paralyze anyone caught in the blast or infused plant matter bombs that create a bigger boom through a unique blend of chemicals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeaknesses: She's a bit of a one trick pony compared to the other mercenary's, even if it's a really good trick. Almost all of her combat related skills involves explosives in some way, which makes her less versatile compared to the others. She knows how to shoot different types of guns and has learned some martial arts, but both skill sets are no where near the level of professionals. She does have a knack for using sniper rifles, but its the only type of gun she has any real skill with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Assets: An advanced bomb suit made to resist extreme heat, shrapnel, radiation and forceful impacts which renders low grade explosives useless and greatly weakens stronger ones. (The suit is very heavy though, and hinders movement when worn.) A large laboratory filled with chemicals and supplies to make homemade bombs and other useful things, such as explosive ammo or high yield blasting clay. A garage stocked with two high performance sports cars and a motorcycle and a helipad for quick extraction. A hidden private jet about two miles away from the main house for stealthy escapes. Finally, a massive explosives storeroom stocked with everything from frag grenades and C4 to thermite and fireworks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting Contracts<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurn It Down - A rich man who lost most of his fortune to his cheating ex-wife and her lawyer boyfriend wants revenge, plain and simple. He is willing to pay most of his remaining savings to anyone who can infiltrate his old manor house on the edge of Sydney and burn it to the ground. Smash the vases, tear the paintings, burn the rugs and blow up the car collection. He wants his wife and her lover ruined for what they did to him and intends to make them suffer. While he won't mind if they are killed in the chaos he has put aside an extra sum of cash if they make it though the destruction alive. Pay: $3,000,000 - $5,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Mushroom Cloud Has A Silver Lining - A terrorist group has recently come into a nuclear warhead that they managed to purchase off the black market and are transporting it past the coast of japan. An unidentified government official would like it if some freelance mercenaries could acquire the warhead for him without any other nations finding out about it. This job will be fairly risky since the terrorists are moderately well armed and unpredictable. Ultimately, completion of this contract will come down to a hard choice... do you hand over a nuke to a shady government agent for a massive payday, dispose of it... or keep it for yourself? Pay: $1,000,000 - $250,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsence Of Evidence - A criminal and his gang have recently been arrested in one of the biggest busts in recent memory. Drug running, arms trafficking and even assassinations... these guys are going away for a long time if the evidence taken from their hideout makes it to court. Luckily for them a dirty cop on the inside accepted a payoff to put out their contract for you to find. The job is simple: destroy the evidence room at the police H.Q. before it can be transported to a more secure location. The guy doesn't care how this gets done or who gets in the way, the evidence has to be disposed of in its entirety. Your call how much innocent blood you want to spill to make this happen. Pay: $5,000,000 - $10,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBombs On A Plane - Some rich businessman has landed in some hot water after a controversial decision he made cost his company over half of their yearly profits. Rather than outright fire him someone has rigged his personal private jet with explosives that are set to detonate if the plane either shuts off or goes below a certain altitude. The businessman has refused to contact the police and insists that his jet must be saved at all costs. Fortunately, the plane had just refueled before takeoff and will pass over Australia within the hour. If you hurry you can probably make contact before anyone gets hurt. The businessman has already promised a hefty reward for anyone who saves him, which he'll happily increase if they can also save his beloved jet. Pay: $50,000,000 - $100,000,000<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAir, Ground And All Around - A wealthy scientist needs volunteers to test her new missile defense system to see how it stacks up to the competition. Sadly, her reputation for playing with unstable compounds and causing disastrous side effects has driven off most potential assistants. If someone could help her get the kinks out of her new toy she'd probably offer them a hefty reward... and maybe even give them a prototype for themselves. Pay: $30,000,000 - $50,000,000</span></div></div>",

After an early morning testing out explosives you were happy to have some time to yourself but didn't want to waste the whole day without getting some progress towards clearing your debt. You still couldn't believe that you'd have to come up with a billion dollars, and soon... unless you wanted trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of catching up on current events you noticed a potentially lucrative contract from a man who wanted revenge on his ex and her lover. Turns out they both screwed him out of nearly his entire fortune, including his house and most of his possessions. Now he wants it all destroyed and is willing to pay out what he has left to anyone who can make it happen. The only requirement is the complete destruction of the property and all assets contained within... the furniture, the cars, the silverware, the electronics, the windows, the kitchen sink... everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you read over the details and finished off your drink. The money was a bit lower than what you would have liked but its not every day you get to destroy an entire mansion filled with valuables. The guy even offered to throw in some extra green if you allowed the cheating wife and her new husband to live and experience the pain of losing everything. It was pretty vicious, but you were already struggling to decide what toys to bring with you on your trip to Sydney.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou texted a quick confirmation to the man that you had accepted the contract and would be heading out within the hour. After he replied back with the address you head over to your armory to gear up and prepare. This would be a loud job no doubt, which means cops and maybe other forms of security would be an obstacle.

If you went in raising seven flavors of hell the cops and maybe even the SWAT team would be on the scene in no time. Nothing you couldn't handle, but a real pain in the ass to deal with. Instead it would be better to do this covertly, at least at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pack up some thermite, C4 plastic explosives, a remote detonator, a revolver and a compact SMG and change into some more appropriate clothing. With your light combat armor you'd have the freedom to move around quickly and silently while also being protected from low grade firearms and explosives. It wouldn't save you from a big explosion or sniper rounds, but it would keep you protected from minor annoyances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you had everything ready you headed out to meet your pilot and planned a course of action. You would infiltrate the grounds stealthily and plant some remote charges on important structural columns around the main property. Once you were clear you would then detonate the explosives and level the entire house in one go. The plan was foolproof but required some careful timing if you wanted to avoid dealing with law enforcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive in Sydney with about an hour of daylight left and check into a hotel for the evening. Tomorrow you would put your plan into action and make your escape before anyone knew what was going on. All that remained for tonight was a good amount of sleep and a big paycheck once your contract was completed. You quickly doze off dreaming of dollar signs and burning manor houses as the night stretches on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next morning you feel completely refreshed and ready to get to work. After checking out of your hotel you make your way to the address you had been given and scope the place out from across the street. The whole property was big and extravagant as you had expected, with a massive front yard lined with gardens and fountains. It was so beautiful it made you all the more eager to blow it to kingdom come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak past the guards standing near the driveway with ease and quickly move around to the back of the house. An oblivious guard walks right past you as he heads over to water the flowers and you make your way to the back door. Your first instinct was to head inside through the ground floor but after taking a closer look at your surroundings a few other ideas came to mind. After taking a moment to consider your options you quickly moved on to the next phase of your infiltration.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You then pull yourself over the rail as the guard below heads back inside after watering the flowers, luckily he didn't spot you sneak in through the open door. Once you make it inside the bedroom you take a quick look around to make sure you're alone and notice a lot of valuables lying around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have any room for paintings or furniture... but there are probably a few trinkets I can grab for some extra cash.\" you think to yourself as you head over to a cabinet in the corner of the room and begin searching it for valuables. Aside from some fine porcelain and other fragile junk you found nothing worth taking so you moved on to a large ornately decorated chest at the foot of the bed and used a bit of thermite to burn through the lock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pop the chest open and discover several jewelry boxes, expensive knick knacks and a few locked cases. After spending a good ten minutes looting everything you had room for you were ready to head out and get on with the job. Along with some necklaces, rings and cold hard cash you had found a rare coin collection that would draw in a huge sum if you could find a proper fence to take it off your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a guard making his rounds to pass by the upstairs door and slowly move out into the upstairs hallway when you hear his footsteps trail off in another direction. \"Looks like its clear, time to get to work!\" you smile cheerfully as you withdraw a C4 charge from your explosives bag and attach it to the back of a statue where it wouldn't be spotted.\"One down, about a dozen to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully creep down the hallway and locate a sturdy looking support structure near an alcove filled with pottery and modern art. \"I hate to be a critic, but these works would look a look better burnt to embers in a giant ash heap.\" you joke as you rig up a few thermite charges and place another C4 package on the back of the support structure. \"When this bad boy goes off everything in this area will be incinerated. It's a shame I can't take any of it with me but the pay I'm expecting for this job will be a nice compensation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully move around the upper floors and duck past a few more patrolling guards as you finish getting things set up. Once half of your explosives were set up you headed for the staircase to finish up with the ground floor when you come across two security guards talking while sitting on a sofa near the guest room. As you listen in you hear them talk about some valuables being moved into a safe room somewhere on the basement level of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two get up to resume their duties you pause to think about your next move. Hitting the safe room would take a lot of time and would probably use up a lot of your remaining equipment, but there was definitely some real nice stuff locked up in there. You check your supplies and see that aside from a few more C4 charges all you had left was some spare thermite. Was it worth the risk? Or was finishing your main job more important?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could always call in some support to deliver some supplies or back up, but that tended to get expensive and you would have to pay for the help whether you got into the room or not. What's your next move?</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be three main entrances, the two front doors near the sidewalk in front of the building, the rear entrance facing the main parking lot and a small side door that was likely intended for janitors or other workers. Getting inside wouldn't be too hard, but the fact that you had no idea where the evidence room was posed a small problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building wasn't really huge, but still big enough that it would likely take some searching to find where you needed to go. That would make a stealth approach pretty hard if you didn't carefully plan ahead but just going in guns blazing would attract a lot of attention and make it a chore just to get close to the evidence room. You sigh and step away from the window as you try to think. You didn't bring many supplies with you since this was such a small job but you wonder if maybe you should contact someone to help you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pay for this job wasn't bad but it wasn't really great either and it would be a pain to share a cut of it with someone else. You pull up a chair as you unzip the duffel bag on the table and began rummaging through its contents. You had brought most of the supplies you need for small explosives and utilities along with a pair of 9mm handguns and a grenade pistol you had developed. The thing would be hard to conceal and only held a single round but it made up for it by being quick to reload and being able to blow a door clean off its hinges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should have brought something a bit higher tech?\" you muse to yourself as you take inventory of your ammo. \"Nah, the big stuff is too expensive for a job like this. I'll just have to be careful how I plan this out.\" You got up and grabbed a cold soda out of the fridge as you came up with an idea that would help you clear the evidence locker. Once you were done you hide the 9mm handguns under your clothes and slip the grenade pistol into a large purse you had brought along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also take the supplies you would need from the duffel bag and then draw up a quick plan of escape once your mission was complete. Once everything was ready you head downstairs and hop onto the motorcycle you had rented for this job and drive over to the police HQ.

With a smile you thanked the butler and answered the cellphone he handed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man on the other end was a panicked mess who stuttered and gasped at nearly every other word out of his mouth. He was a well-connected business man who had apparently stepped on the wrong toes somewhere down the line and was now facing a deadly bomb attached to his private jet. His assistants had zero luck disarming it and calling the authorities wasn't possible for whatever reason. That's where you come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy wanted you to fly out and save him, along with his cargo and his plane if at all possible. Apparently, he had something very valuable on board that he couldn't stand to part with and wants saved at all costs. In exchange, he's offering a massive reward for his safe rescue and the salvation of his personal jet by any means necessary. It would be a pretty tough job and time was definitely a factor... but the cash would be well worth the hassle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen intently as the man gives you as much information about his situation as he can. He was now passing over Australia and would be flying through a nearby region within an hour or so. If the fuel held out you would have roughly five to six hours to save the businessman, disarm or remove the bomb and hopefully save the plane. Challenging, certainly, but not impossible, especially for someone with your skill set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll begin preparing immediately.\" you reply as you put away your tools. \"Tell your pilot to stay on course, I'll intercept and see what I can do. See you within the hour.\" With that you hung up just as the businessman blurted out a quick \"THANK YOU!\" on the other end. With a sigh you head outside to the airfield and tell your pilot to be ready to move as soon as you returned with your gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded in confirmation and lit up a cigarette as he began checking to make sure the aircraft was ready to fly. The thing was an old refurbished fighter from WWII when it was first put into action but your talented mechanics had made sure it stayed competitive and up to date in today's modern world. It wasn't the fastest thing in the sky but it was extremely well-rounded and could get the job done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing out of your work clothes you began gearing up to be ready to move as soon as possible. Normally, you liked to do a bit of planning before taking a job, but time wasn't on your side right now. You'd have to quickly and carefully choose your gear and then head out. Risks and many variables still remained unknown, though hostiles and other threats seemed likely. What kind of approach should you take?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't bring all of your tools or any heavy guns but a balanced selection of equipment meant you could deal with any complications that popped up. After changing into a specialized wingsuit and packing up your supplies you headed back out to greet the pilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to the clock we have about 45 minutes to intercept this guy and secure his plane!\" you shout at at the pilot as he hops into the cockpit of his tiny fighter. \"Get us up in the air, we'll only have one shot at this and I don't want to miss it. I've got the coordinates and other stuff, but we need to get moving.\" The pilot nods his head as he fires up the propeller and begins cruising down the runway. \"Aye-aye, captain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soar off into the sky and marvel at the beauty of the surrounding landscape from the passenger seat of the small but smooth flying WWII fighter. As you flew off towards the point of interception you began to carefully formulate a plan of action. It sucks that you didn't have more time but half an hour or so should be good enough to pull this job off. The hardest part would be right at the start... if you could get past that you'd be all set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to do this safely, you'd only have one way to securely enter the plane without risking setting off the bomb. If the doors of the plane connect to a fail safe then opening the door would only cause a premature detonation. Instead you'd have to deploy your wingsuit as the plane approached, snag it with a special heavy duty grappling device, cut open a small hole in the exterior of the body, slip inside and then seal the hole back up. You'd have to do all of this in a time frame of about 30-40 seconds. Not exactly easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you arrive over the tiny town where the plane was due to pass you had the pilot survey the area for anything that could affect the mission. After flying in a few circles you breathed a small sigh of relief that no enemy aircraft or ground troops were spotted. The last thing you needed right now was a bunch of guys shooting at you while you tried to jump from plane to plane thousands of feet above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough your pilot caught sight of an approaching aircraft flying in from the northeast. That was definitely your target! \"Right on time.\" you grinned as you prepared yourself for the jump. No way was this going to be easy, even for a professional like yourself. Time to give your pilot his final order as he gets in range...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You have a debt to repay. One billion dollars. There is a price on your head until you can earn the cash to pay off the corrupt government that loaned you the money to get started in this business. You are a mercenary, a soldier of fortune who earns vast wealth by taking contracts from shady and influential people. Theft, vandalism, kidnapping, smuggling, destruction and even assassination are all on the table for the right price. Will you be a knight in shining armor cleaning up the messes left by weaker warriors or a heartless killer who only cares about the cash for a job well done? The choice is yours, but one thing about you is certain... you are a professional. Time to get paid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Adult content is fine, but don't get too extreme. This is an action adventure style of story, not an erotica or stand up comedy routine. Don't go absolutely crazy with the sex scenes and jokes. Heavy amounts of cursing and some moderately descriptive sexual content is okay. Don't add anything you wouldn't see in an R rated movie. Comedic characters are allowed but most people should be fairly serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You are free to come up with your own story and customize the characters a bit, but don't change their personality. All of the mercenaries are flexible, but also have their own strengths and weaknesses. A stealth expert character doesn't have to always use stealth for example, but their first thought shouldn't be to go in guns blazing and screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Keep things fairly realistic. Mild sci-fi elements like satellite orbital guns and VTOLs are fine but nothing like aliens or superpowers. I'll also allow minor cybernetics like artificial limbs and eyes, but not giant mechs or super advanced power armor. (If you wouldn't see it in Deus Ex or Payday 2 don't add it here.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Violence, gore and torture is fine, but try to keep it realistic. People shouldn't explode into chunks from anything less than bombs or rockets. Exploding heads and severed limbs are fine if the caliber of bullet or weapon is high enough though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. As a soldier of fortune you are expected to gain vast amounts of wealth and equipment, but keep things within reason and try to pace yourself with the story. Remember that most of your cash should go in storage to pay back your loan. With that said, you are allowed to spend some of the money you get on things like new properties, hideouts, vehicles and new gadgets and weapons. Just don't go giving yourself a private island and aircraft carrier during the first few chapters. This interactive is about rising to the top, not starting there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. After completing a contract the mercenary returns to their base to store however much cash they got and plan a new contract. As such, make sure you keep the amount of stored cash updated upon each return. The goal is to eventually reach 1 billion ($1,000,000,000) dollars, which enables the character to conclude their story. Always make sure the amount of cash earned is proportional to the difficulty of the contract and how well the character completed their objectives. Don't rush to the end either, try to keeps things going for at least 50-75 chapters before concluding things. Individual contracts can last as long as you like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. I Have made a new interactive for all reader created characters, please use it if you have an idea for an original merc. Thank you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1947792-Mercenary-New-Roads\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1947792-Mercenary-New-Roads</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n8.
