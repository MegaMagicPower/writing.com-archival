            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to Haven Healthcare.  It's technically a nursing home, but we're not going anywhere near the elderly residents here.  They mostly stay in thier rooms anyway, and we don't want to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're a member of the kitchen staff, most likely a male.  But if you're a girl, that can be arranged.  Let's meet the staff, shall we?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boys:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris, 21- A buff, white boy wanna be rapper with big dreams of joining G-Unit.  He's big and tough and considered by many to the cutest boy in the department.  His head is shaved and he has a short beard starting from his sideburns.  He had a brief romance with Ashley, which ended when she was too shallow and too bitchy, and she claimed he wasn't her type because he was \"too nice\".  He hasn't endeared himself to Ashley's best friend Lindsey, either.  But recently rehired Alexa seems to want him bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJarred, 21- While Chris is the \"cutest\", Jarred is Number Two.  He's thin and athletic and a bit soft-spoken but he's definetly a tough guy.  Long face, bright eyes and short blonde hair.  Jarred is currently having regular sex with Erica, though they have yet to commit to a full relationship.  He hates Ashley and Lindsey, and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate, 23- Short and stocky, Nate isn't going to win any beauty contests, but he is considered by many(especially many of the adult female staff members at the facility) to be very handsome.  Nate thinks Alexa is really cute and is turned on by Ashley and Lindseys' bitchy attitude, but the one he really likes is Erica.  Marissa, a recently hired teenager, slapped Nate with a sexual harassment charge, which he was innocent of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil, 18- Energetic comedian type, Phil takes nothing seriously.  He used to date Erica and currently flirts a lot with Marissa, who wants him bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan(AKA Harry), 17- By far the most unpopular staff member, Harry is lazy and stupid and very ugly.  He's entirely too hairy(hence the nickname...however, he also resembles an ugly, hairy stocky Harry Potter) and a little lecherous.  He works with his best friend Brian(who isn't going to be in the story) and Brians' girlfriend Monique, whom Harry secretly adores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDave, 21- The youngest cook at Haven, Dave is big, strong and a little angry at times.  He's very soft-spoken and is pretty easy-going, but when he's angry he's dangerous.  His two sisters both work at the facility, as does his Brother.  Had a few dates with Noor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Girls:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley, 19- A bitch, likes trouble and talks a lot of trash when she's not sleeping with...well, anyone she wants.  Very pretty brunette with blonde streaks, bright eyes.  Very Gangsta.  Had an affair with Chris, and goes off and on with how she feels about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLindsey, 21- Another Bitch, Ashley's best friend.  A little overweight, but still pretty with bright hazel eyes and jet black hair. She despises Chris and Jarred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexa, 19- Short and pudgy(but natural) brunette.  Like Ashley but less honest about it.  Bright Hazel eyes, light brown hair. She currently wants to seduce Chris.  She's also unaware that Nate harbors a small crush on her.  She's very close to Erica and Hannah(listed further down)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa, 17- Bright green eyes and a developing teenaged body.  She's jailbait, however, and slapped a sexual harassment charge on Nate.  Very cruel minded and sexually premiscuous.  Wants to get Phil into bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily, 17- Marissas' best friend, Emily is a much better worker and seems nicer than the cruel Marissa, but that's uncertain, since many haven't gotten to know her.  She's got dirty blonde hair and is very pretty with big lips and even bigger boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica, 20- Erica has been around Haven for a while.  She's very pretty but very slight.  She has blonde hair down to her shoulders which she often wears up in a ponytail or bun.  She's currently dating Jarred(at least from her perspecive mostly) and is unaware of Nate's crush on her.  She used to date Phil for a long time, and is very close with Alexa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoor, 20- Noor is a very tall, almost model-like girl with middle eastern decent.  She's very pretty but materialistic and a little snobby, mostly coming from her wealthy parents.  Her best friend is Katie from Housekeeping, and she is madly in love with Chris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonique, 16- Monique is a tall, pretty-in-an-odd-way girl with tan skin and a large nose.  She's thin and favors gothic-style clothes and the like.  Her boyfriend Brian has worked there for a long time, and she's unaware of Harry's intense crush on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin, 24- Erin is Dave's sister.  She's a little overweight, but not as much as Lindsey, and is passionate but very nice and laid back.  She has a pretty smile and eyes, but her forceful personality is what really makes her attractive.  Dislikes Ashley, Lindsey, Marrisa and Emily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Girls from around the Facility:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly, 30- Shelly is a beautiful woman of Italian decent who is currently the human resources manager of Haven.  She's very beautiful and very playful.  She seems nice, but might have a mean streak....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie, 20- Katie is a larger girl, very tall and broad, but she still has a girl-next-door beauty that makes her very well liked.  She has a large, goofy smile and blushes easily, which brings out the color in her big green eyes.  She's a housekeeper at the facility.  She's also Noor's best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa, 31- A very pretty but petite woman, Lisa is the Assistant Director of Nursing at Haven.  She has big yellowish-green eyes and a big smile and shoulder length wavy brown hair.  She's known to be a bit of a brat when she doesn't get her way and can be very rude, as if everyone she meets is beneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie, 31- Marissa's Mother and Lisa's best friend.  Jamie is a tall, statuesque woman with short red hair and bright green cat eyes like her Daughter.  Lisa is considered rude, but Jamie is far ruder.  She acts like she's Queen of the World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeghan, 22- Meghan is a friend of Ashley and Lindsey and is an amazingly beautiful young woman who works at the receptionist.  She favors pants suits and high-heeled boots, but also pumps.  She has long straight black hair and the general look of a model, moving with grace.  She's known to be a slut, and more than a little bratty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah, 20- Hannah is Dave's younger sister.  She's very energitic and personable, making her a valuable member of the activities staff.  She has frizzy brownish blonde hair and likes to wear comfortable, casual clothing, and every day she wears the same gray fuzzy clogs. Occasionally, she dislikes Alexa(and sometimes they're best friends) and is very close with Dave and Erin.  She's also a close friend of Phil and Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, then...who are you?</span></div></div>",

Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not...!\" Chris rapped along with Eminem in the dish room, tossing dishes into the soapy water.  So what if he had to do dishes alone, doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.  It was only temporary anyway, he was gonna be a huge rapper.  He'd made his own name, Dub-CK and he was gonna be HUGE!  He opened up the dishwasher and pulled free some dishes and turned to put them on the drying shelf.  As he did this, still nodding his head to the beat, he tripped on a fallen dishwasher wrack and fell down hard, causing his CD to skip and a breif shock to pass through his body from the wall plug.  There was a bright blue flash and then he was lying face down on the wet ground. He then stood up and noticed that the dishroom had gotten bigger.  A lot bigger!  He could only be...</span></div></div>",

He then heard some loud booming noises and a pair of thunder-like voices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, THAT WAS WICKED FUNNY!  DID YOU SEE HARRY'S FACE WHEN MONIQUE WAS KISSING BRIAN YESTERDAY?

He followed those massive shoes up past her tone legs in tan khakis to his bare-midrift and peirced belly button just below the hem of her tight pink shirt.  Her huge face was above it, and he was both terrified and in awe.  He always thought Ashley was hot(he wouldn't have slept with her otherwise...), but now she was amazing.  Like a Goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CHRIS?  WHERE ARE YOU?\" Ashley's voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT, HE'S NOT IN THERE?\" Lindsey's thunderous voice called from the other room.  He heard louder booms and turned around to see Lindsey walk in on the other side of the room, her huge tattered white sketchers slamming monstrously on the tiled floor of the dishroom that currently acted as his world.  Lindsey looked as if she might stop, but instead she continued to move in his direction!  Those huge white sneakers slammed the ground, shaking him and knocking him onto his ass.  He shouted as her massive right foot smacked hard before him as she reached to pull a rack of dishes from the still open dishwasher.  \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'D JUST TAKE OFF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, MAYBE HE'S OUT SMOKING OR SOMETHING.  OR MAYBE HE HAD TO DELIVER SOME FOOD SOMEWHERE.\" Ashley said, shifting her left foot forward and putting one hand on her hip.  She then reached down and absently played with her belly-button ring, something that had always made Chris turned on.  But he quickly turned to see the gigantic white sneaker of Lindsey beside him.  Up past her meaty legs and navy blue work shirt was her massive head with long black hair and her chubby red face.  He never liked Lindsey, but now he was terrified.  He'd always given her an attitude, but now he was like a bug at her feet.  Smaller than that, probably, since he'd have to jump and pull himself just to reach the toe of her shoe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DAMMIT, I WAS HOPING TO GO HOME EARLY, BUT NOW WE'LL HAVE TO FINISH HIS DISHES.\" Lindsey shouted, causing Chris to cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, LET'S GO HAVE A CIGARETTE FIRST.  MAYBE HE'LL COME BACK OR SOMETHING.  I MEAN, FUCK, I DON'T WANNA DO HIS DAMN DISHES.\" Ashley said.  Lindsey looked at her, completley unaware of her miniscule co-worker helpless at her feet.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nate was pissed.  Once again, he was forced to put the stock away, alone is the stuffy closet.  He hated doing this, he was way too short to put things away properly on the top shelf, but then again he was always asked to do something, because if he didn't do it, no one else would.  It was total bullshit, and he knew it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was typical, though, the day he was having.  He'd cut himself by accident on a knife earlier that morning, he'd been forced to serve breakfest and what was worse, he was asked to stay late again tonight.  God, did he hate that.  And to top it all off, Marissa was working.  Marissa, the little bitch that had accused him of sexually harassing her.  She was seventeen and he was twenty-three!  He wasn't that type of guy at all.  He was trying to be nice to her on her first day, and apparently she'd taken his gentlemenly gestures the wrong way.  That, of she decided she didn't like him, and wanted him fired.  He'd smack her, if he was that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunetly, his submissive nature stopped all of that.  What made it worse, he almost found her more attractive because of that nature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God dammit!\" He shouted, dropping a box on his foot, \"Bloody hell!\"  He stooped to retrieve the box, his cut hand suddenly throbbing.  He cursed again as he say the box had busted open, and a jar of some green stuff was mixing with some other fallen condiments.  \"Oh, bollocks.\"  He said softly, \"Now I've gotta clean it up.\"  he reached down to gingerly grasp the larger peices of broken glass, when some of the green stuff came into contact with his cut.  It burned like hell for a moment, and then stopped.  He looked up and suddenly gasped.  Things were different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had shrunk to...</span></div></div>",

He gazed up at the massive shelves, and to his left was the mess of green goo and broken glass.  \"Oh, just bloody great.\" He muttered to himself.  He walked away from the liquid, before he shrank any smaller and wandered about.  \"Okay, so what do I do...it seems that this green shit made me like this...and it came in with the order.  So, there must be something in the order that can fix it.  Hopefully.\"  He turned around and saw a mountain of boxes behind him.  It could take him days to get onto that, let along get inside and look around.  There were only six boxes or so, but that could take a little guy like him weeks!  What a nightmare!  God, how could this day get any worse?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to hear it.  Not only that, but he could feel it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BOOM*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, bollocks...footsteps...\" He said to himself, turning around and seeing the massive door.

Would she step on him even if she found out it was him?  He had no idea how Marissa would react to his tiny form, and he wasn't sure he wanted to find out at all.  He began to run for the safety of the boxes as she began to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked further into the room, her massive right foot landing just inches from Nate before moving on to the shattered jar of green stuff.  \"WHAT THE HELL, DID SOMEONE SPILL THIS AND NOT CLEAN IT UP?\" She asked herself aloud, her slight country accent showing through.  She sighed exasperatly and bent over to clean it up.</span></div></div>",

Nate sighs in relief until Marissa returns with a broom, dustpan and mop bucket.  Nate hides out while she cleans, wondering just why Marissa didn't shrink when she touched the gunk, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarissa hummed to herself as she worked, tapping her foot, which was maddening to Nate, who tried to stay hidden from Marissa and her massive feet and cleaning supplies.  Any of it was deadly to him now.  But as he watched her tight butt wiggle as she worked, as he watched her massive feet and legs moved and her prety face smiling and humming, he found himself tempted to throw himself to the wolves.  Maybe she'd help him, or maybe she's kill him, but at the moment...she was all he had.  At least, for now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished her chores and placed everything in a corner and rolled up her sleeves, looking down at the clean floor with satisfaction.  Nate, gathering up his courage, stepped out from behind the boxes and waited to see if Marissa would see him, or what her initial reaction would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE HELL...?\" Marissa said from high above, like the voice of God echoing down from the heavens.  Nate cringed as he saw her step closer to him, peering down at him.  \"EWWW...A BUG.  I HATE BUGS.\" Marissa said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no....Marissa, I'm not a bug!\" Nate cried.  Marissa lifted up her massive foot and he saw the pink bottom of her shoe rise up high in the air and start to come down at a startling speed.  He dove out of the way and began to crawl hurriedly as her foot crashed hard onto the floor.  She lifted her foot and examined it, but not seeing his squished guts, she started hunting for him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHERE DID YOU GO, YOU LITTLE SHIT...\" She said, undoubtedly quietly to herself, but to the tiny man running away from her, it was like a loudspeaker.  She got down on her knees and looked around the boxes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNate lost sight of her as he walked around the boxes.  There was no sound, no footsteps or even breathing.  He wondered if in all of the excitement she'd left without him noticing.  He stopped to breath, looking behind him.  It was then that he turned around, and looked straight into Marissas' gigantic green eyes.</span></div></div>",

IT WASN'T NICE FOR ME, AND FOR THAT YOU'RE GONNA PAY.  NOW YOU CAN BE A GOOD LITTLE PET FOR ME, OR YOU CAN GO SQUISH.

The entire building was maybe only a single shoe size larger than her right foot, and the ceiling fell just short of reaching the top of her tattered white sketchers.  \"WHOA, I AM FUCKING HUGE!\" She said, and then giggled at the sight again.  She shifted her feet without thinking, and watched a massive cloud of dust envelope Haven Healthcare.  She looked down and saw that her heel had trod upon a group of cars in the parking lot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around and saw everything else the same size.  The road was just on her right, and the house next door was the same size it always was.  So it was just Haven that shrank!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her right foot over and saw the tiny vehicles embedded in the treads of her sneakers heel.  \"THIS IS FUCKING SWEET.\" Lindsey said, looking down at Haven.  \"CHECK IT OUT, EVERYONE...LINDSEY IS THE BOSS NOW.\" She bellowed and watched as dozens of tiny specks filed out of the doors to gaze up at her massive form.  She could barely see them!  The building was barely larger than her shoe, which meant that all of the workers and residents could set up shop inside her right shoe!  Nevermind her left!  \"MAYBE I COULD RENT OUT MY SHOES AS APARTMENT BUILDINGS.\" She said with a laugh.  She wondered about the specks at her feet, she wondered if they were scared.  Unconcerned about her surroundings, Lindsey laid down so her massive face was directly in front of the service entrance and stared at the tiny people who struggled against the force of just her breathing out her nose.  \"HI EVERYONE.\" She said simply, and grinned as they all looked so very nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lindsey?\" Ashley asked, her voice barely reaching Lindseys' massive ear drums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, IT'S ME!

It didn't smell too bad, kind of a vegetable smell.  He grabbed a spoon and scooped up some and put it in his mouth.  Surprirsingly, it tasted pretty good.  Maybe he could use it as his puree tonight instead of having to puree some saved veggies.  He placed it on the counter and looked at his watch again.</span></div></div>",

There was no way he could jump, and even if he did, what could he do then?  Walk the miles and miles to the front door and then somehow get in and contact someone?  He tried not to panic and finished his cigarette.  \"Why did this stuff shrink with me?\" He asked himself aloud, looking at his clothes and the objects in his pockets.  As he examined it, he found what he thought could be salvation: His Cellphone.  He opened it and dialed the number of his sister, Hannah.  She was still at work somewhere in the facility, wasn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Asked a voice on the other end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah!

His number would have been on her caller ID, but she couldn't hear him.  He then heard the front door open and a woman cough.  He looked up and saw Shelly, The Human Resources Manager, sauntering his way wearing a white blouse with a black mini-skirt and black stockings, her feet clad in black pumps.  She had her long curly hair pulled back and a pair of glasses perched on her long nose.  She was a hotty, but now she was a goddess.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShelly put a cigarette in her mouth and shivered against the breeze.  \"SHOULDA WORE PANTS...\" She said to herself.  Dave shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly!  Down here, on the chair!\" He started shouting as she approached his little world.

He crawled behind one of the front legs of the chair and looked out and up, seeing her massive form sitting there like a Queen lounging on her throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over and saw Shellys' black-shoed feet moving around, shifting from side to side, kicking dirt up around the massive toes.  The heels were several times his size, and they were a daunting and intimidating sight at his tiny size.  He watched the titanic structures move incredibly fast, and began to sweat again.

Her foot twisted and rocked back on it's heel, dangling her sole above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit...\" Dave cried, and dove forward as the massive sole playfully slammed down extra-hard, almost like an angry bull.

He had, allegedly(and he wasn't talking), slept with multiple women at the facility, and had been rumored to even try and get his own female employees into bed.  He wouldn't exactly put it that way, but he'd suggested to Ashley...she was a looker.  He was only thirty, and she was legal...but these rumors wouldn't look good to his now ex-wife, who might take his two children from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was an attractive man, standing at 6'2\" and being in excellent shape...but no one knew offically just how much of a scum bag he was.  No one, except his ex-wife, Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was getting ready to leave, when his phone rang.  He picked it up.  \"Hi, this is Randy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You son of a bitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard...I know about you and your little trollops at work.  I hope you can feel what this does to me, you son of a bitch.  How you make me feel so small and unimportant.  I was never good enough, you bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, please...\" the phone went dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, fuck.\"  He said to himself.  He got up and grabbed his keys, determined to go over there and talk to her.  He could lose his kids, the only thing he cared about.  He rushed to his door, but suddenly doubled over in pain.  \"Argh...must be those pills I popped earlier...\" He said, and spots flashed before his eyes.  When his vision cleared, he was staring at the crack under his closed door.  \"Oh my god...\" He said, \"What were those pills?\"  He then saw his doorknob turn, and the door open slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"RANDY...?  MUST HAVE GONE HOME ALREADY...\"  Randy was shocked when she stepped in...</span></div></div>",

She leaned her head back and closed her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy watched her move with uncanny speed and sit down in his chair.  She was going to take a nap in his office during her break...Randy ran towards her massive foot and began punching the toe, trying to ignore how much it hurt his hand.  \"Erica,\" He yelled, \"I'm down here!  Please, Erica, you have to help me!\"  But Erica was oblivious.  She lifted her other foot and spun the other desk chair around to face her and, terrifying her now miniscule boss, raised the foot he had been banging on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRandy threw himself on the ground, narrowly avoiding having his head taken off by Ericas' enormous feet.  He shivered at how insigifigant he'd now become, almost being killed by the dainty foot of his twenty year old subordinate!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifted her feet up and crossed them at the ankles on the other chair and leaned back, her breathing slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit...she's going to sleep.  She's never going to hear me like this.</span></div></div>",
