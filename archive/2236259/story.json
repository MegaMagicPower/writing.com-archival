The mother was very cautious and protective of her child, rarely ever letting him go out, as her husband had been caught and eaten by a wild animal a few years prior. Her child though was very adventurous and a curious soul.\u2028The child flew downstairs in a rush.\u2028\u201cGood morning, mama!\u201d he said.\u2028The mother turned from her cleaning and smiled. \u201cGood morning Barii, my sweet boy!\u201d She flew herself over to him and kissed the top of his head.<br>\r\nBarii looked out the entrance of their home (a hole in the tree). \u201cMama,\u201d he said, \u201ccan I go outside today?\u201d<br>\r\nHis mother looked over to him with concern. \u201cWhat for, my child?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI wanna go explore that pond down the road,\u201d he said, \u201cplease mama, I\u2019ll be extra careful.\u201d<br>\r\nShe knelt down and placed her hands on her son\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMy child, it is dangerous out there. There are birds and fish alone there that could eat you up. And who knows who might be out there and if they would even be friendly?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut mama, what if there are sweet berries that I can gather?\u201d<br>\r\nThe mother fairy sighed. \u201cMy child, I would never forgive myself if something were to happen to you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBut mama,\u201d the boy begged, \u201cI promise to be extra careful and check my surroundings.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBarii, it is too dangerous.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cMama, please? I know you miss daddy, but he was very adventurous. I wanna be like him too. I promise I will be extra extra careful.\u201d<br>\r\nThe mother fairy looked down and sighed. \u201cBarii\u2026 just\u2026 don\u2019t stay out too long.\u201d<br>\r\nBarii smiled and flew around in happiness. He hugged his mother and giggled.<br>\r\n\u201cI love you my child,\u201d his mother said.<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too mama,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\nWith that, the young fairy flew out. The mother flew herself to the entrance and watched her son fly off. She shed a single tear, hoping the best for his return.<br>\r\nAs Barii flew through the trees, the young fairy boy came across many sights. Soon, he reached the pond\u2019s edge. He sat on a tree branch and observed his surroundings. Not far from him, he saw something curious.</span></div></div>",

He decided to take a closer look.<br>\r\nThe tiny boy\u2019s wings fluttered fast as he drew closer to the camp. The heat of the fire was warming to his tiny body. The fairy boy smiled at the feeling. He decided to sit by the burning logs and relax for a minute. As he did, he observed more of the camp. There was a water jug and a small satchel. The boy felt his curiosity take over yet again. His wings carried him over to the bag. He squeezed himself inside and took a look around. He saw a small bag tied up, a bit of fruit, and what smelled like meat in a wrap. The fairy boy felt like he had seen his fill to know that this camp wasn\u2019t so abandoned after all.\u2028As he wedged himself out of the bag, his ears caught the noise of a twig snapping from behind. He turned around to see the perpetrator.</span></div></div>",

She was very built, with muscles all over her toned body. As she approached her camp, she caught sight of the fairy boy.<br>\r\n\u201cHEY!!\u201d She shouted.<br>\r\nBarii panicked. He tried to fly away from the camp site. As he did, he hadn\u2019t realized his ankle was caught in a loose thread from the satchel. The boy was yanked back for a moment as he saw the string around his foot. The orc woman dropped her hunting kills and approached the boy. Barii frantically tried to get the thread of him. The very moment he was free, he turned to fly away. The boy only made it a few feet before he was snatched right out of the air. The orc woman was holding him in her grasp, her giant gloved (fingerless gloves) hand held tight to the tiny child. Barii cried out as she drew him close to her face to get a better look at the small creature.<br>\r\n\u201cP-PLEASE! DON\u2019T HURT ME!\u201d<br>\r\nThe orc woman huffed at the child before speaking.</span></div></div>",

A fierce looking hawk was looking down at them.<br>\r\n\u201cSHOO!\u201d she shouted. She grabbed her weapon, a large mace, and swung it at the bird. The hawk gave a screech and flew away. The orc woman gave a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you flew any further, that thing could\u2019ve eaten you.\u201d<br>\r\nBarii was confused as to what just happened.<br>\r\n\u201cYou... y-you saved me?\u201d he stuttered out. \u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cBecause it was the right thing to do,\u201d the orc woman said, \u201ccan\u2019t have an innocent fairy get eaten, can we?\u201d<br>\r\nBarii teared up a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cHey no tears kid,\u201d she said as she gently wiped his tiny eyes.<br>\r\n\u201cTh-thank you,\u201d he said.<br>\r\nThe orc woman smiled.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat were you doing in my bag, anyways?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI... I thought this camp was abandoned. I came to the pond to explore and I saw the fire, so I wanted to see what was here. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to look like I was stealing.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAh well you came out of there with nothing at hand, so no harm no foul,\u201d she gently rubbed his tiny head, \u201cIf I\u2019m being honest, I\u2019ve never seen a fairy up close before. You\u2019re a cute little thing.~\u201d<br>\r\nBarii blushed a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you live around here?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n\u201cY-yeah, I live over... over... wait,\u201d Barii started to panic as he looked around. He was turned around and lost.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the orc woman asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know which way home is!\u201d Barii started to cry.<br>\r\n\u201cHey don\u2019t sweat it, I\u2019ll help you find your home,\u201d she assured him.<br>\r\n\u201cYou will?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSure, but in the morning. Sun is setting pretty soon and it\u2019ll be hard to see anything at night.\u201d<br>\r\nBarii\u2019s thoughts dwelled on his mother.<br>\r\n\u201cMy mama told me not to stay out late.\u201d<br>\r\nThe orc giantess sat against a tree stump close to the camp fire, setting the fairy boy on her knee.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you got me to protect you,\u201d she smiled, \u201cnothing will harm you so long as I am here.\u201d She flexed her huge arms and grinned.<br>\r\nBarii couldn\u2019t help but giggle seeing the woman show off.<br>\r\n\u201cM-my name is Barii,\u201d he said shyly.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you Barii\u201d, the orc replied, \u201cI\u2019m Valria.\u201d<br>\r\nLater that night, Valria gave Barii a piece of the fruit she had in her bag as she skinned her rabbit kills. The fairy boy felt safe around his new friend. In a way, she was seemingly like a literal big sister to him. As it grew late, the orc woman gave the boy a dried out rabbit skin to use as a blanket for sleep. She laid him on her bag right next to her bed roll.<br>\r\n\u201cYour mother ever tell you stories, Barii?\u201d the orc woman asked.<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve never heard one from me before,\u201d she chuckled.<br>\r\nValria told Barii a tale of a warrior who played one hundred dragons without breaking a sweat, and how the warrior had become king of all the land. The tale thrilled the boy. As Barii\u2019s eyelids grew heavy, Valria gently rubbed the top of his head and laid down next to him.\u2028The duo slowly drifted to sleep.\u2028The next morning, Valria packed her camp and brought Barii along with her to help him find his tree. The boy sat on her shoulder as she walked.\u2028As they passed a small forest, Barii recognized a patch of bushes with blue flowers.\u2028\u201cIt\u2019s that way!\u201d he said excitedly.\u2028The orc woman walked the boy in the direction he pointed. Soon, they found his home. Barii hopped happily on Valria\u2019s shoulder. The orc woman gently held him in a cupped hand as she approached the tree. She kicked a log over and stood on top of it to see in the tree, her head just barely being able to see inside.\u2028In the tree, was Barii\u2019s mother hunched over a table crying.\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cUmm\u2026 excuse me? Miss?\u201d Valria spoke up.<br>\r\nBarii\u2019s mother saw the orc woman and screamed.\u2028 \u201cBACK BEAST!! GO AWAY!!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I\u2019m not a beast, I only look like one.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPLEASE LEAVE!! DON\u2019T HARM ME!!\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cN-no, miss, you misunderstand,\u201d Valria explained, \u201cI believe this belongs to you.\u201d\u2028Valria reached in a bit and placed her hand down on the floor of the fairy\u2019s home. She opened her hand and revealed Barii sitting inside.\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cMAMA!!\u201d the boy shouted happily.<br>\r\n\u201cBARII MY CHILD!!\u201d his mother cried out. She flew up onto the open palm and held him tight. \u201cWHAT HAPPENED?? ARE YOU OKAY?? WHY DIDN\u2019T YOU COME HOME??\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cMama, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Barii chuckled, \u201cI got lost, but Valria here saved me.\u201d<br>\r\nHis mother looked over to the orc woman\u2019s face. The woman smiled and rubbed the back of her head.<br>\r\nBarii\u2019s mother flew over to the woman\u2019s face. She placed her tiny hand on her giant cheek.\u2028 \u201cThank you,\u201d the mother said.<br>\r\nAs Barii and his mother exited the giant palm, Valria pulled out her hand and jumped off the log. She gave a satisfied sigh and started to walk away.\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cValria, wait!\u201d Barii shouted. The boy flew out really quick and up to the orc\u2019s face. He hugged her giant cheek one last time. The giant woman placed her hand over the boy.\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe one day we can go on adventures together kid,\u201d she said.\u2028<br>\r\nBarii gave the giant orc woman a tiny kiss on her cheek before flying back to his home. With that, the orc was on her way.\u2028Barii\u2019s mother meanwhile was comforted by the fact that not everything out there was out to get her and her child.</span></div></div>",

A little thief!\u201d<br>\r\nThe fairy boy frantically shook his head in protest.<br>\r\n\u201cThink you can steal my gold while I was out on a hunt? You\u2019ll have to do better than that to put one over on The Mighty Valria!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cPlease let me go!\u201d Barii cried, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you alone, I promise!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you\u2019ll leave me alone,\u201d she said, \u201cright after I\u2019m done with you!\u201d<br>\r\nShe tightened her grip on the boy, squeezing him tight. Barii cried out in pain as the giantess\u2019s grip was crushing him.<br>\r\nValria sat on a nearby stump in front of her campfire.<br>\r\nShe used her other hand and grabbed Barii by his foot, dangling him upside down. She brought him close to her eye to get an even closer look at him. Barii was practically able to she his reflection in her giant eye. All of her features were gigantic to the boy. Her giant green face, her dreadlocked hair, her giant pillar-like tusks. For all intents and purposes, she was quite beautiful for an orc, however beauty meant nothing to the helpless fairy at her mercy.<br>\r\n\u201cHmmmmmm,\u201d Valria pondered, \u201cwhat am I going to do with you?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cP-please\u2026 let me go,\u201d Barii begged, his voice getting tired from the crying.<br>\r\n\u201cI could always eat you,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve never tasted fairy before.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cW-We don\u2019t taste good!\u201d Barii shouted a bit.<br>\r\n\u201cOh I\u2019ll never know till I try.\u201d<br>\r\nShe brought him up to her giant lips and opened her maw, extending her giant green tongue and giving Barii\u2019s tiny body a long lick. As the wet mass passed over him, Barii coughed from the feeling.<br>\r\n\u201cOr maybe I could just step on you,\u201d Valria added, \u201cyou fairies are kinda like bugs after all.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cP-Please\u2026 I wanna go home,\u201d Barii begged.<br>\r\nValria pondered for a few moments.</span></div></div>",

Her green tongue was wet with saliva, awaiting the incoming meal. Barii cried out. She began to lower the tiny boy into her waiting mouth. Barii saw every detail of the incoming fleshy cave. Her giant tusks sharp to the point like giant spears, her teeth like razor swords, her tongue like a giant wet carpet, and her wide throat like a dark cave.<br>\r\n\"PLEASE!! DON'T EAT ME!!\" the fairy boy cried out.<br>\r\nAs she lowered him more, her tusks passed by the boy's sides and her tongue felt up his tiny bare chest. She had inserted him only half way before closing her lips around his waist with a loud \"OOMPH~\"<br>\r\nBarii screamed out for help, but was unheard to anyone outside. The giant tongue beneath his body slathered him up with thick saliva. His tiny legs kicked outside of the orc woman's lips, his little feet feeling the outside wind.<br>\r\nValria giggled at seeing the boy's little legs try to get loose. She used her sharp pointed nail to tickle his tiny little feet. Barii couldn't help but laugh from a mixture of the feeling and anxiety. Valria poked his tiny bare rear as well.<br>\r\n\"Soft little fairy\", she thought to herself, \"tasty too.\"<br>\r\nValria puckered her lips and brought in the rest of her tiny meal with a loud audible slurp.<br>\r\nBarii was now completely inside the orc woman's mouth. His wings were too wet to even make him fly. He pounded on the giant tongue in protest to his captor. All the monstrous woman did in return was flip him over and raise her tongue, squishing him against the roof of her mouth. Barii cried, knowing he was completely insignificant to the giant woman. She twirled him around and kept getting a taste for him, tossing him from one cheek to the other. Barii was becoming too weak to even cry or scream.<br>\r\n\"Help... please... someone...\"<br>\r\nSoon, Valria's tongue stopped toying with him.

As compared to everything else, it was almost soothing to the boy.<br>\r\nValria sat by the fire and began to skin her rabbit kills from her hunt, her stomach gurgling as it was ready to accept the tiny morsel.<br>\r\nBarii felt the tube expand one final time before he was released into a short fall. He splashed into a shallow puddle inside what was seemingly a dark cave. He lifted himself up and looked around. Barii had realized where he was. The fairy boy was inside of the orc girl's stomach. He sat down in a fetal position and started to cry. His thought dwelled on his mother, wishing he had listened to her and stayed home. He told her he'd be careful, and yet here he was, swallowed alive by an orc.<br>\r\nValria felt the boy enter her stomach and smirked. She rubbed the abs above her stomach as she hummed a cheerful tune. Her stomach gurgled a bit more before she let out a loud, satisfied burp.<br>\r\nAs the gas pocket burst around Barii, he covered his nose to the smell. He was unsure of how long he was going to last in the belly of the giant orc.</span></div></div>",

MY WINGS!!\" the boy cried out.<br>\r\nValria hunched over and placed the fairy boy on the ground. As he tried to lift himself up, he tried to flap his wings, but only gained more pain as they had been mangled and crushed. He turned around and witnessed the orc woman lift her giant, green bare foot above him. She wiggled her toes somewhat maliciously and giggled.<br>\r\n\"P-please,\" Barii groaned out.<br>\r\nValria slowly lowered her foot down, taking her time. Her heel impacted the ground first. She slowly rolled her sole over the boy. Her green skin was rough to the touch, but soft enough that it conformed to Barii's tiny body. Soon she brought her whole foot down over him, his tiny face peering out between her big and second toes. The orc woman gently shifted her foot around, twisting the boy into the dirt beneath her sole.<br>\r\nBarii was too weak to call out for help. The giant toes around his face wiggled around him.<br>\r\n\"Scared of my big foot, little boy?\" the orc woman teased. She rolled her toes over his face, shifting her entire foot to completely cover his tiny body. Valria wasn't even applying pressure and yet the boy beneath her firm sole was in immense pain.<br>\r\n\"P-please,\" he whimpered out, \"don't... squish me...\"</span></div></div>",

She had pinned down people beneath her feet before, but never one so tiny.<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, fairy,\" she spoke as she shifted her foot to show Barii's face between her toes again, \"I like this feeling. So I'll give you a chance to make me feel good. If you do, then I'll heal your wings and send you on your way. If not, then I squish you flat. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\nBarii had no choice. He frantically nodded. Valria grinned.<br>\r\n\"Good. Now,\" she said as she sat back in relaxation, \"worship my toes~\"<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" Barii said confused.<br>\r\n\"I said, worship my toes,\" she demanded, \"stick out your tiny tongue, and lick them.\"<br>\r\nBarii was taken back by the request, but knew he had no other choice. He leaned his head over and licked the giant toe to his side. Valria closed her eyes and hummed at the feeling. The boy kept licking her big toes much as he could.<br>\r\nValria moaned a bit in pleasure. \"I should do this more often,\" she cooed.<br>\r\nBarii slurped at the giant green toe that pinned him down.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm keep going, boy~\" the orc woman said.<br>\r\nBarii turned his head and started to lick the other toe. He slathered it up as much as he could. The orc woman shifted in her position. The giant foot lifted up off the boy. He was confused but didn't dare try to get away. Valria extended her leg out straight. Her giant bare foot towered over the tiny boy, her sole flexing in front of him.<br>\r\n\"Keep going, boy,\" she demanded.<br>\r\nBarii picked himself up and approached the foot. He reached out and began to rub the firm surface as he stuck his tongue out and licked the heel.<br>\r\nValria moaned in the the dominating feeling. She reached her hand beneath her waist armor and began to help herself to some self pleasure.<br>\r\nBarii worked his tongue and hands as well as he could. He didn't want to admit it to himself, but he was somewhat enjoying the feeling. Valira's foot was quite warm to the touch in a comforting sort of way. The taste of her bare sole wasn't negative in any way. In fact, it seemed almost naturally sweet. Still, Barii didn't stop to think about his own feelings, and would rather help the giantess feel good. Perhaps she'd let him go after all was said and done.<br>\r\nValria kept fingering herself to the feeling of the boy's tint tongue against her sole. She bit her lip in the thought of dominating the fairy to the point of making him worship her like a goddess.<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmmmph, yeah~\" she moaned out.<br>\r\nBarii thought of a way to help his situation. He climbed Valria's foot a bit, grabbing hold and setting himself just at her giant arch. He began to start the process there like before.<br>\r\n\"OH!\" the orc woman moaned at the sudden change of place, \"Choosing a different spot? You slick boy~\"<br>\r\nBarii kept up his worshipping, slurping at the firm wrinkled sole that towered over him.<br>\r\nValria fingered herself harder, gaping her mouth open in pleasure.<br>\r\n\"OH! OH! OH YES!\" she moaned.<br>\r\nBarii shifted himself again, this time standing in between her big and second toes. As he licked the green flesh around him, he witnessed the musclebound giantess moaning out. At this point, she was fingering herself with one hand and grabbing one of her massive breasts under her armor with the other.<br>\r\nSuddenly, the toes on Barii's sides pinched him, though not roughly. A loud moan signified the sudden spasm.<br>\r\n\"OHHHHHHHHHH!!!~\" Valria moaned out loud.<br>\r\nThe giant toes around Barii relaxed and released him. He sat between the giant green pillars and looked up at the giantess orc. The woman was panting in pleasure. She removed her hands from beneath her armor and looked at the fairy between her toes. She grinned and wiggled her toes around him.<br>\r\nBarii nervously chuckled. Soon he saw the giant woman reach over, extend her index finger and thumb between her toes, lifting him up from between them. Barii found himself in her firm grasp once again as she lifted him up to her puckered lips. His face was practically buried in the plushness as she gave him a long kiss. As she parted the boy from her giant lips, she smiled.<br>\r\n\"So...\" Barii started, \"you'll... let me go?\"</span></div></div>",

But, a deal is a deal. You helped me with my pleasure, so I'll help your heal wings as soon as I can.\"<br>\r\nBarii was taken back for a moment. \"Y-you can't heal them now??\"<br>\r\n\"Relax, boy,\" she assured him, \"I don't have the means to fix them right now, but we're not far from a town that I know of. There's a woman there that makes many potions and spells, she'll be able to fix something up to mend your little wings instantly. I promise.\"<br>\r\nBarii shed a tear.<br>\r\n\"H-hey, you'll be okay,\" Valria cooed. She gently reached an index finger out and wiped his tear away. She opened up her hand to gently hold the fairy in an open palm. \"I won't hurt you anymore. Just, promise you won't steal from my bag tonight, okay?\"<br>\r\nBarii nodded in agreement. The orc woman smiled and brought him in to kiss the top of his tiny head.<br>\r\nFor the rest of the day, Valria skinned her rabbit kills and cooked one over the fire. She gave Barii a piece of the fruit she had in her satchel to feed him. The boy didn't want to let his guard down, but he was starting to feel safe around the orc.<br>\r\nAt night, Valria told him a story as he sat upon her knee. The boy was intrigued by the woman. Over the span of a day, he had seen her wrath, and her kindness. Barii's mother had always tried to keep him inside, and while he had witnessed first hand what dangers there were, it was nice to know there were people who were willing to be gentle to him.<br>\r\nAfter the story, Valria placed the boy upon her ab toned belly as they laid back and looked up at the stars.<br>\r\n\"Barii?\" she spoke, \"Are you still scared of me?\"<br>\r\nThe fairy hesitated a bit to answer.<br>\r\n\"J-Just a little bit.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry our meeting had to be based off a misunderstanding, but I can tell you're a good kid... sorry I used you for my pleasure.\"<br>\r\nBarii thought about the way he saw the giant woman touching herself before.<br>\r\n\"Keep that between us?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah,\" the boy replied.<br>\r\n\"And the thing about your wings too. Don't tell you mother about that. If I could take that back I would. I really am sorry.\"<br>\r\nBarii teared up a bit and laid face down on the toned stomach, stretching his arms out. Valria perked her head up and looked down at him. It took her a second to process what he was doing. The fairy was attempting to hug her. She smiled a bit and placed a hand over him to \"hug\" him back.<br>\r\nBarii slept in dried out rabbit skin that night, right next to Valria. The orc woman didn't dare let him get into harm.<br>\r\nThe next morning, Valria walked to the town she had mentioned before, with Barii riding on her shoulder. She had taken him to the potion shop she had told him about. The older (human) woman was amazed at the sight of a fairy as they were seemingly rare. After paying the woman, Valira was given a glowing blue potion. As she stepped outside, she gave the tiniest of drops to the tiny boy. After consuming it, Barii's wings miraculously straightened out and healed right up. He leapt up and fluttered his wings to test them out. He zipped around his orc friend in a show of recovery.<br>\r\nHe looked at Valria's smiling face and flew up to her, hugging the giant orc's cheek. Valria giggled at the feeling.<br>\r\nA few hours later, Valria escorted Barii to his tree. The fairy boy flew up and into the hot where the entrance to his home was. His mother was hunched over in a chair crying.<br>\r\n\"MAMA!!\" Barii shouted.<br>\r\nHis mother looked up in shock.<br>\r\n\"BARII MY SWEET CHILD!!\" she flew over to him and snatched him up, hugging him tight. \"WHAT HAPPENED?? ARE YOU HURT?? WHY DIDN'T YOU COME HOME??\"<br>\r\n\"M-mama, I'm okay,\" Barii assured her. \"I... got into a bit of trouble. But... I made a friend.\"<br>\r\nHis mother was taken back by the statement, confused. Barii lead her over to the entrance and showed her Valria standing beneath the tree. The orc woman smiled up at the two fairies and waved. Barii waved back, while his mother's mouth gapped open from shock.<br>\r\nThe orc woman turned and began her walk along the road once again.<br>\r\nBarii's mother was given some assurance that perhaps not everything was out to get her child.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The following story takes place in a medieval fantasy styled world called \u201cTerrasia\u201d. The world is inhabited by many creatures including humans, elves, orcs, dragons, and many half human/half animal like beings (think Argonian or Khajiit). And one such creature we will be focusing on is a young fairy boy named \u201cBarii\u201d. Curious to a fault, Barii is known for getting into trouble, getting lost, and nearly getting late by the local wildlife. However, this adventure might just be his last if things turn south.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCHARACTERS:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarii - a young fairy boy (looking around the age of 12 perhaps). Curious and somewhat daring, he sometimes gets too close to possible dangerous beings. His messy blonde hair and soft cheeks (and overall skin) are key characteristics of this little fairy, reaching only an inch and a half tall.<br>\r\nNOTE: Fairies in this world typically only wear a loin cloth made of leaves (and a bra of sorts for the women). Fairies also do not bleed normal blood, as it looks more along the lines of blue liquid with sparkles.\u2028\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincess Dariana: An elf pricess (physically looking around the age of 18) who is usually alone, observing her surroundings. While she is usually gentle to creatures of any size, she can be quite demanding if she does not get her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValria: A traveling orc warrior (seemingly around the age similar to early 30\u2019s to humans), Valria is a fierce orc warrior and traveling bounty hunter. She has a built muscle body and carries a massive mace weapon. Her armor only covers her breasts and \u201clower regions\u201d. The way she treats strangers is usually dependent on her mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShkii: A half human/half cat humanoid (pretty much like a Khajiit)(Seemingly around 23 in human years). Agile and silent, she is an assassin for hire and her morals are unknown. She can be kind one moment and cruel the next. Her animal-like instincts can kick in at any moment and usually triggers when she sees something small, like mice, small bugs, and unfortunately, fairies. She can be very seductive and playful, sometimes too much of a mix of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary: A human girl (13) that lives on a farm. She is usually collecting things she finds like interesting rocks or small animals she finds, usually asking her mother if she can keep it as a pet (Mom always says no). She has heard stories of fairies before and should she find one, might be either gentle or a bit rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKadina: A female dragon (many countless years old) with a love for gold, jewels, precious metals, and riddles. She hordes her treasure in her mountain cave and has a taste for flesh. She will usually toy with her prey, however does have a soft side if offered something for their lives. Reaching nearly fifty feet in length and twenty five feet in height (walking on all fours, but can temporarily use her front limbs like hands). She is known for having a very seductive or motherly voice, giving her victims a false sense of security. She can be a giant among giants to a fairy like Barii.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:\u2028<br>\r\n-NO SCAT OR PISS<br>\r\n-NO MALE GIANT INTERACTION<br>\r\n-NO SHORT ADDITIONS, AT LEAST ADD A MEDIUM PARAGRAPH<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: There will be good endings where Barii lives, as there will be bad ones where he is either taken away from his home forever or in fact dies. Be prepared for both.</td>",
