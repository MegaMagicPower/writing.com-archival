She adjusted her posture and felt her foot hit something. Looking down, she saw an odd clear object, she lifted it up to her eyes and examined it. She recognized the object immediately it was a 20 sided die!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could examine it further the bell rang, signalling her necessity of leaving the library. She snapped her book shut and mumbled to herself, \"I wish I'd had more time to read, I was just getting to the good part!\" Just then she accidentally dropped the die to the table, where it rolled a perfect 20. She looked down at the die and saw it glowed light green for just a moment!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it her imagination? She picked up the die again, no matter, she had to get to class. Then she noticed, no one else was getting up. No one else was even moving a muscle. Everyone else in the whole library had frozen in place. She looked down at the die in her hand and on a whim decided to test a theory,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that time would resume normally\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe die rolled onto the table and flashed teal as it landed on 15, suddenly the library came to life again as students resumed putting away their things. Alyssa followed the stream of students out into the hallway as her mind raced with what she should try next with this strange magic die.</span></div></div>",
