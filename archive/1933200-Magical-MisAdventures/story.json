            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Our story begins in the distant kingdom known as Decatar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Decatar wasn't exactly a quiet kingdom by any means. Sure there were plenty of lovely and peaceful country sides, beaches, mountains, forests and more to find a quiet place to relax, but there was always something going on that kept the kingdom from being, well, boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was a gang of bandits stealing from caravans in the mountains or witches preparing dark and potential dangerous spells in the deep woods, there was always something that required a call to action. Mind you such things were rarely 'true evil' in nature, not that such dangers didn't exist in the kingdom but any real dark forces seeing corruption, power, domination or all ofn the above were generally few and far between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such the kingdom had a well trained, moderate sized army but few had seen anything beyond a battle with some bandits or a powerful magical beast of one sort or another. As such Decatar was an ideal land for freelance adventurers. Anyone with applicable skills were just as likely to succeed as the local guards, and better since, if an adventurer died performing the mission there was no effect on the kingdom. Unlike the possibility of guards getting killed and taxes would in turn be raised to train new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecatar was also home to many varying species, both magical and non, of humanoid bestial beings. Most were treated warmly for the most part, save some of the more dangerous of the magical beings. It wasn't that they were cruel or nasty usually, but most simply didn't trust creatures with such natural talents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuch beliefs stemmed from the fact that, for non-magical races, learning magic was a skill that could take years, even decades to perfect, but even a skilled wizard could still be outclassed in the strength of spells by a young naturally magical being. True, those who had to learn magic the hard way were often more diverse in talents, but rarely could they match the strength of the magical creatures inhabiting the land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut enough gab, I'm sure everyone here is eager to get on with our adventure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOur story begins in the small town of Fox Hollow. A quiet little town set between the mountains bordering the kingdom to the west, the thick forest of Amberwood to the East, the road to the sea and the capitol to the North, and the planes that sloped away to the southern dessert. Not much happened in Fox Hollow, as any resident could tell you, and yet, despite that, no one was ever surprised when some call to action was needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe local inn, named the Fire Drake Inn, was probably the most lively spot in town. Songs were sung, ale flowed like water, and many a guest was enjoying some good natured betting in the local games of Arm wrestling, darts, and ale guzzling. An ideal place for talking over important matters without being overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ideal meeting spot for heros...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner of the inn sat four figures, each enjoying meals of varying sizes as they conversed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice place,\u201d said one with a sigh, \u201cRustic, rural, a far cry from the bustling cities with rushing carts, shoving citizens, and loud noise... I miss it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuit your belly aching,\u201d replied another through a mouthful of turkey leg, \u201cYou're the one who got us this gig, remember?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMe? I thought it was one of you guys.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe individuals presently conversing were about as stark a contrast as could be. The first to speak had been a rather lithe and graceful vixen female. Dressed in leather armor and a heavy dark blue cloak that hid her daggers as easily as her long red hair, she was no damsel to be rescued, that was for certain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer name was Tabitha, a thief by trade and quite the cunning one. While not the top of her class, she had a record of thefts as long as her arm. In fact it was only because of a bungled attempt at mass thievery during a town meeting when she was caught and given the choice. Either the axe or ten years community service. The choice had been obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other she conversed with was, himself, an exercise in contrasts. John was a knight, and yet he was a dragon. He was strong yet he was also rotund. Having been abandoned in the town square shortly after hatching, John had been rescued by a knight and taken in to loved and cared for and taught all the virtuous ways of being a knight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever his adopted fathers wife was not one who enjoyed her husband going out on dangerous quests and she was not about to have her adopted son do the same. So she had spent Johns younger years giving him all the food and treats she could. Then result was now at a mature adult size John weighed easily 375 pounds, not counting his armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, so we traveled all the way out here for nothing?\u201d John muttered in irritation as he bit off the last of the meat and dropped the bone to his place with a clang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, not nothing,\u201d replied one of the other figures, a white Unicorn Priest by the name of Cassy, as she sat carefully sipping at one of the ales, \u201cWe already received the down payment and money for the trip, meals, and our stay at the Inn. That's a long way to go for such a weak prank.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy was a devoted priest, but unlike others she attempted to honor every religion in the kingdom she possibly could without contradicting her practices. Rather than try to sway anyone to a 'one true' religion, she instead believed that faith was something every religion deserved. So to be more spiritually balanced she had immersed herself in the teaching of every races religious believes she believed had good and nobel intentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI agree,\u201d Tabitha nodded, \u201cI guess our mystery client wishes to remain anonymous. And if that's true he'll probably send someone to give us the message rather than appear himself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou've been quiet this whole time Marty,\u201d John noted looking to their last companion sitting in the corner of the booth, \u201cWhat do you have to say about all this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure shifted, his dark robes and large brimmed hat as stark a contrast to Cassy's white and gold robes as their professions were different. He stretched a little bit as felines like him were want to do. The cheetah gave it some thought and finally just shrugged, \u201cI say we go with it. If our hose shows up then we get a quest for some gold. If not then we get a vacation from the city. Either way it's a win win situation as far as I'm concerned.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just snorted a few smoke rings, \u201cThat is so... so you Marty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, it was rare the mage could get riled up over anything, not that John didn't try. The pair had met as kids, and ever since the first day when john had tried and failed to scare Marty just to see how fast the cheetah could run, the pair had been friends of a sort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn saw Marty as both a challenge and role model. The feline never seemed to get riled up over anything, something John would always push trying to see if one day Marty might loose it. But the cheetah seemed completely unflappable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we need to decide what to do here soon,\u201d Tabitha muttered, \u201cIf our mystery host doesn't send us a message soon I'd like to get a bit of shopping in rather than sit here waiting for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot to worry,\u201d Marty stretched again, \u201cI think there's someone over at the bar looking for us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three turned to look across the crowded room to the distant bar, where indeed the bartender seemed to be directing someone their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure approached, dressed in a thick traveling cloak. \u201cI'm glad to see you all made it,\u201d he spoke when he was close enough. Pulling back his hood revealed large ears and red fur. A kangaroo it would seem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMade it is one thing,\u201d John replied, \u201cBut how about telling us why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell it's actually quite simple. My name is Ken, and my master has need of your unique talents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha shot a glance at the others that screamed 'told you so'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd what sort of services does he want?\u201d John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty added, \u201cYeah we don't do windows and plowing makes my back hurt.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a soft giggle from Cassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNothing so mundane,\u201d Ken replied, \u201cThis is a far more serious matter. You see...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) \"...Deep in the mountains there are a network of feral dragon caves. The dragons have stolen something important from my master and you must retrieve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) \"...Children have been vanishing from around town. What little information we have suggest all were last seen wandering into the forest last. Please bring them back safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) \"... There is an ancient castle stronghold far to the south that is claimed to be enchanted. My boss wishes for you to enter and retrieve something precious from somewhere inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) \"... This will be a diplomatic mission of sorts to the ocean dwelling beings in the seas to the North. My master wishes to open trade with them, but communication is difficult so we must sent representatives to begin negotiations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.) Something else entirely.</span></div></div>",

Those beasts have stolen something that is priceless to my employer, and he would pay almost anything to get it back,\" Ken explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this thing they stolen,\" said John, sitting up a little more straight in his chair, his attention fixed the moment he heard the word \"dragons\", \"what is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, don't worry about that,\" said Ken, \"You'll know it when you see it. It's infamous to grab anyone's attention no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" Ken continued, pulling out a piece of parchment and a bag with and ample amount of money in it, \"Let's discuss the legal matters about your payment. I'm about to give you a quarter of what we owe you ones you accept this task. The rest will be given ones you complete this mission. By signing this contract, you hear by are bound to my employer's service. If you abandon this task or return without what is required, you and you companions will be declared as outlaws and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Yeah, blah blah blah!\" John said, irritated, cutting Ken off, \"If we don't get the stuff your boss will bust our kneecaps, we get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn snatched the contract, signed it, and thrust it back at Ken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then,\" said the kangaroo, rolling up the parchment, \"I'll leave you to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled up his hood and left the inn, leaving the bag of money behind. Tabitha was the first to rush over to it, open the bag, and, more out of instinct than suspicion, she nibbled on a gold coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied that it was real, she turned to John and said, \"Feral dragons, hey? So, how does it feel to visit your cousins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn growled, smoke began to rise out of his nostrils. \"There NOT my cousins!\" he snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonoid's outburst made the inn go silent, and everyone in the room looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you all looking at?\" John shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting a fight with such an imposing foe, they all went back to their drinks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, firstly,\" he said, his tone softer, though their was no less anger in it, \"I may be a dragonoid, but I refuse to have any relations with those monsters. They are all filthy and stupid beasts that eat their own young.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's heavily bias of you,\" said Cassy, \"I'll let you know that not all dragons are like that. I studied them. Sure there's a lot of them that are feral, but there's also others who are very smart, even more smarter than us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what,\" said John, folding his arms, something he always did in a argument that he was going to lose. It was a form of self-comfort for him. \"That doesn't mean anything to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, but it does,\" said Cassy, \"Many adventurers got themselves killed in the most horrific ways imaginable because they underestimated them, because they thought they were primitive monsters, like you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I... You don't... Ag!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Marty to save him out of this argument, but the cheetah only shrugged his shoulders and said, \"She's right. We should be very caution on this mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pride bruised, John stood up, knocking his chair over, and walked up, saying bitterly, \"I'm going to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey watched as he stomped away, shoving a drunkard out of the way as he went upstairs to guest rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha sighed and said, \"What a ball of emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You see, things have not been so quiet in Fox Hollow lately,\" said Ken, pulling out a scroll from underneath his cloak. He opened it, spreading out all over the company's round table, revealing a large and detailed map of Decatar. He pointed a finger at the edge of the Amberwood, a huge forest that expanded many miles to the East.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children, peasants mostly, have been unexplainable disappearing around these parts,\" explained Ken. \"It has been causing a great uproar from small folk, and they are demanding that there sons and daughters are returned. My employer can't send out a search party, for both finance and time hinder him. So, he has decided to look for a cheaper; and your party was chosen for this task.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically,\" said John slowly, rising a little from his seat, \"You want us to go look for a bunch of snot-nosed kids, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen nodded. \"You must find them and bring them back home safely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then,\" said Tabitha, \"But how much are you paying us? That's the main question here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be rewarded handsomely, I'll see to that,\" replied Ken, rolling up the map and hiding it back inside his cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have any idea what could have taken the children?\" asked Cassy, who had been listening to the story and had been shaken by the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ken only shook his head. \"Haven't the slightest clue,\" he said, \"You know very well that the Amberwood has a sinister reputation. Stories of monsters and witches often come from there. But, gentlemen, I must leave you for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, he turned around and left the inn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty watched the kangaroo leave with a suspicious look. \"I don't trust that guy,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I,\" said John, draining the last ale from his tankard. \"But if he says he going to pay, then he's going to pay us, or he'll never see another light of day again, I'll make sure of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" Tabitha suddenly said, \"if he doesn't pay us, we can always use his money instead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe produced a small pouch, shaking it, and the sound of coins could be audibly heard. The group stared at her with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't...\" Cassy said flabbergasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen only giggled, saying, \"Old habits die hard, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group left the inn the following morning when the sun was barely began poking its head above the hills. Amberwood was close to Fox Hollow, only ten miles as the crow flies, and the party arrived at the edges of the forest at midday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inhabitants, like Ken described, were all farmers who lived in small farmhouses, which lied scattered across the plains that were patched with crops of all sorts. But another thing that they noticed was that their were no children, and the residence looked sad and weary, even though they weren't overworked or starving. They were most likely grieving for their missing offspring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stopped at the area where most said the children were last seen: It was a large path, almost worthy of the title 'road', that went into the forest for quite a distance before it finally gave way to the fauna of the Amberwood. It was used by lumberjacks and hunters often, but now it lied abandoned due to the missing children incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party was assembled for a while at the gates of the huge forest, for they debated if they should spend the night outside the Amberwood or if they should travel inside and camp there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy, supported by Tabatha, was the one who decided to stay outside, just to be safe, for the forest had a sinister reputation, while John, supported by Marty, was the one who ordered that they should camp inside the forest, for he wanted to get the quest done as quickly as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arguing for at least an hour, they finally decided to camp in the Amberwood. Night was falling when the group finally settled down on a small hill, after they traveled a long distance into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fire was demanded if they wanted to spend the night there, and John saw to it with a flint and a few pieces of dry grass. Marty would have started the fire with a little magic, of course, but the dragon didn't want that, saying to his companion: \"I don't want any of your fancy-ass sorcery to help me. Besides, the old way is always the best way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What ever you say,\" Marty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the leader, John took the first watch for the night. He was halfway through it when Tabatha, apparently woken up for no reason, came and sat beside the dragon, listening to the eerie but beautiful night-life sing there songs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John\" the vixen whispered, \"Do you think we're ever going to find them - the children, I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn only shrugged, saying, \"Don't know. This place is kinda big. Chances are good that we're not going to find them at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lapsed back into silence. After a couple of minutes went by, John, with his keen night adapted eyes, saw something walking, or rather skipping, around between the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see that?\" he whispered to Tabatha, rising to his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something dancing over there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it's a leprechaun,\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sush!\" John snapped, \"Stay here. I'm going to check it out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" Tabatha asked, \"It could be something very dangerous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about me,\" John said, \"I can take care of myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that said, he marched off into the forest, leaving the safety of the campsite behind. He drew his long sword and crept closer. The skipping figure became clearer and clearer, until John could identify it as one thing: it was a little girl, a human that looked about the age of six years. She was wearing a pearly-white dress that reached towards her ankles, her golden hair hung loose over her shoulders, and she was giggling merrily, like there was no danger in the forest this time of night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stopped, turned and noticed John staring at her. The dragon had to admit that he felt a little nervous for some reason. There was a voice in the back of his head telling him to run, but he ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, there,\" he said finally, trying his best to sound friendly, \"You're one of the missing children, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" John said, becoming a little bit annoyed, \"Do you know where they are, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't answer, only stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was beginning to lose his temper. \"Listen, kid,\" he said impatiently, \"Who are you and what are you doing here? Do you know about any missing children around here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl suddenly giggled, turned, and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come back here!\" he called, but that did little to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sneered and ran after the girl, not knowing that he was being lured into a trap!</span></div></div>",

But as they were making their way down the small hill, strange things began to happen: it first began with Marty seeing something dash by in the corner of his eye, then the air suddenly felt much colder, and everyone in the group getting the nagging feeling that they were being watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Does anyone here have the feeling that we are being watched?\" asked Cassy, her eyes zipping left and right.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before anyone could answer Cassy's question, from the darkness, at the treeline, emerged dark figures. Their bodies were like shadows, their eyes two glowing balls of piercing, glowing white orbs, devoid of love, of anger, of anything, their silhouette taking on the forms of humanoids. The air suddenly felt a whole lot colder for a Summer night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are those things?\" Tabitha asked Cassy, fear audible in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't k-know,\" she stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with her vast amount of knowledge about folklore of almost every religion in Decatar, Cassy had never heard or read anything about such bizarre creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey approached the adventurers, walking slowly and calmly, as if they had all the time in the world. Tabitha tried to push the group back, up the hill, so that they would have some ground to fight on, but she found that more shadows were coming up behind them, surrounding them, closing in on the group like a fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two girls were pushed aside, and Marty, with a confident grin on his face, stepped forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" he said, \"I'll take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe held out his paw, and from this appendage sprouted a ball of fire, increasing in size until it was as big as a bowling ball. It shot forth, speeding directly towards the nearest shadow, hissing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it struck the shadow, the creature exploded, sending black smoke spraying in all directions...before that very same smoke retraced, forming back into the shadow ones more, looking like it suffered no damage at all. It re-continued with its advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty shrank back, his confidence replaced with absolute fear, his eyes growing wide and mouth falling open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha pulled her twin daggers from her waist, adopting a battle-stance, saying, \"Alright, any other bright ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one answered, and the fox only shook her head in frustration. She decided to attack, going for the shadow closest to her with her daggers, aiming for what she guessed was its neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a impossible amount of speed, moving so fast that it seemed nothing but a blur, the shadow dodged Tabitha's attack. Its hand lashed out, grabbing the fox's upper arm with a iron grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha felt how her feet left the ground before she made contact with it again by her back. The force she struck it with almost made her lose consciousness, her daggers flying out of her hands, but she fought to stay awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha saw, through the slits of her eyelids, how Cassy and Marty desperately battled these monsters: the cheetah threw fireball after fireball, the creatures jumping easily out of the path of the raging inferno, and the horse swung her staff, the piece of food only passing through the monsters' dark body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood no chance in this battle, Tabitha knew with dismay, and they will be captured by this creatures. She could not imagine what they would to to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright flash of light erupted above them, so bright that it nearly blinded the fox. Unearthly howls went up into the night air, and the shadows began to dissolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as it happened, the ball of light disappeared, leaving the adventurers standing alone on the slope of the hill, the shadows no where in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing her head, Tabitha sat up, looking around her, wondering what just happened. Cassy and Marty were just as shocked as the fox, looking about themselves as well, trying to find whoever saved their lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looked like you guys needed some help,\" said a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind them, they saw a old man standing on top of the hill where their campsite was, wearing a cloak that concealed everything except his boots. His hair was snow-white, his face clean-shaven, his eyes a deep grey color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was smiling at them warmly. \"You are trespassing on dangerous land,\" the old man said, \"But you are probably another search party, unaware and uneducated about the dangers that lurch in these forests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Tabitha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll explain to you in time,\" the old man said, \"But first we should sit down first. I'm starving. Do you have anything to eat?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So you want us to travel more than a hundred miles to the south,\" John asked as the Kangaroo indicated the location of the castle on a map, \"Break into a castle that's supposedly loaded with magical traps and enchantments, steal this valuable object you still haven't told us what it is, and we're getting payed how much for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five thousand gold apiece,\" Ken nodded as he passed the map to Tabitha to examine more closely, \"With a bonus of an additional five thousand each should you successfully return with the item.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is...?\" John pressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret,\" Ken replied simply to the dragons growing annoyance, \"The map you have has been specially treated by my master with some powerful enchantments. It will lead you to the object he seeks. Whatever you do, you mustn't loose it. Or you will never find the object.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm guessing there's another reason to hold onto it?\" Marty asked, drawing the attention of all those present, \"I can feel the power in the map even from here. For such powerful enchantments you must be worried a normal map or instructions will not be enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true,\" Ken nodded, \"It's said that inside the castle, maps, compasses, trace spells, and other means of determining ones location are completely useless. Worse, the castle is rumored to be a maze inside, far bigger than it looks. With shifting passageways and vanishing doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not exactly instilling us with confidence here you know,\" Tabitha muttered as she rolled up the map and tucked it up her sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen shrugged, \"It's not an easy mission. You deserve to know what you're getting into at the very least. You should knowe I'm putting a lot of faith in you by telling you this much. My master would have simply gievn you the map and directions and sent you on your way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charming,\" John grumbled sarcastically, \"Does he also donate to charity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy gave him a dissaproving look but Ken just smiled knowingly as he avoided the question, \"The gold you recieved as a down payment should cover your supplies for the trip there and back. I take it you can be ready to go soon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll leave first thing in the morning,\" Tabitha replied, getting in ahead of John and surprising the dragon just when he looked about ready to tell ken where to shove his map, \"Marty and I will go shoping after we're done here for a few items we still need, but other than that I think we're set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" ken nodded, standing up as their meeting appeared to be over as far as he was concerned, \"I'll see you all when you return. Oh, and one last thing; as I mentioned the castle is quite hazardous. Many adventurers have attempted to penitrate it's magical defenses...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess,\" John muttered gloomily, \"None have ever come out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen just smiled and turned, soon leaving them behind as he vanished into the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have we gotten ourselves into this time?\" the dragon muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite the adventure I'd say,\" Cassy smiled as the companions around the table gave the priest a mixed bag of looks from approvving, to concern, to general disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost exactly a week later the quartet of adventurers found themselves cresting the rise at the edge of the planes. Far ibn the distance the golden sand of the desert could just barely be made out. Much closer, however, sat the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" John asked incredulously at what appeared to be a crumbling guard tower, barely large enough to hold a dozen soldiers let alone the vast riches promised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Clever...\" Marty mused as he scratched his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it!?\" John repeated growing a bit more irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's clever Marty?\" Cassy asked ignoring Johns rambling for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S IT!?\" John was litterally glowing smoke rings by now with every puff of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a clever illusion spell,\" Marty replied, \"I'm sure of it. The castle has been magiced to look far less impressive and unassuming than it really is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT'S... really?\" John asked the fire in his voice dying out so fast the girls did a double take at his mood shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm positive,\" Marty nodded, \"I can just make out the outline in the air where the real limits of the castle are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you undo it?\" Tabitha asked straining her eyes to try and make out the outline marty had spotted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately no, this form of illusionary magic is too strong for me. It would take at least a dozen average wizards, or even theree arcain mages to enchant a whole castle with a perminant spell this effective. But, I do believe I have a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into his bag he pulled out what looked to be an ordinary pair of specticals and put them on. Wavhing his hands in front of his face, the cheetahs palms began to glow. \"Now let me see... If I can tap into the same frequency of the illusionary magic... reverse it... and... there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing's different,\" Jon pointed at the small tower that was supposed to be the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not there, here.\" Marty pulled off his glasses and handed them to John. The dragon looked dubious but slipped them on anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word was as simplistic as much as it was an an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe castle stretched upwards easilly five hundred feet tal. And that wasn't even counting the two dozen or so towers sprouting haphazardly from the roof and sides of the building. The walls stretched away in either direction for what looked to be a couple miles. And looming right where the tower had been were a pair of impressivly tall oak doors carmed with all manor of runes and symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" John repeted as he pased the glasses to the girls as they slowly started towards the castle, \"Ok, good job Marty. But one question: This castle is by a major traiding rout, how do the traiders not accidently run into the invisible castle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a matter of one of the ten basic laws of magic. The fourth if I'm remembering correctly,\" Marty replied, \" 'Any spell that effects perception effects ones reality only so long as they believe the illusion', Hence, if no one knows there's a castle there, as far as they and the magic are concerned, there isn't. But for us, since we know it's there now, it should feel as real as a-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn 'Oof'ed as he suddenly ran smack into something that wasn't there. \"...Stone wall?\" The dragon finished a little cross but not specifically at Marty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" the Cheetah Mage nodded, \"Now we just need to find someway inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we break open the front door,\" John noted, \"That wood looked old and worn. i bet we could smash it down if we worked together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use your head John,\" Marty replied, \"Didn't you see the markings all around the doors? Intricate spellwork if ever I've seen it. We bash down the door who knows what sort of enchantments it might stick us with. maybe given some time I could try to decypher parts of it, but it didn't look like any language I could pick out at a glance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then what do you suggest?\" John replied, still sounding a bit on edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We look for another way in,\" Marty replied simply, \"The castle might be enchancted now, but it wasn't when it was built I bet. If we circle the wall we might find an old servants way in that's less guarded.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you seen how big this place is?\" John asked retorically, \"That could take us days just to walk around the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh boys?\" Tabitha muttered as she looked up at the castle while wearing the specticals, \"I think I see some windows above. Maybe I could try and climb up and toss a rope down for everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How high is it?\" John asked curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least... I'd say a hundred and fifty feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh, no way!\" Marty muttered waving his hands in front of him, \"I'm scared of heights. I get up there I know I'll get dizzy and fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could always tie the rope around youe waist and hault you up last,\" John smirked toothilly as Marty glared at the smug dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only one who hadn't voiced an opinion was Cassy as the three looked to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Cassy?\" John asked, \"What's your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't really have one...\" She admitted slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, which plan should we go with, you're the tiebreaker here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...\"</span></div></div>",

So...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty sighed and rubbed his eyes,\" It's ok, I understand your reasons. I don't like it, but I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha meanwhile approached the wall and felt the stone. \"Old, cracked, with crumbling mortar. Won't be easy but I think I can manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into her pack she pulled out some special spiked grips that she bound to the underside of her shoes. Then taking a dagger in each hand, she began her slow climb, working each blade deep enough into the cracks between the stone before hoisting herself up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took almost two hours of slow careful climbing before she finally reached the window. Locked of course. A few quick moments with the blade of a dagger and the wood around one of the small panes of glass was loose enough to pull free, reaching inside and unlocking the window, the others below had a surreal moment where a hole in the sky seemed to be open and Tabitha slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping to the ground she quickly took stock of her surroundings. It appeared to be a large bedroom of sorts. unusual to have in the outer chambers of a castle as opposed to inner chambers where it was safer, but perhaps it was a room for a servant of little importance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is what the servants in this place got, sign me up,\" Tabitha quipped as she took it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only was the room the size of a small cottage, but the four-post bed looked big enough to hold a large extended family, a walk-in closet nearby showed off what appeared to be hundreds of outfits, and the bathroom through another door looked to have it's own swimming pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only door not open was apparently the door leading out of the room. Tabitha wasn't worried about that for now though, first she had to find some way to get the others up to her. Uncoiling her rope, she found a large heavy chest of sorts she was able to tie it too. Even if the others were able to pull it to the window, there was no way it would fit through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTying one end of the rope to the chest she leaned out the window and called down. \"Looks clear boys. Now, how about we discuss how we're going to split the reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn flushed and started to sputter, but Marty remained calm. Just when it seemed John was about to blow his stack Tabitha laughed, \"I'm kidding I'm kidding! Here.\" With a flick of her wrist the rope rolled down the side of the castle to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn still looked angry as Marty put a hand on his shoulder. \"You know she was just teasing right?' the cheetah smiled, \"Ken said we'd each be paid individually, so there's no need to divide up a single payment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn still looked irritated, but that shifted to confusion as Marty approached the rope. \"I thought you were scared of heights?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Terrified,\" Marty replied casually despite his shaking hands, \"But at least if I go first then you or Cassy can catch me if I fall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't count on it,\" the dragon muttered, but the cheetah was already climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three dizzy spells and two minor slips, Tabitha helped haul Marty inside. As he turned to help Cassy up Tabitha decided to explore the room a bit more. The bed seemed to catch her interest for the moment, being the biggest thing in the room and she noticed three 'bell pulls' hanging over it. Normally the rich used such things to summon servants. But if this was a servants quarters, why were they here? And why three of them? Even if they lead to different places, she couldn't see needing three of them for anything beyond calling any servant from one location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy had just made it in and the mage and Priestess were just working together to haul up John when there came a sudden knock at the door.Tabatha glanced to Marty and Cassy. Here was no way for them to hide still hauling John up the castle wall, and the dragon was too far up to be dropped. The knock came again and Tabitha retreated to the door, intent on intercepting anyone who might come through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady?\" came a voice from the other side, \"My lady are you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a chance, Tabitha replied in the sweetest noble voice she could manage, \"Who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnexpectedly the door suddenly swung open. Tabitha brandished her knives but almost dropped them in surprise. The figure on the other side of the door was such a sight she honestly wasn't sure what she was looking at at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaller than John and almost twice as wide, the figure was also scaly but with bright red scales covering her face. And it was indeed a her. If the flowery blue dress wasn't indication enough, the enormous orbs barely contained within were a dead give away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my lady, it's so good to have you home,\" the female scaly smiled, her puffy lips parted in a wide smile, \"Everyone has missed you so much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha didn't know how to respond, and only was jolted out of her stupor as John was hauled in through the window, his armor clanking loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and you brought friends,\" the large female smiled turning to face them. It was then Tabitha realized why the female looked so big. She was fat. And not just chubby, but very fat. She would have put the wealthiest well fed noble in the country to shame with that girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you're probably all tired out from your long journey so why don't you all rest here and I'll be back shortly with some snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tabitha could say another word the female left, shutting the door firmly behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you were from around here,\" John noted with some interest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not!\" the vixen replied, finally managing to string two words together, I've never been to this place before, she must be delusional or...\" Tabitha trailed off seeing Johns smirk, clearly satisfied to have gotten under her skin again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what now?\" Cassy mused, \"We're inside but we have no idea where to go And we have at least one strange servant who seems to think Tabitha is someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could play along,\" John mused, \"She did seem eager to help. If she thinks Tabitha is this lady she's been waiting for she might be able to help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but one slip or indication I'm not who she thinks I am and she might scream for help,\" Tabitha pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Mark replied, \"She didn't seem to think you were anyone else in all that gear you're wearing, and that's hardly the outfit of nobility. Maybe she is delusional and really can't tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's still a very big risk,\" Tabitha sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what do you think we should do?\" Mark asked the vixen thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha looked unsure as she glanced about the room again.</span></div></div>",

Only John seemed like he wanted to say something against it, but even as a knight the dragon understood the value of information gathering over rushing blindly into some strange situation. So with Cassy searching what looked to be a writing desk and dresser area, Marty checking through the closet, and Tabitha examining the bed, John shrugged and headed for the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was, as expected of such a huge bedroom, quite the huge bathroom as well. Gleaming white tile covered the floor and every wall, gleaming metal faucets, a tub set into the floor that looked like it could hold ten adults with ease. It certainly was a bathroom fit for a king. John didn't know what he expected to find looking around in there but at least they were covering all their bases then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the moment to glance in the mirror John admired his reflection. His scales shone a deep forest green in the bright room and his twin horns were still bright and shiny despite their long days on the road. The only thing he didn't quite like seeing in the mirror was the second chin that he'd been growing over the last year or so. The added weight was certainly becoming a hindrance and yet he could never bring himself to do the added training necessary to loose it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the more he looked at himself in the mirror though the more he questioned why he had to loose it. He was strong and brave and could hold himself well in a fight. A few extra pounds wasn't going to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd a few more wouldn't hurt either...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn blinked. Did he really just think that? \"I gotta get a hold of myself,\" he muttered as he turned to continue searching the room. Though what he failed to see was the reflection in the mirror didn't turn with him and instead watched him a moment longer with a soft smile before fading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy searched through the desk and dresser, likewise uncertain about what she was looking for. So far the writing desk had turned up nothing but the usual writing supplies and she'd found a number of lace scarves, fancy gloves, and a box of makeup supplies in the dresser. It was all normal for the most part until she happened upon the jewelry box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside was mostly average stuff, a pearl necklace, some fancy earrings, a jewel brooch. but what really caught her eye was a necklace. The jewel in the center was a sapphire and as large as a chicken egg, surrounded by fancy woven gold designs. It was remarkably beautiful and eye-catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Cassy had never stolen anything in her life, so when she began to put the necklace in her pocket she wondered what the heck she was doing. She rationalized such a beauty didn't deserve to stay in a box gathering dust, but should be shown to the world, possibly in a museum or something. But a deeper side of herself knew she only wanted it for herself and she felt ashamed. Yet try as she might she couldn't bring herself to put it back and it soon found it's way to her pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continued to search the necklace was rationalized again and again in her mind even as she slowly started to forget about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty looked through the closet with some amazement. The walk in was easily a room unto itself, lined with a couple hundred clothes on either side. Most were fancy dress clothes, for both genders weirdly enough, but there were a few day clothes and more casual day wear hung up as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe far wall had a collection of various shoes, from the ordinary every day to the fancy dress shoes to a pair of simple sandals. The latter he'd picked up and was examining when there was a call from Tabitha in the bedroom. Not thinking about it Marty shoved the sandals in his satchel and hurried out to join the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha had been examining the bed and the tables beside it when she discovered a book in one of drawers. Pulling it open and flipping through she soon discovered it to be a diary of sorts and called the others over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think this is the diary of whoever lived here,\" she explained when they gathered around the bed, \"This could tell us loads about whoever lived here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go on, read it,\" Marty replied feeling a little eager as John and Cassy gave him a 'tisk, tisk' sort of look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha flipped through the diary to the last few entries. \"This seems to be where things got interesting. Clearing her throat she began to read aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'January 21st, 960...'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just forty years ago,\" John mused as he got the glares this time for interrupting. Tabitha cleared her throat and began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'January 21st, 960.<br>\r\n'Dear Diary,<br>\r\nIt's been a hectic six months but at last the castle is completed. Winthrop, the mage tasked with enchanting the castle, seems most pleased with it's design. Something about the passage ways and the walls being perfectly alined with... something. I'm afraid it was all far too complex for me to understand. But if he's happy all the better. He assured us the castle will be fully enchanted and protected by the end of the month, but I told him to take it easy and relax. No sense rushing the spells and making a mistake. Still such enthusiasm is endearing to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'January 28th, 960<br>\r\n'Dear Diary,<br>\r\nI had the strangest sensation I was being watched today. no matter where I went in the castle I felt eyes on the back of my neck. Winthrop says it's my imagination and the anti-scrying spells placed on the castle prevents any magical peeping toms. I've tried to put it out of my mind but I still can't shake the feeling something odd is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'February 4th, 960<br>\r\n'Dear Diary,<br>\r\nNow I'm sure something is going on. Last night I snuck down stairs for a bit of a late night snack and the kitchen wasn't <br>\r\nwhere it was supposed to be. instead I somehow ended up in the grand hall. I tried to go back to my room but I kept <br>\r\ngetting turned around. I finally managed to get back by dawn and collapsed into bed. I wasn't even sure if what <br>\r\nhappened was a dream or not, but this morning I woke up and was still wearing my shawl I had wrapped myself in <br>\r\nbefore seeking out. I'm going to ask Winthrop about this today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'February 7th, 960<br>\r\n'Dear Diary,<br>\r\nI know it's a little earlier than usual but I'm still feeling uneasy. Winthrop and I had a long talk two days ago. He explained how new magic can sometimes make a enchanted home feel disorienting and cause a few unpredictable results, but it should settle down. That I could understand, but then he went behind my back and hired a new servant girl to attend to me. I know he's trying to be helpful, but it just... I don't know. I know he means well but it feels...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'February 11th, 960<br>\r\n'Dear Diary,<br>\r\nFour days now with my new personal assistant Lina and I wonder about her. Not in a bad way, she'a always super nice and helpful and cheery, but just feels like she's trying to hard. Yesterday she brought me a plate of chocolate bonbons and said they were all for me. She's such a good cook, I ended up eating all of them just to make her feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'February 21st, 960<br>\r\nDear Diary,<br>\r\nIt's been a while I know, but I just feel like I've been lacking a lot of energy these days for some reason. It's harder to get up in the mornings, and even harder to stay awake through the day. Winthrop has been so nice, taking on the extra burdens of managing the castle while I'm having trouble like this. Hopefully it'll pass before long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'March 7th, 960<br>\r\nDear Diary,<br>\r\nI could swear I saw a stranger when I walked into the bathroom. It wasn't until after I yelled I realized it was my reflection in the mirror. What that really me? I hadn't put on that much weight surely. Sure Lina introduced me to the concept of 'Brunch' a couple weeks ago but that can't be it. My clothes are fitting a bit too snugly now anyway. I should ask Winthrop if he can fix that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'May 6th, 960<br>\r\nDear Diary,<br>\r\nWow, has it really been a month since I last wrote an entry. That seems like so long ago somehow... Anyway, not much happening here. Winthrop has taken over nearly fuull time while I recover in bed... Come to think of it I can't seem to recall the last time I was out of bed... Weird... Anyway looks like Lina is here with afternoon tea. I'll write more later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'July 9th, 960<br>\r\nDear Diary,<br>\r\nTwo months... That can't be right... What is wrong with me? I feel tired all the time now. I sleep whenever I can and yet I'm always tired. Lina says I need to keep my strength up and brings food whenever I ask now. Something feels wrong though... I'm not hungry all the time, but I feel like I could eat at any time now... Ooh... speaking of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last entry was so scrawled it was hard for Tabitha to make out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'December 15th, 960<br>\r\n'Dear... Diary...,<br>\r\nCan't... stop... so... big... but... so... empty... Need... more... Must... have... morrrre...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok,\" Marty muttered in the silence that followed, \"Is anyone else really creeped out by this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) Suddenly there's a knock at the door, the servant girl has returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) There a noise from the bathroom. It sounded like shattering glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Enough of this, best sneak out and find the treasure before they're discovered snooping.</span></div></div>",

The sound of breaking glass startling all of them more than it should have after the unsettling diary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was the first to recover and take point, moving up to the door as quietly as he could manage in his armor. The others followed, each moving as quietly as possible. Tabatha went first, creeping up to the door and opening it slowly to pear inside. At first nothing seemed out of the ordinary, but then she spotted the mirror that had been over the sink. Or rather what remained of it. Shattered into hundreds of pieces the reflective surface now lay scattered across the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a shame,\" she muttered after they'd checked the room and confirmed there was no one else inside, \"You rarely see such good quality work like this these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm more concerned about how it broke,\" John muttered as he carefully picked up a shard of the mirror, \"Glass just doesn't break on it's own. And there's nothing in here to indicate what broke it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA search of the room revealed no other indication of what might have broken the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs John bent down to examine the shards again though he was met with a sudden shock. All the reflections of him in every tiny piece of the mirror suddenly leapt up and out out of the glass. In moments there were easily two dozen miniature versions of John standing among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, as if one wasn't bad enough...\" Tabitha muttered seeing the numerous tiny dragons look up at the four adventurers. \"What are they anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark grabbed one of the smaller doubles of John and held it close as the tiny dragon wiggled in his hand, \"I'm not sure. They;'re definitely magical in nature...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, really?\" Tabitha replied laying on the sarcasm by the bucket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but the magic in them is fractured,\" Marty continued unhindered, \"Like they were supposed to be part of something bigger, but when the mirror broke the spell was shattered as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Cassy asked curiously as she examined the tiny doubles of John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic can only function when the spell is fully formed, that's why most spells have a beginning command and an end command phrase. Without those the energy accumulated dissipates harmlessly. Some wizards have found workarounds for that, combining both the opening and closing phrase into the start of a spell so the energy cannot be dissipated and the spell might be continued. The danger with that though is a spell that cannot be dissipated is incredibly unstable if incomplete. Anything that activates the magic could do any number of things that were not intended but could be derived from the original spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine it like this,\" Marty mused, \"Say I wanted to turn a feral cat into a feral horse. I need to establish in the spell every part of the cats body and every part of the horses body and link them via the change in the spell. If the spell was shattered with the combination command phrase at the beginning, then the spell would effect everything it touched in pieces. So a passer by might suddenly have his legs shift to those of a cat, or grow horses ears. A really bad fracture might even do worse by having things like the cats tail replace his arm or swap his tongue with the horses di-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU!\" John growled, \"We get the idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Marty apologized, \"My point is that these little copies are all fragmented pieces of the spell. They're incomplete, only parts of it. The effect of the spell must have been centered on johns reflection when he was in here earlier, but before it could fully activate the mirror broke. Now the pieces of the spell have formed as best they could into him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do with them?\" Cassy asked, as she looked over the tiny doubles simply standing around looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to take them with us,\" Marty sighed, \"It's too dangerous leaving fractured spells like this lying around.\" Selecting a handful of Johns doubles Marty slipped them into his bag. \"Everyone take a few of them, we can't risk putting them all in the same bag or they might recombine in such a small place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would that do?\" Tabitha asked as she scooped up a couple fist sized dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not certain,\" Marty replied as John and Carry split the remainder, \"But as long as they're kept apart for now any dangers should be minimal dealing with them. </span></div></div>",

Tabitha spotted cupcakes, cookies, brownies, cake slices, sweet breads, and a whole lot more. And that was just on the first shelf of five. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please relax,\" the large female smiled as she gently but firmly grabbed Tabitha by the shoulders and guided her to the bed, \"You need to rest after your long trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks but really I'm fi-gluh!\" Tabitha was cut off as the lizard female all but stuffed a cupcake down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you're not,\" the lizard female replied sitting on the bed next to her, \"Look at you, you're practically skin and bones. The journey must have been quite a difficult one. You should never have left home my lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me mam,\" Marty spoke up, \"But what journey are you referring to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large lizard looked a bit surprised at the question. \"Why the Royal Summons from the king himself. King Rothgar decreed he wished to meet with the lady of this house, and one does not simply turn down a request from the king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked perturbed. \"Rothgar was the father of our current ruler, King Halberd,\" John muttered to the others in an undertone as the lizard fed Tabitha another cupcake despite the vixen trying to protest, \"Something isn't right here. It's hard to place with the added weight, but this servant couldn't be more than twenty years old. Rothgar stepped down from his rule almost thirty years ago when he handed the crown to his son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible she's under an enchantment of some sort,\" Marty replied quietly, \"Though what kind I cannot say. Whatever magic might be woven into her is so subtle I can barely detect anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you not eating?\" the lizard females voice suddenly broke in on their conversation, \"Please, eat and enjoy. Any guests of my lady deserve the best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Cassy smiled selecting a brownie from the cart, \"We are most honored by your generosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh think nothing of it my dear,\" the lizard female blushed as she fed Tabatha a cookie, the vixens protests going unheeded, \"It's the least I can do for the guards who kept my lady safe in her travels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and Marty likewise grabbed some food, but just before they were about to take a bit, a faint sound caught their attention. It sounded like a straining, faintly ripping noise, like cloth being torn slowly. It took a few moments of looking around to locate the source of it and when they did their eyes went wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha by now had only been fed half a dozen of the sweets, but there was a noticeable change in the vixens figure. If not for her form fitting clothes they might not have spotted it, but now the ties that fastened her leather vest together were straining as new mass pushed from behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabatha was feeling shocked herself as she prodded the new mass on her torso that hadn't been there mere minutes ago. Her figure looked like she'd put on easilly twenty pounds, most of it seeming to have gone to her belly and constrained breasts. She winced as she felt the outfit become more constricting, even as one of the ties of her vest popped, allowing more of her straining blue undershirt to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy stood in shock, the brownie still held in her hand, \"How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty quickly shushed her and inclined his head away indicating they should take a step back and talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be the food,\" he whispered when he felt that the lizard female wouldn't hear them, \"It probably has some curse on it to make whoever eats it gain weight. Remember the journal? I bet that's what happened to the owner of this castle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we need to do something fast,\" John replied as another tie on Tabithas vest popped, \"She'll be too big to help us if this keeps going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea,\" Marty replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later they returned to the cart and pretended to eat the food, but through some careful palming of the sweets they were able to stuff them in their bags without taking a bite. The only problem was they had to go slow, or risk angering the lizard female for being to greedy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs such by the time the try was nearly empty Tabitha had fully ripped out of her leather vest and her shirt was riding up over a belly that made her look nine months pregnant with twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear,\" the lizard female replied seeing the cart was empty, \"You all must have been very hungry. I better go get some more snacks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she left Tabitha groaned and flopped back on the bed, \"Thank you, I don't know how many more of those sweets I could take.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're not out of the woods yet,\" John replied as he and Marty helped her up, \"We have to get out of here before she returns or we'll all be in trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that they half-carried Tabitha out of the room, Carry leading the way. The hallway beyond was large and richly decorated, with numerous doors leading off both sides. Taking the direction opposite the lizard female had gone, they moved as quickly as they were able, but after three more corridors and a half a dozen ornate rooms, it became clear they were lost in the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Tabitha groaned, her stomach still digesting the sweets she'd been stuffed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" John began.</span></div></div>",

A faint noise that couldn't quite be pinned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like... crunching?\" Marty muttered confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's coming from out bags,\" Cassy finally realized. John and Marty quickly dropped their own in concern. The answer to their questions soon rolled out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the miniature dragon copies of John had apparently been gorging on whatever food they could get their tiny claws on. It had resulted in some rather rotund reptiles too as the largest of them could no longer fit into their armor and then smallest were little more than scaly balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty checked the bags once the scare was over and was a bit surprised, \"They ate our rations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, now we'll have to go without food while we're here,\" John muttered sourly as he contemplated using one of his tiny doubles for a child's toy, namely a soccer ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" Marty replied slowly, \"I mean they ate OUR rations. The food the servant girl gave us is still here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA check revealed the same in all their bags. Every morsel of  food they'd brought with them was devoured by the once tiny, now bloated dragon copies, only the items they'd stuff in their bags to hide still remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too strange,\" Marty muttered as he examined the cupcake in one hand and the fat miniature of John in the other. Every time he brought them together the copy shied away from the food, \"Why do they not like the food from this place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he picked the least pudgy looking of the copies and put the small dragons face practically in the cupcake that the dragon began to eat it, but even then it was slowly and reluctantly, compared to the fast feeding frenzy the others had participated in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is too weird,\" John sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're not the one stuffed like a Christmas turkey,\" Tabitha replied, the vixen groaning as she rubbed her overfull belly tenderly as it pushed out between the torn remains of her vest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk at least?\" Cassy asked looking over her bloated friend with some concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" the vixen nodded getting shakily to her feet, \"It's uncomfortable but I can manage for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, John nodded, \"Then we better get moving, though how we're going to find our way around in here I'm not sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's easy,\" Tabitha replied, \"watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving herself forward to the next intersection, Tabitha bent down (with some difficulty due to her straining pants) and drew a small arrow on the wall right by the floor indicating one of the hallways. \"There,\" she smiled standing up slowly, \"Now we just check all the corners at every hallway to make sure we haven't been this way before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice,\" Marty nodded, \"That's sure to come in handy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn just snorted as they set off down the hall after stuffing the mini-Johns back into their packs. Of course, such an elegant plan was quickly doomed to failure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey'd just arrived at the next intersection and tried to decide which route to take next when Cassy looked worried, \"Um, Tabitha? This wall's already marked.\" The unicorn pointed to the same small arrow she'd just watched the vixen draw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how?\" Tabitha replied scratching her head, \"We've only walked down one hall, we couldn't have gotten turned around already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we did,\" Marty mused looking at the arrow. \"We went down the right hand corridor, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tabitha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now the arrow is pointing at the corridor ahead of us. That means that these two must be magically looped. When we went to the right we 'came out' on the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so by that logic the only path we can take is the one to our left now, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No we came from the right, so we're going left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want us to go right we came from the left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to go right I said we should go left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh will you two knock it off!?\" John fumed as he stalked over to the left hallway. Tabitha paused too make another mark as they entered it. But again the castle had more plans for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way,\" the cheetah mage groaned as he spotted the new marking and the old one at the next hallway, \"Both are looped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then how do we get out of here?\" Johns snout was emitting puffs of smoke to coincide with his irritation, \"There's a way in, there must be a way out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only think of one thing,\" Marty replied, \"We passed several doors in the hall, one of them must lead to new rooms and perhaps different paths from there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But which one do we try?\" Cassy replied looking at the identical doors that stretched down each hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could each take one,\" Tabitha suggested, \"It maximizes our chances of finding the right path.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll also separate us,\" Marty pointed out, \"And I don't want to be stuck in this freaky place alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll put it to a vote then,\" John decided, \"Split up or stay together.\"</span></div></div>",

On a given signal from John they opened their doors and stepped through into the rooms beyond. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha moaned as she stepped into what looked to be a normal bedroom. Her stomach ached from being stuffed as tight as it was and the constant moving she'd had to deal with since then had only made her more uncomfortable. The once limber vixen thief felt like she was carrying a rock in her stomach almost as large as her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began the slow process of checking the room for any hidden ways out, but more and more the soft looking bed called to her. If she could just lay down for a few minutes maybe she'd feel better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha had just about checked the whole room when she couldn't take it anymore and turned towards the bed, flopping face first onto it soft surface she was asleep almost before she realized how tired she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy meanwhile seemed to have stepped into what looked to be a dungeon at first. Various devices hung on the walls a padded bed with cuffs for hands and feat was in a corner, and a table was laid out with various 'instruments' that gleamed in the dim light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn healer would have turned around then and there if something hadn't caught her eye. It was a large wooden chest against he far wall, covered in golden bands of metal. On the lid was a splash of some metallic design with a strange vaguely egg shaped indentation in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without realizing it Cassy pulled out the amulet she'd taken from the room and looked at it. There was a distinct match between the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn took a step forward but hesitated. Did the chest just move? No, surely it had been her imagination and the dim light playing tricks on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was a little surprised when he stepped through the door. Of all the things he'd expected to find in the castle this was certainly not among them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reminded him vaguely of the knights weight rooms where they would lift heavy iron to build their strength. Here though the room was laid out with various strange forms of equipment combined with levers, pulleys, tubes, and various padded benches more resembling a modern gym than anything the dragon had seen before. It even included the full wall sized mirrors that encircled the entire room, making it look far larger than it actually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn wandered over to one of the nearby hand weight racks and lifted one of the dumbbells testing it's weight. What he failed to see as such was this reflection behind him turn and grin as it watched him from the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty was still grumbling a bit to himself as he stepped into the room. So much so it took im almost half a minute to realize where he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked like a library of sorts, but better than that, it was a a wizards library. Marty knew right away as he could see many old tome covered in strange runes lining the shelves. And where there weren't books there were jars filled with strange liquids or crystal balls on gold stands. The shelves were actually so tall they disappeared into the dark ceiling overhead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of the light came from a large stone fireplace set in the wall nearby. Besides that a small candelabra had been lit and placed on a nearby desk, as though whoever owned the room had only stepped out for a moment. And yet the thick layers of dust betrayed the fact no one had been in there in years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty unconsciously started to move towards the desk, the mage's curiosity getting to him. All the books around them, there had to be something worthwhile hidden away in this dusty corner of the castle.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John set down the weight and continued to explore the strange room. Lifting weights or occasionally testing the machinery, eventually he stopped in front of one of the mirrors and began posing. He was not narcissistic but still managed to be focused enough on his reflection that he failed to see two other reflections of him emerge from the other walls and slowly sneak up behind him. John was just looking down at his front and wondering if his armor felt a bit snug when two sets of green scaled hands grabbed his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What the...!?\" John looked back and fort between his grinning doubles, \"How...!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got his answer soon enough when the remaining reflection in front of him grinned and stepped forwards through the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smees ew evah a wen tseug ot yalp htiw.\" the reflection spoke, sounding strangely garbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tahw dluohs ew od htiw mih?\" said the double on Johns left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute but John realized the mirror copies were speaking backwards, each word reversed as though through a mirror. The original John struggled to get free, but two of his doubles was, as logic should have dictated, two times stronger than he was and able to hold him tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I yas ew niard lla sih htgnerts, ekam mih a ythgin-thgie dnuop gnilkaew.\" said the double on the right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Han, I was ew nrut siht tif nogard otni a taf bols.\" the one on the left countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teiuq htob fo uoy, I evah a retteb aedi...\" the third smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double lead the other pair still holding the struggling John over to a strange looking machine in the corner of the room. Unceremoniously the pair shoved him into the strange seat on the machine and before John could jump up large clamps fastened around his wrists and ankles, pinning him to the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let go of me you cheap imitations!\" John shouted at the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheep?\" the double that appeared to be the leader smiled, speaking slowly as if if he had to think about how to pronounce each word before he said it, \"We're not cheap. No, very expensive actually. Lots of work went into making such special mirrors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The mirrors?\" John asked puzzled, \"Then you really are my reflections come to life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than that,\" the leader grinned as he turned to the strange machine. \"Soon, much more...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn hadn't gotten a good look at the device before he was shoved into it, but now he could see the strange contraption was loaded with all sorts of pumps and tubes and weights. Far more complex than anything he could really understand. Perhaps Marty would have a better grasp of such things...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering his friends John gave a shout. \"MARTY! CASSY! TABITHA! ONE OF YOU GUYS HELP ME!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't bother,\" the double smiled, \"The doors are sound proof. None of your friends can hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that Johns struggles redoubled. He had to get free before...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CLUNK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Too late. The double had activated the machine. John winced wondering what was going to happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGears slowly spun, pipes thumped and John felt the chairs peaces separate. For a moment he thought he'd come loose somehow, but really the chair was just repositioning itself. John was now held flat with his arms out to the sides as if strapped to an inclined table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling his arms out to the sides and spreading his legs, the machine clamped a mask or something over his mouth. With a swift motion it brought his arms and legs down and back together, simulating a movement much like 'jumping jacks'. As his limbs returned to his sides though John felt something tense in his torso and then exit up out his mouth. The clear tube extending back into the machine showed what looked like a green mist leaking out and being sucked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever it was the doubles were happy but John was feeling legs so. He again tried to struggle as the machine spread his arms and legs again before pumping them down once more, again the feeling of something exiting his body was felt. John tried to struggle again. His armor clanked about as bounced on his frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait... was his armor... loose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was! John would have gasped if he could. His once snug armor was now a bit loose on his frame. He couldn't see his figure under all the plate male but something was definitely happening to his body. His struggles even felt weaker as more of the gas exited his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process continued for what felt like hours. Johns struggles grew weaker and weaker with every pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually there was a noise and the machine ground to a halt. John felt weak, really weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thguoht uoy dias uoy ndid't tnaw ot ekam mih a gnilkaew?\" Stated one of the doubles removing a jar of dark green liquid from the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Teiuq, siht si tsuj esahp eno.\" the leader replied as the remaining double brought over a dark blue jar, \"Won tel's tel mih ees tahw eh si dna tahw esahp owt lliw gnirb.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn panted a bit as the leader left and returned with another mirror. For a moment John was worried a fourth double might appear, but thankfully not. The trio set the mirror up in front of him so he could see himself as they removed his armor. What was underneath made John moan in despair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just weak, barely skin and bones. His body had shrunk to a sickly state. No muscles nor added pounds, just shriveled scales covering a painfully thin figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now,\" the leader smiled, \"for the next part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHooking up the jar of blue liquid to the machine the doubles seemed to set it in reverse. This time when Johns arms and legs opened wide he felt compelled to breathe in and the blue gass was suched down his throat. With the mirror still set up John watched as, with each pump his body began to fill out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not the same way as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon watched as with each intake his hips thickened, swelling out bit by bit to their normal size, and then bigger still. His waist remained trim for the moment but his upper torso began to swell. The dragon whimpered again when he saw the developing mounds on his chest as they grew soft and tender, pushing out into what could only be a pair of breasts. Even new hair began to sprout on his head. Long and read it curled down the sides of his face to rest at his shoulders. Even what little he could see of his face was being feminized as his jawline thinned and his cheeks rounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the doubles had apparently passed around the jar of green liquid they'd taken from John. Watching as the three drank it in turn it wasn't hard to guess the jar contained Johns 'masculinity' as the three began to swell up looking stronger, more fit with tougher bodies and a distinct bulges in their leather pants. Each gained an additional third of Johns size when split three ways, but that was still enough to force them to remove their armor as well to be comfortable. Interestingly their armor vanished as soon as it touched the ground, leaving three large musclebound green dragons standing in only their tight pants which left little to nothing to the imagination from the bulges inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn whimpered, he felt some tingling, almost shriveling feeling in his own nether regions. With a soft sequel his privates 'inverted' and John was now 'Joanna'. By now her breasts were heaving mounds any porn start would have been jealous of, almost as big as her head. Her thighs and huos were large enough she had to arch her back to lay against the table. Even her lips felt puffy and thicker than before, giving her a permanent pouting expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well boys,\" the double smiled looking at the now fully female dragoness in front of them. \"We've got new bigger bodies and a new toy. I saw we give them both a test run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna's eyes twitched, the now female dragoness wanted to scream as the three advanced on her, eager for their fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The now female dragoness was unstrapped from the machine and held tightly by two of the body builder sized doubles. Half carried half dragged, she was brought to one of the padded floor areas of the gym. Where the pair unceremoniously tossed her. John, or Joanna wanted to fight back, wanted to teach them a lesson, but she was still weak from the machine. Though just clenching her fist she could feel some strength slowly returning, if she could just hold out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time for some fun,\" the leader of the trio grinned, \"I call dibs on 'breaking in' this new toy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two looked like they wanted to argue, but at the same time, even two on one, it was clear that none of them would stay allied long enough to decide a 'pecking order' with their strengths evenly matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit yer grumbling,\" the leader replied as he removed his pants revealing a rather well endowed member and balls the size of apples, \"She's got three holes doesn't she? One for each of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to settle the argument and before John could move the leader grabbed her and rolled over, with him on his back and her above, the other pair positioned themselves in front and behind her as they removed their own pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Joanna wanted to scream, she wanted to flee, she wanted to pummel the three until they were gobs of mush. But the dragoness was a knight and as terrible as it was she recognized a no-win situation when it was staring her in the face. Speaking of which...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green scaled member bounced in front of her face a mere inch away. Her male mind still behind her eyes was repulsed by the thought of that thing going in her mouth as she tried to turn away. That afforded he a slap on the rear. Too late John realized the point of it but could,'t stop it as her mouth opened just a fraction it was enough for the manly double to shove the hard eight inches of meat down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Joanna gagged, mumbled and even tried to bite the meat in her mouth, but the dragon image just laughed it off. The other two were apparently jealous of him getting ahead of them and thrust their own lengths into their toy's 'back doors'. John wanted to scream as she was penetrated from both sides. It was incredibly demeaning and worse, her new female body was loving the sensations which only made her male brain more sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it,\" the dragon under her grinned as he began thrusting into her feminine sex and playing with her dangling breasts, \"You are our fuck toy, our plaything. You like this don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn would rather die than admit it, but his now 'Joanna' side was enjoy it as she suckled and slurped at the meaty member in her mouth. 'John' had to distance himself from that or he knew he would barf. The two mindsets though were at least in agreement about getting out of there as soon as possible. Strength was returning to their body, and while it might not be enough as a male, it might be enough to get away. For now playing possum was the best bet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Joanna gagged a bit at the taste of pre as she was forced to swallow it downthe other two in her rear began filling her the same way. All were quite potent too it seemed as none of them had cum yet and already she was beginning to feel full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe play continued, in and out, up and down, fondle, grope. And 'Joanna' enjoyed it all the while as she felt her own climax nearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one in her rear came first interestingly. Her tight hole apparently too much for the dragon as she felt her insides filled with a torrent of creamy seed. The one under her was only a few moments later and she felt her own orgasm mirror his as she clamped down on his spurting member. Even knowing what was next it was hard not to gag as the last stream began flowing down her throat into her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps this was her chance, while all three were drained from their 'fun' she could make an escape. But as the three came... and came... <i>and came</i>... John began to wonder if they would ever run out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready the dragoness body looked full to term with infants, and still her belly stretched larger from all the seed filling her. Her belly scales even began separating, showing the softer skin between them. Just when she thought she might burst before a chance could present itself to escape, the flows finally began tapering off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly she looked around for a method of escape. Luckily a dumbbell rack was close at hand. There was no way she could grab one of the bigger weights, but she didn't need a big one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that was good little toy,\" one of the three moaned (John didn't care to notice which), \"You're going to be wonderf-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*BAM! CRUNCH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore any of the three could react, John grabbed one of the five pound weights and using gravity to help swung it down in an arch, smacking it across the dragons face under her before bringing it up into the dragon in front of her's crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe double whammy was enough to daze one and incapacitate the other she was able to leabe to her feat off their members and make a break for the door. It proved a harder run than she thought though with her belly bouncing and gurgling all the way. Dodging around weight machines she could hear the roar of the three very angry dragons as they charged after her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpying her pile of armor and items she didn't have time to grab it all. Snatching up the satchel and the sword she dashed for the door. The three were closing fast though, so thinking fast she used the sword as leverage to tip over a rack of dumbbells that went rolling into a weight machine and caused the whole mess to topple back towards the three.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost at the door. The question was, would she make it or would the three grab her before she could escape and do something worse to the newly formed dragoness?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John/Joanna's hand was mere inches from the doorknob when there was a sudden and painful yank on her tail. One of the three copies had caught up to her and pulled her away. As she was pulled away from the door, John moaned in frustration as the chance of escape slipped away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingles sent up her spine from the pull on her tail caused Joanna to moan for entirely different reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith quick movements two of the dragons grabbed her again holding her arms tightly even as John/Joanna struggled as hard as she could to escape. She had more energy certainly but it wasn't enough to break free of their grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn this little slut,\" one of the images groaned clutching his aching member, \"She really has got more fight than we thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needs a lesson in humility, she does,\" muttered another with a cut lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got an idea,\" the unharmed third one smiled, \"I say we give her the 'moo juice'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other pair seemed to think it over. \"I admit I like the idea,\" the one with the cut lip replied, \"But you know what happens if it goes too far.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?\" Replied the third, \"If she makes it our little toy gets even better. If not, it'll be a well deserved punishment for this little slut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I call first dibs,\" the one with the aching balls replied, \"Damn bitch nearly turned me into a gelding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two smirked but said nothing, apparently not keen to dispute his claims for one reason or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more they dragged John/Joanna back to the padded area, this time tying her hands and feet with the elastic cords usually used for jump-rope or something similar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile two of them tied her up the third retreated to a corner of the room and returned with a large clay jug. Popping the cork from it he held the end under John/Joanna's nose. John tried to resist but the smell from it was already getting his feminine side moist again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" the dragon grinned, \"It's a special brew some alchemist cooked up years ago. Wanted to make the cows he raised far more potent. It worked too, but it had a few... 'side effects'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnceremoniously the dragon grabbed John/Joanna's mouth and forced it open, tipping the neck of the jug into it. The taste that hit her mouth was the purest cream she'd ever tasted. Incredibly soft and smooth as it rolled over her tongue. She tried to resist, to spit it out, but it was too good as she ended up swallowing a whole mouthful before gulping more. And more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey take it easy,\" the cut dragon muttered, \"You know what'll happen if she drinks too much, and I ain't cleaning up your mess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax,\" the dragon feeding her smiled, \"It'll just be more fun for all of us. Besides, this is a punishment, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two looked uncertain but said nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter John/Joana had swallowed maybe a dozen gulps of the cream the dragon backed off and put the jug aside. The dragoness moaned her already full belly stretched all the further as it gurgled in her lap like a big stretched beach-ball. Something was beginning to happen, her belly gurgled and bubbled, as though the contents had begun to boil. Her stretched scales bulged in places and rippled all over to make the boiling pot seem all the more apt in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust when she was wasn't sure she could take the suspense anymore the gurgling settled down, but it didn't stop entirely. Instead it began changing, sounding more like a babbling stream. Only where it was flowing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn/Joanna should have guessed as she felt a tingling sensation pass through her torso up into her breasts. The once modest sized mounds began to vibrate and pulse in a manner Joanna found most pleasurable and only served to arouse her further. Little by little, inch by inch her breasts began to expand, growing fuller and softer and bouncier as the twin orbs ballooned over her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males practically drooled at the sight, only the one with the bruised balls looked impatient. It was only when her thimble sized nipples began to bead with milk he couldn't wait any longer and wrapped his tongue around one as he began to suckle. The sensation alone nearly drove Joanna to climax as John tried not to think about how pleasurable it was to be suckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe males drank and drank as the other male with a cut lip latched on to her other nipple and suckled as well. When both gave an extra long pull as John/Joanna's breasts reached the size of pumpkins Joanna let out a loud moan in pleasure as she came again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen both finally pulled free, both wore the biggest grins yet. The part of the dragoness that was John noticed the male whom she'd cut was no longer bleeding. In fact the wound was gone entirely. And judging by the enormous shit-eating grin the other one was sporting his balls no longer ached either. John decided to file that away for later. Weird as all this was maybe something useful would come out of all this weirdness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the third began suckling and the other two argued about who would get her next John noticed something else. The six pack abs both had sported were faded somewhat stretched over new bellies that hadn't been there before. It was a long shot, but maybe if her milk was as as fattening as the drink had tasted she just had to keep them drinking as long as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to put on a show as John let his Joanna side take control for a bit, moaning and squeezing her breasts together for the dragon currently drinking. She fluttered her eyes, made pouting lips and generally made herself the sex doll the dragons wanted. The other par actually began fighting a bit harder to get the other breast and eventually a game of rock-paper-scissors decided things as two now eagerly drank from her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her show still going, giving it all she had, the dragons took it in turn to keep drinking and yet John/Joanna never seemed to run out. If anything her breasts were only getting bigger as they neared the similar girth of her belly at large watermelons in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while John tried to use her claws to loosen the ropes tied around her ankles first. Once those were loose enough she began work on her wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took nearly two hours but eventually she was just about ready. With all the gorging the males had done from her continual teases they were quite bloated. Each looked to be sporting a fat belly that could have held all of John/Joanna inside prior to her breasts swelling like balloons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of her breasts, each was more than an armful for her, Prize winning pumpkins would have been overshadowed by her enormous breasts. And each was tipped with a nipple the size of a drinking glass. If she was going to escape it had to be now before her mounds got any bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the males took a breather she again seized her chance and sprang up, wobbling heavily her first couple steps, but with her arms wrapped around her tits she made a jiggling dash for it. This time the males were slow and lethargic to spring after her, and she made use of those precious few moments by knocking over even more of the weight machines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly her gigantic breasts really helped as they had enough mass now one good turn was enough to knock over most of the machines with her massive mammaries. John/Joanna was panting heavily be the time she approached the door. Her sword and satchel were right there where she'd dropped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her bid for freedom was so close. She just had to make it or she doubted she'd get a third chance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This time she was thwarted, not by the doubles, but by her own traitorous assets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unused to her massive mammaries, John/Joanna hit the door breasts first... and rebounded badly. The impact from her massive chest globes forced her back before her hand could reach the handle. And before she could stop herself she was knocked backwards, falling flat on her back with her huge globes bouncing on top of her, knocking the wind out of her in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdded to the fact her head hit the edge of some piece of exercise equipment, the dragoness was badly dazed by the time the three caught up to her. She tried to follow what they were saying but the blow to her head and the loss of air was making her too dizzy to follow their words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point the three grabbed her and started dragging her away. She tried to fight back as she knew her chance of escape was fading fast, but still it was no use, and her struggles only hastened her descent into unconsciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness groaned as she began waking up. Her head throbbed from where she'd hit it. She wanted to reach up and rub her head, but her wrists were tightly secured, spread out far to her sides, each held apart by a long rod that pressed against her upper back and simultaneously pinned her wings down. Testing her ankles she found the same thing. She also appeared to be suspended by the rod on her back as her feet dangled mere inches above the ground,.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her eyes and for a moment thought she hadn't opened them at all. It took a minute to realize the room was just very dimly lit. Wherever she was she was no longer in the gym from before. Of course it was hard to even see the room beyond the massive mounds of scaly breast flesh <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like our toy is awake,\" came a voice reverberating from the darkness, \"It's about time, I was getting ready to start without her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of candles lit with a puff of breath from the dragon speaking. The light was barely enough to see by though and certainly not enough to see the edge of what must have been a huge room judging by the echo all around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the three dragons stood before her and Joanna wanted nothing more than to beat them senseless and take back what was hers... His? Her mind was feeling so muddles she couldn't focus. An attempt to shake it just left her with a pounding headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time, pet,\" one of the dragons spoke, \"Time to begin your new function in life. You won't be leaving this cave, ever. So you better get used to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoanna wanted to reply, she wanted to shout and cuss and swear her head off, but all that escaped her mouth was a faint whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See? She's ready,\" the dragon smiled. Handing his light to one of the others he stepped up to the suspended Joanna. The dragoness tried to resist, but it was feeble and useless as the copy popped the cork out of some container of strange smelling liquid and poured it down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long moment nothing happened, Then Joanna cried out as she felt something start in her stomach. Something hard was forming. Hard and round as it began to stretch her belly. It grew and grew until it reached almost the size of her head. No sooner had it stopped though then there was a faint 'clunk' as another orb began developing in her stomach. She moaned and struggled against her bonds as her belly grew but there was no escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe panted puffs of warm air as a third, and a fourth began to stretch her wider than she ever thought she could get. It was as she felt a fifth beginning to fourm that something in her seemed to snap and one of the orbs began moving, working it's way downwards. Unceremoniously Joanna lifted her tail and moaned as the large orb spread her feminine sex so wide she thought for certain it would break. Thankfully the orb slipped free and fell to the ground with a loud 'clunk'.The whole experience had been a bit painful, but also with a hint of pleasure she just couldn't pin down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joanna panted and tried to recover even as the next one began to move, one of the copies walked around and picked it up. As Joanna had suspected it was an egg. A Dragons egg and just as large as the feral dragons of old used to hatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm not bad for a start,\" the copy dragon smiled, \"Keep up the good work pet, you'll make a wonderful brood mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time Joanna was able to stutter out a word between moans as her next egg pushed out. \"B-Broo-oh-od mo-ooh-other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes. You are going to be the mother of the next race of dragons,\" the copy smiled, \"Of course it'll be a hundred years or so before the eggs actually hatch, but no matter. You should be almost done by then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Done?\" she gasped another strange spike of pleasure passed through her more potent than the last, as another egg began to move and yet she felt something stir in her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes?\" the dragon grinned with a nasty sneer, \"You're going to be the mother of a new race, so you'll need to make a lot of new dragons. Filling this cavern should be a decent start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness almost cried out as, even while the fourth egg slipped from her, it seemed three more had grown in her womb. By this point her burgeoning belly had begun to lift her ponderous milk-bags of breasts, causing them to slosh to either side as her straining scales struggled to stretch over her packed stomach<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it'll get easier soon enough. As you stretch you'll be able to hold and birth more eggs much quicker.\" The dragon approached again and put his clawed hand on her swelling belly, \"Why I'd guess in about a month you might be holding a few thousand eggs at a time and birthing a dozen every second or so. That should put you at a modest pace. How you don't dislike the sight of that belly of yours because soon it'll be all you're able to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragoness all but screamed in a mixture of small pain and huge amounts of orgasmic sensations resounded through her stretched body as two eggs slipped from her birthing canal at once as no less than half a dozen swelled her stomach almost to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, she's really getting into this,\" the copy smiled with false concern, \"We best leave the new mother to her work. After all, raising a family, let alone an entire race is such a hard job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that the three left, though they had placed the candles on the ground for Joanna to see herself with. It made little difference though. Long before they would have burned out her swelling belly smothered them and put out the light. After that the dragoness was alone in the dark, with only her howls of pleasure as she felt her belly growing bigger and bigger and more and more eggs fall from her rear with every clench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a brood mother. Even as tears fell down her face and she tried to remember her old life, more waves of eggs and pleasure flowed through her to block it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a brood mother. She had to lay eggs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a brood mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to lay eggs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrood mother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEggs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oohh...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>XXXXXXXXXX<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn Priestess looked over the wooden trunk with apprehension. True it didn't look particularly evil. If anything it looked rather intricate and worthy of an exhibition. The wood was not simple slats fitted together, but carefully carved depicting various figures marching up and down its sides with no rime or reason. And it it was so carefully sculpted it was lovely regardless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the metal bands that went over the wood had been placed so as not to disrupt the carvings. And yet they too were a work of art in a strange way. Rather than iron heated and shaped to the wood to cool ad constrict, the metal appeared to be solid gold, the edges hammered and shaped to look like intricate floral pattern and vines that wove around the wood. And in the enter of the top most and the gold stretched out in the pattern of a flower missing it's center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Cassy looked at the necklace she had grabbed in the bedroom. It looked as though it might fit into the indentation in the center of the flower. Curiosity burned within her and yet she had been sure she saw the chest move just a little while ago. Her rational mind cautioned her that such a box could very well contain a monster that was sealed away. Opening the chest without precaution was inadvisable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did try to take a proactive approach and scanned the box with every manor of detection spell she knew. However, while he could detect magic in and about the box, what it was let alone what it did was completely unclear to her. Again her rational mind told her to leave and forget about the box, or at least locate her companions first. But the more she looked at the box the hard she found it to turn away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost without realizing she was doing it, she stretched out her hand holding the necklace towards the chest. The gem slipped into the indentation perfectly. A moment later the gold along the chest seemed to flash and the whole thing shook. Cassy jumped back, all her worst fears racing to the front of her mind. But the box only made a modest 'click' as the lid rose half an inch and stayed there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nothing bad had happened for about a minute Cassy inched forward and carefully lifted the lid. The first thing that caught her eye was a note affixed to the top of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'BRAVE ADVENTURER YOU HAVE COME FAR, <br>\r\nBUT DO NOT KNOW YET WHERE YOU ARE.<br>\r\nTROUBLE BEHIND AND TROUBLE AHEAD,<br>\r\nNO PLACE YET TO REST YOUR HEAD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTROUBLE LEFT AND TROUBLE RIGHT,<br>\r\nONLY ONE WILL GRANT YOU MIGHT.<br>\r\nTROUBLE WAKES AND TROUBLE SLEEPS.<br>\r\nCHOOSE ONLY ONE FOR YOU TO KEEP.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then Cassy looked down and saw the contents of the chest. It was rather an odd collection of items. The first was a strange looking puzzle. She'd seen something like it on a trip she'd taken to a distant land. The intricate designs on it always hid secret switches that opened hidden panels and compartments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second was hard to decipher at first due to it's dark color, but Cassy realized with a start it was an enormous black pearl. Easily as big as her fist and shining with a soft light. An object like that could fetch millions back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third looked to be a strange elongated bottle green in color with an intricate gold stopper in the top. The was dusty and tarnished but there was also something strange about it. Like the chest she was almost certain she saw it move when she looked at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last was a golden bracelet, set with rubies and diamonds along it's top. Nowhere near as valuable as the pearl but probably still worth as much as a whole manor house back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly all of these items were enchanted somehow, otherwise there would be no reason to lock them up so securely. The question was which one should she take? </span></div></div>",

Cassy stood still in the room she was in, waiting for any confirmations of her eyes. After awhile, Cassy didn't see the chest do anything else. Maybe it was her imagination that was playing tricks on her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may want to check the chest for anything; who knows, maybe it'll have something to help us in our quest?\" Cassy spoke aloud. Strutting over, Cassy bent down in front of the chest. Holding the amulet in her hand, she carefully placed it in front of the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlowing with a dim,blue light, the chest popped open with a \"bang\". Cassy jumped back a little in surprise, taking her staff out and pointing it at the chest. She was ready for anything that came next. She may not have that many damaging spells, but she knew how to weather most attacks. Exhausting whatever was attacking her and her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy waited for a few minutes before cautiously hopping back to the chest.Looking down, Cassy saw a peculiar sight. An apple was stationed on top of a pillow, perfectly preserved. It glistened like a newly polished sword, its red surface alluring to Cassy. Her horse-like instincts making her want to get down and bite a chunk out of the thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, who left this amazing apple here ?\" Cassy's logical side speaking out loud. However, something clouded Cassy's mind, her logical side leaving her for a few moments. Her eyes focused on the apple, right before they glazed over. Reaching downwards, Cassy took the apple in her hand. Opening her mouth, she took a bite of the delicious red fruit. Chewing it with gusto and relish, her mind jumbled do to whatever spell that came over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting slowly in consuming it, Cassy then ravaged the apple, tearing chunks out of it. And with one massive chomp, she utterly consumed it. Cassy smiled in satisfaction, her previously full stomach felt lighter. She would normally questioned the circumstance, but right now she wasn't in a stable, state of mind. Stumbling out of the room, Cassy traveled towards another area. Leaving her companions behind in their explored sections. Oblivious to the consumed apple changing her body; slowly, but surely.</span></div></div>",

Occupying her attention to both that and searching for any more leads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knight to B4\" She announced as she opened, yet another empty room and nodded at the sight. Her progress wasn't showing any fruits to her labor and she started to think of heading back  the way she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unicorn snorted in her equine fashion as she made her way towards a final door at the end of the long corridor. \"I wondered what would Lady Tabitha would think if she came down this way? Cassy mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the final door revealed a <i>vast </i>room, causing Cassy to blink in response. Its ceiling was raised in the air by about 30 ft and its layout seemed more for a house than apart of a dungeon/castle.Slowly making her way in, the unicorn cleric could hear off in the distance the sound of a party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully did the mage walk throughout this strange area and could see the faint glow of light. Making her way closer, Cassy hid behind a wall and peaked her head out of its side. There, it what appeared to be an ruined noblewoman's room, were goblins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Squat, green, beady eye, little pests.</i>\" Which was the average adventurer's thoughts when encountering goblins. Cassy, however, thought of them more as a bunch of weird, little folk, who were wrongfully considered threats by other adventurers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh, geez, I'll just do a quick blinding flash and get past them quic-\" Cassy stopped as she felt her bottom half, feel, <i>tighter.</i> The unicorn turned around and neighed in distress to see the cloth of her dress-cloak ride up her body. Her cries was made even louder as the constricting force of her lower garments  suffocated her growing butt flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer loud sounds of terror alerted the goblins, who came rushing over to see who the cause of the noise was. Surrounding Cassy completely, the group of goblins stood still as they saw this weird, horse being grip its backside like it was a raging monster. And were even more perplexed as they saw its behind of all things gather up fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo particular goblins calmly walked up towards the horse being's backside and delivered a large slap. It neighed it distress and now seemed to be concerned with the horde of goblins around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice, goblins, easy goblins.\" It calmly stated, while the goblins watched as the beings butt still grew. It seemed easily distressed and the goblins began to laugh at the absurd site, which seemed to make the horse being even more placid.  That was right until one of the horde came around with something that fell from the being's dress and the once meek thing seemed to be breathed steam from its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblins of the castle would soon tell the tale of \"Horse-large-Butt, Steam breath.\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">===</div><br>\r\n\"To think I thought so highly of those pests.\" Cassy spoke out while carrying her undergarment clenched in her fist. Her butt wobbling as she walked and still slowly growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah, where does this place end?\" A voice belonging to one particular fox girl called out loud. Cassy stopped in her tracks, breathing heavily inward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods, Tabitha. I found one of my comrades. But can I let her see me like this? Oh, she already teased me enough when my posterior was normal, what of now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat could Cassy do?</span></div></div>",

The brief rest was what she needed after the stuffing she had endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she became more aware she tried sitting up. But found it difficult as there was still a heavy weight centered on her midsection. Finally getting to a sitting position and swinging her legs over the side of the bed Tabitha sat on the edge of the mattress and felt her still rounded middle, but where earlier her stomach had been taut and stretched with food the dome of flesh in her lap now was soft and squishy with fat and flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling up to her feet Tabitha waddled over to a full-length mirror in the corner of the room and surveyed herself in its reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer vest was now completely open in the front and showed her shirt underneath. Her breast were slightly larger under her shirt, and her butt looked slightly more cushioned as well, but her belly was now completely exposed as her shirt had grown too small to contain the fatty mass and had ridden up to rest on the shelf her belly now created for her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was now a near perfect sphere that curved out from her chest and hung heavily over the waistband of her tight pants. Sometime during her nap she had opened her belt and pants to relieve some of the pressure. But now her pants were too tight to button up completely due to her belly\u2019s new girth and size. Poking a finger into her bellybutton it disappeared nearly to her hand now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning from side to side Tabitha couldn\u2019t believe how big and fat her stomach had become and yet how smooth and blemish free it was. It was as if she were pregnant with pure fat. Her skin simply stretched over a ball of pure fat injected into her spherical belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never seen any woman before with such a fat and globular belly and yet with a perfectly otherwise skinny frame. Tabitha reached up and felt each of her breast. Yes, they were slightly bigger, maybe half a cup in size, but not much more than that. Inspecting her rear she had a slight extra cushion of padding. It would make sitting a little more comfortable, and gave her rump a slightly more pleasing look from behind, but she wouldn\u2019t need to buy new clothing from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would need new clothing to cover her fat pregnant looking gut however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing it with both hands Tabitha shook it and her belly wobbled like the sack of lard it now was. It was heavy and pulled her center of gravity far out in front of her. It restricted her movements and slowed her walk to more of a pregnant waddle. Looking side long in the mirror her belly projected far in front of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact was that although all or most of the food she had been forced to eat had now digested her belly hadn\u2019t gotten any smaller in size or shape. It had just gotten softer and flabbier and maybe a touch bigger. She looked over due with twins now. Two really fat twins!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell this is just great!\u201d Tabitha growled in angry tones. \u201cHow am I to perform my job if I can barely move! And how am I expected to hide with this ball of fat hanging off me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha tried to cover her bulky belly with what little of her shirt she could pull down, but each time it would just get pushed back up by her huge round belly. Her stomach was just too big and fat to be covered unless she found something larger to cover up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil then her belly would remain naked and exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around the room angrily she tried to find something that she could wear to cover her expanded midsection. But all she could find in the wardrobe was some moth-eaten cloth that was falling off the hangers. Giving up in frustration Tabitha adjusted her pants as best she could under the dome of her great belly and did up her belt as much as she could. Luckily it was large enough to still buckle under her newfound girth, and at least gave her oversized belly some support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat! Just bloody great!\u201d Tabitha growled.

Mistress I have some more snacks for you and your friends.

Thinking fast John got the dragoness\u2019s attention. \u201cMilady, perhaps you would like give me a tour, you mistress never mention she had such an impressive estate.\u201d John asked giving the dragoness a seductive smile. She looked at him in shock as if surprised by the attention, as she took in John\u2019s friendly smile she seemed to finally realize how handsome he was making her cheeks blush an even deeper crimson. Mustering up her willpower Tabitha pushed the dragoness and her sweets into her burly friend. \u201cThat sounds like a great idea John, why don\u2019t you two go have some fun.\u201d The Dragoness was flustered from being pushed into John\u2019s chest. \u201cOh mistress, I could never, I would never do something so forward.\u201d John responded by bowing slightly and merely put his hand out. The dragoness looked between John and Tabitha conflicted, but after a wink Tabitha, the dragoness regained her composure and turned to face John. She fixed herself up and eagerly accepted John\u2019s hand, as he lead her out the room. \u201cSo, shall I call you Master John.\u201d The Dragoness asked inquisitively, to which John replied with a chuckle. \u201cNo, just John is fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha waited for them to be a ways down the hall before she collapsed against a nearby dresser. She was relieved that she didn\u2019t suffer another stuffing session and started heading for the door, but as she passed the cart of treats she stopped in her tracks. One wouldn\u2019t hurt she thought dismissively and snatched a sweet roll popping it in her mouth. It was heavenly, made to perfection, its taste overwhelming her in satisfaction, something that only ever happened after a wild night with a studly stranger. She headed for the door licking her lips when she stopped again thinking of how hungry she still was. She grabbed a few more tarts and buns and stuffed them in her mouth, her stomach fattening slightly with each morsel. \u201cMaybe a few more for later.\u201d She whispered to her self grabbing an armful as she finally headed out the door.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ever since he left the dungeon, climbing floor after floor, walking down corridor after corridor, which seemed to never end (John understood now why that kangaroo said this place was a maze), the temperatures rouse steadily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was because the castle was built in the middle of a forsaken desert, but then it was suppose to be cooler indoors, wasn't it? John was beginning to suspect that there was something else involved here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he was still on his guard, John had placed his longsword back into it scabbard, for no danger had made itself evident. Hell, to John it seemed like the castle was completely deserted, which worried the green dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was his companions? Was he doomed to wonder these hallways forever, without the contact of any life? John throat was dry, and he swallowed. He was getting tired, his heart thumping in his chest and his breathing growing deeper, and thirsty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was half-tempted to venture into one of those well-furnished room, go into the bathrooms that they conveniently had, and take a sip if water. But John was wary of touching or using anything in this castle, for he never knew what contained a malevolent intent. It also didn't help that he could feel that something was watching him...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn suddenly stopped. At the end of the hallway was a big blue door. It was nice to see a change of scenery, but, at the same time, this change if scenery made John rest his hand on the handle of this sword again. After walking what seemed like hours down these corridors, the green dragon had no clue what waited beyond that door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, in order to progress, John had to pass it, and, approaching it cautiously, he grabbed the door's handle, shoved it open, and pulled out his sword, ready for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what did he find? </span></div></div>",

There was another blue door that stood opposite of the one John just entered with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was filled with crystal clear water, the light it casted reflected off the wall, and boy did it look inviting.

No, he had to continue, he had to find...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, what the hell is the point,\" John exclaimed, frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat was unbearable. If he continued like this, he could die if a heatstroke. He needed to cool down and fast. And so armor, weapons, chain mail, and under clothing flew through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was still hot, but, standing stark naked in the room, John could already feel his body cool down. Taking a quick look at the clothing and armor littered around him, the green dragon couldn't believe he was able to wear such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he dived in, John paused to study himself for a few moment (he couldn't resist, for mirror were everywhere). He was truly a big dragon, not only in height (he stood more than six feet tall), but in girth, too, being heavily muscled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, unfortunately, not all of 375 pounds he had were muscle. A great deal of it was fat, too, which resulting in him having padded limbs and a developing double chin. His chest, though, escaped most of the damage, and still had a muscular appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right under it was his large, round belly, which stuck out more than one foot in front of him. It covered his privates, which, unlike other anthros that had theirs hidden in a sheath, was exposed and dangling below his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's dive in,\" John thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving himself a running start, the green dragon cannonballed in, causing a large splash that sent wave splashing everywhere. John's head popped out from the surface, and he gasped for air. The green dragon smiled at himself. He never felt so refreshed in his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn swam to the edge of the pool, reclining against it, sighing, enjoying the cool water lapping against his scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

They threw down their towels and began to disrobe, obviously getting ready for a swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O, crap,\" John said, his eyes widening in surprise, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green dragon couldn't allow anyone to see him nude, for his pride wouldn't survive it, so he jumped instantly to his feet, climb out, and began to desperately scramble for his clothing. But it was already too late, for one of the cats, the shortest one in the group, had already seen him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look, sisters!\" she called, pointing a finger at the green dragon, who was pulling his tunic over his head, \"It looks like we have someone else who had decided to share our spot today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said another cat, who was the tallest, studying John's broad figure, \"He's quite an impressive specimen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now John was blushing so so hard he looked like a tomato. He was tumbling with his pants, cursing all the way, when he felt a hand gently land on his shoulder, and the green dragon grew still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was rotated like a bar stool, his chin grabbed and his head forced downwards, and the dragon knight's eyes met the intense gaze of the tallest cat. She was naked, her firm breasts curvy body mesmerizing John, and the green dragon could feel his cock stirring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush, big boy?\" she asked in a seductive tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn attempted to say something, perhaps ask who she was, where he was in the castle, and where he could find his companions, but he was silence when she placed a finger against his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you join us in the pool?\" she said, resting her body against his, her muzzle inches away from his, \"I'm sure there would be-\" she rubbed John's large belly before giving it a squeeze \"-enough room for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving him a chance to think, the green dragon was pushed and dragged towards the pool by the four nude cats, being groped all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, please,\" John said, but he was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being pushed into the pool, John was made to sit on the shallow end. Two cats flanked both his sides, hanging off of his shoulders, their erect nipples brushing against his scales. Another one sat behind him on the edge, her breasts resting on his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom all the nude women surrounding him, John was beginning to feel horny, his cock hallway erect. Before him stood the tallest cat, licking her lips and eying the green dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, hold still,\" she ordered, \"We will take VERY good care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn bit his lower lip. He wanted to break free, to say something, but he was paralyzed, watching as the cat approached him. His member was fully erect, throbbing beneath the water.</span></div></div>",

The ocean was not his best suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he'll get over it,\" said the handsome wolf who was rowing the boat, \"He has yet to earn his sea legs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name was Rowan. He was a charming youth full of life. The first time they met him on the beach he managed to charm Cassy, but he had a hard time with Tabitha, who was actively resisting him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll come around,\" he had told her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In your dreams,\" Tabitha told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip was mercifully short, though John certainly didn't seem to think so as he lost a little more just as they pulled up to the side of the large ship. Marty, in his somewhat know-it-all way, explained it was a Schooner type as they began climbing the rope ladder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The substitution of fan shaped rear pointed sails over the traditional square ones means a larger ship can be sailed by a smaller crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True enough,\" Rowan noted as he helped the cheetah over the railing just a bit roughly before being more gentile with the ladies climbing over, \"But as they say it's the quality over the quantity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shout down the way of 'Captain on Deck!' had all available eyes turn. This unfortunately meant Johns grip slipped just as he was climbing the rail and he would have falling if not for digging his claws into the wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hate the sea. Hate it...\" he grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might change your mind in time.\" John looked up and again lost his grip, though this time at least he face planted into the deck instead of falling backwards. Not without good reason though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow leopardess standing over him dressed in boots and leather Bodice over a white blouse was straining to support a pair of barely contained melon's that had to be bigger than her head each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grinned and said, \"So, you must be those landlovers that guy sent us? And hiding from how green this guy is in they face, you have yet to earn your sea legs. Anyway, I'm Captain Vanessa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn and his companions stared at her for a few moments, trying to comprehend the sheer size of her tits, before Marty stepped forward and said, \"Why yes, we are your passengers. You must excuse my friend here. He is....well, not used to all of this. Poor thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis earned Marty a glare from John, and Vanessa observed this with amusement. \"Very well, let me show you to your quarters. Follow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned, her tits jiggling, and strutted away<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does she handle those things?\" Cassy marveled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha immediately glared at John and Marty, expecting some smart-aleck remark. But Marty was just stunned in general. And John... well, the last of breakfast was bidding him bon voyage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a minute for both to compose themselves before they quickly followed the girls. The captain was already telling them a bit about the ship as they walked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard the HMS Solaris. Though we sometimes call it the ship of second chances. You'll find we might not be then most 'upstanding' of crews, but everyone is friendly and helpful enough. All the same, best not to misplace your coin purse while on board. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever crew member has something of a shady past. But this ship is their chance at a new life. If they really wish to leave that past behind they are welcome here to make a start of it. But if they just can't I have no qualms about pitching them over the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey climbed down a staircase, which led to the storage unit of the ship. \"Ship has two layers. My crew sleep in the bottom. It might get a bit loud and rough down there if there is a storm, just warning you upfront.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrew's sleeping quarters consisted out of bunkbeds, and Cassy marveled how clean it was, and Vanessa said, \"I keep my ship clean and orderly. The last thing I want is for disease to break out. I can't afford that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rambled on about her ship some more, but John wasn't listening. He saw a bed and his first instinct was to lay done. He needed to calm down his rumbling beer gut and throbbing head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dozed off. Though, he did not sleep soundly. His dreams were troubled and he tossed in his sleep.</span></div></div>",

Waves crashed all around as strong winds threatened to push him off the deck. Dark clouds sent down sheets of rain and yet he wasn't soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen came the slick wet slimy sound and John looked on in horror as several long, wet tentacles began to wrap up and over the sides of the ship. He tried to run, but his feet felt glued in place as the tentacles inched towards him. He couldn't even scream as they wrapped around him, pining his arms to his side. And yet others pulled his legs apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis suddenly pants-less legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he did make a strangled yell as one tentacle began to push it's way where nothing had any right to go. Another found his open mouth and dove in, making him gag as it wriggled down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was defenceless as he was lifted effortlessly off the boat and into the heaving ocean. He held his breath, though, it was difficult with a tenticale wiggling its way down his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world under the chaotic waters were a sickening green color, turning pitch black as John was dragged deeper and deeper into the abyss of the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the darkness was lit up with four giant orbs of light, but John had a horrified feeling that it belonged to an ungodly behemoth that dwelled the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, my love,\" an echoing voice spoke.

Then even that would transform into barren, dry soil, and rocks scattered everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temperatures would also rise, going from cool, to warm to sweltering hot. Finally, the heat becomes unbearable, if not dangerous for the inexperienced traveler. That's when one would reach the Canyons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dropped 200 meters down a sloping crevasse, the bottom dry but even, acting as a workable road. That was where the four heroes found themselves, walking alongside the moving caravans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a special type of caravans, though. Magical in nature, they did not require animals to pull them, since in such heat they would most likely have to stop frequently for rest, which would slow down the convoy considerably. Something that was very bad in a place full of hiding spots for bandits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, they were moved by a simple momentum spell, moving at 4 kilometers an hour, a steady walking speed. The drivers only had to steer the caravans with something that looked very similar to a helm of a ship, which turned the front wheels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a clever solution to combat the heat and keep the trade moving smoothly. Marty only wished John was so clever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of dressing as lightly as possible like the rest of them, wearing a cowl that not only provided shade but allowed a lot of ventilation and kept each of them cool, the foolish dragon had decided to go dressed in full armor. His reason being wanting to be ready for action should there be danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not last six kilometers before he collapsed due to a minor heatstroke. Cassy said he would be fine, though. <i>Hopefully he'll learn his lesson and stop being such a wise guy</i>, thought Marty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheetah mage continued to walk alongside the caravans. They had a long way to go, at least a hundred kilometers before they reached the end of the Canyons, arriving at the oasis town where there destination was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, they'd walked half that distance in twelve hours, and the sun was beginning to set. With no other lights it would soon become nessisarty to make camp for the night rather than risk traveling in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter traveling two kilometers more, it was getting dark, and they stopped to set up camp. The adventurers set to work at their task, keeping watch. Though, some were more focused on gazing at the night sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever seen a sky this clear,\" said Tabitha in wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I haven't, \" said Cassy, ''It's far brighter than even in the deepest areas of the forest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groan tore them from their stargazing, and they saw John lumbering towards them, clutching his head in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had wisely decided to ditch his armor, wearing only leather pants, sleeveless shirt, which fitted him rather badly, a few inches of his big belly exposed, and a cowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down next to his companions, and Cassy handed him a cup full of strange liquid. \"It's a mix of herbs, honey and a little alcohol,\" she explained, \"It's for the headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gratefully accepted and drank deeply, even if it burned his tongue and tasted horrible. It helped with the headache, though, and they sat around the fire, gazing at the stars for hours, unaware that they were being watched from the nooks and crannies of the canyon walls...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He looked at his companions, and saw that they were just as uneasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Marty shouted from the front of the caravan, \"We got hostiles ahead!''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn dashed forward, stopping next to Marty, and he saw that there were indeed suspicious looking beings in the way. They were kobolds, small lizard creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were four of them, armed with spears and barred the way.The caravans halted, and the four companions jumped to actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the got themselves ready, the kobolds uttered a shriek and charged. The first one jabbed his spear at John, who blocked it with his shield. The dragon then charged forward like a raging bull with his shield, hitting the kobold so hard that he flew backwards, doing a flip in the air and hitting the ground with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second tried the same with Marty, but the he only flicked his paw and the kobold's cloak caught fire, making him shriek and frantically try to put it out. This gave Marty ample chance to hit him with his walking stick, sending him tumbling to the ground, his cloak still on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third slashed at Tabitha with his sword, but the vixen danced out of his reach and delivered a roundhouse kick that knocked out a tooth and sent him rolling across the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his companions fall, the fourth abandoned his attempt to attack Cassy and retreated, shouting in his language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn stood triumphantly amongst his companions and shouted, \"Yeah, you better run! Go back to whatever dank hole you came from!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the group's victory was short lived, for there came more shrieks from the canyon, and more kobolds appeared. This time there were a lot more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKobolds were weak creatures, but in large groups, they were furious and formidable fighters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was dismayed, but got themselves braced for what might be their last fight. Just as the kobolds were heading in for the kill, they heard a roar that echoed down the canyon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came from something large and powerful, and that was exactly what dropped from the sky, landing amongst the kobolds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the black scales that covered parts of his brown, human-ish skin (such as his arms, torso and lower half of his body), to dragon-like features (such as wings, horns, muzzle and tail), it wasn't hard to figure out that this being was but one thing: a dragon-human hybrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised the group, for such beings were usually ugly, deformed brutes, hated by humans and real dragons, but this one was surprisingly handsome, standing even taller than John himself, who already stood seven feet tall, intelligence clearly twinkling in his bright blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like John, he was also pretty fat, sporting a large, round gut, but his arms and chest were bulging with muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled at the outnumbered heroes and spoke, his voice deep, intimidating, but his speech sounded like an educated and rational person, \"Since you are clearly outnumbered, I suggest that you give your belongings in the caravans freely. I swear upon my name that none of us would harm a single soul in your company. It will be such a shame to see you all come to such a bloody and violent end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn growled, smoke coming out of his nostrils, and he shouted, \"Over my dead body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hybrid sighed. \"You know what, let's make a deal,\" he said, \"One of you can take me on in single combat. If you lose, I get everything in the caravans and kill the drivers for good measure. If you win, I'll leave you to pass through with all your treasures and lives. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn grit his teeth. He promised to get these caravans safely to the nearest town, and he wasn't going back on his word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut his companions were thinking otherwise. \"I think we should give up,\" said Marty, \"I mean, look around you. We are outnumbered ten to one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coward!\" snapped John, \"I can take this hybrid and all of his wannabe reptiles all by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your stubbornness and pride talking,\" said Cassy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Tabitha cut in, \"I mean, even if you took this guy on one on one, he'll beat you to a bloody pulp. Look at him! He twice your size and stronger than you. Are you honestly gonna risk your life and others just to satisfy your ego?''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn glared back at the hybrid, who flexed his impressive chest in response. He bit his lower lip, realizing he was face with a big decisions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he surrendered, the caravans will be robbed and his group will not receive a single dime for the work, most likely getting fired as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if he took on the hybrid in single combat and lost, not only will the caravans be robbed but innocent lives will be harmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth options were a lose lose situation, but the latter offered at least some chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did John decide to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began to stuff his face, icing smearing his chubby cheeks and snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not notice himself swelling bigger, his armor popping off.... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs pieces of his armor started to pop off, he tried to stop eating to investigate, but the cake was so sweet and delicious than anything he ever ate. He simply had to finish it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finish that steamy pile of ribs drench in mouth watering sauces as well.  Aaand maybe that large stack of pies too, perhaps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued his mindless binge, the remaining armor pieces fell off in audible pops, leaving John in nothing but a stretch undergarments containing his swelling bulk.  The other occupants waddle out a while ago, receiving orders from their master to carry them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the last piece of juicy food went down his gullet, John snapped out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he notice how big he was. He was way past obese. He was morbidly so. His belly hung well over his waist, a doughy ball of flesh that gurgled loudly. He could feel his underwear straining across his broad hips and fat butt, his nipples on his flabby moobs painfully erect for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn panicked and ran.....well, waddled as fast as he could, wanting nothing more but to get away from this cursed kitchen.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He appeared to be in some bathing chamber, hot pools of water filling it with steam, resulting in a thick mist that was hard to see through clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And he was not alone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the steam, John was able to pick out large hulky figures in the baths. He gulped and sweated, not from the heat but from the dread of facing one of these brainwashed warriors in combat without armor or any weapon. He was defenceless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to back away, to escape, but John suddenly felt a presence behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He whirled around, ready to face his enemy, but his weight made him stagger and fall to the ground, his underwear splitting open. This alerted the other guards, who immediately went to investigate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked up in fear at the hyper muscular fox before him, his three feet long cock throbbing happily at the sight of this fatass. He towered over him, grinning. \"And what do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the rest arrived, who grew aroused at the sight of this fine butterball of a dragon. John gulped as he became surrounded by huge hunky soldiers of the overlord.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It all, thankfully, ended quickly, with him landing onto a large cushioned surface.  Dazed, he looked around to see he was on a bed in a large and extravagant chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn also notice on the left wall that their was a large collection of plush dolls of various animals. Plush dolls that ranged from being buff to rotund.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that John noticed the naked hunk of a wolf with a devious smirk on his face across from him, his large cock erected and leaking pre-cum. A large swollen dragon plush doll that looked a lot like him floated behind the horny wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn growled. \"So you are the one behind this?\" He said in anger. \"When I get my hands on you.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll what!\" Snapped the wolf lord, \"You are a fatass, too big to move. What are you going to do? You are at my mercy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey plush toy began to swell bigger and so did John, who cried out in horror. \"See, you are in the palm of my hand,\" said the wolf lord, \"Though, I want to toy with you more. I wonder how you would look and act a bit.....stupider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of the John plush doll gained a glow and suddenly John felt light headed.   \"What you done!?\" John asked as his intelligence began to leave him, his voice deeper due to the adding pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overlord laugh mockingly as he climbed onto the bed, John  trembling with bouth arousal and anger.  \"YOU STOP IT!!!\" Whatever sign of a sophisticated dragon John once was no longer present in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, nope,\" the lupine overlord simply said, flipping John over, giant fat scaly ass wobbling in front of him now.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is a basic DnD-esq fantasy adventure story with a twist. All the characters are anthros (but that's not the twist), who travel to various locations in search of magic treasures (but that's not the twist), and along the way run into a number of curses that alter their bodies in strange ways. <i>That's</i> the twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor our heros:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn - Self-proclaimed leader of the group. A green dragon knight with golden belly scales who's a little heftier than he should be, a little bit quick to temper and a bit on edge but with good intentions. Dressed in full plate mail <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarty - A mage of moderate skills. A cheetah in species Mark is the most knowledgeable of the group when it comes to basic spells and lore. A bit of a sass when it comes to John and sometimes a little bit of a know-it-all, Marty just wants to take the most logical path most times. Dressed in purple wizard robes, for storing his potions, and a large brimmed hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassy - A priest and a white unicorn. Proficient with healing spells and knowledgeable about ancient (and modern) gods and religions. Cassy is the most forgiving, easily the most patient of the group and has never done a bad thing in her life. Under that sweet exterior though she'll do anything to help her friends. Dressed in long flowing white robes with golden trim and sashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTabitha - A vixen thief. This rogue is proficient at stealing and has handled many tough jobs in the past. She's used to going solo but has an honor code that won't let her turn her back on others of the group. Best at feeling out traps and secret passage ways, she's top notch when it comes to stealth. Can steal anything from just about anyone. Dressed in a dark cloak and vest with twin daggers at her disposal as well as an array of typical thief gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry to keep the characters at least similar to the types established in early chapters. Character growth I do welcome, but keep it subtle and don't just have someone act out because 'it was cool'. Try and follow the set down characters and grow them in similar ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOTE: This story is also being written on FurAffinity.net as a 'vote for the next chapter' thing I'm writing. If a chapter ends in [RESERVED] that means I am writing that path. Chapters posted there will be deleted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, if you're interested, come vote on my path on Furaffinity. <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/drakin/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/user/drakin/</a>  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHighest votes tell me what to write next. And once the decision is made I'll open the other for the previous chapter on here, to be continued as any writer wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, some simple etiquette. I expect good grammar and spelling. Not perfect, since everyone makes mistakes, but make an effort. And no short 'OMG THEY CHANGE THIS WAY' chapters. Anything with a word count less than five hundred AND is poorly written I will delete. If it's well written and too short I will give the author warning and send them a copy of the chapter before deleting it so they may have a chance to expand on it and post again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to be fare and give everyone a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, while this interactive is open to anything just about, I do have three basic rules. Nothing gross. Nothing excessively violent. Nothing depraved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo elaborate: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Gross:</u> is anything like fluids that are stinky, gooey, sticky, or just overall you wouldn't want to touch. (some exceptions can be made to this given the right situation such a goo monsters or jelly beings.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Excessively violent:</u> is not <i>just</i> cutting off an enemy's head, but bathing in their guts or something. That's going too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Depraved:</u> is anything that would make most sick, such as finding sexual thrills with dead body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep all these NO's in mind and everything should be alright.</td>",
