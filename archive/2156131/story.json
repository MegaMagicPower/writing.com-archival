            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Welcome to alpha One. You're on board the first human ship sent from earth to colonize Alpha Centauri. You've been in space for a little over a year with your five other shipmates. You chose to leave behind your old life for your own reasons, ad so did they. You didn't bother with their backstories much, and neither did they save for a few of them. Beckard and May enjoyed sharing stories from their pasts. Before recruiting, May was married but lost her wife to a car crash and was on suicide watch fro two years. Beckard was a drughead for cocaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at them now, you realized it wasn't obvious at all they had such horrible stories, but you supposed that if they knew your past, they'd think the same. Now you were a doctor for ship hurdling through space set for a one-way path to a foreign planet to settle down and prep the world for future settlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were settled in the far back of the cockpit with May and Captain Lance. Despite being a doctor you were also right hand to the captain and were highly experienced in piloting a ship and fightercraft if needed. May requested to learn the basics in your downtime, and you had a lot of that. You were listening in, piping up ever so often when Lance would glance at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blip appeared on your screen. It flashed at the normal pace, but it was quickly drawing closer towards your location on the radar. Lance was already seated at his station, pulling up the radar and scanner on the hologram screen in the middle of the aisle. As the scanner did its work, the image of the oncoming ship appeared to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's impossible.\" Lace whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That says the oncoming ship is... 300 miles long. Are the calculations wrong?\" You questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those calculations aren't wrong. Look!\" Mary pointed out the window.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you was a supposed 300 mile-long ship that made yours look like a flea and it was quickly growing closer. You were either going to crash into it leaving not even a scratch, or you would have to make quick moves to get you freed. Lance was running calculations and Mary was panicking. That left you in charge of getting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, you grabbed the piloting controls and thrust them into \"manual\". You increased the speed and trajectory of your glide through space, arching the ship upwards. You twist the ship to the left, throwing Mary off balance and all the loose objects slid on the floor. You commanded Mary to flip off the gravity to keep things as still as possible. The ship groaned at the max speeds. A empty coffee cup floated past your head as the ship pulled up further. Just as you were cornering around the side of the large ship, the Alpha lurched and stilled mid air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! What's happening?\" Mary screamed, her hair floating in each direction and she huddled mid-air slowly towards the closed door to the halls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magnetic pull...\" Lace and you quipped in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you believe it, that ship's so large, its producing its own gravitational pull around the exterior. If it was small and we were a fightercraft we'd have a chance at escape. we're doomed like this.\" Lace flipped on the gravity, sending Mary to the floor. The coffee cup near you fell to the desk on its side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Mary asked, rubbing her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wait.\" You spoke up. \"They've definitely been alerted to us now that we're in their pull. They'll either open the cargo door and take us in, or let us crash into them since we're so small. And if they do take us in... there's no telling what they'll do to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so the waiting game began. Just as you said, the cargo door opened and eventually you were deposited on their cargo bay floor. From the front window you spotted boxes and crates larger than your ship. Further away you spotted three figures looming by the door to the rest of the ship. You couldn't see anything but silhouettes of their forms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crew ran in quickly, screaming about what happened but quieted down when they spotted the figures. They quickly went back to yelling and panicking. Lance stood and yelled for them to quiet. He began demanding orders and telling everyone to suit up quickly to confront these captors. Thankfully you were already in your jumpsuit, as you wore it nearly ever day. By the time they had finished up getting in gear. the figures had moved closer but still kept away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you step out of that ship now. We won't wait any longer.\" A voice from from one of the figures commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard him. Lets go. I'll go first. Crow behind me. You're my right hand so you'll stay at my side. The rest of you file behind us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you leave the ship your eyes move to the three figures waiting. They were tall, human like, but not quiet; they were more animal-like, but stood on their hind legs and built similarly to humans. Fur covered all over the first two while the third was covered in feathers. Snouts and paws took the place of mouths, hands and feet. The third had a beak and talons. His hands were normal, and on his back were black wings that matched the rest of his skin and feather color. The first two, you realized were a dog and and a lion, while the last was some type of black bird. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and the group filed before them, a great distance away to look up at the probably mile high furs.  The lion spoke first addressing Lance easily. \"You are the captain, yes?\" Lance nodded. \"Good. I'll get to the point. We don't plan to harm you. If fact, we'll let you go if you would rather. We're a curious bunch of course, so we wanted to investigate the <i>flea</i> that got stuck to your magnetic pull. Our names here are rather easy. We go by what breed we are. I'm Lion, that there is Lab, and my right hand is Crow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snickered. Quickly you tied to muffle it but Lance beat you to it, literally, by elbowing you in the gut firmly. \"My apologies for his behavior. My name is Lance, and this is my right hand, <i>Crow</i>.\" He quickly listed out the names of the rest of your crew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How humorous.\" The large crow spoke stoicly. You almost spotted a sneer on his lips- er, beak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you traveling to, Lance?\" Lion questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alpha Centuri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, our home? Are you planning to inhabit it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that was our plan. We hadn't realized there was other life living on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's plenty of room on such a large planet. Our population is still small and recovering from our original home planet being destroyed.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unfortunate. I'm sorry. How far did you have to travel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let's just say our only option was cryostasis. Say, why don't you stay aboard with us for the remaining of your trip? Each of your crew can shadow mine so they'll be familiar with their environments and learn about our technology.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well, it would certainly save us the trouble of running into other spacecrafts. We don't want to risk running into a less friendly ship either.\" Lance looked to you, asking for your thoughts. You expressed your indifference to the situation, letting him choose. \"Well, my right hand appears to be alright with it. So we'll accept.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent! You and your crew can follow me. Crow will have follow... Crow to register your ship and personal data into our systems, but they will be able to join us later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone seems to go along with the lion, quickly heading to the large door. You eye the large crow staring down at you.... hungrily? You imagine him licking his lips if he had any. You suddenly started having distaste for the bird, and realized it was mutual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Let's go. I haven't had lunch yet and now I've got to deal with a pesky human.\" He turns away quickly, his talons clacking on the floor. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you followed after Crow, you noticed his black feathers ruffled and swayed to his lithe movement. His form-fitting, navy space suit allowed for mobility, breath room, and easy access to putting on a space pack as well as taking off the whole thing, all while keeping his feathers neatly aligned and out of the way of being crumpled. You noticed a tail on his hind that twitched or fanned out slightly occasionally. Rather than wing tips for hands, he had a set of leathery hangs that were partially covered in feathers that gradually got more dense and larger as they placed along his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're stopping for a snack on the way to my room.\" He spoke at you suddenly. He hadn't stopped moving, only turned his head over his shoulder to glance at your straying form. \"And keep up. I'm not searching for you if you get lost.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded quickly, keeping up with his pace. Eventually you two reached an area you deemed a kitchen. It looked essentially like a normal kitchen you had on your ship, aside the a few strangely shaped appliances on the counters. Everything was a bit more high-tech and the writing on each object in the room was foreign, but you assumed the idea was the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow stilled near a table and looked down at you as you neared him. \"counter or table? I'll mostly be by the counters so if you choose there, then you'd better stay out of my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought on that. Getting in his way was a bad idea for several reasons, but it would open the door for you two to talk and learn more about each other. Or you could choose an unspoken idea of staying on the floor to explore, but you had no idea what was safe in this ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The counter. I'll stay out of your way. Set me somewhere up there that will be easiest for you and I'll stick to that area.\" You finally decided. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk appeared on Crow's beak. Suddenly you were in his hand. He's much faster with moving then you thought. You imagined his reflexes piloting. Being in his talon-like hand was bizarre, but also comforting. His sheer size scared and fascinated you. The warmth radiated from his hand, warming your sides where his fingers restrained you. He was surprisingly gentle despite his rough attitude. Suddenly the warmth and tight hug of his hand was gone, and you were on your hind on the chilly counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow had already begun prepping food. You wondered if he would share. The idea of him sharing food with an ant-sized human made you chuckle.  This was your chance to ask him questions or talk about anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could ask about him, his race, his skills as a pilot, and whatever he would actually share. He didn't seem like the type to share much but maybe if you pushed a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr you could ask about his planet and species. Maybe you could learn a bit about the history and technology of his people. Maybe he'd be interested in learning about your species too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should ask about food. You had been planning to grab food one you exited that meteor belt until you ran into his ship. Your stomach was starting to grumble and complain. How long has it been since you ate? </span></div></div>",
