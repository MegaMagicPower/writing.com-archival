Muffled tremors interrupt your less imprisoning moments.  Rough denim penetrates the thin membrane of cotton at your front, harshly massaging your fragile facial features.  The fleshy stench is amplified by the sweat permeating through the back wall of your pitch black cell and into your absorbing body.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a vain effort to distract yourself from this constant state of discomfort, you give thought to the question of how Jeannie could do such a thing to you.  Seriously, such a thing shouldn\u2019t even be physically possible!  Yet here you stand, approximately three inches tall by your brief estimation, proving conventional science wrong.  If you weren\u2019t so terrified, you would probably be proud of such an accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long and unenviable while, the torturous pattern ceases.  The ceiling of your dark prison splits, allowing light to intrude onto the scene.  Taunting prodigious fingers slip through the opening, wiggling anxiously as they home in on your position.  A hard, red shell punches your chest.  A much softer, but no less gentle, olive padding conforms to your shoulder blades as it merges violently with your back.  Your two assailants attempt to connect, squeezing your lungs dry of carbon dioxide.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising toward the illuminating hole, your legs frantically search for ground to tread upon.  Your arms flail in desperate protest.  It feels as though your frenetically pulsating heart could burst at any moment.  As you make your involuntary exit, the immediate exposure to brightness blinds your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting to their new environment, your eyes take in only blurs of seemingly random color at first.  Gradually, your sight restores, revealing your captor\u2019s weaving red hair surrounding her face as it drapes slightly past her narrow shoulders.  You take notice of Jeannie\u2019s deep blue eyes as they fixate on your pathetic form with great intrigue.  You stare back in awe, discontinuing all other actions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour elevation suddenly begins to decrease in an angular motion.  A shooting movement throws you away from Jeannie, her slender, golden tanned tentacles releasing their grip on you.  A strong gust of wind builds under your plummeting body.  Your vocal cords start to emit a feeble shriek, but your backside collides with a smooth, yet unforgiving surface before the sound is able to leave your throat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull yourself to your feet, the oaken platform decorated by onyx swirls serving as a welcome change from the flimsy fabric of your former holding place.  Your attention returns to the gargantuan woman before you, her busty chest, dressed in light blue fabric, hanging just above eye level.  You strain your spine to look beyond this...distraction as you converse with Jeannie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d, Jeannie\u2019s voice retains its sweet tone, despite its dramatic increase in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow...how could you do this to me?\u201d, you ask, ignoring her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie\u2019s monstrous arms emerge from under the table on which you are standing, setting themselves on either side of your location.  They stretch the entire length of the table, and their width could support two lanes of traffic each.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQuite easily, really\u201d, Jeannie answers, \u201cI used to shrink people all the time\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did?!\u201d, you exclaim with a mixture of curiosity and fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk crosses Jeannie\u2019s plush red lips, \u201cYeah, it used to be so much fun, but it got old after a while\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOld?\u201d, you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie continues unabated, \u201cI mean, stepping on little men, grinding them into the ground, was empowering at first, but it got real boring real quick.  Besides, do you have any idea how hard it is to clean that stuff off of my shoes?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shudder as your imagination visualizes the scene Jeanie describes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c And sure, I admit it was great to crush tinies in my fist\u201d, Jeannie gazes down at her now clenched hands, \u201cbut they always made such a sticky mess in my hand.  It was kind of gross\u201d.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c....\u201d, you can\u2019t find the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI even tried eating some of the little ones.  They tasted horrible!  I actually choked on one I swallowed whole.  That puny jerk just wouldn\u2019t stop wiggling around in my throat.  Can you believe the nerve of some people?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what are you going to do to me?\u201d, you force out of your mouth, eager to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u201d, Jeannie pauses, presumably for effect, \u201care going to play a game with me\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA...game?\u201d, you are unsure how to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u201d, Jeannie confirms, \u201cA game.  You\u2019ve heard of Hide and Go Seek, haven\u2019t you?\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, so you want me to hide?\u201d, you say with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNoooo\u201d, Jeannie\u2019s voice upswings, \u201cI want you to seek.  You see, I\u2019m going to leave you in this hotel room.  If you can find me, I\u2019ll change you back to normal.  That\u2019s it!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d, you echo skeptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie\u2019s petite chin swoops towards you with great haste.  Her cutely rounded nose stops just inches from prodding your chest.  Instinctively, you take a step back.  Uninstinctively, your feet trip over themselves, causing you to fall over backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course that\u2019s not it!\u201d, Jeannie tries to state seriously, but can\u2019t help but giggle at her own silliness, \u201cYou have to bring a...replacement with you.  A female replacement, to be exact\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand yourself back up, and before you can get a word of complaint in, Jeannie asks, \u201cSo, are you ready?\u201d.</span></div></div>",

No, you had better oblige your enormous \"playmate\", even if you still hold reservations about leading others to whatever cruel kismet Jeannie has in store for them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", your reply is brief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", surprise rings is Jeanie's tone, \"You're not even going to whine or anything?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou keep this response short as well, \"Nope\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, then\", Jeannie sighs, \"Good luck, I guess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointment written in her face, Jeannie rises to her full height.  You are presented with her shifting, curvy jean-clad derriere as she makes her exit.  While her hand turns the brass knob of the door, she glances over her shoulder and back at you one last time.  The corners of her mouth curl upward, stretching her parting lips.  Sparkling white teeth emerge from under their red tarp.  She raises a hand level with her face, having her four unified fingers wave cutely.  She departs through the now open doorway, pulling the lock between the approaching partition and its destination.  With a loud clang the monolith finds its path impeded, leaving the door slightly ajar for your convenience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow kind of her\u201d, you sneer sarcastically to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide against scaling down the table due to both the sheer height and bulk of its legs.  Rather, you start to sprint toward the ledge of the platform that was facing Jeannie.  Once you arrive at the end of your runway, you make a daring leap over the edge of the table.  Your fall is broken by the not-as-soft-as-it-looks seat cushion, your body coiled for impact.  After a bit of tumbling, your momentum halts.  Your body has sustained a few bumps and bruises, but at least you didn\u2019t break anything.  You run to the nearest chair leg, and begin your climb to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe firmness of the padded brown carpet is cushioned little by the rubber soles of your sneakers.  Each step shoots discomfort from your feet to your lower back.  You soon journey past the gapped doorway and into the thankfully abandoned hallway beyond it.  The sound of Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata dictates your path.  As you round the corner at the end of the hall, an extravagant lobby comes into view.  It seems Jeannie was also kind enough to book a room on the first floor.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems there are only three people occupying the lavishly expansive room.  Sitting on one of the two adjacent love seats is a blond haired woman skimming through today\u2019s newspaper.  Her back is to you, so it is hard to get too detailed.  A young woman, probably only a few years older than you, appears to be checking out of the hotel.  A small lavender bag lay at her ankles, its zipper leaving a small opening at its end.  She is arguing quite rudely with the attendant, who appears a tad younger than you, over some trivial matter involving her room\u2019s condition.  The attendant\u2019s candor is unusually kind and accommodating as she deals with the unruly guest.  You plot your next move while taking all of this in from behind the corner. </span></div></div>",

The problem is that her back's to you, so you need to get around to the front of the couch that she's sitting on. And you do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gods seem to favor you as she shifts her body so that she is facing you. Your luck seems to rise even higher when the lady puts down the newspaper to reveal her radiant face. Finally, you can see her clearly! The rose scent from her perfume was already intoxicating you, and her blue eyes, cream trench coat, and chic eyeglasses just made you like her even more. She's pretty young and seems nice enough. Still, should you risk it making contact?</span></div></div>",

You are paralysed in fear as she lifts its partner, and only as she steps over you do you realise you've been holding your breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally you wrench yourself around one-eighty to see her stride over to the arguing woman, who waves her forward to reveal some documentation to the attendant.  The pair must be staying together for whatever reason, and if you approach one, the other will be along for the ride.  Maybe Jeannie will be extra grateful if you bring her two victims in exchange..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling wickedly, you ponder the pros of the increased gratitude compared to the danger of having yourself in the power of two powerful women, and thus twice as likely to be taken advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopefully they'll be gone soon, and the attendant will be relieved.  In the wake of that, you can manipulate her so much easier, now that these two have worn her down!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hotel exit is right there, you could shuffle off into the wider world...</span></div></div>",

You wait for the rest of her voluminous hand to bring its full weight down upon your fragile frame, but it refuses to do so.  Instead, rays of light flicker through the ceiling of your domed prison of flesh.  The screeching of Jeannie's nails dragging against the wooden surface is amplified by your closed confines as you are scooped up by her less than caressing fingers.

The rest of your environs are confined to amethystine darkness, save a few shards of paleness from a three-quarter moon penetrating an army of atramentous clouds.  Your argent platform seems to drop off on all sides, except for several yards ahead of your location where an odd transparent monolith of Plexiglas inclined at an awkward angle awaits.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the natural haziness commonly associated with your awakenings, you push yourself to your feet.  The silver surface feels flexible, almost flimsy under your insignificant weight.  You dare to venture toward the massive view screen, comparing the scene against some of the many aquatic exhibits you had seen in the past.  Your cheap sneakers thud lightly as they make small temporary depressions into the silver landscape beneath you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter journeying for a few minutes, you arrive at your intended destination.  Attached to the base of the invisible slope sets an elongated black bench giving low, gradual ascent as it travels in place to the resplendent outline surrounding it (the slope).  A quick glance to the other side of the area reveals an inverted mirror image staring back.  Eager to view the contents your mysterious peep show holds, you step onto the charcoal step and press your face against the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the tremendous plane of faded blue immediately opposite you lies many splendorous sights for you to behold.  A singular colored rainbow of cyanin erects itself a few feet past the ledge of said plane.  Two towers of short, thin fibers of light gray curves inward accommodatingly stand side by side further within the encased zone.  A mountain of similar material sits deeper inside, its color hidden by the more shadowy realm in which it resides.  At the center of the worn blue ceiling hangs a white dome watching over all.  The back of the enclosure is a matching glass window, matching the one before you in both height and width.  Four smaller portals surround the domain.  You now know where you are, though you wish you didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour frightening realization is interrupted by a clicking noise fast approaching.  A silhouette peaks over the elevating edge, paying you no attention as a loud clang sounds.  A wall of silver carrying one of the four smaller shields of transparency swings into view, replacing the ominous figure.  A sudden slam removes the door from vision, shaking you greatly all the while.  Looking back through the seeing glass, you notice a gigantic woman has taken asylum from early droplets of rain starting to fall from the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman appears to be in her late thirties/early forties.  Her swarthy hair is bonneted neatly on the top of her head.  The light complexion of her skin is over matched only by the whiteness of her thin, short-sleeved and unbuttoned coat which hordes green scrubs away from the world.  Her light green eyes focus downward as her tough-skinned hands fumble through a dark brown purse.  Your eyes widen in horror as she pulls a set of keys from the large carryall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA raindrop strikes your back, drenching it as you begin to pound desperately against the dense windshield.  Your fists almost immediately fill with pain, but you haven't the time to concern yourself with such things now.  You scream for help, but you doubt your shrill voice can penetrate to the inside of the vehicle.  The woman looks up, possibly at you as her experienced hands move once again. </span></div></div>",

Sitting down, your legs dangle freely over its edge.  Jeannie is slouched in her wooden throne, her head tilted at a low angle to keep you in her line of sight.  Her lengthy right leg stretches beneath the table, while her left bends backward as the bottom of her foot lines parallel against the nearest chair leg.  Her arms, fed from short sky blue sleeves, are lazily plopped on the cushion-less structures designed for their support.  Her pedicured hands hang over the thick, rounded ends of the arm rests.  Her wrists were beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is\", you begin your defense, \"you shrink me to, what, three inches tall, which you've yet to give me a reason for doing by the way.  Now you want me to go out and not only wander around by myself, but lure somebody else with me to...you won't even tell me where!  This is crazy!  What did I do to deserve this?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think of it as punishment\", Jeannie instructs, \"Think of it as a test\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A test?\", you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, never mind that\", Jeannie seems to regret her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to your original thesis, \"Jeannie, I don't think you've thought this through.  Why don't you just fix me and we can just forget about all of this.  I mean, its not like I could tell anybody.  Who'd believe me, right?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie removes herself from her relaxed pose.  Her silky arms slowly begin to descend on your position.  You take the hint and evacuate the area in something less than an orderly fashion.  Her soft hands overlap each other at your former location, serving as a resting place for her small, yet defined chin.  A sly smile reveals itself upon her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As smooth and touching as that little speech was\", a slight hint of sarcasm carries itself in Jeannie's voice, \"I'm not about to let you wuss out of our game.  But since I don't want to be known as a cheater, I've decided that I will do one thing for you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that thing would be?\", you question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it\", is Jeannie's response, \"Anything you want, except for changing you back, of course\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give serious thought to your lone request before making a decision.</span></div></div>",

However, your thoughts are centered on the greater problems of your predicament.  This hotel room is scary enough; how frightening will the outside world be at three inches tall?  Not to mention the difficulty involved in contacting other people, let alone conning them to switch fates with you.  Your problems are just too big (both literally and metaphorically) for you to deal with alone.  But maybe you won't have to!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A phone call\", you blurt your sudden thought aloud, \"I'd like a phone call, please\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie's face turns sour, \"A phone call?  Now that doesn't sound fair.  I can't let you call your victim; that would be way too easy\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my victim\", you correct, \"Just someone to help me out a little.  You have to realize that there's no way I can last out there by myself\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know\", Jeannie sounds reluctant, \"That still goes against the spirit of the game...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to take a chance and 'cop an attitude', \"So you're changing the rules now?!  Your promises don't mean anything?!  I don't think I can play with a cheater and a liar\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright!\", Jeannie's tone seems to indicate that your gamble had paid off, \"Stop with the melodramatics already.  You can have your call\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie's right hand snatches you with frustration.  Your face is buried in the breast of her palm, its suffocating effects serving as more than a minor discomfort.  The tight squeezing from her fingers, threatening to crush your body like soft aluminum isn't exactly a nice feeling either.  The lone benefit to your unenviable position is that you are hardly aware of the violent swing of Jeannie's arm as she stomps angrily toward the drawer holding the room phone, a feeling that would no doubt upset your notoriously weak stomach otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your air supply reaches its end, you are tossed underhanded onto a surface of brown lighter than the table.  You roll in front of a pale white hut which you recognize as a telephone.  Jeannie removes the receiver from its port, appearing as a enormous hand plucking a quarter moon from the earth and placing it in the sky while she raises it to her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What number?\", Jeannie asks in a spoiled voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou already know who to call, \"588-7523\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grand finger lowers from the heavens, depressing square buttons as large as your head with relative ease.  Once the correct sequence is dialed, Jeannie sets the overgrown banana in front of you with the speakers conveniently facing your direction.  The phone rings, and Jeannie sits looming on the nearby bed, elbows on knees while she stares at you with a spark of interest.  It seems her curiosity has helped her to get over not having her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello\", a somewhat muffled, yet familiar voice sounds from the top speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice always sounds weird on the phone, but the effect is amplified by your minuscule size.

Besides, people usually check into hotels to avoid being bothered.  Any person you find here is likely to be unreceptive to your plight.  A change in scenery is definitely in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you give me a lift somewhere?\", you make your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so\", Jeannie seems unimpressed by your lack of originality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie's prodigious fingers swerve around your lower body and midsection without permission, tightening as they contort around your pathetic form.  The sturdiness of a solid base is stolen from your feet, your elevation increasing the distance between the table top and yourself.  You see Jeannie moving to place you back into the dark confines of her jean pocket, and decide to push your luck a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, do you think I could ride somewhere else?\", you ask daringly, \"It's sort of rough in there\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, is it?\", Jeannie mockingly questions back, \"Fine, then.  Let's see if this is more to your liking\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe index finger from Jeannie's free hand approaches you, making taunting movements at you.  The rude digit makes contact with the top of your head, and pushes down with great force.  Your face is soon surrounded by the darkness of the inside of Jeannie's fist.  The puffy skin enveloping you is almost suffocating, not to mention the perspiration the body heat causes.  Maybe you should have kept your mouth shut?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of the world outside your fleshy walls are barely audible.  The muffled clamoring, the faint sound of classical music, the bang of a door being closed; you can vaguely identify all of these noises taking place.  You recognize the bang of slamming car door, and find yourself free once again.  You fall into a small, cylindrical valley as Jeannie's fingers uncoil around you.  Landing on your feet, you quickly identify your new cell as a cup holder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where am I taking you?\", Jeannie asks in an intrigued tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree places come to mind, actually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could ask to be dropped off at the local library, which is conveniently open twenty-four hours a day.  You're unsure who would be hanging around such a place on a Friday night, but nevertheless, the quiet environs of the library would make garnering attention much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe you should ask to be let out at Roamer's, a new night club located downtown.  Yeah, a nightclub would be a less than ideal location for someone of your stature, but it also just so happens to be located two blocks away from the city police station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a trip to the old suburbs across town is where you would like to go.  You know some people who live there, and you can even think of a few people who deserve to be your \"replacement\".  Of course, how you can convince them to do so is a question you have yet to answer.</span></div></div>",

Jeannie glares down at you with twin dark blue orbs, apparently unhappy with your lack of an immediate response.  Impatient clicks emanating from the collisions between the ledge of the table and her well manicured nails echo this sentiment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour initial shock of Jeannie's insane proposal soon gives way to anger.  You find yourself wondering how Jeannie could expect you to make such a decision on a whim, given all the dangers involved.  It strikes you as rather selfish on her part, actually.  The thought that this brat expects you to risk life and limb just because she was suffering from an affliction of boredom infuriates you.  Such immaturity you can not tolerate, and you know of only one way to deal with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bottom lip overtakes its counterpart slightly, puffing itself outward.  You intersect your arms across your chest flamboyantly.  Glancing up at Jeannie, you roll your eyes annoyingly.  You promptly turn your back on her.  For added effect, you loudly utter \"Hmph!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess you're NOT ready yet\", Jeannie states calmly, \"That's okay, though.  I'm sure you'll be good to go by the time you wake up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to turn around, about to ask what she meant by when you wake up.  Halfway through your venture, you notice Jeannie's right arm has moved from its perched position.  In the ensuing search for the missing appendage, you instead find a charging backhand.  Before you can brace for impact, your head is bashed by a callous mound of bone wrapped in a thin layer of red, cracked skin.  The painful connection sends your minuscule body soaring through the air for a good while.  Your fall is broken by an impressionable mountainous surface.  As you fall forward toward the dark green expanse below, blackness envelopes your vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPushing yourself away from the soft, pampering plane, you jump to your feet.  After taking a moment to walk off your state of disorientation, your eyes explore your surroundings.  As Jeannie had said, this was a hotel room, though she was long gone at this point.  You are standing on the lone bed in the room, a golden pillar erecting shaded light strategically placed beyond its foot.  Smaller adjustable lamps line the walls of the room.  A movie theater-esque television sets atop a bulky dark wooden dresser, adjacent to the table from which you were knocked.  The doorway is shielded from view by a premature corner in the white wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud beep takes you by surprise.  You recognize the accompanying clicks and clanks as the turning of a door knob.  You take refuge behind the nearest pillow.  Your eyes focus on the corner as the guest(s) enter the room.                           </span></div></div>",

Her sandy blond hair hangs limply just above her narrow shoulders, tickling the fabric of her amaranth t-shirt as it sways in rhythm with the strides of her tightly dungaree-wrapped legs.  Rondures of fern guide her atramentous pupils on their visual tour of their new surroundings.  Gently pouting lips bathed in venetian red curled into a warm simper at her examination of the lodgings she has apparently been assigned.  Her slightly cuspated nose directs her well defined facial structure at a downward angle in humble fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told ya this was a nice place, Miranda\", a shrill voice calls from just beyond your sight, \"Perfect for getting away from classes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", the girl dubbed Miranda replies sweetly, \"Even the single rooms are impressive.  Thanks again for putting us up here for the weekend, Amelia\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank my daddy\", the second conversationalist says as she begins to come into view, \"though he doesn't know it yet\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia, as you have been informally introduced, has skin of tanned buff.  A tad shorter than Miranda, Amelia's bright flaxen strands stretch in bouncy jubilance a few inches longer in contrast.  Her tight lime tank top exudes the busty curves of her chest region quite excessively while leaving her trim abdomen completely barren.  Her lower body is shielded only by low cut jean shorts, barely containing her voluptuous buttocks and exposing everything from the thigh down to the outside world.  Headlining her innocent countenance are eyes of hazel waiting to dazzle any who dare behold their depth and beauty, complete with darkened lids and thick lashes.  An adorably bottled nose lines itself between them, and plump lips glazed in hot pink pucker in ignorant movements beneath it.  Thin cheekbones conceal themselves behind lightly painted walls of blush to round out her facial features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you two stop gawking at the room and get out of my way?\", asks a third person coming into your line of sight, her tone carrying annoyed authority, \"It's not like this is the first hotel room you've been in, right Amy?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia gives a blank stare to the new entrant into the room before Miranda answers on her (Amelia's) behalf, \"Come on, Josie.  You promised you'd stop picking on Amelia, at least for the weekend\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry\", the girl known as Josie hardly sounds remorseful, \"It's just so easy, sometimes\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie's fine carmine lips smirk in spiteful satisfaction.  Irises of radiant emerald shine against the pure white scleras hoping to contain them.  A petite, rounded nose nestles itself in harmony between these features, housed in dark cream epidermal encasing.  Her dark brunet hair is bunched into a great ponytail cascading just short of her shoulder blades.  Easily the tallest of the trio, Josie is also the most modestly dressed.  A baggy, thin long-sleeved royal blue shirt does a moderate job of hiding her ample bosoms while loose-fitting sterling shorts almost reach her knee caps.  Under her right arm pit, Josie holds a rolled up sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\", Josie announces, \"Amy, you'll take the floor while Miranda and I will take the bed.  Lucky for you I thought ahead and brought you a bag\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of disappointment crosses Amelia's face, \"Aw, do I have to?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you do\", Josie responds, tossing the mountainous bag at Amelia, \"Don't worry, the floor spiders won't come out until after you're asleep.  You won't even know they're crawling all over you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fl-floor spiders?!\", Amelia exclaims in fright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's kidding\", Miranda does her best to calm her friend.  However, Amelia's petrified gaze causes Miranda to concede, \"You know what, I'll take the floor\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great\", Amelia breaths a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia walks toward the drawer next to the bed pillows (and you, incidentally) and sets her purse on it carelessly.  The cacophonous bang startles you as well as pain your ears a bit.  You notice the zipper is slit open on your side.  You might be able to fit if such a need arises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as soon as I go to the bathroom\", Amelia tells her friends, \"I'm hitting that party on the third floor.  You know, the one that cute guy in the elevator told us about.  You guys want to come with?\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks\", Miranda politely declines, \"I think I'm going to lay down for a bit.  I'm really tired\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to her word, Miranda slips into the sleeping bag, now rolled out at the foot of the bed.  She doesn't even bother changing out of her street clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No\", Josie denies the invitation, \"I'm going to relax for a minute before I decide what to do.  Besides, one of us has to be around and awake when the bellhop brings our bags up\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Josie plops onto the immense mattress, sending a small series of tremors through you.  Her head lays on the edge of the pillow you are behind, forcing you to step back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourselves\", Amelia seems a little unsatisfied with her friends' lack of adventurous spirits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmelia heads around the corner, and you hear the slamming of what you can only assume is the bathroom door.  You realize that any one of these three should be considered a prime candidate for your substitute, or even a prime source of help if you can't fathom yourself leading someone else to such a fate.  Either way, it may be problematic to allow yourself to be seen by more than one of these girls.  In any case, now seems like an ideal time to make your move.</span></div></div>",

The swish of passing cars rolling on wet pavement poured in, followed by a young woman, frantically grasping a young child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly slams the door shut, flipping the bolt and snapping the security chain in place.  She leans back against the door for a moment, sliding down to her rear while clasping the child close to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, are we safe?\" the child cries plaintively, clinging desperatley to her mother's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, baby, they won't find us here.\"  The mother softly wipes the child's face, pushing the locks of her hair back from her brow.  A small sniffle, a stifled sob, slipped from the mother, as she quickly wiped the unfallen tears from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.  Let's get you in a hot bath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother tosses the small backpack she had been carrying onto the bed not far from where you lie in stunned silence.</span></div></div>",

No luck in that direction!  So you turn to find an even more imposing wall to the other side, clearly that of Michelle, so much the bigger than her daughter Jenny.  Craning back in the other direction, you see that the unknown man is on the other side of the girl, a gargoyle clutching the child tightly.  Michelle could easily get out of the car door, but not without leaving Jenny behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl trembles, even such a simple motion a terrifying threat to one of your size.  So, maybe down from the seat would be the way out?  But no, the great feet of both mother and daughter are down there, fidgeting and deadly.  There is no easy way out, but at least no-one has spotted you.  There may be no escape from the car right now, but one of these two females will carry you out without knowing.  Let them do their dealings without bothering the three-inch tall man along for the ride!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's legs are encased in thick denim dungarees, a pocket large enough to hide you right before her belly.  Sure, if she gets carried out by this sinister dude you'll be closer to him, but his eyes will more likely be watching for trickery from the mother rather than the daughter, and once outside you'll be able to escape with less chance of being seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle on the other hand, you'll be able to jump off as soon as she steps out of the car.  The problem?  Any sign of movement from his mature captive will draw immediate attention from either of these criminals.  So, as you consider the best angle of approach to ensconce yourself upon the skirt of this worried mother...</span></div></div>",

You look up at the majestic tower of the woman, a few years older than yourself but still attractive to your eyes: while her face is clean of make-up, its natural tone and sculpture remains beautiful among the tumbling locks of dark hair.  She certainly doesn't seem like the sort of person you'd want to consign to Hell in your place, but she hopefully will help you find someone that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, madam,\" you pipe up, shouting ever so slightly so that the timid voice from your three-inch tall form may carry to this possible salvation.  \"I require your help, if it's not too much trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere.  Nice and polite.  The woman's eyes widen as they track around to spot you, but while you're watching them there's a thunderous impact as a shadow looms over you.  The girl - with her mother's eyes and smile - beams down at you.  She's young, and you're not enough of an expert ot pin it down precisely, but she's definitely not too old to play with dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How cute!\" she squeals, and her hand wraps its fingers around you, irresistible force pressing those jointed pillars around you.  You are wrenched from your place and the loud, menacing face grows even bigger as you are brought in for a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling is futile, but clearly they can hear you.

During your twenty-five years, you've led a pretty uneventful life.  Five days a week, you would sit and work at your cubical, working diligently through endless stacks of forms and documents.  Perhaps you would periodically engage in some office banter with your co-workers, many of whom hold at least twenty years on you.  Then, you would go home, maybe see an acquaintance or two along the way, and pretty much keep to yourself until the next day.  Nothing in your routine would even remotely suggest your current predicament to be fathomable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all starts with Jeannie, the twenty-one year old college intern.  Referred to by many of your fellow males in the office as a cute side-dish (which is really creeps you out, considering their ages), Jeannie seemed to be a sweet girl, if not a bit flirtatious.  Other than exchanging pleasantries and answering one of her occasional questions, you didn't really deal with Jeannie too much despite the significantly smaller age gap between the two of you.  That's why you are having such a hard time understanding why she would do this to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had just stepped past the threshold of the glass door exit when she called out to you.  You found it odd for Jeannie to attempt fraternizing with you after working hours, so you decided not to pretend you didn't hear her (standard procedure when seeing most co-workers outside of the office).  As you turned around, your eyes were already level with her chest.  You quickly found her pelvis across from your face.  Your line of sight traveled down her leg (without any movement of your neck) until you were staring at her ankles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeannie wasn't too gentle in picking you up.  She flashed you a twisted smile as she carelessly stashed you into her right jean pocket.  Now all you can do is wait to see just what Jeannie has in store for you.                      </td>",
