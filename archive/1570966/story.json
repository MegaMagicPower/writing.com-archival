But despite all the labor he has done for, the conditions of his current surroundings made it impossible, it didn't help his big stomach was growling like a mad lion underneath his prison stripe shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, shut up,\" growled Bushel britches to 'himself', \"It been along day, and I need sleep. In the mornin, we will have some bread and water.\" His stomach gurgled violently to that last comment. \"Well what did you expect? We're nobodies now! We used to be law in this horseless town. All we had to do is boss people around and collect taxes for Prince John.. with a cut for ourselves, as well as a nice fancy room and all the food we can stomach... but now; we are just no bodies in prison...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sheriff!\" shouted Nutsy,  the former buzzard lieutenant of the pudgy wolf, \"Er, former Sheriff. You gots a birthday package... don't know why they would though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right, it was his birthday, the days in jail just flew by. With a heavy grunt, the wolf got on his feet and turn to his former bird goon standing on the other side of the bar. The former goon of his was holding a plain looking box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PLEASE be a cake or something</i>, the former Sheriff hope has was handed the package through the bars, which were dashed when he lifted the box lid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small vile of juice... with a note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBushel Britches took the note and read it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy Birthday, My Big boy.<br>\r\nHeard of your trouble, and thought a drink made with a little love will help you out grow your troubles.<br>\r\nLove, Aunt Notty\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAunt Notty.... Bushel britches BARELY remember her, back when he was a bouncing baby brat. His family kept a distance from her, saying she was a nut and believed in magic and such nonsense...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Sans-Sherrif of Nottingham took a look at the drink his Aunt sent. It was pretty much see through, like watered down juice. Opening it up, the smell as strangely strong that made his wolf-nose curled.<br>\r\n\"Ugh... well... it maybe not cake, but better than nothing.\" He said to himself, he then looked down at the stomach, \"And if anything happens, I blaming you and your complaining.\" Raising the juice up high,  the SHeriff made his personal toast, \"Happy Birthday to me... down the hatch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one simple swing of the glass, the entire vial was in the wolf's big mouth, barely even filling up half it. Surprisingly, the foul smelling drink had a strong sweet taste to it. Savoring the textures for awhile, the Sheriff gulp the mysterious concoction, fouled by a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though it wasn't very filling, the Sheriff felt strangely warm than he was once before. Behind his barred windows, the Sheriff saw the full moon shinning down. It looks like a giant silver coin... though strangely enough, his thoughts went to think of chocolate silver coins now... Either way, despite being in a cage, the Sheriff somehow felt more free then ever... like everything is beneath him somehow... </span></div></div>",

He had set it up in the attic at Authur's house seeing as how they were both assigned to work on the same assignment and his own attic was already choc-a-bloc with an array of scientific nic-nacks. He plugged the last lead into the remaining USB port and prepared to test his shrink ray. Powering up, aiming for the item (an aubergine) and, just as it reached full power, he fired the laser... and blasted the aubergine into a poached jam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man!\" He groaned as he went about scraping all the goo up. \"That the second time I've done that today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside Authur, Buster, Francine and Muffy were practicing baseball with Francine at the bat, Authur pitching and Buster and Muffy fielding. There was one problem with their practice that got under Francine's skin in particular, Muffy spent more time worrying about getting her clothes dirty than she did actually fielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one point where they managed to get a break but The Brain was still fretting over why he ended up splattering aubergine all over the place when his so-called shrink ray was actually functioning. Once the break was over they all went back to what they were doing except for The Brain who went off to try and sort out the problem with his science project mathematically. At one point Francine got such a good swing that the ball smashed through the attic window and knocked right into the shrink ray causing imminent activation. The smashing did not go unnoticed as Jane Read soon stepped out of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur.\" She called out. \"You and your friends have gone too far. Get that ball out of the attic and then maybe you can get started on your homework.\" With that she returned to her accounting while the four of them groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Buster,\" Arthur commented, \"Let's recover the ball, and maybe she'll calm down if we clear up the glass.\" Shrugging his shoulders Buster followed Arthur indoors as Francine and Muffy looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we go?\" Asked Muffy, Francine shook her head and replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was <i>my</i> ball. I'm not budging from this spot until I get it back.\" Muffy now thought if she should just set off anyway or remain; she figured it would be better for her reputation to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur and Buster poked their heads round the door to see the science project in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this something left by aliens?\" Buster asked, Arthur groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" He answered. \"It's mine and The Brain's science project. He hasn't really told me what it's about ye...\" Just then the machine fired at the both of them, causing them to yelp in surprise. In another part of the room there were soft furnishings that could fit in a matchbox.</span></div></div>",

Oh well.\" With that she made for the front door and Muffy, after thinking about the implications, decided she might as well follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls poked the heads round the door, bewildered at the sight of what The Brain had been working on, and then the machine fired for the last time that day. Blinking from the burst of light Francine and Muffy attempted to get their bearings in what seemed like a grand hall at first but, after further observation, they realised that it was the same attic that they had just walked into. As the realisation that they were now ant-size began to sink in Arthur and Buster began running towards them from another part of the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What going on here?\" Francine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Arthur commented, \"I don't know why The Brain has been working on something that shrinks things. What's the benefit anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph.\" Groaned Muffy. \"A fine afternoon this turned out to be.\" Just then footsteps could clearly be heard coming up the stairs into the attic; realising the implications Arthur and Francine ran across to where the shrunken sofa was, calling for the other two to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they gathered round the sofa Francine told them to move across to the more open part of the attic and, in spite of the qualms they had with her bossy voice, complied. They had barely gone ten paces when Jane entered the attic; for a few moments they were all distracted as they noticed that Arthur's mum now looked like Godzilla and, seeing her stroll in their direction, Arthur swallowed and told them to hurry up as they completed their manouveur, after very nearly being stepped on, and clambered on top of the sofa to try and can the giant aardvark's attention.</span></div></div>",

This time he was being chased through the desolate desert by none other than Wile E. Coyote, supergenius! Normally, the rascally rabbit had a number of tricks up his sleeve to ensure that he always came out on top, but this particular maroon was hard to shake. Wile E. was bigger than him, smarter than him (for the most part), and definitely more determined than him. It seemed that, after all this time, Bugs had met his match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is, until he found the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an unassuming building, really, just a metal box with one door, no windows and a flat roof. There were antennae surrounding it, blinking lights, the works. It didn't look like much, except it was really out in the middle of nowhere, where no one should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBugs looked behind him to make sure he wasn't being chased. The coyote, for once, was no where in sight. Well, he thought, there's no harm in taking a look around. This place might even be a good place to hide out for the time being. Cautiously, he snuck from a rock outcropping to a cactus, and from the cactus to a fence. Impossibly, he hid behind one of the metal posts along the fence before sneaking inside the property. Skimping on carrots the way he had been brought some advantages, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything was quiet as he snuck up to the building. He placed one gloved paw on the door knob before twisting it open. He put his ears through the crack at first, and then one eye. \"Hello?\" he called out. \"Anybody home?\" There was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all he needed; he threw open the door and walked in. Then he thought the better of it and closed the door behind him. It wouldn't do to give away his possible hiding spot to the Coyote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he flipped the light switch, he found himself inside of some kind of abandoned laboratory. Test tubes and beakers rested on desks and in sinks, and there were all kinds of electronics as well. One particular set of test tubes caught his attention, probably because they were the only ones to have labels: Giant Growth, Shrinking Powder, Super Strength and Super Speed were the four he could read. They were all filled with some white powder he supposed you needed to swallow. The fifth, also white, was unmarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end of the room, a futuristic ray gun lay on the floor in front of the mirror. He grinned at himself. \"You handsome devil, you.\" Then he looked at the gun; there was a dial on it with two settings: Grow, and Shrink. Whoever was here sure was obsessed with size-changing, that's for sure. Bugs picked it up, and suddenly had an idea. Wouldn't this be a great thing to use against that 'super-genius'? Here he had a full lab at his disposal! Who knows what kind of trouble he could cook up?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sharp ears heard some movement outside. In a flash, Bugs was hidden underneath a desk with his new toy. \"Rabbit?\" He could make out the somewhat distant voice of Wile E. Coyote entering the yard. \"Where are you? I know you're somewhere nearby. I have an excellent sense of smell you know.\" The smugness in the coyote's voice convinced the bunny that some comeuppance was in order. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was he to do?</span></div></div>",

In all her years as a student Twilight couldn't recall ever hearing about an actual spell to change size; there were a multitude of transfiguration spells and a plethora of stories for unicorn foals about giants and shrinking, but never anything that pointed to such things being possible. Now she decided to make her attempt. She focused hard and thought about the apple in front of her, trying to focus on it being downsized without affecting its molecular structure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI!\" Pinkie Pie blurted out as she burst into the library with Applejack, Rainbow Dash and Rarity in tow. The sudden interruption startled Twilight, causing her to lose control of the thaumic energy she'd been building and, in a flash, she suddenly found herself alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Pinkie yelled up. \"There's no need for that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What they hay are ya on about?\" Applejack asked in confusion. Suddenly she felt a series of earthquakes and turned to see four great columns of a light purple colour; she hesitantly looked up just as...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>IS ANYPONY THERE?</b>\" Twilight asked, unaware of how powerful her voice was to her friends in their new predicament.

I might be a bit shrimpy to do a Sonic Rainboom now, but I bet I could match anypony's speed nonetheless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, come on, Rainbow.\" Pinkie Pie pouted. \"If Twilight finds us now, it'll ruin the drama of the story.\" Prompting the other three to look at her in a bemused fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\" Rainbow shrugged it off and shot up just as one of Twilight's hooves crashed down closer than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Huh, WHO KNOWS WHAT KINDA PROBLEMS THAT COULD'VE LED TO.</b>\" Twilight boomed. \"<b>PONIES DROPPING IN UNANNOUNCED ON A PRACTISING UNICORN IS MORE THAN IMPOLITE, IT'S DANGEROUS.</b>\" Rainbow Dash was now a little blue dot against the mighty purple column of Twilight's leg, climbing ever higher in her attempt to reach the giant mare's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I hope we can have some fun with this.\" Pinkie Pie declared. \"Twilight's all 'Fee fi fo fum' and we're a bunch of helpless specks.

These can be anything from highly anthropomorphic (like PBS's Arthur) to barely anthropomorphic (like Disney's 101 Dalmatians). As such I'll accept just about anything be it Disney or WB or even something not so well known. I ask only these factors:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must be in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must remain within the canon rating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing Angsty, growing is preferred to be restricted to protagonists but this is not exclusive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo adult material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than those restrictions, write that which suits you. If I find something that seems to contradict what I'd intended I might refine the above restrictions or simply do a re-edit to try and bring it into the intended limits.</td>",
