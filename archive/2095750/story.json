Almost everyone last year knew some of her strength and what she could do.  But Pippi held much of it back. Pippi did not want to scare anyone unnecessarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did protect her friends from bullies 4 or 5 times then.  She even pulled a stuck car out of a ditch once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippie was able to 'hide' her muscles. But now, it finally forced itself out making her look like an average mini-bodybuilder.  That summer, she studied last year's playbook and knew which positions that she loved the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day before, she was jogging in her shorts and muscle shirt. Pippi went by the coach's house a few times.  She caught his interest and even flexed to show that she was for real.  She' even expressed her interest in joining the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Dryden was amazed and agreed.  He said \"meet me in the weightroom after school the first day. That is when the players are meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, Pippi was wearing her school uniform but had her hair in pigtails But she did look attractive.<br>\r\nPippi walked in at the last minute and did a small flex.<br>\r\nThere was a signup sheet for the new players to sign a wavier and their first choice position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer team needed almost any good players excepts for a couple of good cornerbacks and a very good center,.Pippie signed the waiver and signed up for her favorite position.  But she was open to helping the team anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe signed up for <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I want to make that better.\" Pippi replied. To make her point better, she flexed her biceps in emphasis. They rose to the size of multiple oranges in both arms. Coach Dryden was a little intimidated but amazed at her determination to play with the boys on their team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, lets see your skills.\" Coach finished. Then he led her to the field to run some drills. First he made her run a 40 yard dash. Because Pippi was so strong in her legs, she was able to run fast with a 4.35 40 time. Coach was so surprised that he thought they had their running back for the year in the bag. He had her do a few more drills, 10 yard split, 20 yard cone shuttle, and other drills. Pippi aced them with ease. He was impressed at her skills and how good she was overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Pippi, I'm impressed with your skills. You would be a great addition to our team. With your strength and speed, we'd be sure to win a lot of games this year.\" He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi giggled \"Thanks Coach, but what if the boys don't like me. They might not like a girl bigger and stronger than them on the team, would they?\" To show, she flexed her biceps again, which is 17 inches around considering she measures them all the time. The Coach blushed a bit before clearing his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pippi, I guarantee you the boys will love to have you on the team. It'll be better than having no run game all year and lose a lot of games again.\" He finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, lets go.\" She says as they both go to the other side of the field to see the boys. When they boys notice her, they...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pippi had to weigh her options, thinking how a bunch of boys were going to feel about a girl on the team. While she really wanted to try for linebacker since it would combine her speed, strength and intelligence, she knew that likely wasn't the best option for a new player (and a girl at that). As a receiver, she thought she could put her speed to use without intimidating anyone right away, so she added her name for that position on the signup sheet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Dryden introduced himself as the coach-in-charge and Coach Pope as his assistant; Pope had been the high school varsity position coach for the last three years, and was a short and stocky bulldog of a guy next to the taller and more agile Dryden. Coach Dryden talked about how the Cougars were rebuilding this year, how they had good returning players in their backfield and could probably beef up their 3-4 defense if they could frame around their center (a powerful-looking redhead named Eddie D, Pippi noted), but how overall it was about building team spirit, having fun and generally getting comfortable with the game given the number of new players. They were to do some warm-up stretching and strength training before running a few laps and performing a little basic drill, no actual playing today. The coaches needed to see where the new kids' strengths were and start deciding where they'd fit in with the team, assuming they fit in at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi changed out of her school uniform in the girls' locker room, which was quiet as a mausoleum; cheerleading practice, girls basketball and tennis hadn't started up for the year as yet, so she was the only one in there. She put on her usual shorts, muscle shirt and sneakers as well as her long, mismatched socks before returning to the weight room with the other boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe returning players were already doing squats and cable shrugs under the capable eye of Coach Pope, while Coach Dryden was lining everyone else up and taking them through a quick round of stretches. She took some minor grief for her colorful socks, but not from the coach. No one was really complaining about a girl on the team yet, since a lot of the guys were as new to the school as she was. Pippi held herself back to a single 'flex' moment, doing a few one-handed pushups to amuse everyone after a brief run of crunches and lunges. That pretty well stopped the socks jokes and any urge to tweak her pigtails, everyone able to see she had plenty of muscle and poise regardless of being a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, they all ran a casual lap or two before being asked to push themselves. Pippi kept up with the returning players, careful not to blow them away but unable to hide the fact that she wasn't breaking a sweat. Eddie D was starting to pay attention to her now, realizing she had potential.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Coach Dryden took his star players out near the south goalpost while Coach Pope introduced himself and had everyone go around the circle and give their names as well as what position they were hoping to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi wound up looking like a capable receiver, Pope running her and a few of the other receiver-hopefuls on some down-and-in routes, ten yards, then moving to longer comebacks for speed. He must have liked what he saw with Pippi. After a few sluggos, Coach Pope sent her on a streak. Pippi really opened up, nowhere close to going all-out but putting on enough speed so that, when she turned back to catch the pass Coach Pope had popped her way, she could see him looking a little slack-jawed with the rest of the new guys. Even Coach Dryden had his hand up, shielding his eyes from the sun to watch her. Pippi caught the ball easily and ran it back, just as quickly as she'd gone out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPractice was over before she knew it. She'd shown her spunk without necessarily manifesting herself as superhuman, which Pippi thought was fine for her first day. She changed back over to her uniform without showering - she hadn't worked hard enough to perspire in the slightest - and prepared to head home.</span></div></div>",

One of the players called in a friendly voice \" hey,Pippi, You are pretty cool after all. We-err, we are impressed. have -have you ever been dogpiled by anyone.  If you are our star wide receiver, the other team will gain on you and will try to take you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi laughed innocently and sad ' Well, let us test it out. Here is my backyard just down the next block.  Try pinning me down, the fence is fairly high. We should be OK.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, the test began, The backyard was fairly large.  The first two player ran after a  \"jogging\"  Pippi.  She let them grab unto her but they were not able to force her down. One of them noticed her muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the players, Bob, said  'OH MY, How strong are you.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi said \" Let me lie down.. All of you tackle me while I just stand here. Don't worry, I am not easily hurt. Really, I am okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey reluctantly did as she asked. When the 5th player got a hold of her, she was able to stand up still but deliberately fell down.  From under the pile, she laughed and said 'Don't worry.  I am okay. Let me see if I can get up now. With a slight grunt, she managed to ease herself up and did some 20 push up with 5 boys on top of her.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they all got up, Pippi did say ' No Matter how good I am.  I am still not the whole team. I may have to be sort of a player/trainer too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the players said ' Wow, you are awesome even with the pigtails---\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pippi was totally excited after having gotten dogpiled by all five of the football players and still being able to lift all five of them thanks to her fantastic strength! Obviously, the five boys felt a little envious and intimidated by having a girl on the team who was that strong and they didn\u2019t want anything else to do with her other than having her on the team with the hope that she would help them win a lot of games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the boys all got up and left her alone since she was a block away from her house. When the boys walked off, Pippi spotted one boy standing there, looking from a distance. At first, she couldn\u2019t recognize him but when he came closer, she knew that he was also on her football team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2019re Pippi, right?\u201d the shy boy said to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was only 5-foot-4 inches tall and he had brown eyes and short, brown, straight hair with light skin. But he had a friendly expression on his face and was obviously curious about Pippi and her amazing strength. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d Pippi replied excitedly. \u201cWhat was your name again? Peter?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, no\u2026 My name\u2019s Paul!\u201d the boy replied. \u201cI\u2026 Uhh\u2026 I think you\u2026 You\u2019re really strong!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul was still wearing his cleats, his socks, his long pants, his pads, his team jersey, and he was holding his helmet in his hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, why\u2026 Thanks! I just can\u2019t remember the last time I saw you play\u2026\u201d Pippi said, but she instantly regretted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, umm\u2026\u201d Paul sighed, looking down a little bit with a sad expression. \u201cI\u2019m not very good. I sit on the bench a lot. But, if you every have a minute to just throw a ball around with me\u2026 I\u2019m not very important\u2026 I\u2019m one of the receivers on the team but I can\u2019t catch worth a lick\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, of course! Let me get a ball and we\u2019ll play out on the lawn!\u201d Pippi cheered as she ran home and returned a minute later with a football in her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Paul and Pippi spread out across the edges of the extensive lawn and they tossed and caught the football to one another. Pippi made a few catches and passed the ball back, making Paul run for it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will train you, Paul!\u201d she smiled. \u201cYou will become the BEST receiver on the team!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of passing and catching, the two came together at the patio in front of Pippi\u2019s house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGosh, you got a really strong arm, Pippi! I wish I could throw like you\u2026\u201d Paul sighed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI got a weight bench! I can let you lift weights! I can also let you try to push up against ME!\u201d Pippi smiled. \u201cI can give you lots of resistance which will strengthen your muscles!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDang! You will do that\u2026 For me?\u201d Paul asked her shyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure! You\u2019re on my team! And, I don\u2019t want you sitting on the bench all year!\u201d Pippi smiled as she walked up to the boy, who was an inch shorter than her. \u201cAnd, by the way\u2026. I think you\u2019re cute!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi then kissed Paul on his cheek which caused him to blush tremendously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh wow\u2026\u201d Paul smiled, not knowing what to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust to let you know\u2026. I don\u2019t have a boyfriend\u2026 Until now!\u201d she grinned. \u201cSo, you\u2019re it!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul just smiled, feeling totally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWh\u2026 What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna be your trainer\u2026 and your girlfriend! You\u2019re gonna be the best boy on the team! I\u2019m gonna shape you up, Paul!\u201d Pippi said with a big grin on her face. \u201cWe start at 6 in the morning!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaul\u2019s jaw dropped wide open. But he just nodded in agreement. He was speechless. Pippi was the boss. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From there, they ran to the park across the street where there was a large, open field. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they got there, they started to toss the ball to each other from various distances, while standing and while running in different directions. Then, they sprinted to the high school where they actually practiced in the football field. It was great since there was nobody else there. It was too early in the morning! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 2 hours of throwing the ball down the football field, Pippi and Paul and walked over to the small coffee shop down the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s recruit a few other kids to join in on the practice with us!\u201d Pippi suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, the two of them walked down the street and they spotted Alex, the boy who lived next door, and Jennifer, another girl, same age as Pippi. The four of them returned to the field and practiced throwing the football around until\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Pippi was going to walk home in the usual way, but felt an indefinable tug in another direction. She'd learned to trust her instincts in these matters and turned on her heel, heading opposite her accustomed course and cutting over a few blocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she emerged from the residential sidestreets, Pippi could see what had drawn her in. A few doors down from a music store, there was a raunchy little hamburger joint where bad boys from the high school often hung around. Four older boys were handling a guitar case and taunting a younger girl with it. She had sandy-red hair and was dressed like a girl from an academy Pippi had heard was nearby, which meant she was in a school uniform a bit more posh than Pippi's own. The girl was keeping her head level and staring the bullies down, though she looked about ready to cry... the sort of tears arising from helpless fury rather than fear, which made them that much harder to hold back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, music lovers!\" Pippi called out, loudly. That tended to stop things as everyone realigned themselves, making sense of the new face. Pippi walked into the breach, still smiling and not giving an inch. The tallest boy was the obvious ringleader, still with the girl's case held at shoulder height, frozen in mid-taunt. Pippi reached up and snatched the cased instrument away from him easily, passing it back to the girl while keeping herself front and center. \"You might as well let her have it. I've heard you lot couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. That's... what do they call it? Assignment by merit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bad boys didn't look all that bad. They were fairly clean-cut and didn't seem the sort to be hanging around trying to cause trouble all day - Pippi could see it in their eyes. These were bullies of opportunity, not habit. The tall one had a toothpick his sneer sucked itself around, but that was just unpracticed enough to look like a show rather than a trademark with him. The boys were probably four to five years older than Pippi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just be on our way,\" said the previously bullied academy girl, trying to get some steel back in her voice. She'd realized she was a couple of years older than Pippi herself and was clearly worried the young redhead was about to get creamed as payment for her bravery. She had a prefect's way of speaking, someone who was used to being obeyed in a stricter social regime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who does this squirt think she is?\" the tall boy asked, essentially stalling until his brain could catch up. The boys couldn't make heads or tails of Pippi's chutzpah, and clearly didn't know how to act once they were off their semi-familiar script. The lead bully tossed his dark brown quiff back as though on the verge of sneezing, then made a move to shove Pippi hard to the sidewalk. Pippi let him get his hands on her, bent back a bit, then snapped herself forward, sending him stumbling back into his buddies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Check out her socks,\" said the guy in the woolen flat cap. Pippi had indeed kept her colorful socks on after changing back into her school uniform, but she was baffled that a guy in a cheese-cutter would be giving her lip on fashion. He didn't look lippy, though. His face looked drawn and white. He was already backing off and, bumping into one of his friends, danced away as though he'd touched a hot stove. With churlish mutters, the group withdrew. Pippi stamped one of her T-strap Mary Janes on the sidewalk and they walked off that much more quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were lightweights,\" Pippi told the girl, taking a quick breath and letting it back out. \"I'm really glad I didn't come in swinging.\" She realized it was true. Beating people up didn't seem much of a task, but Pippi worried she'd become like those boys if passing out thick ears became a casual occurrence for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for coming over to help,\" said the banjo girl. Pippi could now see it had to be a banjo, the case too round for a standard guitar. The head girl's blood must be boiling a bit, since she likely told girls like Pippi what to do all day at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBanjo girl introduced herself as Melinda, and Pippi gave her name in return. They began walking slowly toward wherever Melinda had been heading before having her banjo grabbed away, trading small talk about school life. Melinda talked about an upcoming talent show, Pippi talked about her hopes for the football team, and they both found a convenient intersection at which to break off the awkwardness. The girls went their own ways and \"hoped to see each other around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That could've gone a lot worse,\" Pippi said to herself, headed back to her place. She had a dark suspicion her next bully encounter wasn't going to go as smoothly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Nothing all that spectacular happened the rest of the way home or doing afterschool stuff: peanut butter and banana sandwich for a snack, homework, spaghetti for dinner, watch some TV, brush teeth. Pippi did scold herself to get to bed on time, and woke just as the sun hit her feet on the pillow. Up, make bed, shower, eat cereal with fruit, brush teeth, go to school. School, regular old classes, lunch (Sloppy Joes), more classes, done. Nothing really great or awful or embarrassing happened that day. Pippi didn't mind the academic routine and went along with it. These days, she mostly looked forward to hitting the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore football practice started, Pippi stopped at the equipment cage with the other new kids. They had to give their measurements for cleats, pants and jerseys. If they didn't know their sizes, the equipment manager measured them right then. He looked like a high school kid who was pretty bored with the whole thing, taking all the numbers down on a legal pad and not actually passing out any uniform items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we get our pads?!\" asked one longhaired kid with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't start hitting the first week, and we still need to see who's on the cut list,\" the equipment manager told everyone. \"Don't get too excited just yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the sort of practical reminder that cooled everyone's jets a little. But if they were already getting measurements, maybe not too many more people would be getting cut. As it was, the Cougars would have a tough time filling out a second string with the number of people they had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPippi went through warm-up and stretching, and then had to run a 40-yard dash. Coach Dryden was timing everyone on the sidelines with his stopwatch. Coach ran Pippi a few times more than the others, and she kept it relaxed, not overdoing it. She had consistent 4.4s, no slips to faster times. It was still enough to get Dryden talking to Pope, both of them looking at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, position drills. It was repetetive and not very interesting, but necessary to see how everyone's skillset could (or couldn't) be honed. Some of the guys who'd been there yesterday hadn't shown back up today, having already decided serious practice was too much of a pain next to the informal pick-up games they were used to back on the block. Pippi thought she could see a couple other guys who might be cut as well. After her impressive 40s, she didn't try to stand out and showboat at all, just kept her head down and did as instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn watching the other players, Pippi could see they were grooming a guy named Raven Roque to be the quarterback. He had a rockstar sort of name, but had black hair in a Clark Kent cut and looked like he should probably be wearing glasses. He also seemed like an incredibly nervous guy, easily rattled... but he could also just as easily toss the ball forty yards and do so accurately, landing it anywhere he was directed. A decent arm, but he'd have to stay brave in a real game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longhaired kid who'd asked about pads earlier was Shon Tritt, and he was an easygoing guy who really wanted to play tight end. He seemed more like a proto-stoner who should have a Dagwood in hand rather than a football, leading his talking Great Dane around as he helped solve mysteries. He seemed pretty fast, but Pippi wondered if he could take a hit. His brown hair was almost over his eyes, so she also wondered if he could see much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer special trial was one of the returning cornerbacks, a blond 'charmer' named Beau McCarron. Pippi had decided to say her mismatched socks were \"for luck\" when asked earlier by Coach Pope, and now Beau was bugging her a lot, saying he was feeling a little lucky, trying to poke at her bellybutton under her muscle shirt, and generally being a nuisance. He was smart enough not to bother her when the coaches were watching, and Pippi was also smart enough to shove him down hard and level a finger of warning at him when no one was paying attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trouble was, Beau seemed to <i>like</i> that she was strong and could easily push him around. He kept trying to get open-hand slaps on her tummy, and she kept responding with quick jabs to his ribs that were just hard enough not to be mistaken as affectionate. He eventually waved off, starting to feel bruised, but Pippi sort of liked having someone to roughhouse with - if only it was someone else. So far, the others had treated her like one of the guys. Pippi figured she could handle Beau, but hoped she didn't have anyone else acting all mushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the guys were cutting up a little bit too much, so Coach Pope made everyone run a few laps at the end of practice. Beau thought he could prove himself as an endurance runner, so Pippi messed with him, falling back to match his speed and then slowly running faster and faster until he fell back, unable to pace her. He tried to keep up with her accordion torture and finally had to surrender, though he laughed as he did. Maybe that would be the end of his messing with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the girls' locker room, Pippi had raucous company for a change. Soccer tryouts had just started, and there were plenty of girls signing up. Pippi thought cheerleader tryouts might have started as well, since there were girls everywhere. It became official once a bunch of different girls asked if she was going for soccer or cheerleading - and Pippi had to tell them she was already playing football. That surprised a lot of the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't let you play football with socks like that!\" one blonde girl with a Dutch-boy haircut blurted out, sounding astonished. Pippi had to laugh and tell her it hadn't been a problem yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those boys will beat you up, wait and see,\" said a black-haired girl. She wore glasses and looked nervous enough to be Raven Roque's kid sister. Pippi laughed again and said she could beat up any boy on the team, no sweat, but that they seemed mostly like nice guys and it wouldn't happen anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sort of uneasy celebrity began attaching to the pigtailed redhead with goofy socks, and Pippi could feel it taking hold... but she liked that she played a sport the other girls wouldn't want to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she didn't really need to, Pippi went in to take a shower. She figured the other girls would start calling her 'Stinky Pippi' if she didn't, since her playing football already made her kind of boyish to them. Even in a towel, the other girls could see she had good muscle tone and some chatter started.</span></div></div>",

They had the oversized lockers against the far wall in the middle of the locker room, almost like an exclusive little alcove. Pippi had seen these girls around school and had a few of them in her classes. Ditzy Jane, nerdy Rachel, etiolated Ariel... and the head cheerleader, Veronica. Weirdly charismatic, curly black hair of medium length, green eyes, freckles, and an expression as though the universe was a first-rate gag choking to death on its own punchline. Veronica was the one with the alluring voice, of course. Pippi wanted to keep walking and couldn't, just standing there in her towel. Veronica continued regarding Pippi, appraising her, leaning against the wall in her cheerleading uniform with no evident urgency to change over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Redhead fails saving throw versus charm,\" Rachel said, trying to struggle into her civilian clothes. Between her huge glasses (which diminished rather than magnified her blue eyes) and blonde 'port side' ponytail at 45\u00b0, it was a near thing for her Tri-Lamb tee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine being smooshed out of existence under a few hundred pounds of offensive linemen,\" Ariel mused, touching up the dark circles under her brown eyes. She rocked a deep fringe with shoulder-length symmetrical side layers, sort of like an emo telephone operator from the 2L-4N days. Her hair managed to be blacker than Veronica's even though they both had seriously black hair. \"No, hang on: imagine having to <i>haunt</i> a football field! I'm going to sit here imagining it even if the rest of you won't.\" That said, Ariel drew her socked feet up onto the bench and tuned out, chin on knees, looking like a waif atop flotsam bobbing in lava.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Look at myself in the window of a toy store,'\" Jane sang with an impassioned whisper, apparently to the mirror in her locker. She was the tallest of the cheerleaders. Tan, leggy, lithe, her nut-brown hair scrunchied up in a topknot. She danced around, misjudged, went down on her butt over the bench and onto the floor, bounced back up with supernatural flexibility. \"'Look in my eyes!'\" Jane winked at her reflection - her eyes were jade green to Veronica's emerald. She wasn't at all embarrassed or self-conscious about singing, dancing and falling over; her falling over looked like part of the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the 'Moomsi Bop,'\" Veronica said, shifting only her gaze, following Pippi's amused eyeline to Jane and deciding what to make of Pippi based on her appreciation of said 'bop.' \"We're pretty ragtag, not the catty, supercilious middle school royalty people usually hope for - even if they won't admit it. And we need you, Powers. The superhuman strength and speed, the red hair, another set of awesome freckles... you were made for the Pumas. You <b>are</b> a natural complement to the squad, and we've been waiting for you. We need that fifth girl in the core. Grace us with those smashing pigtails of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica smiled fully, an honest shine after that overcast smirk of hers, and... Pippi resisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot, but I want to keep playing football right now,\" Pippi said, wrapping her towel a little more tightly around herself. \"I'll bet you guys can find another girl without trying too hard, since you don't seem mean or snobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charm offensive, phase one, <i>flameout</i>!\" Rachel exclaimed, which started amazed commentary between her, Ariel and Jane. Veronica looked both surprised and pleased at this demonstration of Pippi's willpower. Pippi felt like she'd just survived a grape jam tsunami. Wearing nothing but a towel! That Veronica was a very persuasive girl. Magic or some mental power? Pippi paused for a few more seconds of agreeable bewilderment before saying goodbye and heading back to her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There <i>isn't</i> another girl that'll be anywhere near as good as you,\" Veronica said, having slid up just as Pippi got back into her school uniform and prepared to head home. \"I don't want to be annoying about it, but I'm going to have to make my pitch a few more times. Think about it, won't you? You're missing your calling here, Powers, I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica gave a flicker of half-powered charm and stepped off. The locker room had mostly emptied by then, but Pippi thought this would get around in the rumor mill and ramp up to a mild irritation before too long.</span></div></div>",
