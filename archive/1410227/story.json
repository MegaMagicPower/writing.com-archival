Inuaysha and the gang had been tracking him down for the past couple of weeks and when they found him, he was terrorizing a village. So, after a long battle, he was dead. The villagers came out of their houses to thank the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for slaying that demon. Is there anything we can get you?\" One of the women villagers asked them. Of course Miroku was the one first to speek, moving over to both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually ladies, if we can have somewhere to stay the night and some food. We haven't eaten for a while\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir.

Miroku was in the same amount of pain he always was in after Sango hit him. He then felt his body being picked up. He realized it was Inuyasha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When will you ever learn Miroku?\" Inuyasha asked, bringing him into one of the huts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, when will he die?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaraku was upset. Not only did Inuyasha destroy his latest incarnation, but he destroyed all of the demons he sent after him and his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need something to stop him\". He opened his spellbook and flipped through some of the pages until one caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe something to make him dangerous with a little side effect\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInuyasha, Miroku and Shippo were in the hut, finishing their food. The girls had just left to go to the nearest hot springs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, that was good\" Miroku said, finishing his food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree. That was good\" Inuyasha agreed, patting his stomach. All of a sudden he felt an odd sensation flow through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So Gohan stepped up to do the cooking, since he knew his dad would only burn whatever he cooks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut tonight, Gohan was trying something different. He found a recipe for a potion that would increase strength and since he knew his dad was always trying to get stronger, he made some to pour in his dads water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, dinner was ready and Gohan called his dad, who was lying down on his bed. They started eating and just like Gohan wanted, Goku drank from his water. Gohan hoped it would work because he had made a whole container of the potion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they were finished with dinner, Goku started moving around in his chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Goku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is, Dad?\" Gohan asked, pretending not to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My chair feels a little small\". This was not the answer Gohan was expecting. He thought his dad would feel a rush of energy or something. But when they both got up, Gohan saw something odd. His dad looked like he had grown a couple inches. Goku though, hadn't noticed it yet. Gohan also noticed that he could see lines on Goku's shirt, lines that looked like he was growing a belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow tall does Goku grow?</span></div></div>",

He put a hand to his stomach and said, \"I feel strange...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dad?\" Gohan asked as he noticed his father grow a few more inches, his belly slightly pushing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It feels like something's swelling in my belly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly burped again, louder this time. Gohan noticed the growing was picking up speed. His shirt was starting to ride up showing the developing belly underneath. Gohan looked on in shock as only his height and his belly seemed to be increasing in size. His arms, legs, and chest were as muscular as they had always been, but his belly was swelling like it was filling with water. Goku had a worried look on his face as he saw his body changing to rapidly, but only let out another burp, this one loud enough to rattle the dishes. His growth picked up again, his pants tearing as he grew two feet in the next two seconds. The growth seemed to stop with Goku's head pressing up against the nine foot ceilings. His belly was sticking out in front of him like he had swallowed a beach ball. Goku rubbed it, the swelling sensation subsiding. Gohan reached out and stroked his dad's stomach, amazed at how tight the skin felt. Goku looked over his stomach at his son and said, \"Gohan...what happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan explained about the potion and how he wanted to make his dad stronger. Goku grabbed his son around the waist and hugged him, the young boy's legs straddling the ball of a belly. \"Thank you so much Gohan. I really do feel a lot stronger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Gohan asked, his face lightening as he realized his dad wasn't mad at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really.\" Goku said setting him back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't lying either. He felt much stronger than he had before. The gut wasn't anything to terrible either. It would take some getting used to but he had overcome worse hardships over the years. He smacked it and laughed as it bounced in front of him. This was actually kind of cool...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku looked down at Gohan who was gazing up at his father with a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Gohan...</span></div></div>",

Gohan grabbed his father around the waist and tried to knock his balance off but Goku kept his footing firm. In retaliation Goku moved his hands to Gohan's shoulders and shoved, pushing him toward the edge of the ring. At the very edge Gohan caught himself and forced his chest into his dad's stomach, forcing him back a few steps. Side stepping, Gohan got around the back of Goku and shoved. Goku flew forward a few feet before managing to right himself and charge Gohan again, ramming him as hard as he could with his belly. Gohan bounced backward, his feet sliding on the grass, nearly falling over.</span></div></div>",

It was a magical feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan let these thoughts fill his mind, he turned his head slightly, and, as if his dad's heavenly hands were still massaging his large, meaty feet, he fell over in a slight ecstasy. Only on on foot though. His eyes went wide as he fell into his dad's chest, knocking over the equally large man ,and accidentally, his lips pressed against Goku's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their eyes met, father and sun, Gohan could see the immense blush on Goku's cheek. He wasn't sure, but he probably had the exact same expression. Time seemed to stand still as this awkward and yet sensuous moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their lips parted, Goku blinked exasperatedly. \"Son, is everything alright?\" He asked, pressing his gut against Gohan's equally large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan wasn't sure what to say. \"I . . .\" He turned his gaze away from his father, and leaned off of him. \"S-sorry dad, my bad!\" He said, with a smile and a laugh that was easily his facade. Goku could tell that the growth had changed both of them, he just wondered how much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its alright son!\" He reassured his younger giant counterpart, placing his hands on the boy's shoulders, as both of the giants turn and sit down beside each other. Goku places his hand on his son's blue training pants - hardly loose anymore thanks to the growth - and shakes his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan still cannot help but blush, his rigid and now slightly pudgy face disdainful with a hint of lust for his father. He tried to smile it off, but he only turned and nodded. \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku turned his head in confusion, and then nodded. The more powerful of the family leaned off the ground, and quickly assisted his son up. \"Yeah, I'm sure.

His belly quickly started distending pushing his shirt up. Goten poked at his expanding belly and giggled at the feeling. He let out a huge belch and felt his body star getting taller. While his stomach and butt grew bigger along with him his arms, legs, and chest got slightly more muscular making his muscles more defined but not quite as defined as Goku or Gohan's. His pants tightened around his thighs before bursting at the seams. The same thing happened to his shirt, the sleeves shredding off while his chest burst the material on the front. Soon Goten had reached the full fifteen feet, the same as his brother and father. It was a new experience for everyone. For Goku and Gohan it was strange to be seeing Goten, who was normally around their knees, looking them in the eye. For Goten it was strange seeing his father and brother, people had always had to look up to, looking him in the eye. Now that all three Saiyans were the same size Goten said, \"I want to play a game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan rubbed his brother's belly and said, \"What kind of game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten thought about it for a moment and said, \"What were you and dad doing before I got home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku replied, \"We had a sumo match to see who would have to rub the other's feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten said, \"That sounds like fun! But I already rubbed both of your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about we have a sumo match with different stakes?\" Gohan suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten and Goku both agreed and all three males took positions around each other so that they were standing in a triangle pattern, equally separate from each other. Gohan said, \"Alright the stakes to this match are as follows. Whoever loses has to do whatever the winner says for the rest of the day! Agreed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed!\" Goku and Goten both replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Start on 1...2...3!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe backyard was suddenly a free for all of limbs and fat, the ground quaking with every movement from the heavy weight giants. The battle raged on but it soon became apparent that Gohan was losing stamina while Goku and Goten were determined to win. Without warning Goku slammed Gohan into the ground, eliminating him from the game. Gohan quickly rolled over to the sidelines and watched his father and brother continue to battle.

Goten sat down on top of Goku's belly and held his father down. \"No way! I'm just as big as you and Gohan so I'm not getting left out of this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku laughed again and said, \"Size doesn't have anything to do with it! You may be as big as me, but you're still just as young as you were. So, sorry, but this is all you get Goten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten suddenly jumped up and said, \"Then I'll just take the bottle for myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran over to the house, Goku struggling to his feet to chase after him. Gohan, who was laying on his side and reaching in through the doorway, his eyes scanning the kitchen from the window, was oblivious until he felt the ground vibrating under his formerly little brother's feet. He looked up just as Goten got close, dropping to the ground and slamming his hand through the window, going straight for the bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goten! What are you doing?\" Gohan said with a stern tone, swatting his brother's hand with his own. \"This is dad's stuff! You can't just steal it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on! This is for all of us!\" Goten argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan had always intended the bottle to be completely for Goku. It was his kindhearted father who had wanted to share it with him and then with Goten. He had only even gone THIS far because his father wanted him to. Now that he was enjoying being big and wanted to be even bigger Gohan wasn't about to deny his father just because his little brother was being childish. As they fought, their hands knocking over several other items and bottles as well as crashing into cupboards, Goku ran over. Goten saw him coming and, with a quick move, ducked under Gohan's hand and grabbed the bottle. \"Hah! Gotcha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yanked his arm out and tried to quickly get to his feet. Goku, however, quickly grabbed him and took the bottle out of his hand. Goten struggled but wasn't nearly as strong as his father, despite sharing his height. Gohan quickly took the bottle away from Goten and Goku let Goten go, grabbing the bottle from Gohan as he did so. Goten kicked at the ground, not looking into either of his family member's eyes, looking both sullen and a little ashamed at how he acted. Goku smiled and ruffled Goten's hair. \"Don't feel bad Goten. You just got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoten muttered, \"Sorry.\" as Goku uncorked the bottle. Gohan's eyes were shining as he watched Goku lift the bottle to his lips. With a quick motion, Goku began to drink, his throat working as he gulped down more and more of the potion. There was more in the tiny bottle than it seemed, Goku stopped after having taken quite a few big gulps. He sighed and wiped his mouth, corking the bottle again. There seemed to be about a quarter of it left. The swelling sensation quickly filled his gut again, the fleshy orb already pushing out further and further, his body stretching up taller, his muscles even growing a little larger. Suddenly, Goku opened his mouth and unleashed a MASSIVE burp, the wind blowing Goten and Gohan's hair back slightly. The ferocity of the burp caused Goten to look up in shock as Goku's body exploded upward in size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Gohan even knew he was in danger, Goku's belly slammed into him, lifting the teenager off the ground and into the air as Goku's body expanded larger and larger. Gohan gripped the tight globe as best he could, slowly slipping down it as his father grew. Panicking (and in his panic forgetting he could fly) Gohan looked for something he could grab on to. Luckily, Goku's belly button was just above him. He reached up and pulled himself into the ever expanding cave, sitting comfortable in the deep belly button. He looked down and was shocked to see his house was becoming nothing more than a tiny dot next to his father's massive toe. Scanning the ground, he barely saw Goten, trapped on top of his father's foot, unsure of what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs all this went on, Goku himself stared around in delight, everything shrinking down to miniature sizes before his eyes. He rubbed his huge gut, the swelling sensation filling him more fiercely than ever before, his belly hard and tight while his muscles grew larger to help support his ever expanding body. He leaned forward and chuckled as he saw his second toe plow through his former house. \"Guess we don't need that anymore!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan heard his father's voice rumble over the landscape, the voice of a thunderous god. He smiled as he heard his father's proclamation. Who needed a house when an enormous belly button was so much warmer and cozier? He laid out on his stomach, resting his head on his arms as he looked out with a sigh. This was EXACTLY what he had wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Goku's growth came to a halt, the trees of the forest barely tickling the bottoms of his toes. He stretched and put his arms behind his head, looking around. He spotted East City in the distance and grinned. \"I wonder how big the buildings are now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a new purpose in mind, Goku turned and started lumbering towards the city, the ground shaking and cracking under his tremendous weight.</span></div></div>",

He soon lifted it up and saw Goten was flatten. He grew scared to see his youngest son this way so he called Gohan. Gohan quickly moved out his father's belly button and flew on top of his father's belly saying\"Hey Dad, what's wrong.\" Gohan I accidently flatten your brother Goten while the growth began. How do we save him from being crushed by so much weight. Goku said worriedly. Gohan soon thought back and rembered the book. It must of had a way to reverse this problem. I'll be right back said Gohan flying down at the remands of their former house. He began searching through every piece of rubble and stone to find the book it took him about twenty minutes to find it. As he began looking throw the pages he found a way to help Goten reform. But Goku might not like it though. Gohan flew back on top of his dad's belly and said\" Dad, I found a way to restore Goten but you may not like it.\" Well son, it can't be that bad. So tell me how we can restore Goten? said Goku \"Well, you have to eat him.\" Say what! You mean I have to eat my own son. \"Not just that you have to also focus the energy in your belly to help reform but it will only make him revert back into a baby. Which you'll would be pregnant for about 9 months.\" Gohan said to his father Well, I do feel hungry, bring him here son and drink the rest of the potion so you can help me take of him and my needs. Alright Gohan said happily grabbing Goten and sent him down Goku's throat heading straight to his belly. Goku burped and began to rub his belly in love and care as he got up to see Gohan's new growth.</span></div></div>",

Not huge, but a few feet above his father and brother. Suddenly he thought of something. Maybe his dad and brother would let him get bigger since he won the match. He didn't see any harm in it and they probably wouldn't either. So when Gohan and Goku stopped rubbing Goten said, \"Can I get a little bigger please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku and Gohan looked at each other as Goten said this. Gohan looked at his brother and said, \"I don't know Goten. We're already pretty big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to get really big! Just a little bigger.\" Goten said. \"I'll be good, I promise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smiled at his son and said, \"Maybe we should let him Gohan. He's not going to do anything wrong and it'll be fun to have the youngest of us be the biggest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan shrugged and said, \"Alright if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took the now tiny bottle of potion in his hand and told Goten to tilt his head back and open his mouth. Goten did as he was told and Gohan poured in a small amount of the potion. Goten swallowed it and licked his lips, the swelling sensation already present in his stomach. Goku and Gohan watched as Goten started growing, his belly stretching out, his butt getting a little more padding, and his height slowly increasing. Goku and Gohan stepped back as Goten's belly rose above their heads, followed by his thighs and knees. When his kneecaps were just over their heads he stopped growing.

I really like you now and you'd be even better bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku rubbed his stomach thoughtfully. It would be something to be even bigger. But this was already pretty darn big. But how could he say no to his son's big doe eyes? Gohan wanted Goku to get bigger so that his belly could be big enough to sleep on. Maybe even big enough that his belly button could be used as a little house for him! He loved the idea of being close to his father as he grew into a mighty colossus, a pillar of power to the whole world. Granted these were the thoughts of an energetic kid who couldn't (or didn't want to) see the reality of such a situation. In the end Goku allowed Gohan to pour more of the potion into his water. Goku chugged the glass of water and potion and waited to change. Soon he felt the familiar swelling in his gut and let out a burp.

Gohan watched in delight as his father grew more, his butt pushing him up while his height started increasing more and more. Gohan ran out of his house as his father filled it up with his swelling flesh, breaking down the walls and ceiling. Gohan looked up, enraptured as he father rose to his feet. He looked much the same as he had before he started growing except for his belly which was now hanging down between his legs and his butt which had more padding but still looked strong without any hint of drooping.

Gohan explored over the foot, the toes clenching as Goku's nerves reacted to his son's touch. Gohan rubbed both feet in this way before flying up to his father's belly. Gohan's own belly rubbed against his father's far larger one as he rubbed his hands over the expanse of flesh. Goku's hand came down once again to glide his son over his copious amounts of flesh and Gohan was more than happy to be directed in such a manner. As Goku lazily slid his son over his flesh he pondered what to do next. With his giant size he could do anything he wanted and no one would be able to stop him. And if they even came close he could just drink more of Gohan's potion and he would be big enough to take on any foe.

He was about half the size of the stomach and could still use it as a bed but he was disappointed that his bed had been severely reduced. But he also didn't want to disappoint his dad so he would grow when he asked. Likewise, Goku would grow for Gohan when he wanted to. Gohan hugged his father and said, \"Now that I'm bigger what do you want to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku thought about is, stroking his son's back. He wiggled his toes and though about how nice it would be to get a massage again. But he had that done twice already. He shifted Gohan off his stomach and stood up. Gohan only came up to his knee. Even though Gohan was a giant compared to normal humans he felt like a child again next to his father. Goku looked down at his son and said, \"Let's go for a walk Gohan. A change of scenery will be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan followed his dad's thundering footsteps as he traveled across the landscape. Seeing Goku in motion was an amazing experience for Gohan. He wondered what it would be like to be riding his father's feet or on top of his belly. He looked at the bottle in his hand and smiled.

Master Roshi was taking a rare trip off his island to go searching for new magazines since he had gone through the old ones so many times many of the pictures were faded out. 18 was also out, taking Marron on a trip into the city for a few days to look at prospective schools and shop for school supplies. Chi Chi had filled 18's head with strange notions about school life and she was taking extra pains to ensure her daughter would be safe no matter what school she was put in. This left Krillin alone with the island to himself and he was going to take advantage of it. He had been planning on relaxing on the beach in his swim trunks when he felt the ground shake around him. Looking out into the see he was shocked to see a monstrous shape coming toward him from the ocean. He prepared himself for the worst when he suddenly realized he recognized the monstrous shape. It was Goku! Krillin watched, slack jawed in amazement, as his gigantic friend arrived on the island. Of course, he was so big his feet were really on either side of the island, his pinky toes soaking in the water. Krillin wasn't even as tall as Goku's toes! Standing behind Goku's right leg was Gohan, reaching only as high as his knee, but still looking terrifying. Goku crouched down as best as his belly would allow and said, \"Hey Krillin!\" in a booming voice. Krillin could only barely manage to stutter out, \"G-G-Goku...WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?!?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku laughed at Krillin's reaction and said, \"Gohan made a strengthening potion for me and it worked in a way neither of us was expecting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan patted his father's leg and said, \"I want to keep him huge but he keeps wanting me to grow to match him. That's why I'm so big right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin gulped and nodded slowly. \"That's...interesting. Is there something you came to see me for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku laughed at the question and said, \"Do you really have to ask? Don't you want to be huge too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan looked up at his father and said, \"That's a great idea! If Krillin was bigger than me then you'd have someone to keep you company at your size and I'd get to enjoy two gods!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and said, \"My thoughts exactly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin shook his head wildly and said, \"Whoah, whoah, wait! What are you talking about? I can't grow like you guys! What would 18 think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku scratched his head and said, \"Come to think of it what is Chi Chi going to think about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan shrugged and said, \"We shouldn't worry about mom. What were doing is making us happy and that is what's important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku nodded and said, \"Exactly. What about you Krillin? You can't tell me you've never dreamed of being taller.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin sighed and said, \"You're right. I've always been jealous because you've been so much taller than me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan shook the potion in Krillin's line of sight and said, \"With a few gulps of this you can make that dream a reality. Of course it comes with extra features!\" He slapped his gut and butt to show what he meant by \"extra features\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin weighed the pros and cons in his mind and finally came to a decision. Something like this came along once in a lifetime and he wasn't going to give it up. Gohan handed him the potion and told him how much to drink. Krillin started gulping and instantly felt the swelling sensation burst in his stomach. He held it slightly and burped loudly, the growth beginning.</span></div></div>",

Gohan, on the other hand, lay stretched out across his Dad's stomach, face down and his cock grinding into the firm bally belly as he slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, Krillin lazily opened his eyes, and he could feel something raging in his loins. Had his libido grown just as much as this ball belly equipped on his stomach had? All he could think of, as he lay on the beach, 50 feet tall beside his 50 foot talll best friend was grabbing his body and making sweet love to him. His cock demanded it, he thought, and so Krillin sat up, disregarding Gohan's awakening form and the seemingly asleep Goku's desire, and leaned ontop of Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wake up, sleepy heads!\" Krillin said with a smirk on his face, as he sat on with his knees around Goku's bodacious thighs. Their bellies touched from the bottom, and, as Gohan awoke, he could feel his feet trapped between the muscular body fat of his father and his almost uncle, considering how close Goku and Krillin were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, boddy?\" Goku moaned from below, leaning one arm up to wipe the sinking sun from his eyes. He was grateful, however, that Krillin's bald head blocked any direct contact to the sun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin leaned in, covering more of the two titans' bellies together as well as forcing Gohan's entire lower body between the two ball guts. Krillin smiled lustfully. He longed for his equally large friend's muscular form, that much was obvious. As Krillin let his knees rest and slid his legs atop Goku's, the pressure on Gohan's body continued to infrease. An unaware Krillin was not thinking about the small-fry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku too decided not to think of his son as he draped his meaty, pulsing arms over Krillin's body, and pull the bald-headed god to his body. He watched as Krillin's head fell just below his chin. He must have slid down a bit. \"What's wrong Krillin, don't like my lips?\" Goku replies softly, his boyish smile gleaming with lust and his eyes filled with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan, on the other hand, felt his entire body being smothering b Krillin's and Goku's lusting muscle-chub like bodies. He felt his flabby body encompassed by the two titanic lovers, sandwiching him like bread and cheese. He struggled his arms and legs, trying to tell Krillin that he was trapped, but it was no avail. Realizing this, he started to feel the encompassing flesh grow larger around him. Was this the case? He couldn't tell, but Goku's deep belly button, near his feet, was getting larger and closer as Krillin slid across his father's body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess Goku, I still like being the shorty!\" Krillin moaned softly, as he began sucking on Goku's flabby left nipple, the wrinkled skin redfining its shape to the giant bald man's touch with every suckle, every tongue lashing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku moaned in response, the nipple play something he had not thought of before, a new concept. He dragged his arms down Krillin's back rolls. He wondered how Krilln even had muscle under all that fat, but he had always had a compact body. Goku's hands reached Krillin's chubby ass, and he started to mold the formerly small body builder's buttcheeks in his hands. \"I never knew your ass was so . . .\" Goku struggled for the words, his ecstasy on the rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Free?\" Krillin said, as he leaned up from the nipple, and slid his body back to get eye-to-eye with Goku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Gohan had begun shrieking with pleasure and a horny sensation! He concluded, as with Krillin's last sliding movement, that because of the pressure on his body, the growth formula must have started to wear off on him! In the center of the two bellies of these godly figures, however, he knew, as he slipped into Goku's slightly expansive belly button, that he would be safe.He pushed up against the 'roof' of his little cage, Krillin's own gut, and tired to see if his masters would feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was right there between our stomachs!\" Krillin groaned softly, and knew Goku would worry too much if his son was gone to have sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku shook his head. He leaned his hand down, and plucked his pinky into his belly button. He felt a little body in there and plucked it from the hole!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gohan plopped into Goku's hand, his eyes grew extremely wide, staring up at the awe-filled faces in front of him! His cock sprung to life immediately, looking up from the height of Goku's belly button to the muscular upper arms and flabby pecs of his dad and Krillin all the way up to their faces, smiles replaced by shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to you, son!?\" Goku asked, his 50 foot voice booming into Gohan's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, dad . . \" Gohan, in the midst of his horny stuttering and trying to catch his breath, explained what he thought had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it . . \" Krillin said, his awe filled face turning into a smile. Gohan could tell that smile was a devilish, erotic one. Krillin uncouthly plucked Gohan from Goku's hand, and held him up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're toy sized now!\" Krillin said, with a laugh, a condescending laugh. He enjoyed this! Frankly, Krillin wouldn't have had it any other way. Now someone else was the small fry. \"C'mon Goku! Lets play with our new toy!\" He leaned against Goku's body, and Gohan got scared. Surely his dad wouldn't let Krillin play with him right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin looked to Goku, as the giant baldy held his son in two fingers. He raised and eyebrow, as Krillin raised Goku to his lips. \"Well, it couldn't hurt. I saw the look on your cock, son. You want this just as much as we do!\" Goku wrapped his lips around Gohan's lower half, engulfing his son's legs and his genitals in his mouth, as Krillin leaned foward, locked his lips with Goku's, and trapped Gohan in the middle of the kiss of these two gods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan, knowing his father was right, felt as if he was in heaven. His body, drenched in saliva as his two owners exchanged minutes of passionate kiss. He felt that he might drown in the saliva of these two giants, but that would be his life, the sex toy for these two chubby men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Krillin broke the kiss, he slurped Gohan into his mouth, letting the toy fill the expanse of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoku smirked, and shook his head. He rubbed his fingers over Krillin's nipples, and said. \"Come on Krillin, spit it out.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrillin unwillingly agrees and spits you out on . . </span></div></div>",

Naruto swiftly diverted his target from Ichiraku's to Hinata, and landed right in front of her. \"Hinata,\" he comforted, \"are you okay? Is something wrong?\" Hinata continued weeping. \"Aw, come on!\" Naruto wailed. \"Isn't there something I can do to make you feel better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, hmmm, hmmm...\" she whispered, \"Yes, there is something you can do...\" That's when Hinata...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a fine day in Lilycove City, Hoenn, where Drew, Pokemon Coordinator extraordinare, was preparing to once again sweep the local Contest.  Presently, the green-haired showman was waiting near the Berry Blender, eager to try making Pokeblocks from some new Berries he'd found outside Fortree City.  They were apparently a new species, having proven unidentifiable even to the Berry Master.  He was sure that they would make excellent supplements for his Contest stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the man in front of him finished up, he moved forward toward the machine, taking a brief moment to wave to some of his adoring female fans before dropping the berries into the slot.  After he finished blending (he got the best score, as always), he removed the newly-made Pokeblocks, which, to his surprise, were rainbow-coloured.  'Hmm...', he thought.  'Never seen anything quite like this... I wonder what it'll do?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling out his prized Roselia, he tossed one of the new Pokeblocks toward her.  She sniffed the cube suspiciously for several seconds before greedily gobbling it up.  In an instant, the Grass-type Pokemon suddenly sprung up, filled with boundless energy.  The large blue and red roses that comprised her hands seemed to fill with vibrant colour, growing slightly larger as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Drew was quite shocked at this sight.  \"Wow!\" he exclaimed aloud.  \"With this, I'll win for sure!\"  Just as he finished, his eyes drifted toward the remainder of the rainbow-striped candies, and he suddenly became aware of their enticing aroma.  As he stared at the Pokeblocks, he was overcome by a desire to eat them as Roselia had... they seemed almost to call out to him.  Before he knew what he was doing, he had already placed one in his mouth, chewing it slowly and savouring its heavenly taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... \"Wait, what am I doing?!  Bleh, these are for Pokemon!  ... Though it did taste really, really good...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Giving in to the allure of the Pokeblocks, Drew quickly gobbled up all of the remaining ones, taking note of how filling they seemed.  Now brimming with energy himself, he recalled Roselia into her Pokeball and took off toward the stage.  \"Ow!\" he said, bumping his head on the doorframe.  \"Odd... I don't remember it being so short.  Oh, well.  I've got a Contest to win!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young coordinator barreled down the hallway, still riding the high from the energy-rich Pokeblocks and not noticing the extra weight he was now carrying.  As he settled down backstage to further prepare, he got a better look at himself... and was quite surprised!  Over the past ten minutes or so, he had developed a rather pronounced gut, which now poked out from under his shirt.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... that's not right.  I sure have let myself go; I gotta cut down on the sweets!\"  Still in his energetic state, he half-heartedly pulled his shirt down and focused on tidying up Roselia, quickly tossing aside the notion that his viewpoint seemed to have shifted nearly a foot higher... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And, next in our lineup for today is... Drew-- er, there seems to be a smudge over the last name here.  Oh, well.  Drew, of LaRousse City, and his incomparable Roselia!\"  Upon hearing his name, Drew grabbed Roselia and headed toward the stage, ignoring the odd... swelling sensation he felt.  \"Hey, buddy, are you alright?\" asked an older coordinator behind him.  \"You look like you're... pulsating or something.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine; I suggest you focus on yourself, pal.\"  As he walked onto the stage, the MC turned to greet him.  \"And here he is, folks, Dre-- OH, MY GOD!\"  He stopped short upon seeing Drew, who had, by now, ballooned to a tremendous size.  At least 12 feet tall and still growing, he had also gotten considerably fatter.  His belly, face, and limbs had all bloated to immense proportions, the latter starting to hang over his knees, and the crowd cried out in horror as he continued to expand.  The haze that had fallen over the boy's mind after eating the Pokeblocks suddenly lifted as his clothes began to tear off, and he became fully aware of his situation again.  </span></div></div>",

He thought up all the possibilities, and all the risks, but it looked like a pretty sold plan. See, a week ago, his Koopa Troopas were out gathering Super Mushrooms when they somehow stumbled on one that had to be at least the size of a fridge! After bringing it into the castle, the Magikoopas examined it and said that it's effects were about 10 times as powerful as a regular Super Mushroom! He then ordered his underlings to have it cooked into a stew for him, so he could gain enough power to finally destroy the Mario brothers. The only problem was that once the effects take hold, he'd need to march into the Mushroom Kingdom and get rid of his greatest threats immediately. The effects are only temporary, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gwahahahahaha! There's no way this plan could possibly fail!\" he told himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Koopas and the Moombas were all busy in the kitchen, getting everything ready for Bowser's big mushroom stew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the salt! The salt! Too much of that would overpower the flavor of the mushroom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head chef merely shook his head as his apprentices ran here and there. He was busy getting everything prepared,he didn't notice one clumsy Koopa put an extra ingredient into the dish.</span></div></div>",

I'm scared.\" Joey actually whimpered as he pushed his chair away from the table and stood up, revealing his bulging belly, that had grown so large that the Italian had been forced to unbutton his shirt and pull his tee up agaisnt his chest, \"I just can't stop eating.\" Joey was still digging out the last few drops of ice-cream from the bottom of the tub.</span></div></div>",

If you squeeze out onto the balcony you could drop down to the street below, and from there we can get you more food.\"<br>\r\nJoey had to admit the plan made sense, twisting onto his hands and knees he made his way to the balcony doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChandler approached behind his friend, standing behind the titan ass of his friend his head only just stood above Joey's arched back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry was sitting on his bed, thinking and staring into space. School was almost over for this year, just three more days left. For the first time all year, he didn't have homework, so he was trying to think of something productive to do. Just as he got his head wrapped around an idea, Ron came into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what'cha doing?\" he asked. Harry came out of his daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just thinking. We don't have any homework so i'm kinda bored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" Ron said, \"Well I have something for you to do. Hagrid told me to give you this letter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon placed the letter in front of Harry and went over to his bed to get something out of his suitcase. Harry opened the letter and read it:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome see me as soon as possible<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird,\" Harry said after reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is?\" Ron asked closing his suitcase and walking over to Harry's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hagrid just told me to come see him. No details or anything.\" Ron looked at the letter too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, maybe he didn't have time to write anything else, or maybe it's supposed to be a big secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" Harry said, putting it in his pocket, \"Well, you know where i'll be then.\" He got up and went to his suitcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll be dark in two hours Harry\", Ron told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think it'll last two hours and if it does, that's why I have this.\" Harry pulled out his invisibility cloak. Ron nodded and Harry left the room. He put the invisibility cloak in his pocket and headed outside, Hagrids hut wasn't a long trip out, but it wasn't short either. It took him a couple minutes until he arrived. He knocked on Hagrids door and heard loud footsteps coming. The door opened and Harry looked up into the cheery face of his friend Hagrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry, come in.\" Harry walked into the house and saw Fang laying by the fire. He went over and patted the dog on the head, then walked back over to Hagrid, who was sitting at his table. Harry sat and started the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what is this all about? Why didn't you write anything else?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a secret Harry. Just in case someone snatched it from Ron, we didn't want anyone else knowing,\" Hagrid replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dumbledore and I. Harry we know that you-know-who will stop at nothing to kill you, especially after that last stunt he pulled, so we came up with an idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how would you like to live with me over the summer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was shocked. Was this real? Did Hagrid just offer him the best thing ever? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry?\" Hagrid was worried. Harry was just staring out. \"Harry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Harry answered, \"Yes! I would love to live with you over the summer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrids face lit up. He was happy as well, he never really sees anyone during the summer, besides rare visits from Dumbledore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, well then I gu-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid interrupted Harry \"-There's one other little bit that I didn't mention yet and it's the one you are going to want to think about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stopped. His world crashed around him. What could it be that he would have to think about? Could it stop him from possibly having the best summer of his life?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though Dumbledore and I both want you to stay for the summer, we don't want this leaking out to everyone, especially those close to you-know-who. The spell over you're Aunt and Uncles house isn't placed over this one, so you don't have the protection you would have if you were there this summer. Dumbledore and the teachers will still be here though. Now we still want you-know-who thinking you're at you're relatives house, that way he knows he can't harm you. But again, we can't have people know that you are staying here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Ron and Hermione?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They can visit if they want. But no one else. We can't let every single person know, because we don't know who is or isn't a follower of you-know-who.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well what do I have to think about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid pointed to a black cauldron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you stay here, we don't want anyone else knowing it. So in the cauldron is a potion that will-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Polyjuice potion?\" Harry interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It's like a polyjuice potion but it doesn't transform you into someone else. It just transforms you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Into what?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the beauty of it. It's like a polyjuice potion meaning you need a hair from a person, but instead of changing into the person, you just gain their features.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, since we can't have you looking like you are now in fear that someone close to you-know-who finds out, we think it would be best to change your appearence. So we decided to make you look sort-of like me. You drink the potion, you'll gain some weight, grow a bit bigger, grow some facial hair like mine and you'll look almost like me. You'd still be you, just have a bit of my characteristics.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was speechless. He had to admit this was a weird plan, but he wanted to stay with Hagrid over the summer and not go back to his horrid relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't I still end up looking like you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Your hair and my hair are about the same color, so we'll look more alike, but say if it was Ron, his hair would still be red. Plus, your face would look entirely different then mine. Like I said Harry, it's not a polyjuice potion, so you won't look exactly like me. Dumbledore just wants it so that if a stranger comes by, no one will recognize you. We'll just pass you off as a brother who is visiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's mind couldn't stop thinking. 'Well, If I stay here, I have to stick with this odd plan. But I'll still probably have a better summer than at the Dursley's.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do you say?\" Hagrid asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt like his brain and mouth weren't connected. His brain was saying 'Wait, I need more time', but his mouth said \"Sure, why not.\" 'Well', Harry thought \"At least I made a decision.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Hagrid said with a smile on his face. \"After school is over you'll bring your stuff here and by then, Dumbledore said that if you said yes, he'd put another room in the house for you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could see that Hagrid was excited about this. 'I guess i'm sorta glad I made this decision. Not only will I have a better summer than if I stayed with the Dursley's, but Hagrid will too.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid was talking a bit about some of the changes when Harry interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do I have to take this potion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid answered Harry's question, \"Well, Dumbledore told me to give it to you right after you gave me your answer. See, it takes about a week to complete, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then won't people notice before school is out\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he told me that you should gain some weight, grow a couple inches and maybe, start getting a bit of facial hair, but it won't start to kick in until the last three days, so everyone will be long gone by the time it really starts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens after that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll be that way for about a week, then you'd have to take another cup of the potion, but don't worry there is enough potion to last the whole summer. But if you wind up not taking the potion, you'll automatically go back to how you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHagrid went over to the cauldron to get a cup of the potion for Harry, who was sitting in the chair, thinking 'This is it. If I have any last minute decisions, I need to make it now'. But he never did. Hagrid walked over with the cup in his hands and set it in front of Harry. Harry stared at the potion, which was green. It didn't look like the worst thing in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you waiting for?\" Hagrid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right\" Harry said. He raised the cup to his lips and drank it. It tasted a bit like lemonade, but it was a faint taste. It mostly had almost no taste at all. Once he realized it was all gone, he set the cup down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think I should be going now Hagrid,\" Harry said. Hagrid looked outside<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey, you're right! It's almost dark out, sorry Harry\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Hagrid. I brought my invisibility cloak,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well I'll see you later and happy growing\" Hagrid said with a chuckle. Harry laughed back, put his cloak on and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived back in the dormitory,</span></div></div>",

Everyone was asleep excpet for Ron, who was sitiing on his bed cross-legged and looking around, probably waiting for him. The door creeked and Ron looked toward the door, \"Harry?\". Harry thought Ron looked qute when he was confused. Yes, Harry had admitted to himself that he had a crush on his best friend. He tried to fight it off for a while, telling himself it was just a phase he'd outgrow, or that he was interested in girls, but he came to accept the fact that he loved Ron. The problem being, He doesn't know if Ron likes him, let alone even be gay. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's me\", Harry whispered, \"Come down to the common room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Ron quickly and quietly jumped out of bed and went down the stairs, following the still invisible Harry. They reached the common room, Harry took off the cloak, and sat in one of the chairs, Ron sat on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's up?\" Ron asked. Harry told Ron everything that Hagrid told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you'd rather look like Hagrid then spend a summer with your relatives?\" Ron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Harry said, bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you must really hate them then. But, then-\" Ron started before Harry interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can come visit. In fact, I think I'd force you to come within the first month. I love Hagrid, but I don't think I could spend the whole summer with just him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great.So when is this change supposed to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess now. Hagrid said it'll be slow the first couple of days, but it'll start speeding up once school is done with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both sat in silence before Harry started talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we better head off to bed, we still have school tomorrow\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon nodded and they both walked upstairs and went to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning</span></div></div>",

His chest had never before had hairs on it, but Harry now saw think wisps that made up a happy trail. He then put a hand to his face and felt the familiar features though the few facial hairs Harry had seemed rougher than he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Harry heard someone at the water jug by his bed. \"Ron?\" He whispered in a voice that sounded a little rougher than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Ron. \"How is it working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Harry said.

He must have been nearly as tall as Hagrid now, and certainly no longer fit on his four poster, which creaked and groaned angrily under the weight.

It was just delivered from the body of the second burliest man ever to visit Hogwarts castle. Harry grabbed at what would have been the bedsheets at his old height, but turned out to be the four poster curtains at his new one. The curtains came down, as did the top of one of the bed posts, but Harry managed to cover his offending nakedness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore stopped and straightened his robes. He had clearly been running, but the man was somehow never out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for the interruption, but I assure you that it was urgent and necessary. Hagrid happened to mention that you were becoming... closer friends than before. While that would not normally be a problem, I'm afraid you'll want to delay any further physical activity for a week. The potion I've provided can have unexpected side effects during... heightened states.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth boys had already been blushing impossibly and wishing to be anywhere else when Dumbledore entered. With each passing word they prayed harder, that they would be free or he would stop. They were incredibly grateful when he did not expand on the meaning of heightened states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given that Mr. Weasley has already begun to take part in the transformation, I am going to recommend to his parents that he remain with us here at Hogwarts for the duration of the summer, so as not to arouse suspicion of the manner of Harry's camouflage. I trust you will take this as good news.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon and Harry were smiling widely but neither looked each other in the eye for the awkward presence of Dumbledore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will leave you in a moment, but you'll need to get down to Hagrid's hut as quickly as possible without being seen. I trust you can manage that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to consider winking but thought better of it. \"The potion's transformation should stabilize in 6 days time. Until that time, do not engage in physical contact, as your transformations will feed off each other and you may change to extreme sizes. The change may even become permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDumbledore left, quickly but still graciously, and Harry plopped down on the bed. The mattress stretched and the bed creaked angrily. He was deflated and confused, as he often was after talking to Dumbledore. But also as usual, he followed the sage advice. Using the marauder's map and the invisibility cloak (though the latter just had to be wrapped around his waist) the two managed the halls of the castle and the path to Hagrid without being seen. Hagrid must still have been at the castle, but they went inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry noticed a door on the left side of the room, he'd never seen before. And from the outside, he was sure there wouldn't have been enough space for that room to exist. He opened the door and saw a second bedroom, shifting around even growing before their eyes. Harry stepped through the door and almost fell over -- the floorboards were shifting under his feet. They drew him forward suddenly, several feet, he stumbled and then fell onto a very long single bed. He felt the bed stretch its width beneath him and become a double wide long enough to accomodate Hagrid plus 1. Harry looked back to Ron and gave an evil grin. As though the spell was watching them, however, Harry felt the bed continue to stretch and then divide into two extra long single beds. One moved across the room with a sassy step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon laughed. But he still moved closer to Harry. He walked in and...</span></div></div>",

As he finished the sentence a wall stretched to create a fireplace, where a cauldron was already bubbling with the green liquid. Ron ladled himself a glass and raised it to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe threw it back like he'd seen his brother Charlie take shots of firewhiskey. It felt right, somehow. More manly than he was used to, but so was his body at the moment. The potion felt hot and uncomfortable in his belly. It was only a glass but somehow it felt like he'd eaten a whole feast -- and it took a lot to make Ron feel overfull. Ron collapsed into a chair as the feeling spread throughout his body -- a wild fever making it feel like he was heating the entire room. He threw open the windows to the night air but it barely helped. His shirt, already stretched the limit by his growth wouldn't come off -- he tore it off. Ron collapsed onto the empty bed and tried to beathe but his stomach began to hurt. He clutched it. Harry came to him, worried. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon's belly began to inflate. It looked much like filling with food but much faster. Ron twisted in the bed so Harry began to rub his belly. Just the beginning of his touch made a dramatic difference. As he began to make large sweeping circles, Ron could feel the excess heat leave him and flow into Harry. The room was still warm, but no longer the feverish sauna of a few minutes ago. Just as Ron began to approach comfortable, he felt a change beginning. The potion seemed to be more focussed than before.</span></div></div>",

The pants he was wearing weren't designed to be skin tight but they definitely were now. His face got round and his cheek dimples deeper. The heat dissipated as he changed and a smile grew across his face. Finally his belly's inflation changed shape -- no longer like a full meal, the roundness spread and became softer. Harry was rubbing a full-fledged gut now. Just as it finished, though, Harry felt a shock that made him pull back. The heat concentrated in Ron's belly had moved through his hand to his own. He stumbled and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's change was much faster though. In a matter of seconds his robes ripped in three places as his belly grew to a gut, his thighs grew thicker, and his butt grew wider and fuller (unfortunately not in time to cushion his fall).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon got up quickly to help Harry, but the moment he stood he felt dizzy, and when he tried to lift Harry they both fell back to the ground. In the process, their pants ripped in three new places -- Ron's all along the sides, being hand-me-downs. They laughed, and smiled and Ron noticed the funny line of Harry's belly just emerging under the bottom of his shirt and the torn side seam. He moved forward and touched it, lightly. Harry smiled and looked into Ron's eyes with a possessive lust. If it ever occurred to them that they shouldn't be doing this, the thought was discarded before it could even fully form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon straddled Harry and slid both hands under his shirt. Harry's breathing increased. They both frantically worked to remove the shirt and after an eternal 3 seconds just ripped it off. Ron pushed down and kissed Harry, their bellies grinding together and their growing manhoods touching lightly through strained pants. Their bellies felt amazing, but the pants were now painfully tight. Harry's wand chose that moment to fall from the bed. He caught it with his usual dexterity and breathily enchanted \"Diffindo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting spell was so powerful the pillowcases ripped. The clothes remaining on Harry and Ron had literally been reduced to threads and they were naked on top of each other.

You are pretty cocky and relaxed lately since you have been able to make a bit of money gambling lately. While at the Cantina, you are getting a bit drunk. They eventually kick you out and Chewie helps get you back toward the millium falcon. On your way, some bug bites you. It hurts like shit, causing you to fall down on your knees, scraping your hands on some odd looking metal object. The trauma causes you to black out and Chewie carries you toward your ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile en route, you start getting heavier by the minute. Eventually, your buddy can't hold you any longer. He sets you on the ground outside the falcon and tries shaking you awake. You start coming too, wondering what the hell was happening. Some combination of events earlier must have really affected your body. You look down and your taut stomach starts pressing hard on your shirt, busting the buttons on your leather vest. Your feet start to hurt, so you sit up and reach to take off your shoes. Before you can get them off, your feet rip out of the foot ware. Your friend is making growling noises. Energy seems to be surging into your drunk body. You are able to stand up and now dwarf your loyal little furball of a friend. Clothing is shredding and falling off your quickly growing frame. You two are far enough away from the action of the Cantina that nobody seems to notice yet. You pick up Chewbacca and head to a more remote area, \"What happened little buddy?\" you ask. He obviously has no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only have you been getting taller by the minute, but the bulk is adding on. Your biceps and thighs are now beefy, bordering on obese. At twenty feet tall, you are starting to get excited, \"I could crush Jabba under my foot now!\"</span></div></div>",

He employs a retinue of career criminals, bounty hunters, smugglers, assassins and bodyguards to operate his criminal empire.

Jabba has a grim sense of humor, an insatiable appetite, and affinities for gambling, slaves, and torture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps you might want to be a giant Gamorrean Guard. Jabba the Hutt actually employed a bunch of these beasts. They are a species of tall, strong bipeds. The Gamorreans had porcine traits, like an upturned nose with large nostrils, jowls, and tusks. Their hulking bodies were covered in green, thick and hairless skin. They had five digits on every extremity, each sporting a hard nail. The digits of their hands included an opposable thumb, which allowed the Gamorreans to easily grasp and handle objects. The males are referred to as boars.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Scooby Gang had split up again..sort of. Daphne and Velma had taken a break from the mystery solving to go to a women self-empowering camp. Daphne bugged Velma for weeks to go and when Velma still said no, Daphne dragged her along anyway. This meant that Scooby, Shaggy and Fred were left in the Mystery Machine. <br>\r\n\"Like, it's been a day since the girls left and I'm already bored\" Shaggy said. He was in the passenger seat and Fred was driving. Scooby was in the back, laying down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Shaggy, we'll do something,\" Fred told Shaggy, \"There just hasn't been any excitment today\". All of a sudden, three big growls sounded out. They knew it was their stomachs, since they hadn't eaten all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Fred, like when are we gonna stop for something to eat. Even your stomach is telling you to feed it\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, next restaurant you see, tell me and we'll go there\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaggy and Scooby both looked out the windows to find somewhere to eat but couldn't see a building in sight. After what seemed like forever, Shaggy spotted a building in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fred, there's a building up ahead,\" Shaggy quickly said. Fred noticed it too and parked in the parking lot of the building. They noticed the sign read \"Barry's Burgers\". As they walked inside, they noticed they were the only people in the room. As they sat down, a man came out of one of the back doors. He was about 6'3 and looked like he weighed 350 pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evening fellas, I'm Barry, what brings you boys here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we haven't eaten all day and we're really hungry\" Fred answered, which was quickly followed by their stomachs growling. Barry laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can hear that. Here,\" he handed them three menus, \"Decide what you want and i'll be back soon\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, thanks Barry\", Shaggy said as Barry walked away. After a bit of deciding, the three called Barry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what have you all decided?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Fred and Scooby ordered two regular burgers. Barry then turned to Shaggy, \"What about you, young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the 'Special Burger'?\" Shaggy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarry smiled, \"That's a burger topped with our special sauce\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then I guess i'll try two of those\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, your meal will be out in a bit\". Barry left and the guys sat at the table and talked for a bit. Barry arrived back ten minutes later with their orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two regular burgers for the young gentleman, two regular for the dog, and two special burgers for the other young man. Enjoy\". Barry went to another table and started cleaning it. The boys started eating their burgers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shaggy, how's that special?\" Fred asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad. In fact, it's really good\", Shaggy replied. They couldn't see the twinkle in Barry's eye as he kept cleaning. After they finished their meal, Barry came over to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was it?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Real rood\" said Scooby, who patted his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\" added Shaggy, \"And, like, that special was delicious. How much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Barry said, \"It comes to twenty dollars\". Fred paid him and they started walking out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'See you later Barry and thanks\" Shaggy yelled back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your welcome young man and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day\". Barry replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

Don't kill off the giant(s)<br>\r\n2. No vore. Sorry, it's just not my thing. The giants can eat people, but they can't eat people their own size. <br>\r\n3. There can be gay stuff. I don't mind it. Sex stuff is allowed too.<br>\r\n4. NO GIRL GIANTS! There are other interactives for those, but not this one. Only the males grow.<br>\r\n5. The giants can shrink, but only down to their original height. No shrinking beyond that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGIft Points: I am now awarding gift points for chapters.
