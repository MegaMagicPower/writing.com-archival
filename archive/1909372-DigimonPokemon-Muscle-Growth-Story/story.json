He was one of the stronger fighters in the area, and it showed. His body, honed from many years of training, was very muscular and fit. Although Lionel didn't think of himself as a vain person, he was actually very proud of his body. Of course, looks were only second to his strength, which he used to enforce peace and justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a normal day, or at least it started out that way. Lionel was making his daily patrol of the area to make sure that things were in order. His patrol through the plains went smooth, as did his walk along the lake side. Now, he was making his rounds through the forest. As he walked through, his eyes scanned his surroundings and his ears were alert, but all he could see and hear were the usual sights and sounds. \"Another peaceful day.\" Lionel said as he rounded the bend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he did, he realized he spoke to soon.

He murmurs inside his head once again, \"It took me a while to get this big, but I can't help but feel I haven't reached my goal yet. There's actually someone else who I know very well who I've tried running up against, but at this point...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA larger digimon suddenly lands behind the greymon and the tree, which turned out to be an exveemon! And boy was he big, the muscles all over his body showing off all on their own while he just stood there and greet the dinosaur digimon. \"Hey Grey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...between me and him...it's no contest.\", the orange digimon replies to himself. He then manages to get up to greet his excited friend, \"Hey Exvee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the larger digimon sticks out his meaty arms. \"How 'bout a big hug?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe greymon hesitates, \"No, wait!\" Without warning, the massive digimon wraps his mighty arms around the dinosaur's body, practically smothering him and cracking the bones on his back. \"ACK!\", Grey manages to free himself from the blue dragon's grip. \"Do you always have ta do this!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on bud! It's time to workout!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Alright. but if you crush me to death I won't be able to work out anymore.\" Exveemon grins sheepishly and hold his hands out in apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.. i just got carried away.\" Grey bends forward a little, and his spinal joints pop in several place and he breathes out a small sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get carried away every time, one of these days you are going to break my back.\" Exvee lets out a laugh and thumps Greymon teasingly on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come off it Grey. You're too strong to get done in by a muscle hug.\" Grey grumbles irritably as he rolls his neck, bringing out another ound of popping joints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With you my strength wouldn't matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww come on, I'm sorry Grey i promise I'll be more careful, now are we going to go work out or not?\" Grey sighed in exhasperation and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIne We'll go working out, but if you try anything while i'm doing my reps i'll drop a dumbell on your foot, and i don't mean by accident.\" Grey watched Exvee mull over the thought for a moment and saw a small shudder pass over, before that same old smile returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'll behave myself.\" Exvee began moving away, looking over his shoulder expectantly as Grey began following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExvee and Grey walked towards a two-story building. As they entered, they could smell sweat, adrenaline, and testosterone in the air. Exvee especially loved the smells mixing together. It pumped the blue dragon even more to work his muscles to be bigger. Exvee grabbed Grey's shoulder and pointed to the weight room. \"Come on, bro!\" said Exvee. \"Let's break some sweat!\" As much as he loved working out with his best friend, Grey didn't always share his enthusiasm in working out. Exvee was clearly more passionate in it. Grey thought he would in more into it too if he had the same muscle results like Exvee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey went over to the dumbbell rack and picked up a 200 pound dumbbell in each hand. He then started pumping his arms. He got lost in his several reps as he could feel the blood in his arms warming and the veins in his biceps pumping more blood. Grey smiled to himself as the warmth invigorated him to get going and keep trying harder. He didn't notice what his blue dragon bro was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExvee was also doing dumbbells but each weighed 500 pounds. Each rep made his biceps swell to godly proportions. Exvee grinned and grunted happily to himself to see his muscles in action and to feel the same warmth in his body that Grey was feeling. Exvee felt like he could do this forever, just keep lifting and keep growing to get stronger. Grey turned to notice Exvee in his workout and couldn't help but fell a sense of envy.</span></div></div>",

The orange dino sits himself on a large stump, and then let's out a rather loud sigh. Exvee turns to his sweatin' friend, \"Feelin' the burn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then some.\", Grey replied. \"But, I kinda feel like I'm not getting anywhere now with my growth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExvee sighs himself, \"Ugh, not this again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it.\", Grey speaks up. \"I don't know if it's your digital form, but you've managed to get as big as you are in only a year. Me, it's been twice as long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue winged dragon walks up to his bro, \"Maybe it's because you're always trying too hard, or not trying hard enough. OR, you just can't wait to get better results.\", Exvee replied with a flex of his thick bicep. \"You know how long it took to buff up those arms of yours? As a T-rex digimon, that's really impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I guess...\" The greymon gets up on his feet, \"I'm gonna go for a walk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\", Exvee exclaimed, \"That'd be a great start for you leg workout later on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey took a deep breath in the cool air. However, it wasn't enough to put his frustration and jealousy at ease. He couldn't stay mad at his bro, his best friend. Grey was just mad at the slow progress he was making. Grey rubbed his eyes out of stress. Maybe Exvee was right. Maybe he was trying too hard. Grey's negative thoughts were halted by a striking pain from his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ouch!\" Grey rose his clawed foot to find a round white device on the ground. He turned his head all puzzled and picked it up. Grey knew what it was when he looked at it from his meaty hand. \"A digivice?\" He asked himself, \"What's a digivice doing out here? Surely someone would be looking for it.\" Grey then noticed there was something different about this digivice. It had additional buttons on all sides of the monitor in the middle. It couldn't have been a later model based on the overall shape of the device and even the later models didn't have these kinds of buttons. Grey couldn't figure out what was with this digivice or who could have lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey then noticed a button on the digivice that was the shape a an arm flexing a bicep. He had no idea what it could do but the curiosity overpowered him. Thinking what could possibly happen, he pressed the button with a wide finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey immediately something was wrong, it was if his body had suddenly been lit on fire. \"Aagh!\" Grey dropped the digivice and he  clenched his fists tightly, his body felt like it was being drenched in molten magma and he watched in shock and fascination as his biceps began growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles bulging out, swelling bigger by the moment, pushing out farther than he could possibly do before. Soon he felt a strong burning in his torso as his pecs began swelling out, growing bigger, stronger, tighter. His abdomen grew tighter in definition and actually took on another row of rock hard abs. Grey was suddenly aware that the ground seemed to be growing a bit more distant, but he realized he was infact growing taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon this burning passed to his legs, the muscles growing tight with thick swelling, showing off an amazing amount of definition before the heat drained from his body and he collapsed onto his hands and knees gasping for breath. \"W-What... What happened to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrey stared at the digivice a perplexed look cross his face as the realization of what happened dawned on him. Reaching down he grasped the digivice and stood up and he stared in awe of his new physique. \"Oh man just look at me!\" Grey grinned broadly as he flexed his left bicep and watched it skyrocket in height, a couple veins pushing out of the skin. \"man... Exvee is going to be so jealous.\" And then suddenly Grey had an idea...</span></div></div>",

Within that time, humans and Digimon had learned to live in all but perfect harmony: individual Digimon can now be considered pets or people depending on a variety of different factors; Digimon viewed as people can have jobs, and get married (to humans or other Digimon); Digimon fighting is now classified as an official sport in the same vein as martial arts and wrestling; the list goes on. But most importantly, instances of hostile digimon emerging from the Digital World have been reduced to less than one a week. Furthermore, the hostile Digimon that do emerge are very swiftly dealt with by the ever-vigilant Digimon Tamers; humans that are partnered with Digimon for<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0One such Digimon Tamer was Rika Nonaka and her partner Renamon. Rika was twelve years old when she and Renamon first met, and their relationship at the time was not one that could be called \"friendly;\" they had seen each other as means of becoming stronger and little else. It wasn't until they had met Takato Matuski and Henry Wong and saw how the two boys and their Digimon - Guilmon and Terriermon, respectively - respected and cared for each other that their mutual apathy and disregard for each other began to dwindle; only then did they truly start to grow stronger, both in power and in character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon was lying down on Rika's bed reminiscing about how drastically their relationship had changed in eight years since then; where they had once seen each other as little more than a means to an end, they were now romantically attracted to each and had been dating for the last four years. Renamon was even hoping that one of them would work up the nerve to propose one day. In fact, Renamon had already worked up the nerve to propose, but wasn't sure when the time would be right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon's reminiscing was cut short when Rika came back from a day of shopping with her mother. \"Hey, Renamon,\" she said, glad to finally be home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Hi, Rika,\" Renamon smiled. \"How was your day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Long and tedious,\" Rika said, rolling her eyes. \"I swear, shopping with mom is pure torture; it's boring, mom always insists on getting me clothes that I don't want or even need, and it always feels ten times longer than it actually is. I swear, if those new card packs hadn't just hit the shelves today, I wouldn't have gone with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Renamon giggled a bit. \"Well, if nothing else, you at least got those card packs you wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rika's face softened a bit. \"Yeah, you're right. I made sure to buy at least two of each new pack, and with five new packs released, that's ten packs in total. Each pack contains twenty cards, so that adds up to two hundred cards in total. Most of them are exclusively for the card game and, therefor, would have no effect on a real Digimon, but, since these are special packs designed for Tamers, there's at least one card in each pack that can be used both in the card game and to modify real real Digimon. So let's check out what new cards we got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rika and Renamon opened the card packs and looked through what cards they got. The packs were supposed to contain at least one card for modifying real Digimon, but the ten that Rika bought had three of said cards apiece; she couldn't believe her luck. First she and Renamon looked through the card game exclusive cards. Half of the cards were really useful, while the other half were situational at best. Rika shrugged and decided to sort them accordingly. One card in particular stood out to Rika, mainly because it seemed really odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Healing Junkie'\" Rika read the card's description. \"'Increases the effect of healing items and skills by 50%, but drains HP by 5% for every other turn health is not restored. Affects all Digimon the user has on the field. Lasts 8 turns. Does not stack.' I can't tell if that's really useful, or very situational.\" She looked over at Renamon. \"Either way, that's all of the cards I can't use to modify you.\" She then looked back at the remaining cards. \"Now let's look at all the cards that CAN affect you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The modification cards were designed to be used in battle, but could also be used outside of battle for various reasons. In fact there seemed to be some that were made specifically for use outside of battle. Rika sorted them into piles of cards that were exclusively used for battle, cards that could be used in or out of battle, and cards that designed for use outside of battle. Rika noticed that she had three variations of the same card; they all did the same thing, but to varying levels of effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"'Muscle Enhancement V1,'\" Rika read the first card's description. \"'Increases Attack by 50%, but lowers Agility by 25%. Affects one of the user's Digimon. Lasts 3 turns in battle, or until used again outside of battle. Does not stack.' Looks like this card will make you stronger, Renamon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"So it would seem,\" Renamon nodded. \"You said there were two more variants of that card, so how powerful are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rika picked up the other two cards. \"Well, this one is apparently 'V2.' This one doubles Attack but lowers Agility by 50%. This last one is apparently 'V3.' It quadruples Attack but lowers Agility by 90%. And they all last the same amount of time; 3 turns in battle, or until used again outside of battle. And they don't stack.\" She then placed them back on her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Well, let's see how much stronger they make me,\" Renamon said giddily. \"I'm eager to see just how muscular I can be. Use any variant; I'm fine either way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Alright,\" Rika picked up her Digivice and then one of the cards at random and swiped. The card she had randomly picked up was...</span></div></div>",

Although there was one thing he just couldn't keep his eyes off of, infact two. His arms. Charizards have been known to not have very long (Or thick) arms. Char has been feeling pretty bummed out about this for a while. Suddenly, Charizard overhears the sound of footsteps. They sounded heavy, and turtle-like. It could only mean one thing... \"HEY CHAR!!\" ...His friend Blast, the blastoise. Jumping up from behind Charizard about ready to dog pile on him..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar merely avoids it by getting up and moving out of the way. Blast ends up landing on the ground hard. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast tries to pick himself up, trying to look good, \"Just wanted to see if you'd like to hang out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns his head away while crossing his arms and sighs. \"I'm not in the mood, okay?--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up, up! I'm gonna stop you right there.\", Blast interrupts, standing up on his feet. \"You, don't feel like doing anything anymore. You're always sitting in front of this tree, always keeping to yourself.\" Blast starts using air quotes, \"Always, telling me, 'No, I don't feel like it.', or 'I'm not in the mood for anything.', or 'Get out of here! I'm using the bathroom!' Why can't it be like the good ol' days when we would hang out together? Playing games, going out for swims, experimenting...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wanted to make sure you're paying attention.\", Blast replies pointing at Char. \"But yeah, you just aren't fun as you used to be, to be honest. And all I have to say is...why?\", Blast asks, puckering up his lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stares at Blast's weird face, \"......I...I, just don't know, okay?\" Char holds up his arms again to stare at them, letting out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"?\" Blast walks up to Char, tugging at one of Char's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar pulls his arms away, \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been staring an awful lot at your arms. Why do you keep doing that? Did you get a beedrill or something?\" Blast gasps. \"Did somebody hit you!? Did you fall off a cliff?! Did you see something that scarred you for life?!\" Blast starts shaking Char furiously, \"Why won't you tell me?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLAST! Just stop, alright?! NOTHING, has happened to me! ...\" Char lowers his head with a sad face, \" I just...I just don't think I'm as strong as I want to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Blast holds his arms out, \"What're ya talkin' about? You're one of the strongest pokemon I know! I've seen you lift up a full-grown rhydon once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember that. It's just, I don't look, or feel strong.\", Char explained uneasily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast looked as if he was understanding Char's problem. \"Hmm... Sooo...what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I had muscles, okay?!\", Char exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh.\", Blast replies understandably. \"But, why would you want muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I?! With muscles, I can show off some serious muscle against a machoke, pump some serious iron against a conkeldurr, even become a hot-shot with the ladies.\", Char explains proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stares blankly at Char for a moment. \"Sooo, you want to become a muscular being all of a sudden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar sighs. And then crosses his arms while turning away, \"I knew you wouldn't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast runs up in front of Char, \"No, no, I understand your plea. I'm just curious to what caused you to make such a decision?\"</span></div></div>",

That is until Machoke showed up. You should have seen him. He had a bunch of pokemon all over him admiring his muscles. I can spit fire but do they care? No! Apparently, people care about the muscle you're packing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first off,\" said Blast. \"Don't let Machoke get to you. He's always been a attention hog and a jerk.\" \"But that still doesn't change the fact that everyone like him because of his muscles!\" said Char. \"That's what makes a Machoke.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast did his best to comfort his friend. \"Look man, you don't need to be like Machoke. You're cool just the way you are.\" \"Thanks.\" said Char. \"But I still think having muscles is a good idea. Not just to be better than Machoke.\" Blast took a hand to his friend's back. \"Come on,\" he said, \"Let's get a berry smoothie. That always makes you feel better.\" Char took another deep breath. \"Yeah. That sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char were walking to the smoothie bar until Char saw something shining at a nearby tree. \"What's that?\" he said. \"What's what?\" asked Blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon taking a closer look, Char's eyes open wide. \"Is that...what I think it is?\" Char picks up, what turned out to be a belt that belongs to a machoke. Blast walks up to him to take a closer look at what Char was aweing at. \"No way...\", Char says unable to finish his sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that, a machoke's belt?\", Blast asks pointing at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is! I know for sure!\" Char held up a shaking fist as he says with his teeth gritted together, \"I couldn't keep my eyes off that show-offy machoke that day...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? You gonna start wearin' that now? Speaking of which, what was it doing lying all by itself?\" Blast starts scratching the back of his head, \"Sure have been findin' a lot of weird stuff around here. One time, I found a charm that belongs to a meowth.\" Blast holds it up, \"And I've still got it. Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar puts the belt right on. It didn't fit him at first, but he was able to adjust it. \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What're you doing?\", Blast asks, the charm now on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna take it out for a test drive.\", Char asks with a sly face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had his arms on his hips, \"What? You think something that works for a machoke will work for a charizard? How're you even supposed to operate that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, THIS!\" Char raised his arms in a flexing pose. But, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OOH!\" Char looked at Blast, who looked all surprised. \"Nothing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar holds out his arms to look at them once again, \"Huh.

Maybe I should try something else.\" Char starts tapping the belt with his a claw, \"Maybe there's a button on here somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast turns around, feeling he should give up on Char, \"Why don't you try using 'bulk up'? Maybe that'll work.\", Blast adds sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar shrugs his shoulders, \"Alright. Bulk up!\"</span></div></div>",

Char wore the belt still feeling the same. \"I guess Machoke got those muscles by working out.\" said Blast. \"Wait!\" Char began to feel warmth and soreness in his muscles. They increased until Char couldn't bear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe saw his arms growing thicker. Veins under his orange scales throbbed as biceps and other arm muscles swelled. Char then felt his chest pushing against him as pecs and abs formed. His pecs became this size of Bulbasaurs and his 6-pack abs looked like Diglets. Char could then feel his legs stretching while growing powerful and his wings expanding for more air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the sensation stopped. The warmth cooled and soreness relaxed. Char dropped his jaw by the look of him. He had the body he always dreamed of! Muscles were all over his scales and felt stronger than ever before! He stroked his abs to see if they were real and flexed a bicep to himself to see it was strong as an Onix's rock body. \"Whoa!\" said Char. \"It worked! The belt actually worked!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast couldn't believe Char's new figure. Char grew muscles right before his eyes! Blast had no idea Machoke's belt could do something like that. Could that have been Machoke's source of strength? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" said Char. \"I feel so awesome!\" \"You definitely look awesome!\" said Blast. \"How strong do you think you are now?\" Char just smirked at Blast. \"Only one way to find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlastoises were naturally heavy with their cannon loaded shells. Char grabbed Blast and placed him over his head. Char then started pumping his arms tensing them up and down as Blast went up and down. \"Put me down, put me down!\" yelled Blast. Char finally obeyed Blast after 20 reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm strong enough to lift you!\" exclaimed Char. \"That's so cool!\" \"I don't think so!\" said Blast still feeling embarrassed. \"Well,\" continued Blast, \"Now that you got muscles, what do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Do you really think you can even attempt this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll have to see.\", Char replies back. He then slips his meaty palms under the snorlax's soft and fluffy body.

'Phew' \"That was close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, just forget abou it!\", Blast whispered out. \"If I know a snorlax, they DON'T want to be woken up from their sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar ponders to himself while tapping his chin, \"Hmm...\"</span></div></div>",

His arms went from Bulbasaurs to Gravlers and his chest shaped to diamond-hard pecs and abs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth finally stopped and Char found himself bigger and stronger than ever before. He actually met the hight of the Snorlax. Blast was more surprised than the first time. \"Let's try this again.\" said Char in a deep toned voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar squatted and placed his meaty hands under Snorlax's fat. Char then put a little pressure into his hands. With little effort, Char got Snorlax above the air! In fact, Snorlax felt so light that Char let go of a hand, lifting a heavy Snorlax above the orange dragon's head with one hand! Char was amazed by his feat. He even flexed a veiny bicep to Blast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Snorlax began to mumble as if he was about to wake up. \"Char!\" said Blast,\"Put down Snorlax! He's waking up!\" Char just chuckled. \"Ok, Ok, don't get your shell in a knot!\" As lightly as he could, Char placed the Snorlax down and the Snorlax drifted back to sleep. \"See?\" asked Char. \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast began to feel a little concerned for his dragon friend. He thought the muscle was getting to Char's head. Maybe Blast was getting jealous. Regardless, Char needed to be careful with belt or he would be no better than Machoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" said Char, \"About that smoothie...\" \"Wait a sec, Char.\" said Blast. \"Can I talk to you for a sec?\" \"Sure.\" said Char. \"What about?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blast closed his eyes and took a deep breath not knowing what to expect from the growth. \"Bulk up!\" Blast yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast felt a chill down the base of his shell. Soreness then creeped up his stubby arms and legs. Blast's arms and legs stretched making him look taller and grew thick with muscle. Blast's arms swelled to the size of squritle shells and his pecs and abs pushed against his shell so much there was definition. After what seemed to be a very long time for Blast, the growth stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char were amazed by the results.

Blast runs off towards the water. He jumps up into the air yelling, 'Cannonball!', the few pokemon that were swimming then swam right out of the way. Blast enters the water with a big 'SPLASH!' As for Char, he chuckles at his pal, and then walks off on his own. He notices a few pokemon keeping their eyes locked on the strutting dragon. He mainly just kept to himself for a time, until he came across the ninetales from earlier. He stares right at her, ninetales staring and blushing right back. Char smirks at her, \"Why, hello there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNinetales couldn't help at Char's magnificent body, her cheeks a rosy red and her eyes glowing. Sitting next to her was an azumarill, who had the same rosy cheeks as her, but then elbows the ninetales on her arm. \"I think he's talking to you,\", whispers the azumarill to her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninetales shakes her head out of her funk, \"Oh! Uh...hi.\" Char took notice of her looking at his arms, which were folded behind his back. Char then tenses his arms, making his biceps swell and become real visible from behind. \"You...sure are big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing!\", the azumarill blurts out. \"I'm sorry, but it would have taken you forever to say that.\", she confessed to her friend. \"How did you, get so big?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns his body halfway so they'd get a good view of his back, and then sticks out his right leg and his right arm, flexing them both in unison, \"I've just been starting a new training regiment that's certainly improved my results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say!\", the azumarill cries out with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns back around, still sticking his right arm out as he flexes it in front of his chest, \"And, who do I have the pleasure of talking, and flexing to?\", Char asks with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ninetales was still pretty fixated on Char's physique, but she finally answers. \"My name is Nyne. It's very nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And my name is Azuma.\", the azumarill adds. \"Sorry about my friend. I guess she still can't get over it.\" She whispers even though Nyne is sitting right next to her, \"I think she's falling for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne actually heard that loud and clear, \"Azuma!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar didn't mind if it was true or if Azuma was playing around. He just goes ahead and strikes another pose, doing a downward double-bicep flex, even tensing and bouncing his pecs a bit. \"Ah I don't mind. As long as you ladies are enjoying the view.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, man!\", the two replied happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar takes a look over his shoulder towards the water. \"I wonder how Blast is doing?\", he asks himself.</span></div></div>",

He dove down to meet the underwater pokemon having fun. Golduck, Dewgong, Lapras, and many other water pokemon were beating the heat under the waves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was doing great. Everyone couldn't take their eyes of Blast's muscles. He tensed his muscles to pose the pleasing crowd. However, Blast's muscles tensed more than the turtle intended after see a magnificent pokemon: a dragonair. The dragonair twist and twirled in the water with such grace. Blast was mesmerized by her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had to meet this new dragonair. Except the dragonair was twice his muscular size! Blast wanted to impress the dragonair unlike anyone has ever done before. Then Blast remembered what Char did right before they went into the smoothie bar. Char put the belt in his shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had to use the belt again. But where? The sea was crowded. Blast then saw a cave not too far from him. The cave was dark and scary looking. Nobody seemed to want to go in there. \"Perfect.\" thought Blast. Blast paddled into the cave until no light was visible. He didn't want anybody to see him grow, even if it meant he couldn't see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast took the belt out of his shell and strapped it around the lower part of his shell. \"Bulk Up!\" said Blast in bubbles of air. The cool water began to feel warm. At first, Blast thought it was the water but it was actually him. He could feel his muscles burning with more power than they were already packing. The power began pushing against Blast's arms, legs, and chest. It was intense but Blast soon felt the coolness of the water again. He didn't know how big he got but he figured enough to amaze the new girl of his dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast swam out and dropped his jaw when light struck him. His muscles was twice as big than before! He was about the same size as Char! Already Blast could feel power flowing through his veins like water rushing through rivers. He felt like he could take on a Gyrados! He then swam up the dragonair's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragonair relaxed by floating in the current of the ocean and bathing in the sunlight. All of a sudden, she got cold as the sunlight disappeared. \"Excuse me,\" she said, \"You're in my..my..\" The dragonair fell speechless after seeing a titan Blastoise blocked her sunlight. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" said Blast. \"I didn't mean to spoil your view.\" \"Th..That's okay.\" said the Dragonair. \"I actually prefer this view.\" Blast smiled at her romantically and gave several poses to her. The dragonair's favorite pose was Blast's flexing one arm while bending a leg showing off definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look amazing!\" said the Dragonair. \"Thanks.\" said Blast. \"What's your name?\" \"Dragona.\" Blast could feel his heart drop at the sound of her name. \"Dragona.\" said Blast, \"that's a pretty name.\" Dragona couldn't help but blush. Why shouldn't she? A musclular and handsome Blastoise was flirting with her. What's not to like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stretched his arms and legs thickening them and attracting Dragona. \"That sunlight feels good.\" said Blast. \"Mind if I join ya?\" \"Not at all.\" replied Dragona. Blast then tilted himself back facing the sunlight. Dragona helped herself by wrapping herself in Blast's might chest. They then drifted in the sun.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Back to Char, he was sitting between Nyne and Azuma on the sand. He let Nyne feel his left arm while Azuma was feeling his right. He even tensed them up a few times while they did so. Char was actually keeping his eyes on Nyne. She was feeling his arm muscles, but even looked up to glance at his charming face a few times. \"Heh. Say, would either of you two like to join me in lifting weights over there?\" Char points over to a couple weight equipment sitting on the sand not too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I?\", Nyne asks with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two go on ahead.\" Azuma lies back on the sand with a pair of sunglasses. \"I need to stay and work on my tan some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Let us go.\" Still gripping Char's large arm, Nyne gets lifted up by Char as he stands up as well. They then make their way towards the equipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and Nyne,\", Azuma calls out, \"don't get too carried away with Char's body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Very funny!\", Nyne replies back. \"Don't lie too long on the sun again. Or else you'll get sunburn like last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\", Azuma yells back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon making their way towards the equipment, a few other pokemon were also starting to take notice. They slowly started circling around the equipment to watch the burly mon start to perform some feats. The first thing Char had his eyes on was a barbell. There was already 375 pounds on it, but Char felt it wasn't enough. He then grabs a few weights and starts packing them on to the bar. Once he was finished, there was now 750 pounds on it! Char peeks back at his female friend, who was staring with awe at him, as well as taking notice of the few pokemon that stood beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar bends down with his knees to grip the bar with his meaty hands. He then tenses and thickens them up as he stands back up to his feet. Char turns around so everyone would get a good view of him from the front, and shreds out his arms and chest as he starts to pump up his body with the heavy bar. Nyne's eyes grew wide, staring at the amazing amount of muscle being used and view in front of them as he lifts the thing up and down. Char's biceps really started to swell out as veins had their resting place on top and around them. Char's pecs really filled out as well, practically being felt under Char's chin as he raises the bar up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne was just speechless. Her cheeks still showed red as she was staring right back into Char's lucious eyes and trademark smirk. As for Char, he was already well past his fiftheenth rep. Once he does his twentieth, he stops, dropping the bar to the ground. This was very exhilarating for him. Getting much attention, meeting one of the pretties pokemon, and most of all, having big muscles! Char goes right ahead, flexing his pumped body for the crowd in various poses. The crowd in return applauds his muscular stature.</span></div></div>",

In fact, when Dragona placed her hand on Blast's pec, he made it bounce. She chuckled and enjoyed the giant turtle's company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really nice.\" said Blast. \"I know,\" answered Dragona. \"The sun and water feel so good together.\" Blast turned to his dragon girl. \"I wasn't talking about that.\" Dragona blushed. \"Oh, stop it, you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona then noticed a giant underwater boulder underneath them. She turned to Blast and his gigiantic arms. Could he? \"Blast,\" said Dragona, \"How strong are you?\" To be honest, Blast had no idea how strong he was. All he did was flex with his muscles. He didn't know what he was capable of with them, especially with his recent growth spurt. \"I'm not sure.\" said Blast. \"I haven't strength trained in a while.\" Dragona then pointed to the boulder. \"Could you show me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was worried. He wasn't sure he could lift the boulder. It was bigger than the Snorlax Char lifted earlier. But he couldn't let Dragona now, not when she thinks he was so cool. \"I'll sure give it a try!\" said Blast cracking his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona and Blast swam to the edge of the boulder. Dragona enthusiastically grinned while Blast nervously shook a little. Could he do it? Only one way to find out. Blast stretched out his hands and dug them underneath the boulder. He could tell already this was going to be a tough feat. But he could give up in front of Dragona. Blast then pressured his hands upward. At first, the boulder didn't budge and Blast gave more and more effort every second. As the seconds went by, Dragona could see Blast's arms bulging out and his chest rippling. It was hard to see with the dust and gravel flying from the bottom of the boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast literally had it in his hands, he could feel it. With one more heap of bubbles flying, Blast heaved the boulder over his head! Blast and Dragona were incredibly impressed! Dragona felt like she could faint. \"That's amazing!\" said Dragona. \"I knew you could do it!\" Blast replied with a sexy smile and placed the boulder down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast then had another idea. The feat made his arms feel so pumped and strong that he needed to exert some more strength. \"If you think that was cool,\" said Blast, \"Check this out!\" Blast curled his fingers to a fist and raised them to his face. Despited the water pressure agaist him, Blast struck the boulder with an incredible force. His hand was stuck in the boulder! As he lifted his hand, Blast could see the impression in the boulder, fingers and all. Dragona then heard a slight crack coming from the boulder. It came from Blast's impression and stretched all around the boulder. The boulder split in two and land opposite of each other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast finally ended with a pose of upward biceps and curling legs. Dragona displayed her reaction by jumping into Blast's bumpy arms. \"You are so amazing!\" said Dragona. \"You are like the greatest Blastoise I've ever seen.\" Blast blushed. But he went redder as Dragona pecked him on the cheek.</span></div></div>",

Nyne was sitting next to him, getting a good close-up of Char's immense bicep in action. She could barely contain herself, her cheeks still blushing their rosy red color. Char actually kept his sights on her for the moment, and then says, \"Hey, you can look, but you can also touch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne chuckles, \"Smooth.\" But it works. She went right ahead and felt Char's Shredding arm. His arm was so large, she had to feel around it with both her paws. \"Sure feels nice though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blast, he had just exited out of the water, Dragona still wrapped around Blast's wide chest. \"That was amazing!\", Dragona calls out happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're amazing.\", Blast adds turning his head back to her. Dragona blushes in response. \"I really liked what ya did back there. That was amazing as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona giggles again, \"Heh. Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You normally do that for a living?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah actually.\", Dragona replies. \"I'm actually part of a circus that just happened to stop by town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's a lass like you doin' out here?\", Blast asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, if you could do what you just did with that boulder, then maybe you'd be perfect if you join us. We need a strong man!\", Dragona explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How 'bout two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm just about to head back to meet my friend. He's a big guy like me.\", Blast added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... That'd be great! You two being strong men for our show, it'd be perfect! Especially since pokemon like you aren't normally muscular pokemon. Is your friend a machamp or something?\", Dragona asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. He's a charizard.\", Blast replies happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here he is.\" They were both staring at Char and Nyne. Char was now pumping his other arm with the same dumbbell, Nyne now feeling his other arm in action. Dragona was actually really surprised. A muscular blastoise AND charizard?! That's incredible! In fact she could barely contain herself. \"Come on. I'll introduce you to him. Hey, Char!\", Blast calls out holding out his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Nyne look up at them. Char sets the dumbbell down as he gets up on his feet. \"Hey, Blast! You're ba-... Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stops right in front of Char. \"What?\" Blast now realizes he's able to stare at Char at his eye level. Almost. \"Oh...\"</span></div></div>",

He admitted that she was hot even though she wasn't his type. Char understood why Blast used the belt. He could talk to him about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up?\" asked Char. \"I got some great news!\" replied Blast. \"My new friend here says she works with the circus in town and they're looking for a couple of strong men!\" \"Really?!\" Char couldn't hide his enthusiasm of the news. This would be another great opportunity for his new muscles. Char turned to Nyne. \"What do you think?\" Char asked her while flexing a meaty bicep. \"Think I got what it takes?\" \"Absolutely!\" said Nyne instantly. \"I'm up for it if you are, Blast!\" said Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is great!\" exclaimed Dragona. \"Trust me, you won't regret it!\" \"Oh, I know we won't.\" said Blast. \"We can handle it right, Char?\" Char replied with a double bicep flex and came up with a great idea. \"I just came with a great intro for our routine! You two want to see?\" Knowing Char meant a posing session with Blast, Dragona and Nyne said, \"Yes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona sat next to Nyne on the weight bench Char just used while the muscle duo stood proudly in front of them. Char turned around and flexed his arms again. The pose revealed a rippled back that looked like it could withstand any weight. Blast squated down in a thinking position and emphasized his arms and legs. He looked like a ball of muscle. Dragona and Nyne loved thier show. They loved Char and Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char finished with a bicep flex back to back and the girls cheered. \"That'll bring in the crowd!\" said Nyne. \"My boss is going to love you guys!\" said Dragona. \"Follow me and I'll take you guys to the circus!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona led Blast, Char, and Nyne to a massive tent surrounded by all kinds of pokemon. Char saw an Alakazam doing magic tricks while Blast noticed a Mankey making balloon pokemon for the little ones. The place was crowded but they turned to see the massive Blastoise and Charizard thinking they were part of the show too. \"Right in this tent is my boss.\" said Dragona. \"You two be nice!\" \"We're always nice.\" commented Blast. \"But Char can be a little hot headed sometimes.\" \"Whatever!\" yelled Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all entered the tent, Dragona walked toward an Arcanine in a neat suit. \"Hey boss!\" said Dragona to him. \"Dragona!\" answered the Arcanine, \"How's my favorite acrobat?\"<br>\r\n\"Doing good! And soon, you'll be too!\"<br>\r\n\"What do  you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I found us a couple of strong men for us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss,\" said Dragona pointing to the muscle titans, \"This is Blast and Char!\" The Arcanine dropped his jaw at the sight of Blast and Char. He never saw a muscular Blastoise or Charizard before. Didn't think it was possible! \"Wow!\" exclaimed the boss. \"You defitely look the part!\" \"You know it!\" said Char. He then tensed his chest while flexing an arm downward. \"But can you use them?\" asked the boss. \"Trust me, sir,\" said Nyne. \"They can! Char here lifted 750 pounds like it was nothing!\" The boss's eyes opened with surprise. \"In that case, how about you show me what you two got?\" \"Sure!\" said Blast and Char simultaneously.</span></div></div>",

Nyne, Dragona and her Boss watched in awe of the amazing muscle show, as Char and Blast slowly raise the boulder a few more inches with ease. Their arm and leg muscles rippled with power upon the show, the boulder now being lifted up against their chest. \"Alright, now you take a step back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\", screams his turtle friend, \"Are you crazy!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're gonna be breaking it into pieces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.

The boss continued, \"You look like you would make a great acrobat! Have you done anything like that?\" \"Well,\" said Nyne, \"I did some gymnastics a while back. I know a thing or two but havn't done it in a while.\" \"Not to worry!\" said the boss. \"With Dragona by your side, you'll be one of the best around! That is, if you want to take the job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne thought this was a great opportunity. She's been looking for a job but always came up short. And she always enjoyed her gymnastic days. Being an acrobat and being around her muscle dragon. \"Alright!\" answered Nyne. \"I'll give it a shot!\" The boss clapped his hands enthusiastically. \"This is great! A new acrobat and two new strong men in one day! Okay, our show begins next week so we need to get you three ready by then. Take it easy today but tomorrow is when the real work begins!\" \"Yes sir!\" yelled Blast and Char together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Char and Blast worked out with the circus's workout equipment while Nyne was working with Dragona. Char was doing pull ups on a hanging bar while Blast squatted up and down with a heavy bar on his shoulders. Char chuckled while pulling up. \"I've been doing reps for fifteen minutes and still feel pumped!\" \"I know what you mean!\" replied Blast. \"I don't think we need to worry about staying in shape! But we might as well just in case the girls show up.\" They both laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you think we should do for our act?\" asked Blast. \"I'm not sure.\" said Char as he was setting himself upside down and locking his legs on the bar for sit ups. \"I guess we can literally do whatever we want! But it's gotta be something cool! Something people never thought of before or couldn't do before.\" \"I don't know about you but I wanna really wow the crowd!\" commented Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both went from different workout thinking about what they could do. So far, they came up with nothing. That is until Char said, \"Wait, I think I got something!\" Blast dropped the dumbbells he was lifting and looked towards Char. \"What?\" \"We got some pretty big muscles, right.\" \"Duh!\" \"Well, I was thinking clothes may not fit us as well anymore..\" Blast had no idea where Char was thinking. \"What are you going at?\" Char smiled. \"What if we entered the ring in skin tight clothing and rip em off our bodies by flexing!\" Blast liked the sound of torn clothes ripping of his glorious body for all to see. \"Yeah, that sounds cool!\" he said. \"What else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast worked his arms by doing a handstand then making reps. During his workout, the belt fell out of his shell and Char noticed. \"Be careful, man!\" said Char getting off the weight bar. \"You almost lost the belt!\" Char's eyes then widened and his mouth opened to a grin. \"Sorry.\" said Blast noticing Char's expression. \"What?\" \"Okay, here me out.\" said Char. \"What if we used the belt in the show and grow right before the audience?\" Blast looked at Char skeptically. \"I'd say you lost your mind! We can't!\" \"Why not?\" asked Char. \"The people will think it's part of the show! And if we can grow by saying 'bulk up,' it's safe to assume we can shrink back by saying 'bulk down.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had to admit it. The belt would make things interesting. \"But what if we can't shrink back?\" asked Blast. \"We'll turn into muscle bound freaks!\" Char laughed at Blast's remark and flexed a bicep to him. \"Blast, I think we already past that! Besides people will think we're circus freaks even if we don't use it. Come on, man. Let's at least give it a try!\" Blast wanted to say no but the thought of a bigger Blast hovering over the circus audience made him reconsider. \"Okay,\" he said, \"But we gotta make sure that the belt bulks down.\" \"No problem!\" said Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar grabbed the belt and wrapped it around his waist. \"Bulk down,\" he said. All of a sudden, Char could feel his strength leaving his body. His muscle mountains became muscle hills. Char reverted to the first stage of muscle growth when he first found the belt. \"See?\" said Char. \"We can make this work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulk up!\" Char yelled. The warmth of strength returned and he became the muscle mountain he loved being. \"What do you say?\" he asked Blast. \"Okay,\" said Blast, \"Since we know how the belt works, why not?\" Char responded by giving his turtle friend a big strong muscle hug. It would normally break a Hitmonchan's spine but to Blast, it was just a tight squeeze. \"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" said Char. \"This is going to be a great show!\"</span></div></div>",

They both first take a peek inside, then someone's spiraling shadow leaps above them. \"Whoa! What was that!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turned out to be Nyne, who was curled up and spiraling in midair for a moment. She then gets carried back by a hitmonlee, who was swinging from one of the acrobat swings. Char was really impressed by her technique while in the air. He never even knew how agile she was. \"Wow! Lookit her go!\", Blast cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Monlee must really be training her well.  Just hope she'll be okay...\", Char added worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast slaps Char on the back, \"Not ta worry man! The boss said as long as Monlee's around, she'll be just fine. Plus there's always a net on the bottom, so if she does fall, she won't ger hurt either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar takes a moment to stair at Nyne perform her upcoming act, and then looks at his buddy, \"Alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, how come you don't worry about me this much?\", Blast asks with a frowny face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stares at his sad-eyed friend. \"Shut up.\" Char starts walking off, \"Wanna go check on Dragona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast jumps up, \"Oh yeah!\" Blast then speeds past his friend, running straight into another tent. The one Dragona was residing at. Char just takes his time, pacing towards Blast's direction, and then finally enters into the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar notices his friend, standing in front of him, but he didn't seem to be doing anything. Just, standing there. Char walks up to his shell, giving him a few hollow taps. \"Hey, you okay?\" Char then overhears a splash. \"Hm?\" The burly dragon moves his head out from behind Blast, and then sees Dragona, in all her beauty. \"Whoa.\" Dragona was standing on the water with her tail in a large glass tank. She was spinning around, making the water underneath her start to swirl around her body in two blasts. Char walks up beside Blast, and then starts elbowing him on his side, \"She's a keeper. Huh Blast? Blast?\" Blast looked as if he was lost in a trance, keeping his glaring eyes set on Dragona's upcoming routine as he was starting to drool a bit. \"Ew. But I see what's going on here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona had her eyes closed the entire time, but she then takes a quick peek, noticing Char and Blast standing side-by-side as they kept their eyes on her. She just continues on with her routine, \"Oh. Hi guys. Just gimme a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast says while still in dreamland, \"No... Take your time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy...\" Char crosses his large arms, \"It's gonna take a tire iron to knock him out of his funk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Dragona's routine comes to a close, the water around her falling back into the tank. Dragona then slithers out of the tank, \"So how have you guys been doing? You figure out what you two are gonna do for the show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah!\", Char replies with a flex of his right arm. \"We can't wait to show it! Right Blast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast's eyes were still gleaming, \"Marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I mean, uh, Mary. Mee. Mary Mee, is a character from this old childhood story I used to read.

It was show night, their first show, and they couldn't wait to show the crowd what they can do. Char paced back and forth in front of Blast who was sitting relaxed in his chair. \"You got the belt?\" asked Char nervously. \"Yep.\" answered Blast. \"Are you sure?\" said Char. Blast got up and grabbed the mega dragon's shoulders. \"Yes, I'm sure I got it. I haven't moved it from my shell since you put it there! Don't worry. We're going to be fine. Just stick to the plan and everything will be alright!\" Char took a deep breath. \"You're right,\" he said. \"I'm ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Arcanine boss came in to their room. \"You guys got five minutes!\" said the boss. \"Wait for my signal. When you hear it, break the brick wall we set up.\" Blast and Char gave a thumbs up and the boss left. \"Well,\" said Blast. \"Let's do it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char walked up the a ten foot solid brick wall. They could hear their boss anouncing to the audience. \"Ladies and gentlemen, if you think you've seen everything, think again! This show is still young, my friends! Ladies and Gentlemen, I present you the strongest Blastoise and Charizard you'll ever see! Blast and Char! It was their cue, Blast and Char raised their fists and striked against the barrier before them. The muscle pokemon were blinded by lights and deafened by the cheering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience was happy to see them but a bit confused. Char and Blast were wearing skin tight clothing on them. If they were muscle men, the crowd needed to see some raw muscle on them. \"I think we need to show 'em!\" said Char. Blast and Char began to flex and swell their bodies as much as they could. Slowly, the audience could see flesh peeking out of their clothing. The holes in Blast and Char's clothes got bigger and bigger until there was noting left. Blast and Char erupted themselves out of the clothing! The crowd cheered by this feat and some of the females in the crowd were stunned to see such big and powerful muscles on Blast and Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle duo waved and bowed. \"You ain't see nothin' yet!\" said Char. \"Ready, Blast?\" \"Ready, Char!\" answered Blast. Blast opened his shell and released his twin cannons. He pointed them directly at Char. The crowd had no idea what Blast was planning. Blast released freezing cold wind at Char. Char could take it despite ice being his weakness but he still didn't like the cold. As much as he wanted to leave, Char couldn't. Char's feet were frozen with ice! The ice was creeping up his rippling body! It wasn't long until Blast covered Char in a block of ice leaving but Char's fiery tail unharmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience gasped and whispered in panic. Has Blast lost his mind?! Blast raised his arms to the crowd. He said, \"Laides and gentlemen, don't be alarmed. I assure you my friend is fine.\" Blast turned to the frozen dragon. \"Aren't you, bud?\" Everyone could hear creaking from the ice cube. The creaking got louder as the cracks got wider. Char burst out the block with a roar and a double upward bicep flex! The crowd cheered to see Char was okay. Blast and Char responded by flexing their amazing bodies to the pleasant crowd.</span></div></div>",

Blast?\" Blast shoots the belt out of his shell, landing perfectly onto Char's hand. Char then straps the belt onto his waist. \"Observe. Bulk up!!\" Char immedietaly feels the belt working it's magic all over his already muscular body. Char clenched his teeth, feeling his neck start to widen out and stretch above his chest. Char then turns around, letting the crowd get a good view of his widening back muscles, which also started to show much more definition as more inner muscles started to protrude. Blast watches his pal grow as the crowd starts to gasp with become awestruck. \"Gettin' a good view folks?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheers. In fact they even got a couple whistles and girly screams. \"Come on folks, yell with me.\", Blast chants, \"Grow! Grow! Grow!\" The crowd started chanting along, Char really starting to like the response he was getting. Char started to feel a tingle in his arms. That could only mean one thing, they were the next to grow. Char goes right ahead and flexes his arms up in a back double-bicep pose. His biceps were the first to fill out, then his triceps, and then his forearms, until he had two magnificent arms bulging all over, which he flexes hard in response. \"How's the gun show folks?\", Blast asks the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd just screams with applauds once again. Char was feeling great so far, the growth, the rush of adrenaline, everything! Char then turns around so he was facing the crowd, stretching out his pecs and lats, which were the next in line. Char just tensed up his chest, his pecs starting to throb a bit, and then stretched out even more. As for Char's abs, his rock-hard six-pack was filling out even more, turning into an 8-pack. It could even become a 10-pack if he flexes hard enough, which he did. Blast cheers on for his growing pal, \"Doin' great so far!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done!\", Char yells out proudly, sticking out his left leg and stomping the ground. Char's thighs started their growth, becoming even thicker than they already are, as well as his calves down below. After one last throb from his entire body, Char's growth had come to a close. He was now a foot-and-a-half taller than his blue turtle friend, show applauded him in response. Char went and did a couple poses for the crowd, tensing and flexing as much of his body as he could after his most recent growth. Every inch of his muscled body has become noticeably bigger, as well as his wing span. Char then slips the belt off, handing it to his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar bend down and jumps right up, flapping his massive wings and flies across the large show area, letting the crowd get a closer view of his muscles as he continues flying around. The crowd cheers proudly for the burlier dragon in response. After about a minute of flying, Char lands safely beside his impressed friend. \"That felt amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Blast yells out, then turning towards the crowd, \"But did that LOOK amazing!\" The crowd cheers loudly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar looks at Blast, \"Alright Blast!</span></div></div>",

Blast wrapped the belt around his shell. \"Okay, everyone,\" said Blast, \"Say it with me! One, two, three!\" The crowd, Char, and Blast altogether yelled, \"BULK UP!\" Blast could then feel the change happening inside him. His arms grew to peaking proportions and his chest added another set of abs. He could feel his bones stretching making him taller. Although Blast loved the growth sensation, it was very intense. He spent the whole time with his eyes closed and his teeth clenched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth finally ceased. The crowd was wilder than ever before. Blast opened his eyes to see the new and improved Char face to face. Blast and Char then stood back to back in front of the crowd and flexed a bicep for the loving crowd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char continued flexing every muscle they had. \"What now?\" asked Blast. Char grinned. \"I have an idea, but you're not going to like it.\" \"What do y..whoa HEY!\" To everyone's amazement, Char grabbed his turtle friend and raised him above his head. \"I hate it when you do that!\" said Blast. \"Get me down now!\" Char looked up and smiled. \"Nope!\" Char then squatted down and spread out his wings. Blast knew what Char was thinking now. \"Don't. Even. Think about it!\" Too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar got into the air flying with Blast over his head! The audience didn't have anymore energy to express their amazement. They just sat speechless by this remarkable feat. Char felt great, so great that he felt he could literally do anything. Meanwhile, Blast was terrified as they flew very close to the audience. Blast was never one for heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a minute, Char flew back to the circus ring and placed Blast down. Before Blast could say or do anything, everyone on the bleachers stood up clapping and cheering. Blast and Char waved their meaty arms while Blast said, \"Never. Do that. Again!\" Char just smiled and said, \"Not making any promises!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, the show was finally over. Blast and Char grew down with the belt to their previous size in the dressing room. Char collapsed on the chair next to him. \"Man, that was awesome and tiring!\" he said. \"I know what you mean!\" said Blast. \"But I liked it!\" Blast and Char high fived each other agreeing that they could keep on doing this forever. Then they heard a knock on the door. It was Nyne and Dragona. \"Hey, guys!\" said Nyne. \"We just wanted to come by and tell you were amazing!\" Dragona nodded in agreement. \"Especially when Char flew with Blast over his head! That was so cool!\" Blast blushed in embarrassment.</span></div></div>",

Nyne and Dragona nodded excitedly as if they were shake their heads off their bodies. Char breathed in puffing his chest. \"Bulk up!\" he yelled. Then he felt it again.

It grew bigger and stronger with a vein stretching to his wrist!

Glad you liked it!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe girls walked out of the duo's dressing room. \"So, what do you want to do now, good buddy?\" asked Char. \"I don't know about you, but after a couple of intense shows like that, I just wanna relax!\"</span></div></div>",

Inside, they were greeted by a furret and a blissey, who were surprised by their muscular stature indeed. Char told them they'd like to have the full package. The first was the hot pool spa. Char and Blast were now lying inside of a large hot spa pool, with only half of their body in the water. They were also sweating profusely with a sweat towel on their foreheads, but it was good for them. Blast had his eyes closed, and then opens one eye to look at his pal Char, with his eyes closed and pretty much in the same relaxing position as him. \"Hey, Char? You awake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar had his eyes closed, but was responsive. \"Mm... Talk ta me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's, been something I've been wanting to talk to you about.\", Blast said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar starts wiping the side of his head with his sweat towel. \"Okay. What's it about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's about you and me and the belt. You really like what you're doing with the belt and all that?\", Blast asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure you know the answer to that question.\", Char replies, squeezing his towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean lying to Nyne about what you really look like.\", Blast added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar paused. He stares at the pool for a moment. \"Well, no. But, I don't think it'd be okay to tell her now.\" Char points at Blast with his towel, \"But what about you?! You're lying to Dragona about what you really look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. She knows.\", Blast replies simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!? When was this?\", Char asked profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember when we bulked down and I said I had to use the restroom? And you said I should ease up on the smoothies?\", Blast explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\", Char remembered. \"So, how'd she take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was okay with it. In fact she was proud that I was honest with her.\" Blast went ahead and flexed an arm, \"She still likes to see me big though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stares at his big friend. \"Oh. Well, I don't know. She was kinda mesmerized about me when I first walked up to her. I don't know how she'll react when she finds out when I'm not really big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows.\", Blast adds. \"Maybe she'll like you more for being honest with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns around, laying on the edge of the pool with his arms, \"I don't know... I kinda want wait for the right moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, it's not like you're gonna marry her or anything.\" Blast shrugs his shoulders, \"Maybe not yet. But hey, if you wanna wait, I won't force ya.\"</span></div></div>",

Char started feeling anxious about what to say to Nyne. \"Sorry I brought that up,\" said Blast, \"I know what will cheer you up! A massage!\" Char took a deep breath. \"Yeah, that sounds good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast got out of the tub, wrapped towels around their waists, and walked to the massage rooms. They met a Blissey at the front desk. She too was amazed their size and blushed at the sight of water streaming down their bumpy chests. \"Um, can, can I help you?\" asked the Blissey. \"We would like massages please.\" said Blast. The Blissey was thrilled by the request and was excited to do it for them, but she kept her composure. \"Oh, of course,\" she said, \"Go ahead in back. My assistant and I will be there shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meaty pokemon did as they were told. The Blissey couldn't help but stare at their back muscles as they passed. The Blissey returned to them with her Machamp assistant. \"Are, are you two ready?\" asked the Blissey. Blast and Char looked at each other knowing why Blissey was stuttering. \"You bet!\" said Char. \"Okay,\" she replied. She tried to quickly choose the one she thought would have the most muscle to touch. She pointed to Char. \"I'll go ahead and take you. Maca, could you do the Blastoise, please?\" \"Of course,\" answered the Machamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar lied down on the massage table and Blissey almost instantly placed her hand on his shredded back. She stroked his back up and down feeling the tensity and power Char's muscles held. Char surprised her by flexing his back, showing more definition. Blissey was amazed how much strength Char must have. After a few minutes, Blissey said, \"I finished with you back, but I think you're tense in your arms. I might need to massage those two.\" Char knew what Blissey was trying to do and didn't stop her. \"Whatever you say,\" said Char innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaca pounded her four hands on Blast's shell. It would normally crack a regular Blastoise's shell but Blast was different. Her pounding was very soothing to him. The vibrations from the pounding loosened the tendons and relaxed his muscles. \"This is awesome!\" said Blast. \"Anywhere else you want me to massage?\" asked Maca. Blast turned over face up and said, \"Think you can pound my chest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour, Blast and Char were fully energized and at ease. \"That felt great!\" said Char. \"Thank you!\" \"Th..Thank you.\" said Blissey. \"Please come again.\" As Char and Blast were walking away, they could hear the Blissey and Machamp talking about how big they were and how their muscles felt. They knew they felt good. \"I don't know about you, but I feel great!\" said Blast. \"What do you want to do now?\"</span></div></div>",

Blast pats Char on his shoulder, \"You sound tired. What say we head back and go get some sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar yawns once again, a tear on the side of his eye. \"Yeah. That'd be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until they've reached their destination back at the circus. Thanks to Dragona, they both had their own tent to sleep in now. After the show they brought upon everyone back there, the boss would give them their own home if they wanted. Just to sleep and relax in of course. Anyways, Char and Blast entered back into their tent. Inside were two sleeping bags that were luckily large enough to fit the two of them in their current size. Any bigger and they'd have to just sleep ON the bag instead of IN it. \"You have a good sleep. Kay bud?\", Blast says to Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was almost already half asleep, \"Mm... You too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a matter of few minutes, Char was already fast asleep. Blast on the other hand, was still awake, lying in his sleeping bag with his muscled arms folded behind his head. He was just staring up at the top of the tent they stayed in. \"Huh. Guess I'm not that tired.\" Blast sits up, looking over to his dreaming friend. Blast chuckles, and then decides to get out from the tent. He raises his arms, stretching them, then stretches his body and legs. \"Hmm... Maybe I'll take a look around the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast takes a look around the circus, checking out all the people who participated in the show earlier. He thought about meeting one of them, but then spotted another place. A carnival. Apparently there was a carnival taking place on the other side of the circus. \"A carnival huh?\" Blast shrugs his shoulders, \"Wouldn't hurt to check it out.\" Blast went right ahead. It wasn't that crowded, but it was enough to keep a business going. Blast merely checks out one attraction, which was a game where you throw a dart to pop a bubble and win a prize, but then gets sidetracked by a couple screams. \"Huh!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon around him sure knew who he was. Heck, he was one of the tallest pokemon there! The folks were happy to see him and Char at the show, but never expected him to be hanging out there with them! Blast looked around, getting a lot of looks back. Blast slowly raises a hand, \"Uhhh, hi.\" Blast gets a BUNCH of greetings in return. \"Alright, alright, alright! I'm, just here ta hang out a bit. Maybe, try out a few attractions.\" Blast slowly starts to walk away, dragging himself with one foot, \"So, you, all, have, a good time.\" Blast just walks away, but not without a small group of pokemon following him. He sighs. \"Ah well. What are ya gonna do? Hmm... Maybe I can appease them with one of these attractions.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Blast spotted a test of strength carnival game when a player has to pick up a heavy hammer and slam it to ring the bell several feet above him. Blast shrugged. \"Why not?\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast walked up to the carnival game where he was met by a Dragonite standing beside it. The Dragonite was hosting the game. He took one look at Blast and instantly knew who he was. \"Pleasure to see you this evening, Mr. Blast!\" said the Dragonite. \"Care for a little game?\" \"You know it!\" answered Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast saw the hammer leaning against the stand and picked it up with little hesitation. Normally, an average sized pokemon wouldn't be able to swing it. Blast swung over his shoulder with one hand. The turtle gripped the hammer tightly and focused on the target right in front of him. The crowd gathered around him wanting to see his magnificent feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast took a deep breath and slammed the hammer against the target. The piece of metal flew like a bullet all the way to the top. The bell rung so hard for everyone to hear. The audience screamed in praise for Blast. Blast responded with a simple bicep flex with his hand still holding the hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthougth Blast didn't expect the attention, he grew to like it. He posed for photos and had little kid pokemon hang on to him. It felt good to be appreciated. \"Blast?\" The turtle turned to see his beautiful water dragon girlfriend behind him. \"Dragona!\" he said. \"What are you doing here?\" \"I'm hosting a dunk tank game here.\" said Dragona. \"What about you? I figured you and Char would be asleep after the day you two had.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but I couldn't sleep. Thought I'd come here and check the place out.\"<br>\r\n\"You want to walk around? I have some time before I get started.\"?<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Dragona passed games and staring people as they walked and talked. \"I told Char about you knowing we're not actually big.\" Dragona turned to his face. \"You did? How did he take it?\" Blast shrugged. \"Pretty well, I think. Still isn't sure if he should tell Nyne though.\" \"She's gonna get mad if she finds out before Char tells her.\" said Dragona. \"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, change of subject,\" said Dragona, \"How'd you and Char like your first day as strongmen?\" Blast didn't hesitate answering. \"It was awesome! Doing impossible feats in front of a cheering crowd is very rewarding!\" \"Well, you going to continue on liking it,\" said Dragona. \"We're going to be here for a few more days and head to the next town.\" \"Sounds good!\" said Blast. \"It would be a crime to hide these guns from the world!\" Blast then heaved an arm to flex and Dragona laughed.</span></div></div>",

Come on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona grins, nodding her head in agreement. \"Alright. Let's get going.\" There were a couple pokemon waiting impatiently at the front. That all changed once they caught a glimpse of a large figure taking Goldu's place. Dragona showed Blast the way, and then he sat right where the volunteer normally sits. Luckily the seat was steady enough to hold a big guy such as himself. \"Alright everyone. Sorry for the wait. So, who's next in line?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pokemon standing at the front were staring intently at Blast, who was sitting patiently in his place with his large arms crossed over his chest and with his usual grin set on his face. Blast breaks the silence. \"Well? What're ya waitin' for? Who thinks they can hit the target at just the right spot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was still sitting with a bunch of frozen eyes staring back at him. He was starting to worry he was a little hard on them before.

In a way, he was still rewarding the crowd even when they lost. Blast felt good on top of his pedestal and Dragona was so thankful for his volunteering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a half hour, a large Vinesaur came up from the line. He wasn't intimidated by Blast's bulk. In fact, he was determined to humiliate him by dunking him underwater. The Vinesaur fueled himself with confidence. He felt like there was no way that could lose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can dunk me?\" asked Blast to the Vinesaur while flexing his arms. \"You bet I will!\" replied the Vinesaur. \"Everyone's just distracted by your size! Not me! I'll dunk you and show everyone the woose you really are!\" Blast like his enthusiasm and decided to play along. \"Okay, prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona gave the Vinesaur a few balls for him to throw and the Vinesaur began without hesitation. The first two throws were misses. Blast could see the Vinesaur was getting really frustrated. On his third and final throw, the Vinesaur struck towards the target as hard as he could. The ball hit the target, but it didn't hit it hard enough to dunk the mighty turtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me?!\" exclaimed the Vinesaur. \"I had that shot! That should've counted!\"<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, man,\" said Blast. \"It's just a stupid game.\"<br>\r\n\"Shut up! You cheated! This whole thing is rigged!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona had to do something before this got out of hand. \"Sir,\" she directed the Vinesaur, \"I'm going to have to ask you to calm down.\" The Vinesaur got up to Dragona's face. \"Shut up!\" said the Vinesaur. Dragona was getting impatient with him. She hated sore losers. \"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frustration quickly turned to anger in the Vinesaur. If there one thing that he hating than losing, it was people telling him what to do. He pushed Dragona to the ground. \"I told you to shut up!\" The Vinesaur then kicked Dragona while she was on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was getting angrier than the Vinesaur ever could. No one ever messes with him or his girl. Blast jumped off the platform over the tank and shadowed the Vinesaur. Before the Vinesaur could turn to see him, Blast grabbed by the shirt and lifted him a few feet in the air. His arms thickened and tensed as well as his neck in anger. \"Don't EVER touch her!\" Blast yelled into the Vinesaur's face. \"Got it?!\" The Vinesaur could tell Blast meant business and he wasn't holding his muscles just for show. The Vinesaur nodded his head as fast as he could before Blast did something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast threw the Vinesaur across the stand. \"Get out of here!\" Blast yelled. The Vinesaur did as he was told. Blast then turned to his girl and offered her his  giant hand. \"Are you okay?\" he asked her. \"Yeah,\" Dragona answered getting up. \"I hate people like that!\"<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.

All that was left were platforms, weights, and other heavy objects he could lift. Char figured this would a good place to wake up his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar first noticed the weight he and Blast used in their act. He decided to give it a shot. The last  time he lifted it was when he was bulked up but he wanted to challenge himself. Char squatted to the weight and gripped it tightly. He raised the weight to his chest but it wasn't easy; just the way he wanted it. He could feel his muscles burning and growing stronger under the pressure. The muscle dragon loved this sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar thought it was too dangerous to lift the bar over his head without bulking up so he just did reps up to his chest. He was feeling more energetic and powerful after each rep. In fact, he stared off into space while lifting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stopped and turned to see a little Charmander kid peeking throught the tent. Char dropped the weight and greeted the kid. \"Hey there, little guy. Come on in. I won't bite.\" The Charmander walked towards the mega dragon still holding his shy composure. The Charmander then stuttered trying to get words out. \"Um, I just wanted to say..I saw your show..and..I really liked it.\" Char couldn't help but be flattered by him. The Charmander reminded Char of him when he was a Charmander. He was very shy until he met Blast as a Squirtle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar squatted his hulking frame to the Charmander. \"Thanks a lot,\" said Char. \"That really means a lot coming from you.\"<br>\r\n\"R..Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I really appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar could see the Charmander was still a little scared of him. \"You don't need to be afraid,\" said Char. \"Despite my intimiding appearance, I'm a nice guy, especially towards Charmanders like you!\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said the Charmander. \"Someday, I wish to be big as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat really flattered Char. He never thought of being a role model for somebody so small and innocent. He felt proud of both himself and the Charmander. Char could see someday that the Charmander will reach his goal someday.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The charmander was really proud to meet one of the biggest inspirations he'll ever meet. He's still awfully shy though. \"Well I, guess you'll want me out of your hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense!\", Char interjected, patting the small pokemon on his head. \"You actually got me in a good mood. Why don't you stay awhile? It'd be no trouble at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, okay.\", the small dragon replies with anticipation. \"So, what're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar raises his right arm, flexing his well-peaked bicep for the charmander, \"Workin' out. What else? Gotta stay on top if I want to be the biggest dragon around.\" Char walks up to the large weight he was lifting earlier, bending his thick legs to grip the half-ton piece of metal. Before he lifts it, the charmander runs over to feel the weight in Char's hands. \"Hm? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small reptile looks up at Char, \"Um, this thing is made of metal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was made out of rubber.\", the charmander remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar felt offended, but he couldn't yell at the little tike. \"Who gave you that idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad.\", he answered. \"My dad says everything weight-lifters lift is fake and made out of rubber just to make you guys look good. And that your muscles were just balloons being inflated to make you look buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Char officially felt offended now. But he's still not gonna yell at the little tike. He stand back up straight, \"Oh yeah?\" Char kneels down on one knee in front of the small charmander, flexing his right arm once again in front of the shy pokemon. \"Go ahead. Give that a feel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small charmander was unsure at first, but then he went for it, patting his small hands all over Char's enormous bicep. \"Wow! Your arm feels like metal too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eeyup!\" Char then sticks his arms outward to his left in a outwards side-chest pose, pumping and flexing his muscles hard. \"What you just felt and see in front of you is an all-natural, hard-working dragon pokemon.\" Char then raises his arms up in a double-bicep pose with his fists pointed away, still with his knees bent. \"Every muscle on my body is sculpted to solid perfection, and all I want is to get bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that what the belt is for?\", the small pokemon interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar relaxes his muscles to look down at the small charmander, \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dad says you're really a puny weakling under all that mass, and only use the belt to make yourself look good and hide what you really are inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment hit Char pretty hard on the inside, even though half of it was partly true. Char yammers in his head, his eye twitching, but not enough to get the small pokemon's attention. \"Yo daddy sounds like a messed-up jerk.\" Char then puts his warming expression back on, looking back down at the small charmander pokemon, speaking aloud, \"Listen, you've just felt my arm right? Isn't that proof enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charmander nods his head, \"Uh-huh. I think so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then why don't you tell that to your dad? If he still doesn't believe me, he's more than welcome to head over and meet me and my friend. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", the charmander replies with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stands up straight backing up a bit. He then turns sideways and turns his upper body around so that the small reptile would get a good view of his mountainous back muscles, raising his arms up and flexing them along with the rest of his body. The charmander was just in awe of the large dragon's mass and definition all over his body. \"Just remember kid, THIS, is real.\" Char even kissed a bicep just to show off, and gives a peace-out and bright and proud smile to the little guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walks up to him and pats him on the head once again, \"Now, why don't you head on home? It's getting pretty late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" The charmander starts to walk off, but stops and turns around to face Char. \"It was really nice to meet you. I hope I'll see you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're welcome anytime you want. The same goes for your parents.\", Char assured the little pokemon happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Okay!\", the little tike exclaimed. \"I will!\" The little one was just about out of the tent, but turns back around to face Char. \"Oh, and my dad says that your friend is a real knucklehead, and is really slow because of his large shell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gettin' pretty late kid.\", Char interrupts. The charmander remembers how late it was, and then skimpers off. Char sighs, setting his hands on his hips. \"Cute kid. Really hope he and his parents stop by tomorrow.\" Char then punches a fist against his other palm, wearing a tick-off grin on his face. \"I'd like to set his dad straight.\"</span></div></div>",

Char turns back towards the large weight he was about to lift, \"Now! Back to that weight!\" Char starts by firmly planting his feet on the ground, and then bends his body forward to squeeze his meaty paws underneath to get a good grip. After a few deep breaths, Char flexes his entire upper body to lift said weight of the ground as slowly and firmly as he could. Twas no problem of course, \"There we go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burly dragon immediately starts lifting the weight without a second's thought, bending his legs up and down in slow repititions, lowering his body down to work out his legs, and bringing his body back up to pump the weight on his upper body. Char was really starting to enjoy this even more, letting out a toothy grin on the side of his maw. One of the things helping this dragon perform such feats was the thought of him flexing and posing to one of his littlest fans. What was helping him even more was what the tike brought up, 'My dad says <br>\r\nMy dad says you're really a puny weakling under all that mass, and only use the belt to make yourself look good and hide what you really are inside.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made the large pokemon growl, pumping himself with the half-ton weight even harder. \"I can't wait to show that no-good--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're having fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH!\" Char flinches, letting loose the large weight from his hands. The weight hits the ground, and, crushes Char's right foot. \"GAAAUGHCK!\" Char tries frantically to slip his foot out. He was successful, but his foot looked a little worse for wear. \"Owww...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! \" The person who ran to Char's side was Nyne, who drops to her knees to attend to the injured mon. \"Are you okay!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! I think it's crushed...\", Char bursts out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne felt so bad for the hurt dragon. \"I'm...I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's face showed he was in deep pain, but he still puts on a weak smile for the saddened fox. \"Heh. Ah don't worry. I can't stay mad at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne felt that was pretty touching, but...\"Char, your foot looks pretty bad. It's starting to swell up.\"</span></div></div>",

Nyne had to do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get the first aid kit,\" said Nyne. \"Will you be okay till I get back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar flexed a bicep back to her. \"Of course!\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was doing his best to act cool under the pain for Nyne but it was so hard for him. He then turned to the weight he was lifting. How was he going to prove the skeptical dad now with his foot like this? Judging by the pain and look of his foot, Char may not be able to perform for weeks, maybe months. What was going to happen to the mighty dragon now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne returned carrying a white box with a red cross on it. She opened it grabbing the roll of bandages. \"You're going to be fine,\" she said. The fox then opened up the bandages and began wrapping them around Char's swollen foot. The coolness of the bandages made Char feel more comfortable but didn't make the pain go away. After a few minutes, Nyne was done wrapping Char's foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I think this will do for now,\" said Nyne, \"But I think we need to get you to a doctor to have it properly treated.\" Char couldn't agree more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, let help you up,\" said Nyne. The fox offered her hand to her dragon man and Char accepted it. Char place his good foot solid on the ground while keeping his bad foot up. \"I can walk you to the car,\" said Nyne. Char was a little worried about that plan. \"I don't know. I think I'm a little too big for you to lean on. Go get Blast. He'll help us out.\"<br>\r\nNyne nodded. \"Okay, I'll get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar leaned on the side of the tent waiting for Nyne to come back with Blast. After a few minutes, the fox and turtle appeared. Blast was surprised to see Char's foot. It didn't look good at all. Without hesitiation, Blast offered his arm to his buddy and Char leaned on Blast as they made their way to Nyne's car. As they were walking, Blast said, \"Think you overdid it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" said Char.</span></div></div>",

Or at least not as much pain as he is currently enduring. Blast and Nyne were sitting beside him in a chair, Nyne still feeling very saddened by the whole incident. \"Hey, what's the matter?\" Nyne looks up at the injured dragon, who had a warming grin on his face. \"Is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne took it as if it were a stupid question. \"Char!? I was the one who scared you and made you drop that weight on your foot! How can you understanding of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar looked back at Nyne as if she had just asked a dumb question, but then smiles. \"It was just a fluke okay? It was mainly more my fault for being distracted while working out. I just had something on my mind.\" Nyne took in Char's comforting words, but, they didn't sound comforting enough. \"Nyne, come here.\" Nyne gets up out of her seat to walk up to the muscular mon. She then receives one of the biggest hugs she was ever given. It didn't feel that hard, but it was enough to feel the large reptile's muscles thicken out around her. Char then sits back properly on his bed. \"There. Ya see? It's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne couldn't help but blush at Char's kind gesture. \"Mm... Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast shrugs his shoulders, \"Eh. Seems believible enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not allowed to talk.\", Char uttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Char, is it?\" The three are soon greeted by a rhydon doctor in a white lab coat and carrying a clipboard. \"How're you feeling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still hurts a lot.\", Char replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhydon takes a look at Char's chart. \"Well, do you want the good news or the bad news?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I, guess the bad news first.\", Nyne answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it seems your foot got flattened pretty good. Probably won't get to walk on it for a month at the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them gasp, Nyne replying, \"Oh no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the good news?\", Char continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the last patient I have before I take the week off.\", the rhydon doc replied happily.

That's it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if the crowd wants you to do something with those bigger muscles?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me worry about my part and I'll let you worry about yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast let out another breath out of his rippled chest. \"There's nothing I can say that'll make you change your mind, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! I wanna see the look on that dad's face!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does it matter that much to you?! Who cares what people think of us? In case you've forgotten, we work in a circus! We're always surrounded by people who don't like us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy think's we're weak, bro!\" said Char. \"And I want to see that skeptic smirk off his face by getting bigger than ever before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar sounded like he made his final decision and there was nothing Blast could do. \"Okay,\" said Blast. \"But if you go back to the hospital, don't expect a \"Get Well\" card from me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar scoffed Blast's remark. \"Whatever, just give me the belt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast opened his shell to dig for the belt. He found it and reluctantly gave it to Char. Char grabbed it and quickly strapped it around his scaley waist. Before he could yell the magic words, Blast interrupted, \"Do you think your foot can handle the stress while growing?\" Annoyance began to show in Char's face. \"I don't know, Mom, let's find out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulk Up!\" Char yelled. Once again, the euphoric warmth overwhelmed his muscles and, for some reason, his injured foot. Char could feel his already giant muscles pushing harder against his scales and his foot against the cast it was in. The fueling power became intense pleasure to Char that he gave a loud roar. His bones shifted and stretched to new heights and his injured foot grew out of the cast shattering it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar finally cooled down and looked down to his new body. He noticed a new set ten-pack abs followed by pecs that nearly touched his chin and biceps the size of an Onyx's head! Char was so surprised by the results, he wasn't aware he was standing on two bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was surprised mostly by Char's newly formed and healed foot. \"Char! Your foot, it's healed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Char finally snapped out of his growth trance and realized he was not feeling any pain from his foot. He raised his foot while standing on the other and could see no signs of injury. It was as if it was never broken. Char just chuckled in excitement and pumped his new bieceps in the air. \"I think I'm well enough to play, Blast!\"</span></div></div>",

Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they headed to the show, the two musclemons waited patiently as Dragona was doing her thing. \"Char!?\" Char hears a loud feminine cry out from behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns around while Blast was too fixiated on his love's act. \"Oh! Hey Nyne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here!? I thought you weren't gonna be able to perform!\", she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright Nyne. Turns out that belt does more than gain muscle. It also helps relieve pain.\" Char pats his once-injured foot on the ground a few times, proving himself correct. \"See? No pain.\" Char also does a shredded double-bicep flex for her, \"Feel a million times better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white fox stares at Char for a moment with a happy smile, but then starts to tear up a bit. \"Oh...\", Nyne runs up to give Char a big hug, \"...Char...I'm so happy for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar pats his girl on her head a bit, \"Just, don't apologize again. Okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that was Dragona's underwater tank routine!\", a loud stereo eminated. \"Give her a big hand folks.\" A roar of cheering comes in response to Dragona and her routine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was also applauding with sparkling eyes at his serpent friend. Dragona slithers back behind stage to join her friends. \"Hey Blast. Hey you two. Break a leg out there, okay guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast pulls out a mallet and holds it up above his leg, \"I would do anything for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar quickly grabs the mallet and pushes Blast towards the backstage entrance, \"Alright casanova, you're gonna need that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne and Dragona watched patiently as the two were about ready to be called out on stage, Nyne then turning to Dragona, \"Is, anything serious going on between you two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really.\", Dragona replies blaintly for her admirer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now forlks, the men you have been waiting for, give it up for the MUSCLE DUO!\" Without hesitation, the two performers quickly sprinted out from backstage and ran out in front of the arcanine, each giving the crowd a pleasing flex of their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Char was flexing for the crowd, he actually caught a glimpse of the little charmander yesterday in the large crowd, who was cheering happily for his greatest hero. Sitting next to him was a charizard as well, who was just sitting beside him with his arms folded. He didn't look too pleased to see you guys at all. Then, as if they were looking right at each other, the two squinted their eyes, a lightning bold shooting between the two. \"That must be him, Char uttered in his mind.\"</span></div></div>",

It was time to show the charmander's dad that these muscles weren't just for show! And he knew just how to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walked to a couple of weight bars sitting side by side of each other. He squatted down to pick them up above his head with ease. The crowd applauded but weren't entirely excited. They hoped he would show them more. All of a sudden, the muscle dragon swung one weight across his abs and the other into the air. As the weight flying in the air came tumbling down back to Char, it looked like he was going to get another injury. Luckily, he grabbed it and swung underneath him to throw the other weight in the air. The crowd was amazed that a strongman could juggle such heavy weights. As Char looked into the audience, he saw the charmander's dad still keeping his unimpressed complexion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to kick it up a notch. Blast was cheering the crowd and getting it pumped for Char's feat until his friend yelled to him, \"Hey, Blast! Can you throw some more weights in my direction?\" Blast bugged out his eyes as the crowd clapped loudly encouraging it. \"Umm,\" stuttered Blast, \"Are you sure you can handle that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so!\" said Char still juggling. He turned to the audience. \"Do you guys think so?\" The crowd responded with a loud cheer and chanted, \"More! More! More! More!\" Blast wasn't one to disappoint an enthusiastic crowd. The turtle walked over to the weight area and picked up a couple more extremely heavy weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, Char?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n\"Ready Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast threw the first weight towards Char. Everyone held their breath hoping the muscle dragon would catch it. Right between switching the weights already in his hands, Char grabbed it and began juggling three! The crowd applauded and cheered wildly. Char wasn't sure how long he could do this feat but if it meant keeping the crowd happy, he was willing to do it. Besides, he loved how defined and tensed his arms looked from the workout they were getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was ready to really wow everyone! \"Bring on the fourth one, bro!\" Blast did was he was told and threw the last one in his hand. Grabbing a fourth weight was challenging while keeping up with three other weights. Char got his hand on a fourth one with no problem and juggling four weights that, when combined, could break a typical bodybuilder's back. Good thing Char wasn't typical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the grand finale, Char heaved all weights above his head making it look like they were going to fall on his face. The crowd and Blast gasped hoping the dragon knew what he was doing. With a grin, Char grabbed all four weights with two on each hand! The audience then stood up to cheer for their wonder dragon. Char replied with a double bicep flex and a hard high five from Blast.</span></div></div>",

Blast looks at his stubborn friend, \"Once again, you're a crazy man bro.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar looks at his tuckered friend, \"Heh. You weren't too bad yourself. Nice job impressing the crowd with the belt.\" Blast was actually a tad bigger now than before. Hey, one of them needed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. You should have tested it out on stage. You would have gone crazy with your performance and all that right after.\", Blast remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar just chuckles. \"To be honest, I was thinking of doing just that too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey fellas!\", their boss enters the tent to greet them. \"You guys actually have a visitor. You wouldn't mind would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two waited to see who followed behind, and it was the charmander and his father. The little charmander waves out to his favorite performer, Char smirking in response. \"Yeah, it's fine. I actually the little guy.\" Char looks up at his guardian, who still appeared to have that same unimpressed look on his face as before. Char added into his head, \"And I think I'm going to get to know his father A LOT more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty.\", the arcanine replies. He then makes his way out, \"I'll leave you guys be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast let's out a bright smile to the little tike, \"So, you're the shy fellow who got to meet my friend up close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy the show?\", Char asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", the small pokemon screamed. \"You were amazing Char! And you were cool out there too Blast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast blushes a teeny bit, \"Aw chee, thanks kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar looks back up at the charmander's dad. \"So, you must be his father.\" Char gets up on his feet and walks up to the skeptic pokemon while the little guy continued chatting with Blast. \"Did you enjoy the show yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes a second for the dad to answer. \"It was, worth the entrance fee. I suppose.\", still not sounding at all impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar holds out a hand to him, \"Put'er there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes the normal-sized charizard to respond once again, but at least he responds. He holds out his hand to shake with Char's. \"So, Char is your name? I don't mean to crush my son's spirits, but I think you two are corrupting my son with your fake bo-DIIIES...!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith just a small tightening of Char's grip, it was enough force to crush the father's hand. Char then flexes his hand-shaking arm in front of his ches. \"You think this is fake?\" Char then inches his head closer to the father's. \"I'm not gonna make a scene in front of your son. That's why my counterpart is speaking with him. I just want you to know that what me, my friend, and every other circus performers I counteract with are REAL performers. We've spent months, maybe years even getting to where we are. Me and my pal may be new on the circus scene, but we've been working out for years to get this far.\" The father just stares at Char with a sort of terrified look on his face, when Char suddenly wraps an arm around the father's back, \"And come on man, he's a kid. Don't start ruining things for him.\"</span></div></div>",

He began to think that maybe they were the real deal. Char saw the doubts disappearing and figured a plan that both prove the dad and please the charmander kid. \"How about if we give you guys a mini-show for being such a good audience tonight?\" The charmander's eyes beamed. \"I'd love to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast chuckled at the cute kid. He could see why Char liked him so much. Blast was more than willing to stand back to back against his dragon friend and started flexing playfully in front of the charmander and his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle duo flexed everything they could. From their arms and legs, they peaked every muscle until veins slithered around their muscles showing off their power. The charmander loved every minute of it. The duo really inspired him to want to be as big as they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as the charmander loved the show, Char thought they could do more. He turned and saw Blast put the belt on a nearby chair. \"You want to see some more?\" Char asked. The charmander nodded enthusiastically. The muscle dragon once again got the belt and set it on himself. He then went back to the kid. \"Now, what were the magic words?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bulk up!\" the charmander yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enthusiasm in the kid slowly turned into amazement as he saw Char growing up close. The charmander saw Char's biceps getting larger and rounder, his legs more bulky, and another set of abs below his 8-pack. Char was turning from a hero to an idol in front of the charmander's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was amazed by the results, including Char. He never felt so much power before even from his previous growths. He could've sworn he saw a jealous look on Blast's face. The dragon then curled his arms downward, his legs slightly upwards, and pushed his chest till it touched his chin. His new muscles showed more strength and power than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" said Char.<br>\r\n\"You look awesome!\" exclaimed the charmander. \"You look like you could do anything you want!\" Char blushed making him tense his muscles even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't he look awesome, dad?\" asked the charmander. \"Aren't these guys just amazing?!\"</span></div></div>",

But, I fear our performances are going to be challenged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", Nyne remarks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just recieved word that another group of circus freaks are coming our way.

The emboar shrugged smuggisly and said, \"I'm the guy you don't need to worry about, according to you!\" The emboar then noticed the giant weights from Char's juggling routine. He stomped his way towards it and lifted it with ease. Char and Blast weren't impressed at first, but chills went to their muscles when they saw the emboar bending the weight over his head into a curve and slamming it to the ground. The emboar then flexed a mountainous bicep to the titan dragon and turtle and said, \"But you can call me, Embo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast didn't know what to think about Embo. He was definitely strong for an emboar and had the arrogance to match it. Blast knew from Char that muscles and arrogance don't mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're the new guy?\" asked Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\" said Embo. \"You guys think you're the biggest and strongest guys around? Well, I'm here to prove everyone otherwise!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you going to do that? Arm wrestle us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo sarcastically laughed at Char's mild sense of humor. \"No, I'm actaully going to invite you to my own show tomorrow evening. I got my own show and partner to back me up! I'll be sure to put you guys out of business!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo picked the weight he bent and went back to the muscle duo. \"If you guys think you're the strongest punks around, think again!\" Embo then pulled on each end of the weight until it began to creak and crack. The giant pig tore the weight in two! He chuckled and tossed the pieces to Char and Blast. \"Enjoy the show,\" he said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona and Nyne looked very worried. What if Embo really did make their circus go out of business. Having a strong boar like Embo almost guartanteed a circus' success. Dragona looked at Blast scared. \"Blast, what are we going to do? That guy looks like he really wants us out of here!\" Blast wrapped his muscular arms around his dragon and drew her closer to his chest. He tensed his chest to calm her with his raw strength. \"That's not going to happen, Dragona,\" said Blast. \"I promise. Char and I will make sure of that!\"</span></div></div>",

You don't have to worry.\" In fact, that's the last thing he would want to do. The same goes for Blast towards Dragona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast turns back to the group, \"Don't worry folks. We'll set him straight.\" The two weight-lifters ran off. Embo shouldn't be too far away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole group stares at the two as they speed off, until Goldu disrupts the silence. \"...We're in trouble you know.\" Dragona whips her tail against back of Goldu's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast were speeding in and around the carnival. Searching for whoever resembles a rather large flaming boar. It wasn't long until they heard, \"HEY FOLKS! Care to take a gander at this?\" Char and Blast quickly sped to the direction of the proud yelling. It wasn't long until they came across a rather fair circle of people. And sure enough in the middle of it all was a bold flexing emboar, trying to attract some attention. He raises his immense are up against his head, flexing two mountainous peaks that raveled the crowd. \"Whatcha think o' these folks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the crowd was impressed, but the charmander from earlier felt differently. Instead of feeling amazed, he feels terrified. He had never seen such a large pokemon before. At least one that doesn't sound like a show-offy behemoth. The tike hides behind his dad's wing. \"Dad...he scares me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo glances back at the shivering pokemon, \"Hm?\" He then walks up to the tike's father. \"Hey there little guy. I'm not a bad man. I promise. Mind if I carry him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I rather you didn't.\", his Dad replies bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo suddenly grips the tike by his tail, \"I promise, I won't hurt him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Don't touch me!\", the tike screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Embo let's go of the tike's tail, glancing at Char. Char looked furious at the boar pokemon. It's bad enough he was on their territory, but scaring the little guy was too much for the bulging charizard. \"Don't you DARE touch him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char!\", the tike cried happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh. I wouldn't hurt a kid you know.\", Embo remarks carelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You obviously don't know how to act towards kids. Just look at them!\" Embo takes a look around, noticing the few kids who were hiding behind their parental guardians, but that doesn't change his careless expression. Char then walks up to the towering pokemon. \"You best leave. NOW.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo then closes his head against Char's, \"Make me.\"</span></div></div>",

This giant pig was full of himself that would go so far as to hurt little kids to get attention. Embo went too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast agreed that Embo needed to be taught a thing or two and knew just how to do it. The titan turtle reached deep into his shell and grabbed the belt. \"Hey Char,\" yelled Blast, \"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast threw the belt into the air and Char grabbed it with a single hand still locking his eyes on Embo. Char knew exactly what to do to put that oversized pig in his place. The orange dragon strapped the belt around his already large waist. \"You wanna know how to get the crowd's attention, Embo?\" asked Char. \"You need to control yourself! Like my bro and I do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar then turned to the crowd. \"Everybody, you want to see more? What do I need to do?\" Everybody in the crowd was thrilled and excited about what Char was implying. They all yelled, \"BULK UP!\" Once again, Char felt an overflow of power coming soaking into his scales, muscles, and bones. His chest grew more rigged and packed with power, his arms pushed his scales to become the size of boulders, and the bones in his wings and legs grew to great proportions for height and wingspan (with the following muscle power flowing into them). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo was struck with amazement and fear. He was always the biggest guy around until a few seconds ago and everybody was cheering for Char out of love instead of fear. He didn't understand. The hulking pig looked back at the little charmander whose eyes brightened at the sight of his muscle dragon hero. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar returned to Embo. \"If you want to be a true muscle man, do it right!\" Char went back to the crowd to begin a friendly posing session. The crowd, especially the charmander, loved how Char's muscles swelled and tensed as he squeezed them between his limbs. The crowd loved all of Char's powerful poses. They couldn't explain it but despite Char's giant body, they felt assured that he would never hurt them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a double bicep pose, the charmander ran up to his hero. Char was so happy to see him that he reached out his vascular arms to hug him. The little lizard felt safe and energized in Char's arms as if the muscle dragon was giving some of his strength to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo had seen enough. He felt more steamed than ever before. The crowd didn't even notice his leaving into his personal tent. The muscle pig swore under his breath that this feud with the muscle duo was far from over. He would do whatever it took to shut them and the circus down for good. Embo sealed his by tossing random weights against the walls of his tent in anger.</span></div></div>",

It seems he had just formed an evil plan at getting back at the duo, but mainly at Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Char and Blast were doing their usual workout session, pumping and lifting weights to prepare themselves for their next show. Which was in a couple of minutes. Char lets loose a heavy dumbbell he was pumping his arms with, and then goes right ahead to lift his arms and flex with himself, watching his peaking biceps throb in the air right in front of him. Char smirks, \"Heh.\", and then turns to his ally, pounding his plump with a fist. \"You ready Blast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had just finished one last rep with a 500-pound barbell above his head, dropping it to the ground behind him as well. He then tenses his muscled legs, getting a close view of his tree-trunk thighs and calves after the workout he had just put them through, and then sticks a foot out to take a step forward and stomping the ground hard and proud. Blast raises his right arm out to flex for his friend, \"You know I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\", cried the proud dragon, \"Then go grab the belt. We're almost on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be right there!\", Blast replies, attending to a dresser drawer that was a few feet away from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Blast was doing that, Char turns to admire himself in a full-length mirror. He smirks at himself, tensing up certain muscle groups to see them flex out and show how he was doing. He's just getting stronger and stronger each day, he KNOWS it! He was about to ever start another quick posing session, turning his muscular body sideways and sticking his arms out, until he notices his friend had been shuffling through the drawer for quite some time now, tossing out things that weren't the belt. Char turns his head to Blast, \"Hey, you finding it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", Blast cries. He then sticks his snout away from the drawer to scratch his head, \"I don't understand. This is where I last left it!\" Blast turns to Char, \"You think one of the guys took it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the guys? Please.\" Char raises his left arm, flexing out his densely-peaked bicep for show, \"I'm pretty sure my warning was clear enough if any of them were to take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast takes out the whole drawer, pouring out anything else that was left in there. But still, no belt. \"This isn't good. We're almost on! Hm?\" Blast takes notice of what looks like a note on the ground. Blast picks it up, and was immediately stunned. \"Char! You gotta look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar runs up to his pal's side, taking notice of the note as well, which had Embo's name on it. \"!! Quick! Read it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast reads: 'Dear Muscle Duo, If you're looking for your belt, don't bother wasting your breath. I have it now. -Embo'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast tenses up his thickly-muscled arm, crumpling the note in his hand. \"Embo... I should've known.\", Blast growled. Blast turns to his chum, who also appears to be really angered at Embo's note, only his entire body was flexing out profoundly. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching Char's muscle pump out, it was as if he was using the belt right now! But just this once. He certainly seems more frustrated than Blast, that's for sure. \"Why that no-good, little... First he makes my little chum cry, and now THIS!?\" Char holds up a meaty arm, \"When I find him, I'll tear him a new one for sure!\"</span></div></div>",

Blast tried calming his friend down. \"Char,\" Blast started, \"I'm mad at Embo too and he will get what he deserves. But we need to calm down or else we'll be no better than he is.\" Char knew Blast was right. The beffy dragon sucked in a wind of air to cool the fire in his gut. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Blast asked Char, \"Feel better?\"<br>\r\nChar nodded, \"Yeah, still want to kick his teeth in though.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's try avoiding that when we get the belt back.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, but what about the show? We can't just leave the audience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar made a point. The crowd would be very disappointed if they didn't see the Muscle Duo. Blast had to think for a minute about what to do. \"Let me talk to the boss,\" he said. \"I'll see if I can work something out with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast left Char to talk to the boss.

The boss said he would try to stall the crowd as long as he could until Blast and Char got the belt back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast returned to his fire fueled friend and gave him a thumbs up. Char knew exactly what the turtle meant: it was time for some payback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char stomped out of their circus and into the carnival. They scoped the crowds walking, running, and playing games. The duo couldn't find Embo anywhere and the crowds greeting and praising the them didn't make the search any better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar put on a fake smile and a light pose for the fans until he saw smoke moving up into the air and across the ground. Char stretched out his neck and found Embo walking around the carnival as if he was the king of the world. Blast noticed him too and was ready to get the belt back.</span></div></div>",

It wasn't long until the crowd dimmed down and was dealt with, and the two bodybuilders raced off to catch up with Embo. As soon as they ran clear of the crowd, Char couldn't help but yell out, \"HEY, Embo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ran into an alley, but then came to a sudden stop.

He's not so tough without his belt, is he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar could only take so much, stepping up in front of the stubborn boar, who was actually still towering Char by half a foot. \"I may not be as big as you right now, but I'm not afraid to take you on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo looms over the angered dragon, \"Oh? You think you're so tough now? Alright.

You feel you're not ready?\", Embo looms once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, FINE! Let's go!\", Char yells.

Char glared at the feraligator and stomped to his direction anxious to punch his lights out. Luckily, Blast grabbed him by the shoulder to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are the big shots from the other circus,\" said Embo. \"Somehow, they're more popular than us. I don't how compare to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast held Char's shoulder tighter. \"Is there a reason you're here, Feral?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral just chuckled. \"I was just looking for my good buddy so we can warm up our REAL muscles for our REAL show. But if Embo's challenged you I just might not have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was getting annoyed with Feral's arrogance and obnoxiousness. Char, on the other hand, let anger grow larger. \"No offense,\" said Feral, \"But your fired up friend here doesn't stand a chance. You don't stand a chance against the both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast let the arrogance fuel his anger as well. His muscles slightly swelled and tensed under adrenaline. \"How about we find out?\" implied Blast. \"Feral, I challenge you to this competition. You will compete with Embo while I with Char. Whoever wins gets the belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral heard a lot about the belt from Embo and how it could help with their show.

They were practically ready to beat them up, aside from being smaller than they are, but there would just be no point. Char and Blast looked around, taking notice of the tent they were secluded in. Off to one part of the tent were multiple pieces of weight-lifting equipment lying around. Char and Blast looked at each other, and then back at the equipment. The two studs walk up to the equipment, taking notice of how much larger the equipment is. Char's eyes grew a bit wide. \"...Are these for real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That barbell sure is big.\", Blast gulped, still holding his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stares at the equipment, contemplating on whether or not he should even lift such a thing, let alone participate in such a petty competition. \"!!\" He then remembers about his biggest little fan, and Nyne. He couldn't give up on them. Not NOW! Besides, Embo and Feral don't deserve the belt anyway! Char gritted his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\", Blast turns to his friend. Suddenly, Char balls up a fist, making a vein stretch up to his elbow. Blast jumps as Char goes and plants his fingers underneath a massive pyramid-shaped weight. \"Char! Don't strain your self!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar blinks, \"!!\" He relizes that if he were to do such a dumbfounded thing, he would probably make matters worse for him still. Char stands back up. \"You're right. We should start off small.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", Blast nodded. Blast glances over to a rather large dumbbell rack, ranging in dumbbells that appear almost twice as big as the one at their tent. The hardened turtle walks over to the rack, his dragon pal joining him as he did. \"Just how much do these guys workout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lot more than us. That's for sure.\" Blast turns his head to Char, then watching as Char grips one of the dumbbells, taking it off of the rack. That unfortunately seemed like a chore. The weight alone was almost as heavy as the barbell Blast was benching earlier. It sure seems like a lot for the burly dragon, but he had best workout as much as he can before their show, slowly pumping his arm with the lead weight. After a few reps, Char turns to his astounded friend. \"Well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was really skeptical, but he didn't want to Char to go in alone. He even lets out a small grin, thinking about Char's stubbornness. \"Alright. I gotcher back.\", the turtle remarks. He then grabs the same weight Char was honing, almost loosing his grip with it, but then manages to find the strength to lift it like Char. Even after the heavy lifting, it seemed like it was all they could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" The two turned back, taking notice of the boar that was standing behind them.</span></div></div>",

Before the competition began, the muscle duos flexed playfully as a tolken of their appreciation. They then turned a set of gigantic weights of various sizes. The goal was to lift the heaviest weight they can carry and whoever lifts the heaviest wins. Embo knew they could beat Blast and Char. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout Blast and Char's knowledge, Embo switched labels of the weights to make the heavier weights seem lighter. Just to be on the safe side, he even super glued the heaviest weights. Embo thought there was no way he and Feral could lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, bro?\" asked Blast to Char. The dragon was pumped with anger towards Embo and passion for his fans. This was his moment to shine. Embo insisted Char to go first and Char didn't hesitate in accepting the offer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar wanted the belt here and now.

Embo just smiled thinking he already won this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar squatted and curled his claws around the bar. The weight felt stiff to the touch like it couldn't budge no matter how hard he tried. But Char didn't care. He had to prove himself to everyone that he was the strongest dragon around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar steadied his feet and began to pull up on the weight beneath him. The super glue almost met his match. Char's arms, chest, legs, even wings swelled under exerted pressure. Char kept pulling until veins pumped out everywhere on his body. Char could've sworn he heard a snort of contempt from Embo. This made flames spill out of Char's lips and into his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of his strength, Char broke the super bond of the weight and lifted the weight high above his head! The cheer of the audience grew louder and louder as Char exhaled more fire from his mouth and Blast patted a hand on his buddy's back. \"That was awesome!\" yelled Blast.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Embo was starting to get furious with Char now. He wasn't going to let the likes of him show him up. For the next half hour, it appeared to be a real show between the two firey bodybuilders. Blast and Feral competed as well, but things appeared more tame between them two. One of Blast's performances was of him and Feral juggling 50-pound weights. Feral was the first up, juggling up to five dumbbells and made it seem like nothing. When it was Blast's turn, Embo pushes him close to Feral while he was still juggling the weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeral notices Blast, and then starts tossing the weights to him. Blast never really juggled before, so this whole thing was a major surprise for him. Feral tosses the first weight, which Blast managed to catch, as well as the second, and then the third. Blast just went for it, juggling the three as best he could, and he was gettin' the hang of it! Blast just keeps his cool, juggling as slowly as he can, until the last two dumbbells get thrown up above him. This made the turtles eyes grow wide. How the heck was he going to catch two at the same time?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was about to run out to help him, but was stopped by Embo, who grabbed his ankle and made him trip to the ground. Miraculously though, Blast managed to toss the three weights he currently had in his hands high enough for him to grab the other two in his hands and started juggling them with the others. Blast was sweatin' like crazy, but he still kept his cool. After a few minutes of juggling, the crowd cheered for the muscular turtle as he caught and set the dumbbells down one-by-one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar ran up to his buddy to congradulate him, and check if he was okay. Even Feral was proud of Blast and his feat. As for Embo though, his patience to ruin them was growing weary and intense. For their next performance after that, it basically involves all four of them flexing off as if they were in a bodybuilding championship, just to see who does best. For Char, this was like his specialty. He sure wouldn't want to disappoint a crowd of this calibre. For the next ten minutes after, it was nothing but flexing hard and showing off what they've got. Char was just off flexing for the crowd for himself, until he feels a sudden boar bump into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns to Embo, who glares back at Char and Char does the same. It seemed like a tough competition between them two once again. As for Blast and Feral though, they seemed to be going at it between each other as well, only they were starting to be more friendly about it. As they were nearing the end of their routines, Char and Embo were sweating and panting like crazy as they still stared each other down. Suddenly, a huge roar of applause started raining upon the four. Though they weren't sure who they were applauding for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling persistant as ever, Embo steps up in front of the three while the spotlight followed. To his surprise, the applauding had actually died down. Seems like Embo wasn't the one who caught the crowds eye after all. Char quickly sprints up in front of Embo, the spotlight now shining on him. That was when the crowd cheered happy for him. Char could hardly believe it himself, but he was really happy. Looks like Char's passion was got the crowd's attention. His muscles too, but that was a helping hand in Char's win as well. Before he flexed some mroe to the crowd, he turns to his friend, wanting the pumped turtle to join him. So Blast did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis in turn makes the crowd cheer even more, as they started flexing their already tired muscles to no end as part of their appreciation. Feral stood beside his jealous friend, feeling proud for the two. Embo on the other hand, grew more furious than ever...</span></div></div>",

Embo's muscles were bulging and throbbing like mad all over his body while accompanied by some angry veins. Suddenly, Feral walks up to his steaming friend, whose flames were flaring out more than usual. The muscled gator pats Embo on his hardened back, \"That'll do pig. That'll do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo turns to his partner, \"Shut up!\" The large boar turns back to the two crowd-pleasers, who were still flexing off proudly and waving a bit to the crowd a few times. A couple minutes later, the four were standing back in Embo's backstage tent. Embo had his large crossed over his meaty chest while staring away and pouted. \"Hmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Embo.\", Char demands calmly, the stubborn boar looking at Char and Blast. \"Give us back our belt. We pleased the crowd the most, fair and square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrrrm...\", Embo grumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo walks over to one of their large weights, lifting it up so he could pull something underneath. It of course turned out to be the belt. Embo then walks back up to Char. The two just stared at each other for the moment, looking all serious and what-not. The two suddenly turn their heads towards their partners, who were shaking each other's hand. \"I see you've got a very competitive partner as well.\", Blast mentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyup!\", Feral replies happily. \"Say, we should do this again sometime. You're welcome to bring Char along if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Definitely considering it!\", Blast replies proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo and Char grumbled as they hunch their shoulders. \"Water types... !!\" The two look back at each other, and then turned their heads away while pouting with their eyes closed, \"Hmph.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here's your belt.\", Embo holds out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar swipes the belt away, \"Uh, yeah. Thanks.\" Char pulls his pal away, taking a final look back at the one who had been giving them trouble. Blast on the other hand waves back says goodbye. A couple minutes later, Char and Blast were finally back in their tents, lounging back on their makeshift beds. \"Ugggh...!\", Char moans. \"I see you were getting chummy with one of our rivals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah he's not that bad.\", Blast remarks. \"I'm sure with a little time, you can get to know Embo a bit more yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar rolls his eyes, \"Psh! Yeah, right.\" Char holds up the belt he finally got back. Even though it's only been a few hours, it stills seems like he hasn't gotten to use it in a while.</span></div></div>",

But Char was still bitter towards Embo and Feral for stealing the belt in the first place. Blast could see Char's lips sucked in out of anger and contempt. He tried slapping the dragon's back to get the harsh feelings out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up, man!\" said Blast. \"We got the belt back and we probably won't see those guys again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We better not!\" exclaimed Char. Blast brought up closer to his rippled frame and hugged him on his side. \"Relax, ok? Let's just get to our tent, get some sleep, and be ready for tomorrow. Besides, I think Nyne will be happy see you happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's bitterness melted at the sound of Nyne's name. The muscle dragon took a deep breath and began to calm himself. \"Much better,\" said Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Blast and Char yawned and stumbled out of their tent to see the whole circus staff standing outside. The muscle duo saw Dragona and Nyne standing at the back of the crowd and walked towards them. <br>\r\n\"What's going on, Dragona?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n\"The boss has an announcement for us,\" she answered. \"He going to announce where we're going to go next to perform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's ears perked at the news. His muscles thickened and tensed out of excitement and Nyne couldn't help but stroke his arm to share her excitement. The arcanine boss walked out of his tent and came to the front of the crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen of this great family,\" he said, \"Let me begin by saying I'm so proud of our performances these past few days! We did a great show here and made new family members along the way.\" The arcanine found Blast and Char in the back of the crowd and pointed to them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast and Char, thank you all so much for all your help and being a part of this great family! We really appreciate you all as if you are our brothers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char blushed out of flattery and modesty. \"Back to business,\" continued the arcanine, \"We will be going to great city of Poketropolis, the biggest city in the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole crowd cheered excitedly. Poketropolis was literally a town of a million opportunities and if the circus did great there, they could go anywhere!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Char and Blast were one of many who were pumped for their trip to Poketropolis. For part of the day, the two bodybuilders spent it picking up and packing tents and stuff while they loaded it all into a train to carry all of their cargo. It wasn't long until everyone was ready and rarin' ta go! Nyne and Dragona were really excited themselves, sitting together while they waited patiently for everyone else to get seated. It wasn't long until everyone was seated, except for Char and Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out, the train was already under schedule. Char and Blast were outside, standing beside the infernape conductor. It turns out one of the train's wheels weren't working properly, as told by the ingernape. It seems they'll have to change one of the bolts in the train's wheels in order for them to proceed as scheduled. \"I can call someone out here, but it's probably gonna take an hour or so to change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast looked at each other, but then both started to think amongst themselves. They sure didn't want to wait an hour for someone to fix the train. In fact, they felt they've waited long enough. Char is the first to call out. \"Hey! Maro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a marowak pops from out of the train. \"Yeah? You call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know anything about trains?\", Char questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, sure I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Come on Blast.\", Char replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burly turtle scratches his head, \"So, how does this thing work?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait!\", the infernape cried. \"What in the world are you two planning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're gonna fix the wheel.\", Blast replies happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe infernape was still realy skeptical about all this. \"Look, I know you two are considered 'strongmen' here, but I don't think--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've obviously not seen one of their shows.\", the marowak interrupted. \"Just stand back and watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next couple minutes or so, Maro explained to the two burly pokemon about what they had to do in order to get the train's wheel fixed. One of the things they had to do was lift the train itself. Char and Blast looked at each other, and then shrugged their shoulders. Blast got the belt from out of his shell to give to Char, but Char wanted Blast to give the belt a try this time. Blast nodded in agreement. Blast manages to slip the belt on, and then called out the magic words. In seconds, Blast's body starts to tense up all over, until he was starting to grow from all over. Blast just flexed his arms downward the whole time until he was now at least a foot taller than he normally is. The infernape was just in awe of what the two were actually capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaro then instructs the two for the next ten minutes. Afterwards, Blast raises the train one last time so Char could install the wheel. And they were done. After the pumped turtle sets the train down, he wipes off some of the sweat on his forehead. Blast then looks up at one of the windows and spotted Dragona staring at him with shining eyes. The burly turtle smirks, and then turns his body around and kneel on one knee to do a back double-bicep pose just for her. They couldn't hear it, but they could see Dragona was squealing happily for her favorite man, which only made the other pokemon inside cover their ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar, Blast and Maro stared at the squealing pokemon for the moment. Char then turns to Blast, \"She's a loud squealer you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Forgot.\", Blast replied.</span></div></div>",

Dragona was still enchanted by Blast's magnificent feat and clutched onto his arm still warm with power. Nyne was also proud of her man that Char allowed her to nap on his rippled chest as if he was a firm yet warm power that flowed into her fur. Blast and Char were happy they could help and with the reward they were given by the girlfriends. Everything was smooth sailing for Poketropolis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group dozed to sleep the rest of the trip. They all woke up by the screeching of the train slowing down to a stop. As they looked through the window, Blast and Char saw an incredibly fancy platform with various people boarding and leaving trains. For appreciation, Blast and Char carried their women against their pecs onto the platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter stretching out from the ride, they all helped carry the circus materials through the train station and walked across the streets to their destination for circus performance. Everybody of the circus staff was amazed by the crowded streets loaded with cars and tall skyscrapers cramped with people. They all stopped at the city arena. Blast and Char was stunned how big the place was. It looked like they could show three shows at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blast, Char!\" The muscle duo turned to the boss. \"What's up, boss?\" asked Char. \"We need to advertise for the circus a little bit and let the people know we're here. Think you guys can get some folks?\" Blast and Char just smiled and flexed arms to the arcanine. \"You bet we can!\" Dragona spoke from behind them, \"Hey boss, can Nyne and I help them out too? We can hand out flyers.\" The boss knew what the girls really wanted and decided to let them have some fun. \"Sure,\" he answered. \"You guys head on out and we'll set up for show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast, Char, Dragona, and Nyne walked around the streets finding out where to get customers. They all noticed a crowded park on their right. Char knew instantly that was a great place to get people. He instantly threw his shirt off his back and walked right in. The other three followed him and people began to stare at the charizard's amazing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Char figured he got enough people staring at him, he began flexing all the muscles on his arms, legs, and chest. Blast didn't want Char to hog all the glory. He took off his shirt as well and joined his friend in the session. Everyone was amazed how two pokemon could be so big and build so much muscle on their bodies. As they were watching, Dragona and Nyne tossed flyers to the audience and the audience accepted them while mesmerized by the show. As they flexed their arms upwards, Blast and Char gave each a thumbs up as a sign of mission accomplished.</span></div></div>",

But it was Poketropolis, the biggest city in the world! Surely there was something that interested them. But Wigg carried a smirk at the corner of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first stop was a ancient looking building with several hundred steps leading to the front door and columns on both sides. People walked up and down the stairs with books at hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the Poketropolis City Library,\" said Wigg, \"One of the oldest buildings in the city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Blast loved books, the way Wigg described the building was dull and monotone. Char, on the other hand, always fell asleep reading books. Book makers might as well drug the book pages with chloroform. After what seemed forever for the duo, Wigg started walking and they followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group walked for about fifteen minutes until they reached the sunny beach. Blast and Char's eyes opened to the sparkling ocean and the blazing sand with the several sized people on the beach. Wigg noticed he got the muscle duo's attention now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the city's beach,\" said Wigg. \"Lots of pokemon love to come here to get some sunshine...and girls.\" Wigg saw Char's ears perk at the sound of girls. \"Moving on,\" said Wigg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg made Blast and Char walk another several minutes and stopped at another giant building with a dome on top of it. \"Welcome to city hall,\" exclaimed Wigg. He lost the dragon and turtle again. One of the things the duo hated the most was politics. They stood there patiently as Wigg explained the importance of city hall and what politicians were doing in there. Wigg could tell Blast and Char hardly cared about what he was talking. Just like he planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg then guided the muscle bunch to a building on the side of a retailing street. He opened the door for Blast and Char and squeezed into the tiny doorway. As they entered, Blast and Char found a room full of different sized cameras, props, backgrounds, and dressing rooms full of different modelling clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And last but certainly not least,\" said Wigg, \"This is my modelling studio.\" Blast and Char were really impressed by her set up, Char especially. \"If you guys want to model, come by here and you'll get plenty attention than what you're already getting! Who know's? Maybe you'll even invite some girls to the beach?\" Blast and Char felt really excited about this.

Would be nice to meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg raises an arm to look at the time on his watch. \"He's actually gonna be here in a couple minutes. For now, why don't I get you two started?\"</span></div></div>",

Right here and now!\" Blast shared his friend's enthusiasm in a lower proportion but still excited to show off his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" said Wigg. \"You guys go on ahead in the dressing room. Clothes are already in there. I'll get my cameras ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast did as they were told and got into adjacent dressing rooms. Inside there was a mirror and a single bench with a skimpy speedo lying on it. Blast found a blue speedo in his room and Char a red one. Blast picked up his with his thumb and index. \"Does he really expect us to fit into these things?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar felt a little nervous himself but was willing to give his speedo a try. Once he got it on his waist and looked at the mirror, he felt amazing. Char could see all his muscles bulging and tensing at the slightest movement. He said to Blast from his room, \"Don't be a wimp, man! Give em a try!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast looked at his blue speedo nervously. It looked like it wouldn't fit him and split while posing. But he agreed he would be there for Char. Might as well trust him. Blast's speedo felt tight against his shell but he liked them the same reasons Char liked his speedo. Blast flexed playfully thinking he didn't look half bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char got out their rooms and complimented each other on their speedos when Wigg yelled to them he was ready. Wigg liked seeing the muscle giants literally showing off what they were made of. He felt so lucky that he found them. \"Alright!\" Wigg started. \"Let there be light!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char's first poses were just them standing showing off their rippling chests with their powerful arms on their waists. The duo then started flexing arms upward and downward. They felt everytime they moved a flast a light followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was having a blast. He was pushing every muscle on his limbs until veins were visible. He wanted to make sure the camera caught the power that was erupting from his body. Blast was enjoying it as well. He stretched out his chest to reveal more power from his pecs and abs. He played a little by stroking his hand across it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes. The cameras stopped leaving spots in Blast and Char's vision. \"That was awesome guys!\" exclaimed Wigg. \"I never had such great shots before! I need to find muscle guys more often!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" said Char. \"It was fun. Right, Blast?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I admit I was a little nervous in this blue thing but I think I can get use to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg still had excitement running through him. \"I'm so glad! This is going to be so great! Trust me, you won't regret this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" said Char. \"We never doubted you for a second.\" Blast tilted his head to the side and rolled his eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Char and Blast were still feeling pumped after their recent session. It always feels great to just flex and show off for the camera. Suddenly, having the supersonice ears Wigg had, he overhears someone walk in. But he immediately knew who it was. \"Ah! That must be him now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\", Blast asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember I mentioned I had one guy as a current modeler?\", Wigg reminded them. Wigg holds out a hand, and in seconds, a burly dragon pokemon steps in. Char and Blast's eyes widened a bit at the pokemon. \"Char, Blast, meet Drago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago, is well-muscled dragonite, wearing blue jeans and a white and blue-patterned, buttoned, shirt. He was actually taller than the two, and carrying more mass. \"Hey Wigg.\" The muscular dragon raises his brute titan arms to fold them over his barrel chest. The two smaller-muscled pokemon couldn't keep their eyes off how tight his shirt was under all that rippling mass! \"So, who're these guys?\" Drago raises an eyebrow at them while still keeping a small grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're our newest modelers.\", Wigg answers proudly. \"How 'bout you guys introduce yourselfs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was the first to walk up to the burly reptile, showing his hand. \"Hi, uh, the name's Blast.\" Drago stares down at Blast's palm, still with his eyebrow raised but his grin faded. \"Uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon it suddenly reappears again as the muscular titan holds out his large arms, \"Hey, don't be afraid!\" Drago wraps his thick arms around the buff turtle. Blast could almost FEEL the power eminating from such a magnificent beast, of a pokemon that is. Drago pats Blast on his shell, but it almost felt like he could chip it, \"So, a muscular turtle huh? Haven't seen any o' those before. Name's Drago. Nice ta meet ya.\" Drago pushes them away. A small part of Blast practically felt like he was lucky to be alive. The beefy dragon then looks up at Char. \"And who might you be?\", he asks with anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar blinks his eyes. \"Oh! Uh...\", before he knew it, Drago was already standing in front of him. \"Uh...\", Drago was about to hold out his arms, \"...I'd, rather not do the hugging thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago blinks his eyes. \"Oh. Okay!\", he replies proudly. He then holds out a hand to Char. \"Put'er there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stares at Drago's bright face, and then down at his meaty palm and arm. It takes him a bit to finally accept his handshake, holding out his hand as well. As soon as their hands locked though, as soon as Drago's fingers interlocked, Char's eyes grew wide. Wider than before. He couldn't believe what he was feeling. Drago's grip was really hard, and firm! In fact, if Drago was a bad guy, he would be able to take Char down in a heartbeat. Suddenly, Char feels Drago start to put some pressure in their shake, and it felt nearly like a compressor squeezing his hand down. Char slips his hand away from Drago's grip, \"Gah!\" Seems like to Char, that was a close one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago on the other hand was unsure of what he did. \"Hm? What?\" Drago raises his hand-shaking arm a bit, \"I didn't shake THAT hard. Hm?\" Drago looks down at his shirt sleeve, realizing that it had just torn apart. Char was just flabbergasted, his expression of shock while his mouth agape. Drago scratches his chin while staring at his enormous and sleeve-torn arm, \"Hm. Maybe I did.\" He sighs, \"Drats. I lose more shirts that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago was about to take his shirt off, but Wigg steps in in front of him waving his arms, \"Whataminute big guy!\" The titan of a dragonite looks down on the small wigglytuff. \"Not so fast. I think I just got an idea for your next shoot. Why not rip the shirt off this time? We can even record it on camera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", Drago ponders to himself.</span></div></div>",

In fact the ruined shirt emphasized his bare scaly chest. Drago let out a daggery grin and said, \"Sure, why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg was happy to hear that. He was getting all the photos he could only dream of. \"Great!\" Wigg exclaimed. \"Just stand in front of the camera and we'll get started!\" Wigg then turned to Blast and Char. \"Would you guys like to see how my regular clients work with my photos?\" Char and Blast were really impressed with the dragonite's physique. With Drago's chest and arms revealing, they really wanted to see how well Drago would do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras started flashing the moment Drago stood in the background. He started by raising an arm to flex a bicep while clenching on his torn sleeve with his free claw. He then clenched the remains on his shirt and tensed his abs and pecs. He even added a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnthusiasm added more and more after each camera flash. Drago gripped his shirt tighter around his chest and tore straight off his body to show off ten pack abs and pillow sized pecs. Wigg flashed his cameras crazily as Drago performed such a feat. Blast and Char literally gasp out of amazement to see a dragon have such a ripped body than their own. Drago looked like he used the belt several times to get those muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago even flexed his legs covered with long legged pants. The pants didn't rip as his legs quickly filled them up but the threads of the pants were thinning revealing bare leg scales. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg stopped the cameras feeling happier than he ever felt in his career. He felt like he got such great photos from great models, especially with his regular dragonite that he could always count on if his other photos didn't give Wigg what he want. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was awesome!\" said Wigg running to Drago. \"You never let me down!\" Drago shrugged a boulder of a shoulder. \"I do my best for the best!\" Wigg laughed out of flattery. Blast and Char, Char especially, grew envious and tad jealous of Drago. They knew the dragonite got great photos from a body anyone could wish for. Blast felt like they could never reach Drago's level with the belt no matter how much he and Char used it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char did their best to hide their personal feelings towards Drago. Drago was a nice guy overall. The dragonite came to them and said, \"You guys stick with me and I'll show you how to be the best models you can be!\"</span></div></div>",

Blast and Char were also getting a lot of feedback from Drago the whole time about certain places, which were starting to make the two a little uncomfortable. But not as uncomfortable as the fact that Drago was completely shirtless the entire time. Drago was getting attention from all around. So much for being the new strongmen in town...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin due time, the group had finally reached their destination. \"Oh, this is it?\", Drago asks. \"That wasn't much of a long walk. Maybe I'll get to see you two more often.\" Char and Blast started to grumble at each other. \"Hey, you two okay? You've been doing that a lot since we left the modeling place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast took notice of the circus tent. Looks like it was almost up and running. They both then turned around towards the two, Char being the first to say, \"Well, it's been nice seein' ya to, but we gotta get going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep!\", Blast continues, putting on a fake smile. \"Thanks for showin' us around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys gotta tell me when your next show is! I'd sure like to see it.\", Drago adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast looked at each other, then remembering that they had the belt as an advantage, for now.</span></div></div>",

Their muscles looked like pebbles shoved into their bodies compared to Drago. They figured it was time to take their training more seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar rushed into their personal tents and dragged out all of the weights and other exercise equipment he could find. \"Char,\" started Blast, \"What the heck are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going to show that dragonite what we're made of!\" said Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you think that lifting several weights in one day is going to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we gotta start somewhere! Do you want that guy to upstage us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he will unless we prove him what we can do! What if the boss decides he wants Drago and ditches us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he would do that. Don't you think you're overexaggerating a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just looking out for ourselves! What if Dragona sees Drago and likes him? He was a dragonair once too you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast's heart sank at the image of Dragona in the arms of Drago. What if that really happened? She was the best thing that happened since Blast and Char found the belt in the first place. Blast couldn't let that happen. \"Okay,\" said Blast. \"Let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscle duo began pumping every limb vigorously. Most of the weights felt light due to their current strength but they didn't care; all they cared about was working till they dropped. Blast and Char didn't notice but their muscles slowly grew larger between each rep of every workout they could think of. They certainly felt stronger and satisfied in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arcanine boss noticed how hard the duo was working and proud to see what he thought were a couple of guys taking their first show in town very seriously. To him, they looked like they were going to be ready for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was the first to collapse from exhaustion. He lied on his back against the floor huffing for air. Blast was still going fueled by the image of Dragona and Drago together. Char lifted his arm to feel the bicep of his other arm. His tiredness turned to excitement as he noticed how much harder it felt than before. Char tilted his head noticed that not just his arm but his whole body looked bigger! And Blast had the same results! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar had no idea how this happened. No one could pump so much muscle in so little time...unless they had a machoke belt. Char grinned, jumped back up, and went back to his workout more motivated than before.</span></div></div>",

It was almost unbelievable to him, but his muscles tensed and flexed harder than they did before! The motivated dragon looks up at Blast, who was pumping an arm with a large 350-pound dumbbell. He sure was happy to see his buddy really focused in this as much as he was. \"Hm?\" Char took a closer look at Blast's rippling arm, and was amazed. He could have sworn he saw the muscled turtle's arm tense up just a tad more with each rep. \"Amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Char overhears two different sets of footprints enter their tent. \"Hey Char. Hey Blast.\", Nyne calls out to the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast look back at the two of them. They could see they were pretty tuckered out themselves from setting up. \"Hey, you girls okay?\", Blast asks, taking a small break from his reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little tired from setting up.\", Dragona shrugged, still holding that cute smile Blast loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you two have been up and at it again.\", Nyne adds. \"You two do seem a little more motivated than before. Run into a certain someone on your travels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast's eyes grew wide. Was it really that obvious to her? Then again, she could just be asking a retorical question. The two bodybuilders were still able to keep their cool, Char letting out an easy sigh. \"Nah. Just thought we pump up some more for you two.\", Char replies with a big grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two chuckle softly at them. Blast sets down the dumbbell, and then walks up to Dragona, who was looking back at him a little puzzled. \"Dragona...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a short moment for her to reply. \"...Uh, yeah Blast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stares at her for a moment, his lip starting to shrivel a bit. Char and Nyne were just as puzzled and confused as Dragona was. Blast then wraps his strong muscular arms around Dragona with care, and then says...\"Mm... We...will be together...forever...right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden...it was as if the mood just got awkward. Char facepalms himself while Nyne and Dragona felt really awkward themselves. Char pulls Blast away. \"Alright Casanova, let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just asking!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns back to them, restraining Blast in his arms, \"Why don't, you two get some rest. We've had a rough time ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast still couldn't stop worrying about his relationship with Dragona. Would she really leave him for a guy like Drago. He felt so scared and nervous. He also felt a little mad towards Char for bringing it up. To make matters worse, he knew he just made things awkward between him and Dragona. Blast slapped his palms to his face in embarrassment and worry. What was he going to do?</span></div></div>",

Blast was still tossing and turning in his sleep from his \"episode.\" Although Blast was acting obnoxious, Char really cared for his buddy. He didn't want his turtle bro to feel insignificant next to Drago. Char wanted to do something to get Blast's confidence back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast walked out of the tent an hour later and scoped the circus looking for Char. The first spot he looked was their performance tent. Luckily enough, Char was there pumping his abs with several hundred sit ups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" said Char. \"I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to get up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast rubbed the back of his head gropingly. \"Sorry, I had trouble sleeping last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd figured as much. You were tossing and turning when I got up. If you're still worried about Drago, why don't you just use the belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar made a strong point. With the belt, Blast could grow ten times stronger than the dragonite but what would that accomplish? This was more than just the amount of phyical strength they had. \"No, this isn't about muscles,\" said Blast. \"This is about proving my personal self to him and myself. I got my muscles the easy way while Drago had to earn them. I just don't want to depend on the belt too much. I think that's a sign of weakness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast made another solid point. Everything that happened to the both of them was practically given to them. Who knows what Drago had to do to get into modelling? As much as Char loved his muscles and what they gave him, he knew Blast was right. This was about proving the real Char and Blast under their strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" said Char still contemplating, \"So what are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll worry about Drago when I see him,\" responded Blast. \"As for Dragona, I'll try talking to her again when I see her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me. You ready for another hard workout without the help of the belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast felt encouraged and empowered and this time it wasn't from his strength. \"You bet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar went back to his sit ups while Blast began lifting dumbbells. They still didn't notice the definition in their muscles growing greater. Char's abs slowly became more sculpted and was forming another set of abs. Blast's arms grew slowly to giant proportions biceps and tripceps pushing so hard against his skin veins bulged to feed his muscles blood and power. They both took a glimpse but didn't take much notice. They just thought they were just getting pumped from their workout.</span></div></div>",

Without noticing, their tent swings open. A tall and burly pokemon started to make his way into the tent and up to the two weight-lifters. \"Dang. You guys sure don't fuss around with your workouts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the two musclemons freeze up. Char glances to his turtle pal. \"Did you, hear that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can already see it.\", Blast replies, pointing into a full-length mirror and seeing Drago's reflection. Blast sets the weights he had down, and then takes a deep breathe. He turns around, trying to keep his composure, \"Drago! What the heck are you doing here?\", Blast asks sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\", Char remarks, picking himself off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Wigg just got me all hyped up about you guys being in the circus, so I just thought I stop by and see what you two were up to. If, that's okay.\", Drago explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it's okay.\", Char stepped in. \"But, maybe next time you could have given us a little future notice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago starts rubbing the back of his head, \"Oh. Sorry. Yeah, I guess I should have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast started to tap his fingers against each other, \"Um, just out of curiousity, you didn't happen to pass by a tall dragonair on your way here, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Just this arcanine, who I assume is your boss?\", Drago asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your assumption is correct.\", Char replies. He then glances back at his worried friend, and then looks back at the ripped dragonite. \"Uh, look, we're, kinda busy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago raises his hands in assurance, \"Oh okay. I understand. I'll probably give you guys another notice once we meet up with Wigg later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right.\", Blast remembers. \"Uh, yeah.

Char could tell Blast wasn't fond of the idea based on his clunching hands. They turned around to speak privately. \"I REALLY don't know about this, Char,\" said Blast.<br>\r\n\"Look, I know that. But Drago's trying be nice and this could be a really great opportunity to get to know him better. Who knows? Maybe you'll learn to like him.\"<br>\r\nBlast took a deep breath. \"Okay, fine. But if he tries to steal my thunder, he's going down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast returned to Wigg and Drago and agreed with the photo session. There was really no reason for them to change. The muscle trio had their bare chests already showing so all they needed to do was pose with some heavy epuipment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast started by lifting a giant bar of steel above his head as if it wasn't anything. The workout swelled and empowered his arms to massive peaks. To finish his pose, he curled his lips to a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar meanwhile raised dumbbells up to his chest and flexed his chest as hard as he could. His chest literally rippled and grew emphasizing the real beast sleeping inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char felt confident of their poses as Wigg flashed his camera against their muscles. The duo could see the flashes reflect against their raw power. Their jaws dropped when they turned to Drago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago was also lifting a bar but his muscles grew more tense and thick as he pushed more pressure on the bar. Squeaks were emerging from the bar as Drago starts bending it! Wiggs's camera goes crazy towards the dragonite as if he was a fountain of power. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char (especially Blast) were losing their patience and grew more confused about Drago. He was a nice guy but he was upstaging the both of them. But they continued the session as if everything was normal. </span></div></div>",

You never cease to amaze me.\" Wigg turns to his other two recruits, \"You guys were amazing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\", Drago cheers. \"Can't wait to do this again.\" Char and Blast didn't even smile, which gave the two a puzzled look. The dragon and the turtle look down at the bent barbell, not even speaking a word. Drago stares at it as well. \"Oh! Don't worry, I can always straighten it out.\" The pumped dragonite walks up to the barbell, about to pick it up, \"Allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", Blast suddenly screams. Char and Drago looked at Blast with wide eyes. \"Um, I mean, let me take care of this.\", the buff turtle replies with a weak smile. Looks like he wanted to do this very badly. Blast walks up to it, and then slowly picks it up in his hands. He grunts, pumping and tensing his arms as hard as he could to straighten the bar back into place. Even with Blast's added-on strength and mass, it still didn't prove as effective, only straightening the bar just a little, until he could take no more. \"Gah!\" The barbell drops to the ground, still bent quite profusely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was left sweating and panting quite heavily, but Drago pats his back to cheer him up. \"Hey, maybe next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blast slaps Drago's hand away. \"Me and you, into the shark tank!\", Blast pointed to a large fish tank that would normally be used for Dragona's waterdancing performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago raises an eyesbrow, \"Huh?\" He then looks back at the jealous turtle, \"Uh...why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast walks up to two triangular weights, and then picks them up with rage and tosses them into the fishtank. He then glares back at the curious dragonite, \"I've had it with you! Always upstaging us! I'm gonna show you what I'm capable of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Upstaging...?\", Drago utters worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walks up to Blast, reaching a hand to him, \"Dude, don't do this.\", Blast just replies by slapping Char's hands away as well. Blast climbs up a ladder and then jumps right in to the water. He swims to the bottom, and then picks up both weights with both his arms. \"Dude, you're gonna sprain yourself!\", Char cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast didn't really care. It seems he had just about had enough with Drago, and wanted to do something Drago might now be capable of. He goes right ahead and starts lifting the weights, two-at-time. The three could certainly see this wasn't gonna be so easy for the raging turtle. Even if he is capable of lifting such great weights, he appears to be doing it too fast. Char, Drago and Wigg could already see the straining in Blast's eyes. He just went through one weight-lifting session, why go through another?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast's arms were really shredding out, but it doesn't look like he can take anymore of what he was lifting. \"Gah!\", Blast gurgles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast!\", Char cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worn out turtle falls to the ground, about to pass out. Suddenly, Blast hears a splash. It turned out to be Drago, who wasted no time in rescuing the poor thing. Blast sees Drago come to his rescue for only a second, and then passes out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy?\" It sounded very vague, but Blast was able to hear it. \"Buddy, are you okay?\" Blast starts to crack his eyes open, seeing Char, Drago, and Wigg look back at him. \"Oh. Thank goodness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-? What happened?\", Blast asks, trying to recollect his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You overdid it bud.\", Char replies blantly. \"You were out for a few minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily I was able to give you CPR.\", Drago added happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\", Blast screams \"Why would you give me CPR!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well because, uh... Oh. That's right.\", Drago remembered.</span></div></div>",

Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago took out his hand to Blast waiting for a response. Blast took one last breath and said, \"Yeah, let's start over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg figured to call it a day after such excitement. Drago suggested going to a resteraunt for lunch as a peace offering. Char and Blast agreed. This could be a good opportunity to know Drago better. When they arrived at the resteraunt and took their seats, Blast began to feel a little better, especially with his chair creaking under his heavy weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast finally got to be friendly with Drago and they were right about his being nice. The buff dragonite even got Blast and Char laughing at some jokes. Then they got to talk about working out and how they got to where they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you guys get started in the circus?\" asked Drago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char were worried about telling him about the belt at first but they decided to tell them. Surely he would have found out eventually. So they told him about their desire grow big and how they found Machoke's belt. Blast was worried about telling Drago because he wasn't sure how he would respond to their taking the easy way. But Drago took it really well. He  actually thought that was pretty cool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\" asked Char. \"Did you get started because you got bullied?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago chuckled. \"No, nothing like that. I actually got started by uncle. I...I lost my parents in a mugging gone bad and my uncle took me in. He took bodybuilding very seriously and got me into it to build my confidence and take care of myself in rough situations so something like that won't happen again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast couldn't help but admire Drago and his story. \"Your uncle sounds like a really awesome guy,\" said Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is!\" said Drago. \"I owe him everything that's happened in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for sharing that with us, Drago\" said Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for listening. And thanks for giving me a chance to be buddies with you guys.\"</span></div></div>",

Blast turns around, raising his arms upwards to flex along with his wide and shredded back. The crowd of pokemon started to clap and cheer excitedly.

They placed all the heavy weights to their spot and felt ready as they as ever. Blast and Char dragged a piece of solid brick wall and covered the entrance to the audience. All they had to do was wait for their cue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey heard their arcanine boss on the other side of the wall. The moment the ringmaster yelled their names, Blast and Char curled their hands to fists and shattered the wall in front of them, suprising the audience immensely. The crowd was astonished how big they were. Most of them didn't believe a charizard or a blastoise could grow so muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar decided to amaze the crowd early so he grabbed several weight bars and began to juggle them like in the previous act. Blast meanwhile grabbed the belt and strapped it around his waist. As he looked at the curious faces of the crowd about what he was doing, Blast saw both Drago and Wigg sitting in the show. Even though Blast reconciled with Drago, Blast was ready to show him what he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast asked the audience to count to three and yell \"Bulk Up\" with him according to their show. The moment those magic words rang in his ears, Blast felt the familiar power of the belt flowing to his waist and to the rest of his body. His muscles erupted into new peaks and shapes while his bones made him strectch to new heights. Blast flexed his arms upwards while puffing his chest as he grew. Drago and the rest of the audience gazed in awe how Blast flexing thickened rapidly. Blast knew the audience enjoyed the growth as much as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Blast was done and perfomed a final pose of holding his arms downwards by his wrists and opening his cannons to show off. Char stood by Blast's side pointing as the audience cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, Blast looked directly at Drago and walked over to the weights Char was just juggling. He picked one up above his head with one hand easily. He then placed his second hand on it and began pulling down on the weight. Blast was pleased to see creaks and wrinks on the bar as he bended it to a perfect curve. He then raised the bent bar over his head for the wild crowd to see. Even Drago was happy Blast could do it. With Drago's approval from afar, Blast finally let his ego be at peace and do the rest of the show joyfully.</span></div></div>",

After about an hour, a giant frame entered their tent. \"Hey guys!\" said Drago waving his thick arm in the air. \"You did great tonight! I can't believe how big you got with that belt, Blast! That was so cool!\" Blast couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in hearing those words come out of Drago's mouth. Not that Blast showed him he was better but that he was just as good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Blast. \"Thanks for coming to see it. We love having fans!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm a fan, alright!\" replied Drago. \"Umm...if it's not too much trouble, could I try the belt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast couldn't find the harm. Drago was their friend like they were to each other. Char threw it to him with a grin. Drago clipped the belt onto his waist. \"Okay, what now?\" Blast chuckled. \"You don't remember?\" he asked. \"You say 'Bulk Up'!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe belt activated. Drago felt a warm feeling coming from the belt into his waist and then towards the rest of his body. He thought it felt great but overwhelming at the same time. The warmth grew hotter and hotter and wanted to get out of his scales. The sensation failed to leave as Drago's muscles thickened and grew to greater peaks than he ever thought he could achieve. Drago could feel his arms growing strong as a steelyx, his chest as machamp, and his legs as a hitmonlee. He was amazed as Char and Blast appear to be getting smaller as he grew taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like forever, Drago was done growing as was astonished by the results. \"Oh my gosh!\" the hyper muscled dragonite exclaimed. \"Look at me! I'm huge! I never thought I could get this big!\" Blast and Char could tell Drago was really enjoying his new look but their necks were getting sore but looking up at him. \"Consider this as an apology gift from me,\" said Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago grinned down flexing his mighty arms. \"Apology accepted!\"</span></div></div>",

It was a little tough to move around, but he got used to it pretty quick, clenching his fingers to see what he was dealing with. He raises his left arm up, watching his immense bicep peak up and flex, with a good vein ta boot! \"Dang. This is incredible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast watched their new pal enjoy himself a bit, but then they looked at each other. Why should Drago have all the fun? Char walks up to the thick dragonite, and then pulls the belt off of him. \"Alright, you're not the only one who's gonna have this much fun.\" Char slips on the belt around his waist, and then says the magic words. \"Bulk up!\" The charizard feels his body tense right up, gritting his teeth as well. Char's body began to bulk up right in front of Drago, his back starting to rise up along with his arms, pecs, and legs. In no time, Char was nearly as big as his bulky friend. Char's body comes to a rest, and then he takes a stomp forward to Drago, showing off his meaty pecs and thick arms. \"Check me out now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Blast, he slips the belt off of Char and then puts it on himself. \"Now it's my turn.\", the blastoise remarks proudly. \"Bulk up!\" The turtle's body began to thicken out from all aroud. He holds out his arms, giving his pals a good view of the growing biceps, triceps, and all that good stuff that showed off from all around. Blast's pecs and abs were also showin' their stuff, which were protruding out more and more. As for his thick tree-trunk legs, they just pumped out more and more. Char and Drago were really excited for their turtle buddy, who was now standing just as tall as Char. Blast stomps a foot in front of them just like Char did, flexing out his thick peaks and large pecs, \"How do guys like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago snorts, turning his upper body around to flex up his left arm and tenses up his large legs. Char and Blast glance and smirk at each other, and joined in on the fun. For the next couple minutes, it was just a straight-on posedown between three muscular freaks! They all just looked at each other with proud grins, showing off what they got. Suddenly, what sounded like a little furball, was bouncing its way into the tent. The furball turned out to be Wigg. \"Heya guys. I just thought I stop by--AIEEE!!\" Wigg leaps back once at the sight of it. He almost couldn't believe his eyes. \"Drago? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago puts on the smile he always had. \"Well, yeah. Why wouldn't it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg kept his distance, staring at the three muscular behemoths. \"Oh. ...... Almost didn't recognize you there for a moment.\"</span></div></div>",

Wigg could literally see the power flowing through Blast, Char, and Drago's veins. He had to take advantage of this moment.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You guys look absolutely amazing!\" Wigg exclaimed, \"And powerful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago chuckled rippling his pecs and abs. \"Thanks boss! You should thank Blast and Char. They helped me out!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blast and Char could say anything to Wigg, the little pink puffball jumped with euphoria and a grand idea. \"Guys, I HAVE to take photos of you guys like this! With your muscles and my pictures, we'll be famous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast, Char, and Drago thought it would be great to pose with these amazing muscles but they seemed to be too big to pose in the circus. Char raised his arm to look at his relaxed yet sturdy bicep. They still had to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for it!\" said Char.<br>\r\n\"Count me in!\" said Blast. <br>\r\n\"You know I gotta be part of this!\" said Drago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg jumped up more happy than ever. \"Fantastic! And I know just the place for us to try!\" The trio looked at the wigglytuff puzzledly. \"Where?\" asked Blast. Wigg smirked. \"Follow me and I'll show you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Wigg jumped along the road to the mystery destination, the giant muscle pokemon followed him with quaking steps. Char accidently made a car alarm go off as he walked beside the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg stopped in front of the gates to a giant junkyard with hundred piles of dead cars. \"Here we are!\" said Wigg.<br>\r\n\"A junkyard?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n\"Think about it!\" exclaimed Wigg. \"There are plenty of heavy stuff for you guys to try out and you'll look awesome crushing some cars!\" The sound of crushing cars with his bare hands sounds really pleasing to Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'ya say?\" asked Wigg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, the trio said, \"We're in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Wigg knew was his taking photos of titans doing incredible feats! Drago started by lifting a car in both hands and raising them above his head. He then tossed one car into the other hand making the car land on top of the other!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg then turned his attention to Blast who had a massive pick up truck in his strong hands. Wigg automatically started taking pictures. However, he paused as the truck creaked in Blast's grip. The metal carrier of the truck began to crack as Blast pulled the truck apart. The crack got bigger and bigger for the truck to be cut in half. Blast then raised the halves as high as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar wanted to impress Wigg and outdo what Drago and Blast managed to do. The dragon grinned when he saw a dangling wrecking ball over a pile of cars. Char walked to the ball and grabbed the chain. \"Hey, Wigg!\" yelled Char, \"Check this out!\" The might dragon snapped the chain with flick of his wrist began swinging the wrecking above his head. Wigg's camera flashed like crazy but not as much when Char slammed the ball into a pile of cars scattering piecies of metal and glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing!\" exclaimed Wigg. \"These photos are going to set my whole career!\"</span></div></div>",

Char then punches Blast on his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hey, we're really glad you like it.\", Char added happily. \"I must say though,\", Char flexes his arms down agaings his sides, tensing and flexing his whole body up to amazing proportions, \"it's really nice to be this big. You can just feel the rush and exhilaration through your body and muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Blast stomps a foot on the pile of broken car parts, just to show of his thick tree-trunk legs, \"Yeah! I hear ya there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast were basically in a pose-off, flexing a specific part of their body with the other one-by-one. Drago thought about joining in, but he was starting to realize something going on with the two. He wasn't sure, but after each pose, they appeared to be getting larger and larger, bit-by-bit. Drago looks back at Wigg, who still appeared to be admiring the photos he had just taken. \"Hey Wigg, can you come here a sec?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg bounces up to Drago, \"Yeah? What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still got some film left, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", Wigg replies. \"I actually bring a digital camera too, in case I run out of film.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take pictures of them. Just basic start-to-finish ones.\", Drago explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg gives a thumbs up, \"No problem!\" Wigg pulled out his trusty digital camera, and then immediately started taking photos of the two bodybuilders. Their flexing and posing with one-another actually scurried on for a couple minutes, and Wigg's camera had plenty of power to capture it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast were also pretty proud of themselves. They haven't really had a good ol' posedown between each other in quite some time. Every muscle group one started to flex, the other wanted to top it. Strangely, that seems like what was happening right now. As soon as the two erupted their final pose, Wigg takes one final picture.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't wait to develop them. He hopped towards the muscle titans enthusiastically. \"You guys did great! Thanks again for the photos! I just know I got some of my best work here!\" Drago shared his boss's excitement still feeling the great power flowing across his scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago's euphoria was short lived when Blast said, \"We should probably shrink back to our original sizes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have to?\" asked Drago hoping Blast would say no. Blast answered, \"As much as it would be cool be this big all the time, it would be kinda hard, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago wanted to say he could handle his new strength but he knew his turtle friend was right. \"Yeah, let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Blast and Char shrank back, it was Drago's turn to use the belt. \"Bulk down.\" Instantly, Drago felt the amazing power leaving his body even though there was still some giant muscle left after he shrank back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar could see Drago looked a bit bummed for having to shrink back. \"Don't worry, man. We'll use it again. I promise!\" This made Drago feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a couple hours later, Drago made his way back home at his luxury apartment ready for bed. Just as he changed into his boxers, he checked his email to see if Wigg sent him the photos he took of him, Blast, and Char. Wigg did indeed. Drago opened up the file and admired each photo of different pose the emphasized their incredible muscles. He loved each picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago then compared the last photo Wigg took with the earlier photos. He could tell Blast and Char's muscles looked a little bigger after each pose. He suspicions were correct! How did this happen? Did the belt do it? He'd have to figure it out in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Drago's mind was still clouded with the growth of Blast and Char without the belt. How did they do that? Just by flexing? Only one way to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago stepped in front of his full sized mirror still in his boxers and began doing random poses. Looking at his muscles thickening made Drago feel pumped for the day but he also felt a little bit of warmth coming from the muscles he just flexed. After relaxing his muscles, Drago noticed they kept their tense shape! He grew by flexing too! But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago was completely puzzled then it hit him. The belt. The belt must have done something to him that allowed him to grow slightly without it! Drago couldn't help but grin. He could get use to this new power.</span></div></div>",

I could not have accomplished such an unfortunate task without your kindness and gratitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, no problem!\", Char replies happily, carrying a fairly large barrel in his left arm and over his broad shoulder, and hefty cable wire around his right forearm. \"We're always happy to help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was following behind, carrying another barrel over his head and one around his left arm. \"Why do you have so much heavy stuff?\" Char whips Blast on his head with his tail, \"Ow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My performance requres a well-built and non-crowd-injuring setup.

That flame isn't any further away you know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not too much further. The one in charge wanted me to entertain the folk that walk the streets to hopefully gather more attention towards our circus.\", Monlee assures. \"With you two aiding me with my belongings, it should take fewer trips there and back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\", Char replies happily. He then raises his cable-carrying arm to wrap the cables around his arm muscles, and then flexes his cable-stretching muscles with all his might. \"I wouldn't mind the extra weight-lifting though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonlee notices the stretching cables, \"Please, although I'm proud of you and your friend's muscular stature, I only have that one cable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar quickly relaxes his arm, \"Oops!

Char turns his head back to his turtle friend, a cannon sticking out of Blast's shell, \"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You started it.\", Blast remarks, sounding childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello you three.\" Char, Blast, and Monlee turned their heads to the front of them, seeing Dragona slither up to them. \"And how are you guys today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Dragona.\", Char greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Dragona.\", Monlee greets, bowing his head a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragona!\" Blast suddenly runs past Char and Monlee with stars in his eyes. Suddenly, the two barrels he was carrying fall on one side of him. \"And how are you today?\", Blast asks excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...I'm, fine.\", Dragona replies, trying to keep her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the muscular turtle was busy chatting with his most beloved friend, Monlee looks down to see Blast's foot was crushed by one of the barrels. \"Umm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar intervenes, \"Let's see how long it'll take for him to actually notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast had actually been talking to Dragona for almost five minutes, Blast sounding mushy the entire time.

See ya then.\" Blast just waves off while seeing the aquatic pokemon slither off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que, Char says, \"3...2...1...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OWWW!!!

Char looks up at Blast, raising up his left arm, \"Well, let's see.\" Char pulls his forearm in, making the hardened peak that his bicep raise up quite well.

The more the charizard flexed it, the bigger it was noticeably getting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! That's incredible!\" Blast shoots the belt out of his shell and into his palm. \"I guess this belt can make you grow big faster on your own after you use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Blast,\", the turtle looks at his friend, \"I kinda already noticed this myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast backs up a bit, \"You, you did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah.\", Char admitted. \"Everytime we worked out, even without the belt, I always thought something weird was going on with your muscles, but I then I just thought you were just growing bigger every time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\", Blast replies incompletely. \"Well, I can't say I didn't feel the same way about you too.\" Char looks up at his friend. \"Weird though. We knew it was happening with each other, but not with ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago suddenly walks up to the two, wrapping a tremendous arm around the two's shoulders, \"Well hey, maybe now that the two of you know about this, you probably won't need the belt to grow anymore. On your own, that is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar looks down a bit, \"Well, yeah. I guess you're right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\", Drago yells out proudly, patting you both on the back. \"Hey, you guys aren't too tired right now, are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar and Blast looked at each other, Blast being the one to reply. \"No, not really. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago steps forward, unwrapping his meaty arms from the both of you. \"Just wonderin'.\"</span></div></div>",

They did all their best feats at the junkyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does he want us to do more outrageous feats?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrago gave a slight smirk. \"Not exactly. He wants us to show off at the beach! Tomorrow's going to bring great weather for a beach day! What'ya say?\" Char agreed the moment Drago mentioned the beach. He would love to show his bare body for the rest of the world to see. Besides, his scales shined in sunlight. Blast always loved the ocean and didn't see why not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm up for it!\" said Char.<br>\r\n\"So am I!\" said Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" exclaimed Drago. \"I'll see you guys there in the morning!\" Drago left the tent feeling pumped than ever before. He loved going to beach. Doing beach footage was his favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char were getting ready for bed when Nyne and Dragona arrived. \"Hey, you guys!\" said Nyne. Char looked up excited to see his fox. \"Hi, Nyne! Great job tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\" Nyne looked like she wanted to say something else but was too distracted by Char's rippling chest. It seemed like it grew more powerful everytime she saw it. Dragona noticed Nyne's shyness and spoke on her behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say guys, since we got the day off tomorrow, you want to do anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stuttered knowing they just made plans. \"Well...we have made plans to do another photo session with Drago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it'll be at the beach!\" interrupted Char. \"You can come with us! I'm sure Drago and the photographer wouldn't mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast looked at his bud. \"You sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Drago and Wigg are layed back kinda guys. I'm sure they'll be okay with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun!\" said Nyne. \"I'm in! What about you, Dragona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not as long as we're not a bother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" said Char. He then flexed a thick arm that formed into a wall of muscle. \"Besides, we don't want you to miss the show.\" The girls giggled and left the tent with a plan settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Char smiled under the sun and over the sand. They stood in the warm sand in the skin tight bathing suits right next to Nyne and Dragona in bikinis. The duo held their girls' hands walking down the beach looking for Drago. Other pokemon noticed the two couples and stared at the giant lizard and turtle. The felt a little shy from the stares but the guys kept walking high in pride knowing everything was going great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast! Char!\" The group noticed a dragonite in a black speedo next to a wigglytuff holding a camcorder.<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" greeted Blast. \"What's up with the video camera, Wigg?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I try something a little different!\" answered Wigg. \"I want to catch your muscles right in the action! What better place to do that than at the beach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar chuckled. \"That's true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWigg then noticed the slender nynetales and the dragonair by Blast and Char's side. \"Who are these nice ladies?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are our girlfriends, Nyne and Dragona,\" answered Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, sir,\" said Nyne. \"I hope you don't mind if our watching their session.\" Wigg didn't mind at all. In fact, he fell in love how Nyne and Dragona looked in their bikinis. He knew he had to capture them in film too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, how would you too feel about posing with these guys?\" asked Wigg to the girls. \"You look marvelous, if you don't mind me saying so, and it would give me great footage of you all to show! What'ya say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne and Dragona were very surprised. Neither viewed themselves as modeling material, but if it meant to be closer to their boyfriends and a bit more fame, they didn't see why they couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey agreed and Blast, Char, and Drago pumped their muscular arms in excitement.</span></div></div>",

In one move Char took the belt from Blast and puts it on, grinning from ear to ear. He tilted his head back, closed his eyes, awaiting the pleasure about to hit his body. \"Bulk up!\" His chest was the first to feel the warmth of growth, his pecs exploded outward and his abs found a way to become even more defined. His arms were not far behind growing to what seemed like max capacity and yet it still expanded. His legs reached outward, becoming even more toned as pillars of strength. As the warmth started to go away, char opened his eyes to nothing but ocean and sand. But after a few seconds, Char realized that wasn't the ocean, that was the sky! And that would make the sand... He reached up one hand to feel his new body. His pecs blocked his view downward to the point where he had to bend over just to see a shocked Blast and Drago. Blast's head could only reach up to half way up Char's 14-pack abs, which was now a 10-pack with two extra on each side in their own column. Drago didn't fair much better, only reaching just under Char's pecs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne and Dragona turned to see the commotion only to see a giant firebreathing dragon. Nyne ran up to the overgrown lizard, \"Char, you're gigantic!\" She looked straight forward only to be greeted by a speedo that was definitely at it's limit. She looked up to see the eyes of her boyfriend gazing down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar reached down with one giant arm and scooped her off the ground, bringing her up to his chest. His pecs seemed like they could fit one of her in each. Once she was raised up by a hand half the size of her to the giant's head, she sat in awe of her lover's massive body. Char began to lay down, placing Nyne on his pecs.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One morning, Char was off and on his own out in the breezy forest. He also had some workout equipment along with him, wanting to take a short break on his own and actually get some quiet time to himself. As much as he loved his fans, he needs this workout time on his own, and boy did he feel great. Char also had his belt handy, wearing it around his right calf while he was doing arm lifts with a 100-pound dumbbell. He takes his time, letting his muscles plump and heave up and down with each rep, getting the most out of his pumped body as he just does more and more. As for the rest of his equipment, it was mainly a few barbells, dumbbells, and weights. Char does one more rep, holding his flexed peak up in the air, and then caresses it with his other hand. \"Nice 'n' big. Just the way I like it.\", Char remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the big dragon overhears what sounded like a twig being snapped. He quickly turns around. \"Hm? Oh.\" Standing in front of him was the same charmander from before. \"It's you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...hi Char.\" The tike scratches the back of his head, \"Sorry if I'm interrupting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm?\" Char wanted time to himself, but he wouldn't mind the same li'l tike from before stopping by. \"Naw, it's alright.\" The big charizard sets the dumbbell down, and then kneels his massive body down in front of the charmander. \"So what brings you all the way up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was actually looking for you back at the circus, but then I saw you up here. So, I kinda just ran all the way up here on my own.\", the tike explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", Char remark. \"You climbed all the way up here on you own? That's pretty brave of you. Anyways, I was just finishing up a few reps for now.\" Char was about to grab the barbell, but then looks back at his number one fan. \"Hey, how 'bout I give ya li'l show again. Would ya like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tikes eyes gleamed, \"Really? That'd be so cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stood back up and raised both his arms in a double bicep flex. To the tike, Char's biceps look like the biggest mountains he has ever seen. Char then puffed his chest to define his pecs and abs. They rippled with power and looked like power was going to erupt from him for the tike to share. Char knew what pose to do for a finale. He kneeled down back to the tike on one knee. Char grabbed his wrist and flexed his bicep right in front of the charmander's eyes. They looked bigger than from afar! The tike couldn't believe a charizard like Char could have such power. Char smiled at the tike, knowing he was amazed by him. \"Want to feel?\" asked Char. The tike blushed. \"Umm...do you mind?\"<br>\r\n\"Not at all! Give it a shot!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tike placed his tiny hand on Char's gigantic arms. It was impossible for the tike to wrap his claw around a big arm like Char's. It felt cool from Char's scales yet warm from the energy he had deep within him. The tike couldn't believe it. Char's bicep felt harder than iron and steel! The tike couldn't take his hand off of Char's arm. \"Wow,\" said the tike. \"You're really strong.\" Char chuckled making all his muscles ripple slightly. \"I do what I can.\" He then winked at him.  The tike stared in awe of the massive muscles Char had. \"This is so cool! I can't believe how strong you are.\" Char smiled and  brought his arms forward to his chest and flexed both, his chest and biceps swellig out, large veins visible on both as his biceps swelled to large peaks of unimaginable strength, making the tike's eyes go wide with amazement. \"How is that?\" Char said with a big grin. \"It was amazing! I hope i can be as big as you are someday.\" Char smiled, placing his hand on the tike's head and rubbed it softly. \"I'm sure you will one day, you just have to work hard and never give up.\" The tike grinned broadly \"I will I promise!\"</span></div></div>",

Hey, want I give you a few pointers when you start workout one day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me? Pointers?\" The tike looks at all the large equipment. \"That stuff, kinda looks awful heavy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, no\", Char assures, \"I'm not gonna make ya lift this stuff. Though it's always good to start training sooner than later.\" Char kneels his immensely muscled body down just like before, \"Now, since you're very young, I wouldn't recommend any lifting of weights and that sort of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, what should I start with?\", the tike asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar winks, \"You can jog. Perhaps maybe even do some push-ups or sit-ups.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Push-ups? Sit-ups?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar chuckles. \"Heh. Guess I'll have to show you that. But just remember, don't overdo it. It took me years to get this big.\", Char lies. \"So nothing'll come to you fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charmander nods his head, \"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. So how's about I show you them situps and pushup?\", Char asks excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay!\", the little guy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! So let's start with some situps.\" Char got down to the charmander and lied on his back with his hands behind his head. \"First, you start at this position,\" Char started. He then lifted his upper body up without moving his arms. The tike could see Char's chest defining as Char got up between reps. \"And then, you lift your upper body up and keep doing it until you reach a setted goal. Got it?\" The tike nodded agreeing. \"Good. Now you try,\" said Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tike got into the position Char showed him and Char placed his hands on the tike's feet. The tike looked at him puzzled. \"It's hard to keep your position in situps sometimes,\" explained Char, \"Especially with beginners.\"<br>\r\n\"How many should I do?\" asked the tike.<br>\r\n\"Hmm...I think ten is doable.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar didn't even have to say go. The tike began excitedly. Char counted each rep the tike completed. The tike began to slow down after his fifth rep. \"Come on,\" Char encouraged, \"You can do this! Just a few more!\" His words fueled the tike to reach his tenth rep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad.\", says Char to the panting charmander. \"Alright, you won't have to do this next, but I'll show you how pushups work.\" Char accurately gets into position, pushing his arms out against the ground while facing it. Without hesitation, and with slow speed, Char begins performing an impressive set of pushups, letting his arms and chest and back just gush out and pump with energy flowing through his swelling muscles. The little charmander almost couldn't believe what he was seeing. Seeing Char's massive body all plumped up, Char's great feats of strength and agility with each pushup, it's almost too good to be true. In a matter of minutes Char was all done, and he had only done about ten pushups! Char gets back up on his feet, and then flexes his entire upper body for show. \"Ha-hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tike wiggles his arms around, \"Oh my gosh! That was so COOL!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar crosses his muscled arms over his thick chest, \"Thanks. Glad you liked it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I more than liked it. I ENJOYED it!\", the tike yells. He then runs up to Char, giving him the best hug he could. \"Thanks for letting me stick around Char.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar puts on a big grin, and then kneels down once again to hug the little guy back, \"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I just remembered! My dad must be looking for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well then, you'd better get going.\", Char.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tike runs off, but not before turning to give Char a wave back, \"Will I get to see you again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure! Feel free to stop by if ever. I'll be up here for a while. Just don't tell anyone.\", Char replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.\" The little guy then runs off on his own.</span></div></div>",

Char's upper body was feeling great, his muscles tensing and rippling from all over while he pants quite heavily from his recent lifts. \"Ah... Yep. Really glad the little guy stopped by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What the heck are ya doin' up here?\", a boar-like voice emitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's entire body twitches. \"No... It couldn't be... Not him...\" Char turns around, the sound of a creaking door eminating as he does. .... It was him. Char turns back away, looking completely uninterested now. \"Oh great.\", he mumbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What was that? I couldn't hear ya?\" The muscular crosses his large arms over his thick chest. \"But seriously, you needed some time to yourself or something? Workout out all the way up here in the middle o' nowhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's eye twtitches as he grits his teeth. \"Uh...YES!\", he yells in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on man, is this really what you do when you're not busy?\", Embo mentions what was the utmost truth once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar drops the barbell, facepalming himself. He then covers the pig's mouth, \"Yes! Yes to ALL of that! And if you don't mind leaving? You're interrupting my me time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo slips Char's hand off, \"Actually, I'm glad you're here.\" Embo sets his hands on his hips, and then shows off his massive pecs and lats. \"I was just going through a quick workout myself. And thought I stop by to show you what I've got.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's shoulders drop. \"......Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo grinned, nodding \"Yea, I got to show ya how a real body builder does it.\" Char shrugged disinterestedly. \"I'm not really interested in having a pose off with you. I just want to work on my reps, so if you don't mind..\" Embo laughed. \"Are you afraid? scared I might show you up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar snorted. \"You? show me up? that's a laugh\" Embo gritted his teeth and stomped his foot, cuasing the ground to shake a bit. \"Such big talk from a little lizard, come on and show me what you've got\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar growled softly \"Alright, alright. If it'll get you off my back then fine.\" Embo grinned, taking a step forward. \"Get ready to lose, I'm not going to let myself lose to you.\" He raised his arms up, intertwining his fingers and lowering his arms a bit into a  triangle shape, biceps bulging out to form great peaks of strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar let out a sly grin. \"We'll see about that!\" Char raised his scaly muscular arms in the air and placed his hands on the back of his head. Not only were his biceps and triceps bulging to godly proportions, but his pecs and abs also swelled bigger in power. Embo felt a little worried but not afraid of Char's muscles yet. That is until Char performed a second pose. Char then pressed his arms downward. His arms grew even bigger before Char completed the pose. When Char stopped moving, Embo found himself literally staring at a mountain of muscle. Char's entire body plumped up. His arms and chest became more vascular and stroong than ever before. Even his legs  showed excessive power. Embo couldn't believe it. There was no way the muscle boar can do that himself.</span></div></div>",

Char had been holding his pose for that long just as well, his left arm flexing downwards while stretching his pecs and lats and his right arm flexed up in the air, tensing his rock-hard muscles as much as he can. The massive boar was staring closely at Char's right arm, watching it tense up with great power while accompanied by a good vein. Char even lowers his arm and flexes it right up again to make his thick peak bounce right up greatly. The powerful dragon looks down at his opponent, holding a big grin on his maw. \"Too much to take in, huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for Embo to actually react. \"Huh!?\" He huffs as he turns away and crosses arms, \"Ah shut up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walks up to the pig, his large arms crossed over his massive chest. \"Face it, you've met your match, buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo turns to Char with a fist up, \"Ah you wouldn't be so tough with that belt of yours attatched to your leg!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh.\" Char points back to himself with his thumb, \"I've been weight-training MUCH before I found this belt.\", Char lies. He then sticks his belt-wrapped leg out to flex his enormous calf, just enough to flex the fabric of the power belt, \"Besides, this thing only improves the experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmbo snorts, and then turns away while throwing his arm at Char, \"Ah who needs ya!\" The angry pig starts walking away. \"I'll be back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\", Char toys. Char smiled returning to his workout, having got sufficiently pumped up after that and needed to burn off this extra energy.he grabbed two dumb bells pumping one in each arm 30 times before taking a break for a minute and starting another set of the same amount. this was really easy for him.  It was too easy for him and char began growing bored of it. he thought about the little flex off he'd just had, and it really excited him. \"I suppose practing my poses wouldn't hurt..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar set down the dumb bells and stood up. wondering what kinds of poses he could do. After his posedown with Embo, Char didn't feel like doing any fancy poses, but he was curious how strong he was when he posed. Char curled his left arm making his bicep grow to the size of his head. He then patted his arm with his right hand. His bicep felt strong, warm, and big under his grip. Char smiled feeling like his bicep was hard as diamonds, like they were all shoved into his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar then took a breath and pushed up his chest to define his pecs and abs. His chest was just as strong as he stroked both his hands on it. He couldn't help feel happy about his shape and strength. Char would have admired it more if he didn't run out of air that supported his puff chest. Char relaxed from his poses feeling satisfied.</span></div></div>",

He then gives his leg a good feel as well, just like he did with his other muscles. It's interesting. He barely got a lot of time to himself, but still, he was feeling even better about himself and his body than he probably would working out on his own. Suddenly, another set of footsteps was making its way towards the empowered dragon, who was still preoccupied with his thick leg. \"Well, looks like someone's been enjoyin' himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's head bops up, he knew who's voice that belonged to. He turns around to see it was... \"Oh, hey Blast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big turtle crosses his arms over his broad chest. \"I figured all this alone time would make you love yourself even more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well... Wait...whaddaya mean by that? Anyways\", the dragon pokemon continued, \"I haven't exactly been by myself the whole time. You're the third as a matter of fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Who else was here?\", Blast asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The little tike from earlier, which was okay, and Embo apparently.\", Char replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betcha you were pretty ticked off at Embo, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, the guy actually challenged me to a posedown. But I won.\" Char does another pose, turning his upper body around to do a back double-bicep pose for his good buddy, \"As you can see, this was too much for the guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive.\", Blast remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar holds his astounding pose, \"Anyways, why're you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast shrugged a shoulder. \"I was getting a bit worried since you've been gone for a while so I thought I'd come by over here to check up on you. Nice to know you weren't kidnapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar scoffed. \"Do I look like I could be kidnapped?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I'm just messing with ya.\" Blast scanned with ground scattered with dumbbells and other weights. \"Blowing off steam, I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I was thinking about going one more time before calling it a day. Care to join me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast noticed a weight bench next to Char and made his way towards it. He didn't waste time; he started pumping his arms by lifting the bar up and down till his muscles felt warm. Blast smiled to himself and pumped faster as his arms felt like they were burning. Char chuckled at his bro while continuing his dumbbell reps. As much as Char loved the sensation of working out, he loved seeing his arm muscles tense and relax from each rep. Each set his arms heated up more and more, the burning felt great as he worked his biceps and triceps. looking over at Blast he could see he was enjoying himself quite a lot as well. each pump of the bar showed off Blast's well defined biceps. they were like giant crags of immense strength and Char couldn't help but admire them. Blast, in between reps, looked over and noticed Char staring and grinned. \"checking out the competition eh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar smiled before nodding. \"I'm just curious to see how much you can really lift\" Blast grinned, flexing a bicep. \"Well why don't we find out together, unless of course you'd rather do something else to test out our strength other than lifting weights.\"</span></div></div>",

At first, his turtle friend looked really tuckered out, but then he just takes in a deep breath. Blast gets right back up on his feet and then turns to his muscle-dragon friend, flexing one arm in the air as his bicep tenses with great power. \"Alright bro. Let's see what these babies can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar was a little astonished at first, but then grins the same as his friend. \"Alright then.\" The big dragon walks over to the many weights that lay effortlessly on the grass. \"Good thing I brought just enough weights.\", Char winks to his friend. He then sets them up with a bar that ends up weighing 450 pounds. Char slowly lifts the weight up against his chest, and then turns around with it in his hands to look at his friend. The orange dragon raises an eyebrow, seeing his friend was looking a little uncomfortable with the heavy bar. \"What's wrong? Ya ain't afraid are ya?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stares a bit at the bar, but then looks up at his friend and shakes his head, \"Naw!\" He then stands up straight to proudly pat his muscular chest, \"Just staring at something that looks so easy to lift.\" Blast childishly turns his head away while folding his thick arms over his chest, \"Hmph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\", Char remarks. Char was about ready to return to the weights, \"Alright then. I'm sure you won't mind if I add some more on to the bar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gih-!\" Blast reaches out with one arm, \"No don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar turns his head back around and chuckles, \"I thought so.\" Char sets the bar down gently on the grass, and then looks straight at his friend while crossing his arms over his meaty chest. \"Now come on and show me what those arms of yours can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast steps up to the bar, and then takes a deep breath. He kneels down on one knee and grabs a firm hold of the heavy metal. With a low grunt, he shuts his eyes and slowly picks up the bar with surprising ease. The bar still was heavy, but Blast actually liked how heavy it was. As the heavy turtle starts lifting, he immediately started to feel the burn. The burn started in his arms and stretched to his meaty chest. Blast leveled the bar up to his chin already sweating. Blast kept pushing his hands upwards against the bar and Char smiled for his friend knowing what he was attempting. The bar was now right in front of Blast's eyes. With a huff of air from his mouth to his muscles, Blast rose the bar above his head. Char clapped loudly for his turtle friend's accomplishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Blast threw the weight down with a loud slam that sounded like a boulder in a rockslide. The muscle turtle the raised his arms to flex them mightly in front of Char.<br>\r\n\"How do you like that?!\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n\"Not bad!\" replied Char. \"Not bad at all!\" He then gave another grin. \"How about we kick it up a notch?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you have in mind?\" asked Blast.<br>\r\n\"Let's see if we can lift beyond our limits! I want to see our muscles deal with bigger weights. Bigger weights equals bigger muscles!\"<br>\r\nBlast chuckled. \"Okay, how much are we talking here?\"<br>\r\nChar had to think for a second on how much would be a challenge.</span></div></div>",

With each piece that was added to the bar Blast began getting nervous. FInally the last weights were slid on and Char gestured to it in a grand teasing gesture. \"After you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast stiffened his back and nodded and nervously grasped the bar. taking a deep breath he pulled the bar off and nearly let go again. The weight was immense, it made his arms burn with the effort just to hold it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar could see Blast's arms thickening under the pressure. Veins popped out of the muscle turtle's arms to provide blood and adrenaline to Blast's body. Blast gritted his teeth hoping making a scary face at the weight would magically make it lighter. Blast pulled harder making his body grow even more vascular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duo heard a ruffle of dirt underneath the weight. Blast managed to get the weight a few inches of the ground! Blast was growing exhausted but he had to keep going. He knew Char would never let it down in he couldn't pull off this feat. Blast took in deep breaths while pulling the weight even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if each huff of air gave Blast energy because each breath drew the weight towards his upper body. Char was very impressed when Blast rested the weight on his chest. Blast paused to rest a bit. \"Umm, bro,\" said Char, \"You sure you can do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast turned to Char and smiled. \"Yes. I. Can!\" With a monsterous roar, Blast heaved his arms in the air lifting the weight over his head. Before Blast or Char could express their excitement, Blast dropped the weight to the ground with a loud thump. His knees followed, and then his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walks up to his tired and panting friend. Looks like the bar really put a number on him. \"Hey Blast, you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big turtle manages to sit up in front of his best pal. \"Nng... Yeah...\", he replies with a rather weak grin. \"That bar sure put a lot of stress on my body, but I think it was all worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar took look at his bro's throbbing muscles. His chest and arms were actually looking quite massive! As if his feat put a lot of pain in his body, but with stunning results. Char then decides to pat a hand against Blast's hardened arm. \"Dude, you look AND feel great! It's almost as if I'm touching a grand statue, er somethin'.\", the big dragon appraised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, you really think so?\", Blast asks hesitantly. He slowly raises up his own arm, watching as his shredded bicep and tricep flex with great size and definition. \"Wow...neat!\", the excited sea turtle yells cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Dragona's gonna have a sight to see.\", Char adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast suddenly remembers something, \"Ack! Dragona! I forgot, I was only supposed to check on you!\" The big aquatic creature was about to get up, but his thick body was still pretty strained. \"Ow...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar pats his hands on his friend's shoulders, \"Hey, take it easy man.\" The orange dragon then helps his bro slowly get back up on his feet. \"I'm sure she'll understand. No need to rush back down to her in your current condition. Plus, if anything, I'm sure she won't hate you too much after you show her what you've become.\", Char winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast looks down to his chest, and then brings his meaty arms in against his sides to see his pecs swell out greatly. \"Hm... I guess you may have somethin' there.\", the turtle replies with his grin returning. He then turns around to head on his way while waving an arm back at his friend. \"See ya bro!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See ya!\", Char replies. The big dragon then turns his attention to the 700-lb weight. \"Hmm... I wonder...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Char couldn't help but wonder if he could lift as much as Blast, maybe more. He did spend most of the day working out, meaning his muscles grew more powerful under the stress. However, Char didn't want to overdo like Blast did. He thought he could hurt himsef, so Char decided to give the 700 lbs. weight a try and if it was too easy he'll add more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walked to the weight Blast dropped and squatted down to wrap his claws on it. The muscular dragon felt a bit nervous and hoped it didn't wear him out like Blast. With a heaving breath, Char tugged on the weight hard. He pulled it as hard as he could and within a minute the weight was up to his chest. It was hard work but it took him less time to get the weight to his meaty pecs than it for Blast. Char was right. His earlier workouts made him stronger, even stronger than his best bud! Char smiled to himself knowing that he had to see what he was truly capable of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar gave a small grunt as he pushed up, the bar slowly rising up past his shoulders, then his chin, and finally raising over his head into the air and he exhaled a deep breath and then lowered the bar again and let it fall to the ground, being careful not to let it hit his feet. \"I wonder how much i can lift.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar decided to tack on another 200 pounds onto the bar, and began lifting up the bar a bit to set it up. Soon the weights were on and he took a deep breath and clenched his  claws together a couple times before grasping the bar. He took a couple short nervous breaths, then held it as he pulled up and slowly began pulling the bar up. This was definitely more of a challenge for him. His biceps felt like they were going to burst out of his arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe progress was long and arduous and it seemed like it was taking an eternity to raise the bar as high as his chest. Char had no idea if he would going to be able lift it all the way, but he had to try or he'd never get any better. He sucked in a deep breath through his teeth and strained as he pushed up the bar. Every inch above his chest felt like his biceps were being stabbed with Nidoran's Horn Attack. it was excruciating, but he could almost feel his biceps swelling to meet the challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it, the bar had risen over his chin and was steadily rising, soon passing his snout and he watched as the bar rose past his eyes and began enetering the open air as the bar finally cleared his head. \"Come.. on... just.. a little more...\" Char gave a low growl as he pushed with all he could and finally raised the bar all the way up and then let go of the bar. the weights hitting the ground with a thunderous boom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar followed Blast by landing on his claws and knees. He warm and exhausted from his workout. The muscle dragon kept gasping for air in hopes that'll cool him off. Char's arms felt extremely warm from the stress of the weight. Strangely, that warmth somehow stretched out to his chest and then to his legs. Char's whole body felt like it was on fire and it was unbearable, even for a fire pokemon. Char looked down at his chest and arms and was surprised to see his muscles more thick and clean cut than before. He then looked at his legs and they too grew more muscle power. They looked thicker than an giant oak tree! Char rubbed his chest and arms to feel their definition. To his pleasure, Char saw that his muscles were harder and sturdier than steel or iron. Eventually, the warmth in his body cooled leaving a sense of strength inside of him behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dragon just wanted to take in what he was packing for the moment. He merely lifts up his left arm, watching his studly arm muscles tense and practically flex up on their own, as well as his forearm being well-accompanied by snaking veins. He then sticks out his right leg, seeing that his leg muscles, his thighs especially, were immense. Almost like he could stomp the ground, making the world shake a bit around him. Last, but not least, were his pecs. He gave them a soft and gentle feel, feeling how hard and thick they've gotten. Suddenly, Char smirks and then pounds his chest a bit like a gorilla. 'ROOOAR!!' Char quickly comes back to his senses after that. \"! Whoa... That was unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Char?\" The big guy jumps a bit, and then turns around to where the greeting came from. Turns out, it was the little tike from earlier. \"Um, was that roar from you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Uh, yeah.\", Char chuckles. \"I was kinda excited. Did you hear it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", the little charmander started to rub his ear, at least where it would be, \"A lot of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar walks up to the little tike and kneels down in front of him on knee, he then chuckles as he pats the little tike's head, \"Sorry. I guess I couldn't really control myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charmander looks up at Char's large hand, \"Huh?\" The youngan then pulls in Char's hand, as best he could, \"Whoa! Char, you grew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooks like Char wasn't the only one to take notice. \"Yeah?\" He then raises his patting hand show off his ginormous peak right in front of the little pokemon, \"Glad you were able to take notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being as shy as before, the little tike goes right ahead takes a feel of the dragon's larger bicep. His paws were practically miniscule against Char's thickened peak. \"Way cool! Did you use the belt again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\", Char replies. \"I just worked out on my own with a really heavy weight, and then\", Char raises up both his arms in a powerful double-bicep flex, \"boom!\" The small charmander cheers for his biggest inspiration once again. Although Char wasn't completely sure what could have caused his growth so quickly, he knows for certain it must have been the belt working its magic. The muscley dragon then relaxes his arms, \"So what brings you back all the way up here? Ya just can't stay away, can ya.\", Char laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I, just wanted to come back and check on you. Since I was still here.\"</span></div></div>",

He took notice and got a great idea. \"Hey, little bud,\" said Char, \"Have you ever rode on an airplane before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charmander kid didn't know why his muscle hero was asking but he answered, \"N-no, why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar got onto one knee to meet the tike in the eyes. \"How about you and I go for a ride through the sky?\" Char hinted his intention by fluttering his wings again at the tike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to fly with you?\" asked the tike nervously. \"I don't know. I never been on a airplane before. What if I fall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry,\" assured Char placing his giant hand on the tike's shoulder. \"I'll hold on to you very tightly. I won't let you go. I promise we won't fly up too high. Trust me, you'll love it! It'll give you something to look forward to when you evolve into a Charizard! What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tike was still nervous but he did trust Char. He knew that Char wouldn't hurt him. \"Okay,\" answered the young charmander, \"But do it fast before I change my mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar laughed and then winked at the tike. \"Don't worry, you won't.\" The tike nodded, still a little nervously before  Char picked him up, holding him tightly to his chest, and the tike couldn't help but marval how solid they were. Char smiled as his wings began flapping, gently at first, then picking up, slowly gaining power as great winds buffeted the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Charizard began floating a little with each beat, and then with geat flare he shot up a bit intot he sky and the tike yelped a little in surprise before he quieted down in excitement. Char felt the gentle winds flowing past him as he picked up a little more altitude, enjoyng the feel of the wind, but stopped when the tike shivered nervously and he looked down and noticed he'd gone up quite a bit. \"O-Oh.. sorry little guy.. i just got carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-it's okay..\" Slowly Char descended a bit, and he began moving forward, enjoying the breeze that now washed over his entire body and the tike gave a small start of surprise. \"This is really cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar laughs proudly at his fine, not-yet-evolved friend, \"See? I knew you'd love it!\" Char was taking it easy especially, flying around trees with ease, even flying over the circus where a few pokemon were taking notice of them from above. As the two were just flying up above, the big dragon looks down at his little dragon friend, seeing he was really enjoying himself. Even sticking out his arms to try to simulate himself flying. So Char thought, why not a tricks? Nothing too hasty of course. The first thing Char did were a few twirls while bulleting through the air. He takes a quick look down to see the little guy was surprised, but really enjoyed it most of all. \"Mind if I did a few more tricks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe charmander looks up at his hero, \"Sure! As long as it's not too fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got it!\", Char winks. The massive reptilian then darts up towards the sky in a twirling motion. He was really recieving some massive air! \"Oops!\" Char looked down, seeing the two were A LOT higher than ever. Before Char could do anything else, stops right he was in mid air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Char, why are we stopped here?\", the tike asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...well...\", Char just thought he let the little guy see for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, the tike could see there were really up there. Even higher than the mountains around them. The tike then looks up, seeing a pidove fly right past them. The big dragon immediately felt the little guy start to tremble in his grasp. \"Um...Char...I think I'd like to go down now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a problem.\", Char assures. He would never want scare his biggest fan. Like Embo did. Char slowly floats to the ground, and then covers the tike's eyes while holding him ever so gently in his protectively muscular arms. \"Don't worry. I've got you.\" Back on the ground, Char made sure if the tike was okay. \"Heh, sorry about that. I guess I got a little carried away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay. I'm just glad you were there to protect me the whole time.\", the tike says warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar suddenly sniffles after that, but then yells into his head, \"Come on Char, don't cry!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the day rolls by, normally people would be out watching the sunset together, if they wanted. But not this night. In fact tonight is another night for Char and his friend Blast to appease the crowd once again with their fastastical feats. Only this time, tonight is what's known as their, like, one-hundredth show! Inside their popular circus tent, the two muscle mons began enticing the crowd with their usual feat of lifting a very large triangular weight. This has become more of an easy task, though still just as fun as they thought of different ways to show off their strong muscles with said weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next part of the show, they came up with an idea a couple attractions back that involved Char picking up his heavyset friend and flying around the circus with him while Blast shot a couple minor fireworks from out of his shell. It's very stunning indeed, as the two then drop back to the ground to show off their best and most muscular pose, until one final firework shoots off, exploding behind them as their large muscles glowed all around them from the explosion of fireworks. After that is their finale. It WAS going to be their usual flex-off routine while using the belt, but tonight they wanted it to be different. Even though they weren't precisely sure what number show this is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar has always been thinking about how big he could get with the belt, but this was something Blast was always skeptic about. For one thing, he was concerned it would scare a few folks, and another being if he could handle all the...a-hem, bulk. What got Blast to go through with it was that Char wanted his bro to use it too. Char put on the belt first, which starting to fit tight, but luckily its fabric was stretchable. As Char yelled out the magic words to the crowd, Char's body began its warm endevor, thickening out from all around while the muscled dragon flexes various muscle groups. In just over a minute, Blast's eyes marveled at the 10-foot sight of his best friend. This may very well be the biggest and most ripped he has ever seen of his bro, thus far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar raises up his arms in great massive flex, his biceps flexing out like boulders! The crowd went wild, as Char then lowers his arms against his sides to protrude out his massive pecs. Blast couldn't believe what he was seeing, until Char handed over the belt to him. Only being able to hold it with two fingers, Char drops the belt onto Blast's hands. Now it's the big turtle's turn. Blast slips the belt on around his wrist, and then says aloud the words everyone else has been waiting for. Blast's body immediately tenses up right after. Char had his arms crossed over his burly chest, grinning as he watched his bro grow right in front of him. Blast's chest started to stretch out, becoming much more thick, even with his shell. The big turtle's arms began to fill out even more, even growing a little more lengthy to support his rippling arm muscles. Blast could feel his biceps fill out against his padded pecs, but he was sure enjoying his moment of bliss. His legs were included in the set as well, which started to become much more meaty and well muscled out. They too also lengethed out just enough to support his growing thighs and calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was long until Blast's magic growth spurt had come to an end as well. Once the large turtle opened his eyes, he was now standing almost as tall as his big bro, in a, friend sort of way of course. Char pats his friend on the shoulder proudly, his blue friend smiling proudly back. They both then glance at the crowd before them, and then pull out the most stunning poses they could think of! Char's was a great double-bicep while sticking out his thick pecs and right leg. Blast's was a lat spread while keeping his arms tensed up and stuck out against his sides. The two bodybuilders just let the crowd cheer on for the time being, feeling really proud of themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of sudden, the two musclemons gacked in pain, their bodies starting to ache like there was no tomorrow. They even started to glow a few times, like any normal pokemon would. They slowly starting to glow a few times while they clenched on to their aching bodies, and then...they both fall flat to the ground. The crowd was silent, unaware of what just happened. In a moment of desperation, their arcanine boss slides out on stage in front of the two. \"Give it up for Char and Blast everyone!\" The crowd slowly started to clap, one-by-one, until the audience was starting to pick up like they normally would. Their boss then looks back worriedly at his two best circus mates. \"Eh-hem, well, that'll be all for tonight! Looks like these two really tuckered themselves out. But don't worry, they'll be just fine!\" The crowd cheers one last time. \"Thank you everyone for attending! We'll see ya next time!\" He then whispers to himself, \"If there's going to be a next time...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning, a thick ray of sunlight start to appear though a small hole of the tent. It was beaming strongly down the hole and right onto Char's forehead. The sound dragon soon started to wake up. \"Hm...?\" He stares blankly at the tent for a moment, until the beam decided to hit him in the pupil. The dragon picked himself up in while covering his eyes, \"AUGH! My eye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you're awake.\" The agonized dragon looks at his boss with one eye. \"Good to see you're still up at it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, yeah. Of course I am.\" Char takes a look around. \"Hey, where am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still in the show tent. Duh.\", the arcanine explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am? Why didn't you take me to my usual tent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we tried.\", Char's boss replies, \"Even with everyone pitching in you two were still too heavy to even budge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. That's right...\", Char remembered. \"Well, then where's Blast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He should be back any minute. Boy was he shocked at himself when he woke up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Was it because of his massive bod?\", Char remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, it wasn't just that.\" Char raised an eyebrow at him. The arcanine then hands a mirror over to Char, \"You might wanna take a look at this.\" Char grasped the mirror as he rocked forward, standing up with little difficulty. Looking intot he mirror his breath stops and he nearly drops the mirror, the end of the handle being caught in his claws as he stared into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss your sure this isn't a trick mirror?\" Char  lowered the mirror as he raised his left arm, sprouting out of his wrists were some new sort of wings, but they didn't quite look like they would help him fly faster without looking totally ridiculous. Curling his tail he found that it had a few ridges protruding near the end of his tail, and one large spike near the base of it<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is too weird..\" Char's wings bristled as he looked intot he mirror again, finding that the horns on his head had changed as well. Looking from wing to wing, he found they changed a bit too. They looked a bit ragged, like a cat had decided to come claw them up while he had been out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's weird but I like it!\" Char turned around and dropped his jaw. He saw a muscular turtle-like pokemon he almost didn't recognize. The buff turtle carried a bigger shell on his back with a huge nozzle sticking out of the top center. He also had smaller shells on his wrists each with a smaller nozzle poking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blast?\" asked Char, \"Is that you?\" Blast nodded satisfied with his new body and his best bro's. \"Yep!\" Blast responded with a flex of a even bigger bicep than from the show. \"Man, I can't get over our new look! We look bigger and stronger even without the belt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did that happen?\" asked Char. \"We're already fully evolved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not...\" Dragona stepped forward. \"I once heard of a rare type of evolution that only applied to very strong pokemon. It's called...mega evolution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mega evolution?\" repeated Blast and Char repeated simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona continued, \"Mega evolution is when a strong pokemon changes its form without changing into a totally different pokemon. It also makes them stronger than their previous form.\" Char and Blast got more excited as Dragona explained making the muscles swell with enthusiasm and power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've also heard rumors that mega pokemon can change between their original forms and mega forms at will.\" That sealed it. Blast and Char were completely excited about their new change. They truly believed they could do anything now. Char imagined showing off his new mega form in front of an audience screaming of applause louder than ever before. Blast pictured transforming into mega for the first time for the audience and the amazement he and his bro would get.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is awesome!\" shouted Char.</span></div></div>",

Got me?\", the turtoise explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar's broad shoulders drop, \"Oh. Okay. But, I wouldn't even know where to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast holds up a finger, \"How about we try and just think about it. Maybe then it will just start to happen on its own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Okay.\" Char starts by thinking seriously, clenching his eyelids closed as a vein starts to poke out on his forehead, \"HRRRNNNG...\" Suddenly, it seems the large dragon just 'broke wind'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three took a step back, Blast being the one to speak up, \"What're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar stomps his large foot, \"I'm trying to change back! What do ya think I'm doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona speaks up, \"Well, I never said it would be so easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're trying too hard,\" suggested Nine. \"Try to relax a bit more. You might change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar thought his foxy girl had a point. He did feel a sense of tension ever since he transformed. Char closed his eyes again and took a deep breath. He could feel the heat in his muscles cooling. Suddenly, he felt his heart drop from his mighty chest. When he opened his eyes, Char saw his arms had no wings, his tail was its regular shape, and his back wings didn't look ragged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Char exclaimed.  \"I'm back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast was happy to see his bro back to normal again. \"Okay, Blast,\" said Char, \"You try now.\" Blast shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he closed his eyes to concentrate. He let himself relax, feeling the overwhelming heat slowly draining from his body. He felt a suddeny shift in balance and he could feel the weight on his back getting lighter as his heart slowed down to a normal pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpened his eyes slowly, he was glad to see he no longer had cannons attached to his arms and he  looked up, noticing the large cannone that was on top of his shell was gone too, replaced by the familiar two on each shoulder. \"that is much better, never thought I'd miss this shell of mine.\" Char grasped Blasts's shoulder grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you'll miss it that much more when we change back, I want to see if we can do this whenever we want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? come on Char we just changed back, why do we have to go mega again so soon?\" Blasts's complaint fell on deaf ears as Char took his stance and focused, thinking about his muscles bulging upwards, growing hotter and hotter, witht he intensity of a active volcano. He could feel his body shifting as the heat intensified, his body pushing out with more muscle and he slowly opened his eyes as the shifting stopped. Turning his arms back and forth he grinned excitedly at the wings now back on his wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar lifted his arm up and flexed his left bicep, watching it flood with wild power. \"Now this is something i can get used to.\"</span></div></div>",

He had to go mega one more time. Blast clenched his hand, closed his eyes, and held his breath.  He could feel his heart pounding harder and harder after each second. Instantly, he felt his is shape changing and growing more powerful. Blast opened his eyes to see cannons on his wrists again, a massive single cannon on his shell, and even bigger muscles on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast grinned and flexed playfully trying to squeeze as much power as he could into one bicep. \"This is so awesome!\" said Blast. Dragona looked mesmerized by her turtle boyfriend's power erupting right in front of her. Nine felt the same way about Char. The girls could see the muscle duo were bigger and stronger than ever before. Dragona and Nine had to see it for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona stepped forward to Blast. \"Umm...you...look great,\" uttered Dragona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast blushed making his blue cheeks a slight rosy red. \"Thanks, babe,\" replied Blast. \"You think so?\" Dragona places her hand againt Blast's pillow-like pecs and felt the warmth and power sleeping inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled. \"I know so!\" Nine stared at Char as he continued flexing his biceps, obviously putting on a small show for her. She couldn't help the firery red blush plastered on her cheeks as she reached out, giving one of char's biceps a big squeeze, but unable to push her fingers intot he rock hard muscle at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow.. you're muscles are amazing.\" Char grinned, feeling a bit hot cheeked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thanks!\" Char wrapped a meaty hand around Nine who yelped in surprise as he lifted her up and set her down on his bicep. \"hope you enjoy the ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ride? oh!\" Nine gasped in surprise and she grasp Char's shoulder as he steadily flexed and relaxed his bicep, letting her rise up and sink  as his bicep did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast and Dragona stare warmly at the two lovebirds, Char continuing with his arm curls and bicep lifts. Blast was also holding Dragona close in his muscular arms. The serpent could even feel her turtle's pecs rise in and out against her back. Blast speaks up, \"Those two sure seem to be having fun.\" The big turtle looks down at Dragona, \"Hey, would you...like if I gave that a shot...?\", Blast asks, with the squimish attitude he has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona quickly turns around so she was facing the big lug. She hugs him as best she could, \"No, it's okay. I like this just as much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast chuckles, bringing Dragona close as well. \"Well, if you say so.\" Blast suddenly tenses up his muscles all around Dragona, almost enough for her to be squished into all his bulk. \"Eh, this isn't what you meant, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragona chuckles in return. \"Oh you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Blast.\", the muscle turtle looks at his pal, \"Mind if I chat with ya for a sec?\" Char goes ahead and gently sets Nyne down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay.\" The two muscle mon then walk off far enough to be chatting on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two ladies stood beside each other, giving each other a confused look. After a moment of silence the two weight-lifters turn back, Blast having rosier cheeks than usual. Dragona grows a little worried. \"Oh boy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Char takes a big stomp forward with his pumped leg, \"Nyne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast does the same his pumped leg, mirroring his friend, \"Dragona!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn unison, the two tensed up their entire bodies as they raised their arms up with grace and perform the best double-bicep pose they could, sticking out their chests as best they could, \"We appreciate you THIS MUCH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNyne and Dragona stare a little awkwardly with open jaws, \"......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo was there boss. \"...Am I interrupting something?\"</span></div></div>",

You and Blast can meet me there whenever you're done with...\", he starts waving a hand, \"...this.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nDragona and Nyne look at each other, and then at the two studs. Their cheeks puffed up, and then they start laughing out loudly. Char and Blast stood side-by-side, their cheeks glowing a little red. Blast glances sternly at his broad friend, \"You and your bright ideas.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two ladies take their own leave out of the tent, Nyne looking back at them while Dragona was still laughing her head off, \"We'll see you two later.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChar and Blast wave awkwardly back, \"See ya...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe muscled turtle then balls his hand into a fist and wacks Char right on his noggin. \"OWWW!! What was that for!?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast folds his muscular arms over his broad chest, \"Oh you know why!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt was only a matter of minutes before they reached the captain's tent. Blast was still feeling fidgety after their event, Char trying his best to comfort his rather large friend. \"Come on, Blast! You gonna give me the cold shoulder now? 'Cause that's just weird coming from a dude.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast completely ignores his friend, \"Boss, you wanted to see us?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe boss nodded. \"Yes boys, please take a seat.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two did as they were told and the chairs squeaked slightly under their massive weight. \"What's up?\" asked Char.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, I was wondering if you two could do me a favor.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Of course!\" said Blast. \"We'll do anything!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well, I just looked at the tickets for our next show. We're going to have a small audience if we don't do some last minute advertising.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Did you have anything in mind, sir?\" asked Char.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I was thinking about spreading the word to the nearest town from here. It's about a half-hour drive from here. I was hoping my best strong men would use their muscle and charm to attract more people to see our last show.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast and Char smiled. They loved road trips. They used to take them all the time before they joined the circus. Road trips plus muscles equalled very happy big pokemon. \"We'll be happy to do it, sir!\" said Blast.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe boss sighed in relief and happiness. \"Great! Thank you so much you guys! I owe you one!\" Blast and Char walked out of the tent feeling excitement of their new assignment. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nChar pumped his arms swelling them till veins stretched from his shoulder to wrists. \"This is going to be so cool! I can't wait to go!\" Blast grabbed Char by the shoulder with a bigger smile on his face.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You okay, bro?\" asked Char.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I just had a great idea to ad for the circus while we're there!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We'll give em a gun show like we always do!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No, I mean more than that! I think I know how we can attract people even more!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChar raised an eyebrow and said, \"How?\" Blast grinned as he brought his arm up and flexed his bicep, letting the thick vein snake it's way across the muscle.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well I don't see why we can't have some fun while we help out the circus. We can advertise the circus and let some of the younger pokemon paint pictures of the circus on our bodies if they wanted.\" Char reached back and scratched the back of his head as he thought it over.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Painting on our bodies? can we still show off our guns?\" Blast laughed before flexing his bicep even harder, pushing out his veins even further as it made it's way all the way up to his shoulder.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What kind of performers would we be if we didn't show off our talents?\" Char grinned as he wrapped his hand around Blast's bicep giving it a firm squeeze, feeling the solid muscle beneath.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Great! I can't wait to get started.\"</span></div></div>",

After they reached their destination, Blast got the facepaint while Char got the table to set out for the face paint cirucs ad. Char grunted pulling the table out of the minivan and lifted it over his head.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"How come I got stuck with the heavy lifting?\" huffed Char.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Come on, bro,\" said Blast. \"It's not that bad. Think of it as a warm up for the main event!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast and Char set the table on a random sidewalk of the city and set a poster advertising for the circus. They were already getting stares from people walking by because of their giant sizes. After they were done, Blast and Char took a seat next to their table ready to spread the word of the circus.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA few shouts and poses from Blast and Char caught some people's attention but not enough to stop and get tickets for the circus. Char sighed. \"I don't know if this is working bro. Most of the guys here think we're a couple of weirdos!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast patted Char's shoulder. \"Relax bro. We've only been at this for about an hour. Just be a bit more patient. We'll get more people for the show. I promise! Let's just keep doing on what we do best!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe two continued their posing, mainly just flexing their muscles than shouting. Char didn't even seem much into it as his friend here, just flexing certain parts without much interest. \"Hm?\" The enlarged dragon barely notices a small pokemon standing before him. A buneary at that. \"Well, hi there little guy!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe lone buneary just stares brightly at Char. He wasn't excited, but he wasn't scared either. \"There you are...\" The two muscled pokemon look up behind the little one, noticing a tall lopunny walk up behind her youngan. She puts her hands on her hips, \"I can't walk ten feet without you walking off on your own, can I.\" She looks up at the muscular duo, \"Oh, hello. Guess he walked up to you guys, huh.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChar struts himself up a bit, \"Yup. Sure did.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe lopunny picks up her yougan, \"What exactly is going on here?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We're actually from out of town, here to entice new customers to come check out our circus.\", Blast explains happily.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Oh.\", the lopunny replies. \"So, are you guys like, performers from there?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yup! We sure are!\", Char replies excitedly. He elbows his pal, and they both flex a fine side chest pose, \"Me and my friend are known as the 'strongmen' of the group.\" They even gave her a wink.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe lopunny chuckles softly. \"Wow. Sounds interesting. I think I might be interested.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nBlast holds up a thin paintbrush, \"Here, would you like to let your kid draw on us?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"I-hi'm sorry?\", she chuckled.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yay! Drawing!\", her child yelps.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"We're also doing this thing where we let kids draw on us for fun.\", Char adds. \"How 'bout it?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe buneary starts air clenching for the brush in the lopunny's arms, \"Well...if you want to.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe sets her youngan down, \"Yay!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know, it's funny.\" Char and Blast turn their gaze to her. \"Normally my young would be afraid of burly pokemon like you. And you two are the biggest I've seen yet. Guess you two must have a lot of experience with kids.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well sure!\", Blast replies, handing the buneary his brush.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nChar and Blast flex one bulging arm beside the other, \"We're a child-friendly circus!\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Well that's good.\", the lopunny replies happily. \"'Cause this town is full of them.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Are there a lot of adults like you too?\", Char winks, only to get wacked by Blast in return, \"Ow!\" Char rubbed his arm where blast had struck him and shot him a small frown.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"what was that for?\" Blast only crosses his arms in response.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You know why. don't flirt with every woman you see.\" Char blew out a puff of smoke from his nostrils as he nodded his head  before the smile came back.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Hey I can't help it, I see a pretty woman and I  can't help complimenting her\" This earned him a smile from the Lopunny. Blast rolled his eyes, but a smile played at his lips as he simply shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright you big ham then you get to be painted on first.\" Char smiled as he nodded his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay. It's only fair i guess.\" Blast slowly lowered down onto one knee as he handed the buneary the small plastic containers of paint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can draw whatever you want.\" The buneary was practically hopping with excitement as Char squatted down and smiled, flexing his bicep, letting the pokemon's eyes go wide with excitement. As he dipped the brush into some blue paint Char did he best to hold still. The paint felt cool against his skin and a small laugh bubbled up. \"Man that is some cold paint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a couple minutes for the small kid to finish before he handed the brush back to blast. As Char stood up he twisted his arm around to admire his new 'tattoo.' In a cool deep blue paint was a small smiley face that looked like a pikachu's face. \"Nice! you're a great artist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buneary cheers a little for himself, his mother laughing a bit in return. She picks up her little one, \"You did a great job.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar holds out a small flier to her. \"Glad your kid had fun.\" He flexes a bulging arm of his own, \"There'll be more of this if you and him both would like to come to our circus.\" Blast nudges Char on his side a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lopunny takes the flier. \"I'll have to think about it now. See you soon.\" The lopunny walks off on her way, Char and Blast watching as their first customer walks away with her child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast hears a sniffle come from his pal. \"You okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChar wipes his eye. \"Brings tears to my eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That her kid had fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I just wish I could be that kid, being picked up by such a fine lady.\" Blast sticks his large, tensing arm out, ready to pulverize his friend. Char shields himself, \"I'm kidding!!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Char had an X-shaped bandage on the back of his head. Although it hurt like the dickens, he had to ignore it because their first customers actually attracted a lot of attention. Mothers and fathers from all around were starting to crowd their spot a bit. It was a little overwhelming, but nothing would be too overwhelming for the two bodybuilders anymore. \"Wow. This is a hefty crowd.\", Char remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, this sure to boost our ratings.\", Blast adds. \"Remember Char, I'm watching you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for pete's sake! Fine, why don't I let the fathers with their kid, and you the mothers with theirs.\", Char assures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast smirks, \"Heh. I knew you'd play right into my trap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?!\", Char yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlast sticks his tongue out playfully, \"Kidding. Hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMultiple children were picking up paintbrushes and slowly approached Blast and Char. One little Meril child approched Blast painting a rainbow on his left pec while a Cubone painted a small peace sign on a free space of Char's bicep. So far it seemed Blast and Char were doing pretty at advertising for the circus. They were also having some fun along the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their muscular bodies became more covered in paint, Blast and Char flexed slightly to themselves and saw how the paint stretched and rippled with each flex. Blast and Char looked at each other and winked. It was time to show the crowd a sneak preview of their circus show. After the last child was done painting, the duo stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Char, \"Thank you so much for all your support today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please allow us to show you what you'll see at the circus if you decide to come!\" said Blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea! You won't See anything like this anywhere else!\" Char grinned as he stood tall, his wings twitching in excitement. As  the last kid backed up and went back to his parents Char raised both arms up until his hands, now curled into fists, rested in the air near his head. As he took in a deep breath ne clenched his fists tightly and flexed. A sudden wave of awe spread over the crown as Char's biceps inflated to their maximum peaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on each great hill of muscle squirmed crisscrossing veins  that snaked their way upto his shoulders. The way his biceps bulged stretched out every painting, making them bigger and much more pronounced. Several kids were point out at their pictures on Chars biceps as they expanded and grew more and more visible. Blast nodded his head in approval as he took a couple steps away from his friend and tensed his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath Blast clenched his fists together as he held them a few inches away from his abs. As he flexed, he clenched his stomach muscles as well. A wave of gasps broke through the eager silence as Blast's biceps exploded with power. Each one turning into a squirming mass of massive muscles. The veins snaked their way from his  biceps down to his hands. As he moved his  arms away from his abs he showed off his rock solid Eight pack abs. Each one looked like they had been etched into stone. The only thing moving was the visibly protruding veings that snaked their way over each ridge of muscle and arch their way up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to see more of this performance, come see us at the circus, we have games, popcorn, cotton candy and of course the full range of talented pokemon who put it all together.\" Char and Blast each took in a deep breath as each one did their best to flex as hard as they could, pushing their muscles to their peak of physical perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We hope to see you there!\" A loud wave of cheering erupted from the gathered people as all the various pokemon admired their strength, the way they uphold each muscle to the best of their abilities. A short while later after the crowd had begun dispersing Blast gave Char a big smile as he  draped a meaty arm over his friend's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think we drummed up enough interest for the circus?\" Char nodded his head, a wide grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd definitely think so. Now how we get on back, might be fun to show off all our new tattoos to the others. I bet our girls will love them.\" Blast gave a big heart laugh as he squeezed his friend in a shoulder hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet they will.\"</span></div></div>",
