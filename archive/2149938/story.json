Since six months to the day, he's worked his butt off to prove he belonged in Beacon. He's trained heavily with his partner Pyrrha everyday, he's studied as hard as he could, and even saved his former tormentor Cardin from an Ursa!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he's recently hit a wall. The past week, he's averaged C's and B's in Grimm Studies and Dust Mixing. He even won a match against one of the lower tier members of teams in Combat Class. But he's still called a dunce, dealing with the whispers of dragging his prodigal partner Pyrrha and other teammates Ren and Nora down with him. Even if Cardin stopped bullying him, the others jeer at him for being weak. Saying he'll never amount to anything more than a warm body on the field, a mediocre hunter at best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune slammed a fist into a hard wall in frustration ... only to shake his hand as the pain reached his brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! OW! OW! Man that hurts...\" he said while cradling his bruised wrist, his Aura slow to heal it due to Combat Class having eaten away most of it earlier in the day. \"I wish there was a way for me to get stronger faster. I don't care what it takes, but I need to be the leader my team needs me to be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his resolve tighten, Jaune went to the ______ to look for ways to get stronger.</span></div></div>",

He needed to get better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe might have been able to handle the lower tier members of their class, but when it came to people like Ruby, Yang, Ren, Nora, or Pyrrha he was going to loose singlehandedly. He wasn't even a proper warm-up for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that there were times where he needed to correct himself on his stance and how he handled his shield and sword, especially during a fight. The more he practiced the easier it would be for his body to it naturally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe entered the training room and saw a few students already there training as well. He went to the nearest open section. The moment he entered the room he set the difficulty. It started off simple with him being able to easily best his enemies, but as his training progressed the 'enemies' got harder and harder for him to deal with. Soon it got to the point where his enemies were able to best him without much trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough,\" Jaune sighed to the room. The robots in the room stopped.
