No character death, random crossovers with other series, or other extreme variation from canon material (within reason, seeing as how this is a WG fic, after all)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.

Keep your grammar and spelling clean. I may do minor editing on entries to fix small errors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Nothing explicitly pornographic in nature. Het/homo romance is acceptable, but keep the smut limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, let us begin...</td>",
