I'll go with fourteen.\" Takato said trying again, \"I wish I was a fourteen year old girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digivice flashed as it came to life. The first thing Takato noticed was his body feeling tingly. Then the full feeling hit him. He grew over a foot taller, developed curves as his waist narrowed and hips widened along with his thighs. His butt puffed out and rounded as what made him a boy retracted into his body and rearranged into that of a girl. <i>\"This feels weird!\"</i> Takato thought as he felt what use to be his testicles become ovaries. His, now her, breasts then budded before slowly growing larger up to a small B-cup chest. Her nails on her hands and feet were well groomed as her hair grew out, all the way down to the back of her knees. Her crimson eyes became larger as her entire face shaped up to be more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. Where Takato once stood, now stood a fourteen year old girl in very small closes. \"Man these are tight...\" Takato wheeze as she looked down at her skin tight everything. Doing the only thing she could do, she took off the clothes until she was completely naked. Takato then walked over to a mirror and looked at herself, \"So this is what girls will look like in two years huh?\" Takato reached up to touch one of her breasts, she instantly pulled away as soon as she did while shivering. \"Note to self, touching a girl's boobs make them feel good.\" Takato said before looking around the room, \"I can't wear anything here... But I can fix that!\" Takato said as she held up her now pink digivice, \"I wish that everyone knew me as Takato's fourteen year old cousin, Toko, who came to visit as a local exchange while Takato went to visit my parents out in the country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digivice flashed again, and in front of Takato appeared two duffle bags. \"Two?\" Takato asked as she dug unto one. One was filled to the brim with plane clothes and the other filled with all kinds of jewerly, make-up, and shoes. \"Do girls really have all this?\" Takato asked as she dug through the bag, \"I don't even know how to wear these.\" Takato said holding on a high heeled sandal. \"Oh I know!\" Takato said as she looked at her digivice. It hadn't failed yet, why now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could think like a girl.\" The digivice responded by asking, \"Why kind of girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know this one! One of those older guys from the high-school said this before!\" Takato said with a smile</span></div></div>",

He blinked as they gave a slight glow for a second before returning to normal. \"Man what a headache...\" She said as she walked back over to her duffel bag. She dug around before pulling out something wrapped in plastic, \"So I have to stick this... inside here?\" Takato mumbled as she looked down at her womanhood. She knew how to do it thanks to her wish, but the prospect of it was still a little... unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato took a breath and braced herself for what she had to do. Opening the wrapper, she followed her knowledge and plugged the tampon into her vagina. \"Man that feels weird... Maybe I'll try pads next...\" Takato whispered before looking at what else to wear, \"A bra and panties.... What color? Well I suppose that doesn't matter since a boy won't see them.\" Takato said before giving off a slightly perverted giggle before realizing what she said, \"Wait did I say boy? Well I did wish to think like a girl... But I still find girls attractive too. Man this is confusing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato decided to push the thoughts out of her head and put on the bra and panties she was holding, which were the same blue as her too small of a sweater. She then looked at the rest of her clothes, \"So... Do I dress plain or girly? On the upside I'll be familiar with my clothes and comfortable. But on the other... I did make this wish to try a girl's life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould she?</span></div></div>",

Another, more powerful shock came out of it next, and traveled through Takato's body, making changes along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe first noticed that the room seemed to shrink a little bit as his height shrank to match Jeri's, and next that his body seemed to become all around more slender. Holding up his other hand, he noticed that it thinned out some, as his overall structure changed to fit a female. After a moment, he bent over and sat on the ground, feeling an intense pulling sensation from below his waist, as something slipped up into him and biologically made him a girl. He felt his waist constrict in a bit as his hips popped out, and then looked down to inside his sweatshirt and blushed as two small points developed forward in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking it was over, Takato stood back up again, wobbling some as he got used to his new center of balance. But he then felt a huge discomfort in his face, as he closed his eyes and felt it change all over, turning into a perfect copy of Jeri's. His hair then rushed forward and down his shoulders, turning a brownish red along the way. Opening his eyes back up again, he looked at his reflection in the small glass of the Digivice, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing, he looked down at the ground, and spoke aloud in his new voice, not truly believing what just occured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've become Jeri's twin...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The first thing Takato noticed was his body feeling tingly. Then the full feeling hit him. He grew over a foot and a half taller, developed curves as his waist narrowed and hips widened along with his thighs. His butt puffed out and rounded as what made him a boy retracted into his body and rearranged into that of a girl.  \"This feels weird!\" Takato thought as he felt what use to be his testicles become ovaries. His, now her, breasts then budded before slowly growing larger up to a nice Mid C-cup chest. Her nails on her hands and feet were well groomed as her hair grew out, all the way down to the back of her knees. Her crimson eyes became larger as her entire face shaped up to be more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just like that, it was over. Where Takato once stood, now stood a hot 16 year old girl in very small closes. \"Man these are tight...\" Takato wheeze as she looked down at her skin tight everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe or rather she rushed home very quickly then snuck into her room then...</span></div></div>",

Takato then walked over to a mirror and looked at herself, \"So this is what girls will look like in a few years huh?\" Takato reached up to touch one of her breasts, she instantly pulled away as soon as she did while shivering. \"Note to self, touching a girl's boobs makes them feel good.\" Takato said before looking around the room, \"I can't wear anything here... But I can fix that!\" Takato said as she held up her now pink digivice, \"I wish that everyone knew me as Takato's 16 year old cousin, Toko, who came to visit as an exchange student while Takato went to visit my parents out in the country!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe digivice flashed again, and in front of Takato appeared two duffle bags. \"Two?\" Takato asked as she dug unto one. One was filled to the brim with plane clothes and the other filled with all kinds of jewerly, make-up, and shoes. \"Do girls really have all this?\" Takato asked as she dug through the bag, \"I don't even know how to wear these.\" Takato said holding on a high heeled sandal. \"Oh I know!\" Takato said as she looked at her digivice. It hadn't failed yet, why now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I could think like a girl.\" The digivice responded by asking, \"What kind of girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Girly Girl I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato's digivice acted different this time, shooting a beam into Takato's eyes. He blinked as they gave a slight glow for a second before returning to normal. \"Man what a headache...\" She said as she walked back over to her duffel bag. She dug around before pulling out something wrapped in plastic, \"So I have to stick this... inside here?\" Takato mumbled as she looked down at her womanhood. She knew how to do it thanks to her wish, but the prospect of it was still a little... unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato took a breath and braced herself for what she had to do. Opening the wrapper, she followed her knowledge and plugged the tampon into her vagina. \"Man that feels weird... Maybe I'll try pads next...\" Takato whispered before looking at what else to wear, \"A bra and panties.... What color? Well I suppose that doesn't matter since a boy won't see them.\" Takato said before giving off a slightly perverted giggle before realizing what she said, \"Wait did I say boy? Well I did wish to think like a girl... But I still find girls attractive too. Man this is confusing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato decided to push the thoughts out of her head and put on the bra and panties she was holding, which were the same blue as her too small of a sweater. She then looked at the rest of her clothes, \"So... Do I dress plain or girly? On the upside I'll be familiar with my clothes and comfortable. But on the other... I did make this wish to try a girl's life...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I know this one! One of those older guys from the high-school said this before!\" Takato said with a smile<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Digivice then spoke \"The Wishing committee regrets to inform you that you have used up all of the wishing energy, and reserve energy is being used to grant your ongoing 1st wish\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What 1st Wish\" she asks while deciding what to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will see\" came a sly response from the Digivice. \"In the meantime you must wait 1 Year till you can make more wishes\" added the Digivice.</span></div></div>",

The owner are free to edit in case something is wrong.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato couldn't believed. Several moments ago he was a nornal boy, now he's a digimon. Laying down at the ground with his belly facing up, he looks like a completely normal Guilmon.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nBut everything are mixed up. He still feels his head-now-tail as his head, his arms-legs as his arms, his legs-arms as his legs and so on. This wierd digivice changed him completely upside-down!&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nHe could only imagine how is his appearance because with the loss of his vision, he discovered he could only hear throught his bat-like ears, even if his yellowish eyes are completely open and with a dull stare.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato started to panic. His head-tail thumbed a few times on the ground and his hands-feet started to rub themselves, apphrehensives. &lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"What I am gonna do now?\", spoke Takato. \"Spoke\" in a meaning of tried to speak, sending a mental message to his now vanished mouth but without sound. Takato noticed this and freaked out even more.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Oh, jeez.\" tried him again. \"What I am gonna do? I'm a Digimon now but a freaking mixed up Digimon! Everything feels so wierd...\" murmured Takato while rubbing his knees-elbows in themselves.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato look to his hands-feet in front of his face. Again, completely forgot he has no vision, he instictely rised up his hands-foot to his face-now-butt in a tempt to look at them. He sighted.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Okey, it's not time for panic. Maybe I should at least 'see' how I am now\" said Takato. After finishing saying, he moved his hands-foot to his face. He felt the smooth scales, the warm surface heated his toes while he discovered his new face. Takato slightely touched his features because of the new sensitive the scales became in this area. He could feel the strong muscles through the scales while touching his chest-pelvis, biceps-thighs and head-tail. He discovered he still have the goggles on. He also feels his yellow wristbands in his wrists-ankles.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nShruggling his shoulders-thighs, he went further down. His new belly are more pronounced, with the big hayzard signal in the center. At this part of his body are more soft and sensitive as well. He even started to feel flushered while playing with it.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato moaned. Or \"felt\" like moaning. He got startled and stop touching it.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato felt more comfortable now after \"exploring\" his new body, as now he got more acquainted to it.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should try standing\", thought Takato.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato then starts to slow process of standing up. In his old way.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nHe rolls up to his side. Using his hans-foot and foot-hand he tried to stand the first level, which is laying down on his belly and slowly getting balance to support his body while using his elbows-knees and knees-elbows to lift his body. In the process he lifted up his head-tail and his new head above his body.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato blinked. Or \"tried\" to blink.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Uh, didn't knew I could move my new head.\" He conjectured. He use his neck muscles to try out his new appendace, moving it up and down. He giggled a little. The sensations are so wierd...&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Okey stop it. I need to focus now\". He's right. The next steps will not be so ease.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\nTakato then prepared himself. While positionating his hands-feet on the ground he lauched himself up until rest his weight  on his legs-arms, his new head now touching it's chin on the ground like a tail. He tried to levarage his arms-legs to find a balance on his center.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Right right. Now I need only to stand up now\" said to himself. Now like a completely normal person (or Digimon) he slowly steadly stands up almost to a complete full height; however he's standing up completely upside-down!&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Damn'it\" said Takato. He's getting dificulty to keep standing because his weight are distributed completely in different places. It's almost if all his weight is centered in his chest-pelvis/belly. Even his head-tail are not cooperating. Being a long appendage bending in every direction it's dificult to keep balance like that so his body slightly bends forward with his arms-legs flapping around. And to complete, his legs-arms are giving up because it's too much for such not designed limbs to support all this weight.&lt;br&gt;<br>\r\n\"Uck, great.\", growled Takato. \"What else could possibly happens now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Because of the fright, he his members wobble around, his center of gravity collapsed and in a blink, he smashes his face/butt on the ground giving a very hard kiss to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato cursed with all his soul in his mind, due to the strong pain he is feeling because his now butt/face are pretty much sensitive than before. Instictinvely Takato wanted to compress his face but because he's back to square one except his belly is facing down, he couldn't reach it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"HAHAHAHA! That was the most stupid thing I ever seen!\"</i>, said the voice again. Takato freeze; he recognize this voice. His stomach dropped. <i>\"Only a dumb digimon with pineapple juice instead of a brain in place could possibly do that! Which in case IT'S YOU! HAHAHAHAHA!\"</i>, said it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's no doubt. It's IMPMON!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato didn't notice but Impmon is laughing his ass off on a dumpster He looks like a small humanoid purple imp creature with a tail and large pointed ears. Wearing a pair of red gloves and a matching red bandanna, he also have a smirking emoji in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Impmon! Impmon, you got to help me! I--</i>, shouted Takato. He tried to move but forgot not only his body are completely messed up, he can't speak without a mouth! While Takato trashes around, he heard a couple of crashes followed by footsteps; Impmon probably jumped out of something before start walking. That's what he guessed; without eyes, he can't see anything from his current place. But with his batwing ears, he can be sure that the footsteps are getting closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato yelped in his mind. He felt he got slapped through his butt/muzzle by Impmon, completely by surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be dummer as I though, pineapple head!<br>\r\nHahaha\", Impmon laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato blinked in his mind. <i>He thinks I'm Guilmon</i>, conjectured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who could thought that I would face pineapple head trying handstands in the middle of an dirty alley! What are you trying to do? Bearing pineapples? HAHAHAHAHA\", laughed Impmon, this time really hard while slapping his butt/muzzle one more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, god</i>, now it felt on Takato. He didn't realize that throught the eyes of others he was handstanding, instead of standing. <i>This is so embarassing...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato gasped again, yelping. He got slapped on his butt/muzzle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Decided to take a nap, sleepyhead? Or are you just pretending? Hehehe. Well enough of jokes for now, pineapple head. That was fun but I was just passing by before seeing your little show. Now see'ya!\" Said Impmon while Takato heard him contouring around his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>NO! Impmon, WAIT--</i>, shouted Takato in vain. Again he forgot he has no mouth but he's desperated. He's completely helpless in this messed up digimon body, he have no one get help and no idea about how to get his body back. He trashed around very hard, resulting in startle Impmon a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, wow, take ease, pineapple head. I--\" Impmon started but stopped abruptly. <i>what? What?! Impmon, what happened?!</i>, said Takato. His blunted silent preoccupied him but at nowhere, Impmon started laughing; really REALLY hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHA! OH MY GOD SERIOUSLY?! Isn't that goggleshead's in your tail?! And his wristbands in your ankles?! What did you tried to do?<br>\r\nWhat ever was, you missed REALLY HARD! HAHAHAHAHA!\" Takato heards a dull thump and sense some moviment close at his face/butt. Impmon is rolling on the ground, gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato wanted to cry; cry out and shout in embarrassment but he can't. He can just be still, facing to the ground, wishing for being back to his old body; to being out of this messed up body; and for Impmon to <i>STOP LAUGHING</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impmon? Is that you? What's so funny about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato perked his batwings like ears. Impmon tried to stop laughing to see where the new voice come from. But this voice was nothing new for Takato. Takato knows that voice very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... huh? Pineapple head?\" Said Impmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the exactly same appearance as Takato, joining in the alley with the other two digimons is Guilmon, a red dragon-like Reptile Digimon with yellow eyes, wing-like ears, a long and strong tail, and carries the black Digital Hazard symbol on his chest; the only differences are the goggles and the wristbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpmon looked back to Takato and Guilmon a couple of times, slightly confused. But quickly changed his face with a smirk. Impmon look at Guilmon pointing his finger at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good prank, pineapple head. Don't know where did you find this other digimon but just finding one exactly the same as you I take ou the hat for you.\" Said Impmon, standing up while taking out the dust of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon tilted his head to the side, obviously confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, Impmon? I never seen this digimon before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Questioned Impmon. \"You don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon got closer to Takato. He sniffed at him a couple of times. He Didn't even move, completely devastated. Hopeless to get out of his situation. And he thought it would be \"fun\" to be a Guilmon. Now it's turning in a complete nightmare. He never wanted to cry so much before than now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon bruptely perked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He smells like Takato!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\", shouted Impmon in desbelieve. \"Are you crazy, pineapple head?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Takato's time to perked out. Is there still hope? Guilmon recognized him by his smell. He knows it's him! Since the beggining of this crazy transformation, Takato never felt so happy. He now is safe. He now  have a change to get his body back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...</span></div></div>",

Then his butt/head's nostrils inhaling air into his lungs. <i>By their own.</i><br>\r\n<i>\"HNNF!\"</i>, groaned Takato. Suddenly he felt his legs/arms moved, pushing against the ground, lifting up his chubby body, his face/butt now being pressured harder against it.<br>\r\nTakato also heard some gasps; Guilmon and Impmon got startled by your sudden movements. <br>\r\n<i>\"W-what's happening?!\"</i>, the upside-down transformed child thought.<br>\r\nHis butt/head coughed; it shook right and left like trying to flick out something in it; it opens its eyes; <i>it blinks.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe New Guilmon finally awakes. He felt like he just woke up from the longest nap of his life. Although, he's also extremely confused. Blinking a bit, he looks to the two Digimons in front of him, looking back at him a bit frowned. He moves his head around, capturing all his surroundings with his yellow reptilian eyes, becoming more confused each second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis focus on his surrounding got snapped by his belly starting to itch. He scratched it and felt the dirt and little pieces of rubble on it; it also feels a bit scratched. <i>Did rolled around while I slept?</i>, he thought. Anyway, he tried to clean a bit by using his hands but it made him notice the yellow wristbands in his ankles. He tilts his head while frowning. <i>\"What are these?\"</i>, he thought. <i>\"I never wore these before. I mean...\"</i>.<br>\r\nHe paused. <i>\"I... I can't remember\".</i><br>\r\nHe looks at them once more, the bright yellow wristbands on his ankles. He lifts them, sniffing a bit. His bat-like ears flicked, surprised and more confused. It smells like.... <i>him?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpmon and Guilmon watched the new Digimon's actions in silence. Impmon looks up and down at this Digimon. It's behavior sure looks like it's not a prank made by Guilmon's. <i>\"It's far too clever for pineapple's head\"</i>, thought Impmon, smirking about his own cleverness.<br>\r\nBut the mystery still remains: he still doesn't know why there's an another Digimon, even so, an <i>another Guilmon</i> in the middle of Tokyo with no stinky human whatsoever and most important...<br>\r\n<i>\"... Why he's using googlehead's wearings wrong?\"</i>, he pondered, his hand under his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of which...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato was <i>horrified.</i> He can't move. This whole time he tried to move his arms. His legs, toes, finger claws, lungs, his batwings-like ears, even his <i>TAIL</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>He lost control of EVERYTHING.</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's this?! What's happening?! Why I can't move?! My... my body... it's moving by its own!!\"</i>, thought the panicked child. He also lost his eyesight connected to his butt/head eyes, although he still can hear by his bat-wings like ears, however his touch... it felt like it was... reduced.<br>\r\n<i>\"I-I... can't feel my body...?!\"</i>, he thought, hesitantly. He's wrong. He actually <i>can</i> feel something: his face/butt pressed hard against the concrete due to his weight.<br>\r\nHe felt flustered. That's all he can feel at the moment and seems it became sensitive almost ten folds. He also feels warm, probably due the sun that warmed the ground... <i>or maybe by <b>him</b>?</i><br>\r\nHe also felt the pressure's adjustments of his face/butt against the ground due to his body moving around. He grunts and gasps every time it happens, making him flustered due to a strange feeling running through his current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs it... <i>pleasure?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato tries to shook his head mentally, to flick these pesty thoughts out of his mind, feeling deeply embarrassed about himself.<br>\r\nBut they keep coming back, distracting Takato to ponder about what he's going to do now...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Meanwhile...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Guilmon dropped his ankles to the ground, now directing his focus to the Digimons in front of him. The smallest one looks up and down at him hard, making him feel a bit uncomfortable, his ears dropping a bit. Did he do something wrong? How so? He just woke up and doesn't know him. <i>Does he?</i> Again, he can't remember. He doesn't remember about anything before he slept, like... he just born?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his line of thought got cut by the smallest one. He lifts his finger and points at him but after he inhales to try to say something, New Guilmon got startled by the bigger one, the big red lizard moving closer, his tail wagging cheerfully and shouting a greeting at his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HI! I'm Guilmon!\", shouts Guilmon, getting so close that both muzzles almost touch each other. New Guilmon leans back a bit, a little nervous. \" I never saw you here before! Have you come from the Digital World? No? So did you hatched from an egg? But you are a Guilmon like me, not a Gigimon. How did you get this much data to digivolve? Oh yeah, where's your tamer? Is he around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions and New Guilmon couldn't even answer the first three. He shifts uncomfortably (which brings pleasure feelings to Takato, distracting him more), opening and closing his mouth by each new question. Still, Guilmon barfs more non-stop. \"Maybe he went to bring bread. Guilmon likes bread. Do you like bread? and play? Would you like to play with Guilmon? What's\u2014\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, wow, wow...!!\", interrupts Impmon by stepping in between the two. He pushes away Guilmon hard from the New but due to his minuscule stature, it was a light push for Guilmon. You could almost see him poofs out smokes on his head. He points out his finger into Guilmon's muzzle, comically pressing it deep.<br>\r\n\"Back off, Pineapple head! I found him first so he's <b><i>MINE</i></b> to do whatever I want, as likely questioning!\", spit out Impmon, like stating a logical fact. Actually more likely emotional and <i>definitely</i> not a fact. He actually didn't like to be interrupted, even more by a dumb Digimon like Pineapple head, and also not being the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh Impmon, I'm not sure this's how things works\u2014\", pointed out Guilmon but Impmon pressed harder on his muzzle before swiping roughly on it. \"Ouch!\"<br>\r\n\"Shaddap, Pineapple head!\", barked Impmon once more. \"Your questions were lame anyway. You need to ask the <b><i>REAL</i></b> questions! So...\"<br>\r\nImpmon adjusts his tone by coughing a bit on his hand. He now turns around and stares hard on New Guilmon.<br>\r\nHe uses the same pressing-muzzle technique now against him. \"Now, here are the first questions, Pineapple head N\u00ba2.\". He retracts his finger out of New's muzzle.<br>\r\nNew Guilmon gulps a bit hard. <i>\"Great, more questions\"</i>, thought New Guilmon, tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n\"Uhm... I'm Guilmon...?\". True, he's a Guilmon in fact. At least, it's something he definitely knows.<br>\r\n\"Good. Where's your tamer?\"<br>\r\n\"Well... Uhm... I... don't know...?\". Also true. He doesn't even know <i>why</i> he's here from the beginning with. Also <i>what's a <b>\"tamer\"</b>, anyway?</i><br>\r\n\"Great. That's enough for me.\" stated Impmon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Impmon\u2014\" pointed out Guilmon again but likewise, Impmons interrupts.<br>\r\n\"Silence, Pineapple head! He doesn't have a tamer so he's <i>'untamed'</i> until someone claims him. So...\"<br>\r\nSuddenly Impmon dashes. New Guilmon got startled by it because Impmon started to climb on his body, reaching to his head, where he sat promptly on his nape, his legs dangling between New Guilmon's shoulders, like a parent piggybacking his child. \"... I'm claiming him MYSELF!\" concluded Impmon, smirking broadly.<br>\r\nOh boy, Impmons is feeling so proud by his cleverness. He realized that by becoming a Tamer, he'll get rip of his two Tamers brats, Ai and Mako, that impeded him to digivolve,  and also he won't need Caturamon's offer either. <i>Why, he won't even <b>NEED</b> to digivolve anymore.</i> His own Digimon will do this job from now in. <i>He's killing not two but <b>THREE</b> birds with a single stone.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\", imposes Impmon, then pulls New Guilmon's bat-wing like ears roughly like trying to use them as horse lines. \"What are you waiting for, servant?!\", shouted Impmon at his ears, making them ring. \"GET UP\u2014\", he tried to say but got interrupted by New Guilmon that got startled by his shout, making him snap out of it and abruptly trying to stand up fast. Well fast enough to Impmon not predict his sudden obedience, unbalancing him out of New Guilmon's shoulders. Impmon falls, rolling on New's back way to his tail's tip and splat out on the ground.<br>\r\n\"Ops, uhh... Sorry, huh, Impmon...?\", apologizes New Guilmon, looking over his shoulder, a bit worried. He wipes the dirt and pieces of rumble again, now under his butt. Strangely, he left out a low moan, his cheeks getting redder than normal, getting startled by what he just did. Did his butt feel way more sensitive than normal? He keeps cleaning it, closing his eyes a bit while purring, enjoying these feelings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Speaking of feelings...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato was in haze. These feeling were so alien, yet so good that most of the time he wasn't aware of what they were talking. and it worsens by Impmon's weight addition, making Takato press against the ground and his Guilmon's body shifts even harder, multiplying these sensations. <i>\"Uhh, why this feels gooood...\"</i>, thought Takato, in a trance. Although, likewise New Guilmon, he also got startled but about a different motive and time. Suddenly his not feeling the ground in his face anymore. He got lifted so fast that he almost felt that sinking feeling when he finally stops midair. A blind light stinks his eyes after what felt like hours being in the darkness. Wait, <i>eyes?</i><br>\r\nYes. Takato's seeing. He's seeing Impmon laying on his belly on the ground, clearly pissed. his shattered pieces of clothes, <i>everything.</i> Although something feels weird about his eyesight.<br>\r\n\"Wait. Since when I was this small?...\", pondered Takato. It seems he's seeing nothing higher than two-foot height above the ground. He also has the sight of his tail, right above his head. <i>Oh oh...</i><br>\r\n\"Oh, no...\", he dreads. Takato has forgotten.<br>\r\nSuddenly, two red paws with claws appear on his sight, without time to knowledge them properly, they go right on his face, groping and wiping it. What would appear to be light touches, for Takato it felt like he was being groped, fondled, and grabbed HARD. He felt like so plump and firm, which made the sensations even more breathtaking. After the first touches, Takato fell right in trance again.</span></div></div>",

Although that was before he begins to hold Impmon from hitting New Guilmon, now bragging curses and yelling at him, pretty pissed about being dropped to the ground.<br>\r\n\"YOU DUMB LIZARD WITH PINEAPPLE JUICE INSTEAD OF A BRAIN!\". Boy, he sure has a mouth. New Guilmon has finished cleaning and now steps back a bit nervously due to Impmon's aggression. \"WATCH WHAT YOU ARE DOING WITH YOUR MASTER, YOU CLUMSY OVERSIZED GECKO!\". He hits the air with his arms, too short to reach their target. \"LET ME GO, PINEAPPLE HEAD!\", now directing his anger to Guilmon. Besides the trashing imp, Guilmon doesn't seem to lose his balance, either even moving by the tiny Digimon.<br>\r\n\"But Impmon, Guilmon is sorry. I-I mean, the other Guilmon is sorry. Don't be mean to him.\", said Guilmon.<br>\r\n\"Shaddap!\", barked Impmon. \"I'm his Tamer and he must be punished!\"<br>\r\n\"Impmon, you can't be his Tamer.\", insisted Guilmon. \"You don't even have a Digivice.\"<br>\r\nImpmon stopped abruptly. <i>A Digivice.</i> How he can be so <i>stupid?</i><br>\r\nHe looks around desperately. <i>\"It got to be nearby\"</i>, thought Impmon. \"PUT ME DOWN, PINEAPPLE HEAD!\", shouted Impmon, now trashing in Guilmon's arms with more vigour. Guilmon decided to let him go and Impmon lands with a \"thumb\". \"And help me find it!\", he complements. He stops. \"Wait. NO! Don't help me! I'll find it FIRST!\". Then he moves away, eyes on the ground. <br>\r\nGuilmon got so confused by all these commands at once that he just shook his head, like trying to shake out this confusion. He decided to forget about but Guilmon looked at the ground anyway. By doing it, he saw peculiar things. Blue and white ripped clothes. He also noticed grey pieces of cloth that looked like it were from a pair of pants and a torn pair of green and white snickers right beside it. They looked oddly familiar to Guilmon. He brings his nose to them and sniffs. His ears perks and eyes grow big. There's no doubt. <i>They're Takato's clothes.</i> Also, Guilmon noticed another thing he wasn't aware this whole time, even when they were waving in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe New Guilmon's ankles. They have yellow bands around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get these?\", asked Guilmon to New Guilmon, pointing at them.<br>\r\nNew Guilmon didn't understand what about them, so he kinda lifts one a bit from the ground, showing it to Guilmon.<br>\r\n\"These? Well... Uhm...\". New Guilmon tried to find a better answer instead of \"I don't know\" but before he could, Guilmon gave a loud growl that startles New Guilmon. He looks at him, now Guilmon was baring his teeth with anger eyes, reading his claws at him. New Guilmon whimpers, not understanding Guilmon's behaviour.<br>\r\n\"THOSE GOGGLES!\". Wait, googles? <i>What goggles?</i><br>\r\nThat's what New Guilmon thought, completely confused. Guilmon again roars at him. \"THESE ARE TAKATO'S GOGGLES!\", shouted Guilmon, pointing at his tail.<br>\r\nNew Guilmon looks at his tail right away. Indeed there's a black band with two yellow frames and lenses attached to it, at the base of his tail. Confused, New Guilmon don't have a clue of what is it and why it's so important to Guilmon to be so angry at him and obviously <i>why it's in his tail.</i><br>\r\nGuilmon shifts his tail angrily. Guilmon hasn't realized his aggressive behaviour towards this new Digimon but due to the torn clothes and sneakers on the ground, he can't think anything but that something bad had happened to Takato, and due to this Digimon has the same smells as his Tamer and using his gears, he's definitely have something to do with.<br>\r\nBlazes start to appear in his mouth. He looks like he's about to burst out a Fire Sphere. <br>\r\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO WITH TAKATO?!\", roared Guilmon, sounding like it'd be his last warning before he snaps.<br>\r\nNew Guilmon whimpered poorly, feeling completely defenceless. He tried to gather his words to build at least some simple response but he was so nervous that he just babbled incomprehensive sounds out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A different shout from another place spooked the two Digimons, both looking directly at the sound's origin. It was a roar, but a different kind. A triumph roar.<br>\r\nNot very far from them, Impmon was cheerfully jumping around, maniacally laughing. Soon after, he rises a shiny object above his head triumphantly, and there beholds a Digivice.<br>\r\nImpmon just stood there, with his arm up like he's waiting for something. Even both Guilmons were. But when nothing happened, he dropped his arm to take a better look at it. Its screen was black. Not wasting any time, he started to mess with it, pressing its buttons, trying to turn it on or something. He got impatient and started to shake it around, really pissed.<br>\r\n<i>\"WHY. THIS. PIECE. OF. JUNK. DOESN'T. TURN. <b>OOON!!</b>\"</i>, growled Impmon, thrashing it harder in each word he spoke.<br>\r\nGuilmon blinked and remembered about his soon-to-be battle with the other Digimon, but before he returned his gaze to him, an electronic sound broke the ambient. Looking back again, the Digivice has turned on and a robotic voice spoke.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Magical Digidevice Service. We will grant all your wishes for no cost at all.\". It adds. \"Please select your wish or speak it loud and clear.\"<br>\r\nBoth Guilmons become speechless. Guilmon as he never heard of such kind of Digivice. And New Guilmon as just flabbergasted by such a device, for him it looks so alien and interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Impmon's expression is a different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Guilmon stops to marvel at that shiny device after hearing Impmon's giggle. He then moved his gaze to look at the little imp-like Digimon. Impmon's mouth is grinning so broad that his corner lips seemed to almost touch his horn-like ears. Red lizard felt pretty concern about that creepy smile.<br>\r\nSuddenly New Guilmon gasps. A weird feeling suddenly flourished in his body. Actually, in a <i>certain</i> part of his body. It was so unnerving that he grasps at them quickly as soon as they started to feel cold for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was his... Well, his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling was not that abnormal but certain it was for <i>that</i> region of his. His buttocks abruptly emanated a cool feeling, sending a cold chill through his spine. <i>What is this</i>, he would have mentally asks himself but Impmon snatches his attention once more, promptly shouting his wish loud and clear without thinking twice, his finger sharply pointing at New Guilmon.<br>\r\n\"I WISH TO BE THIS DIGIMON'S TAMER!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish acknowledged. This Digivice will turn into master's new Digivice and will cease its previous function as a Wishing Digivice. Thank you for using the Magical Digidevice Service and have a nice day.\" A blinding flash erupts in its screen and then gone in a snap. On Impmon's hand, lies the Digivice, now as a normal one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b>\"NO!!!!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A few moments earlier...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato's mind starts to surface again, his blurry vision due to his foggy status of enjoyment after New Guilmon's cleaning (that turned out as a session of fondness petting) begins to dissipate after long minutes of inactivity. During that state, he just heard voices and commotions but he didn't capture what was going on around him. He actually captured two blurry blobs moving around in front of him before his body turns around facing a long corridor with a lot of noises at the end of it and slowly moving forward but he didn't register why.<br>\r\nFinally, with his thoughts now gathered, he looks around for a bit. He's still in the alley, now facing its entrance. He also noticed that he's standing, still not feeling his arms-now-legs. Out of nowhere, he heard a loud roar breaking the alley's silence. Not a scary one but it was so sudden that if he still had his normal body, he would have pissed on himself. It was a kind of happy one? Triumphal? It sounded like Impmon's, though.<br>\r\nBut before he decides which one, another voice spokes like electronically, sounding oddly familiar.<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the magical Digidevice service. We will grant all your wishes for no cost at all.\". It adds. \"Please select your wish or speak it loud and clear.\"<br>\r\nTakato felt what rested of his area of touch runs cold. <i>It was the wishing Digivice. <b>Someone activated.</b></i><br>\r\nTakato was so horrified by it, he didn't notice his long-gone-butt-now-head gasping, his dread state only snapping after two quick movements entered in his field of vision, flanking on his sides. His new arms moved his hands towards him, groping him firmly.<br>\r\nThe former boy mentally grunts while his sight is deformed by the dull claws. It felt good but now it just annoys him. He wanted to look behind him but he couldn't control his legs to turn him around.<br>\r\nHe then heard another shout, Impmon again. This time he registered. Every. Single. Word. And he had a heart-sinking feeling.<br>\r\n\"I WISH TO BE THIS DIGIMON'S TAMER!\"<br>\r\n\"Wish acknowledged.\", he heard the wishing Digivice's electronic voice saying. \"This Digivice will turn into master's new Digivice and will cease its previous function as a wishing magical Digivice. Thank you for using the Magical Digidevice Service and have a nice day.\"<br>\r\nA bright light erupts behind him and fades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Takato snaps.<br>\r\n<i><b>\"NO!!!!!!\"</b></i><br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Back to the present...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud and reverberating voice ghostly erupts very close to New Guilmon. Like <i>real close</i>. He didn't hear with his ears but felt like it echoed <i>in his head.</i><br>\r\nBut that was not all that startled the big red lizard the most. At the same time, his buttocks violently churned by their own.<br>\r\nNew Guilmon is livid. He grabs his butt with his dear life, his glutes convulsing themselves alone between his claws. He's completely lost by his current situation, not understanding what's going on, and his panicking only keeps growing higher and higher while he holds his agitating buttocks and listens to the ghostly voice.<br>\r\n<b><i>NO!! I can't stay like this! I didn't mean to this to happen! I want to be normal again! Give it back!!! GIVE IT BAACK!!!!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpmon wanted to celebrate his day's victory by piggybacking his own Digimon with his own new Digivice at hand but New Guilmon's awkward behaviour made the imp Digimon to cover his mouth with his gloved hand, trying to hold his laughs. But he completely lost it and bursts, laughing to death while holding his belly after New Guilmon started to do pelvic movements while groping his butt, like a silly dance. But Guilmon was stunned. To Guilmon, New Guilmon sure looks like he's panicking by something that Guilmon couldn't see. Something definitely was wrong and because of that, Guilmon worries and try to reach at him to help but recoils as soon as New Guilmon started to bawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Guilmon sobs uncontrollably, panicky looking around, feeling really scared by what's happening to him. His butt starting to contracts weirdly making New Guilmon's legs giving in awkwardly, the red lizard almost losing his balance several times. The disembodied voice in his head just keeps getting louder and louder, and his sobs volume just keeps increasing with it.<br>\r\n<b><i>\"GIVE IT BACK!! GIVE IT BACK!! I WANT IT BACK!!!!!!\"</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't take it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he flees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Guilmon instinctively turns around and starts to run towards the alley's entrance, terrified and sobbing copiously. To where New Guilmon is going? <i>He doesn't know, neither care. He just wants to get out of here, <b>away from this voice.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams and a loud honk with a bright light startled him almost to death, interrupting his escape. The shock made him slip and fall on his tail. Humans were shouting and pointing at him, completely scared by a huge dinosaur in the middle of the street, almost getting hit by a van. But besides the imminent collision and the commotion, he quickly recovers from it. He just wants to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rapidly gets up and continued his running. He finishes crossing the street, enters into another alley and disappears through the darkness, his loud sobs getting lower and lower.</span></div></div>",

How come nothing's happened?\" Takato looked at the digivice and the same voice started speaking again. \"We regret to inform you, but our services have to update your current Wish granting digivice before any wishes can be granted. Please wait, and thank you for your co-operation.\" \"What? You've gotta be kidding me!\" A timer appeared on the screen. \"10:35:28\" \"I have to wait that long! Oh come one! I wish the counter is already finished.\" Of course, that wish wasn't granted. So Takato decided to just keep it in his backpack and continued his walking to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool went by normal, without anything unusual happening. As he walked home, he checked the Wish granting digivice again to check how long he has to continue waiting. \"2:18:54\" \"*sigh* This is taking pretty long. I wonder if this thing really does grant wishes...\" After doing homework and chores, he goes outside and visits Guilmon at their usual clubhouse. \"Hi Takato! Did you bring some tasty bread?\" Guilmon asked, who began rummaging inside Takato's backpack. As Guilmon found the bread and ate it, he also saw the digivice right next to it. He took it out and showed it to Takato. \"Takato, don't you already have a digivice?\" \"Oh that. Well Guilmon, the thing is, I found that out on the street, and there was a voice that said that it's special, and can grant any wish we make on it.\" \"Really!? Then I wish for a huge pile of bread to eat!\" Nothing happened, and Guilmon looked at the device again. \"Hey, where's the bread?\" Takato took the digivice and showed the timer to the digimon. \"You see these numbers Guilmon? We have to wait for all of them to count down to zero before we make wishes.\" \"0:00:20\" \"Hey Takato, it says ten.\" \"What, really?\" Takato looked at the screen and saw the timer at 0:00:13. \"Oh boy, now we can start wishing, buddy!\" Both Takato and Guilmon began getting really excited as they watched the timer hit zero.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it did, there was a blinding flash of light, which forced the two to cover their eyes. When they can see again, Guilmon stared at Takato with him mouth open. \"Ta...Ta...Takato...\" \"Wha...What is it, Guilmon?\" \"You...You're me!\" Takato looked down at his hands and dropped the digivice in complete surprise. He's become a digimon like his partner! \"Whoa...\" Takato checked out his entire body, from the red muzzle on his face down to the tip of his tail. \"This is so cool!\" Takato tried to dig on the floor, which he did with ease. \"Man, I'm even as strong as you, Guilmon!\" Guilmon just stared at his friend, wondering why the digivice turned him into a digimon. \"Hey Takato, how come you me now?\" Takato looked at his friend and started to feel a bit embarrassed at the question. \"Well, I, uh, I was kinda wondering what it would be like...To, you know, be a digimon, and stuff. So I wished that I was a digimon like you, so that's, um, pretty much why I'm like this now.\" Guilmon just stared at his friend before giving him a big hug. \"Hehe, well I'm happy then, cause now we can play like two of me!\" \"Yeah! Oh wait! Where's the digivice?\" They saw it on the ground and Takato picked it up. He looked at the screen, which said \"Next wish?\" on the screen. \"You know, Guilmon, if we can have lots of fun with just one wish, just imagine how much fun we can have with lots and lots of wishes.\" Takato looked at his friend with a glint in his eye. \"Takato, does that mean we can wish for any fun things now?\" \"That's right buddy, we're gonna have lots of fun now.\" \"But what should we wish for first?\" \"Hmm, good point.\" Takato began scrolling on the lists of possible options.</span></div></div>",

Takato wanted to correct Guilmon out of habit but shrugged figuring with his new Guilmon form it was appropriate in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again focusing on the device Takato made his wish and a moment later a large refrigerator and large pantry appeared in Takatos room. Guilmon eagerly went to loo, pulling open the doors to the pantry and let out a happy cry as the the place was stuffed with bread of all kinds as well as dozens of jars of peanut butter. Guilmons favorite combo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakato checked the fridge, finding it more evenly stocked with other food, sandwiches, fried chicken, pizza, noodle dishes, as well as pastries, cakes, pies and many sweets. Everything he could want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Guilmon meanwhile had taken everything out of the pantry he wanted and closed the door, when he decided he wanted more peanut butter and opened it again. In surprise Guilmon saw the place was now overflowing with peanut butter jars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Takatomon, what's going on?\" Guilmon asked biting into a loaf of cheesy bread, \"I opened the door and there's more peanut butter than I've ever seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well is that what you wanted?\" Takato smiled through a bit of a sandwich, his face a little messy as he was still getting used to Guilmons muzzle and claws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Guilmon replied slowly, \"But why is there so much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because that's all you wanted,\" Takato smiled, \"The fridge and pantry are special. Whatever food you want when you open the door, that's what will be inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuilmon blinked closing the door. \"So if I wanted...\" Guilmon opened it again and gasped, there was a life sized replica of him standing there made out of bread and filled with peanut butter. The digimon laughed happily as he bit into the bread sculpture, enjoying the delicious taste as takato laughed at the happy sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair smiled and gorged on the food well into the afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumber 1: Takato and Guilmon Eat until their sick and Takato makes a wish they would never feel so stuffed ever again. This however creates the problem that everything they eat is digested completely into fat almost instantly. So the pair gorge and swell but never feel full, only constantly hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNumber 2: Takato and Guilmon eat until content but are too stuffed to move so Takato wishes they had someone to help them about and picks Rika and Renamon to be their new 'assistants' for various things such as feeding them, washing them, giving them massages, etc.</span></div></div>",
