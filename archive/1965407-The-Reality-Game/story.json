It allowed the player to live out any life he or she wished. There were two types of this game; one for boys and the other for girls. Being small for his age, looking more like a twelve year old than sixteen, Daniel did not make the football team so he ordered the game for boys in hopes of living the life of a football player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly all of his hopes were dashed when he opened the package; the game was pink in color. It was the girls' version of the game. \"But I ordered the boys' version of the game!\" angry and confused, Daniel said. \"I know I did; I checked it three times!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, bro?\" entering Daniel's room, Sophie asked. \"Something wrong with the game you ordered from Reality Inc.?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just everything, Sophie!\" angry, Daniel yelled. \"I ordered the boys' version of the game and they sent me the girl version! I can't live the life of a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with being a girl?\" with a fake look of hurt, Sophie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not born one, that's what is wrong!\" tearing up, Daniel yelled. \"It would be too... weird!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the game has a money back guarantee.\" with the hint of a smile, Sophie said. \"Why not at least give it a try?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked as if he was about to be sick. \"You can't be serious!\" angry, he screamed. \"Why would I want to try being a girl at any time!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have been on pins and needles, waiting for this to arrive.\" serious, Sophie replied. \"I don't think I can take your pacing much longer. At least give the game a try. If you don't like it, you can send it back in exchange for the boy version.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked at his sister as if she had lost her mind only, after some pleading, he finally gave in and hooked the game equipment. It was fairly basic with its own digital monitor, the game console, and two wireless controllers. Once everything was set up, Daniel turned on the game and stood in front of the monitor where a message read, 'Please hold still while you are scanned.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scanned?\" curious, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a number of green beams of light fired from a round lens in the game console. It hit Daniel in various points. After a few second, the beams of light vanished and a new message appeared on the screen. Please select your character age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel looked at the options and saw...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You hear the shower shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo minutes later, Sophie opens the door and leaves wearing only a towel, she's your identical twin Sister, so its like looking into a mirror everytime you see her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly hop into the shower and think about the dream you had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a weird dream, something about some video game, and I was a boy.\" but you dismissed it, though it still seemed weird, you wash your long blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rinsed yourself off and stepped out of the shower, wrapped a towel around your ample chest and one around your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you were dried off, you put on a lacy bra and pink panties, settling with a white layered skirt and pink and white tank top. you then brush your hair out and re wrap it a towel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Dad, Step-Mom, and Sister were already eating, You see Sophie's wearing the same skirt as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Daddy.\" You say giving your dad a kiss on the cheek, and cooking a bagel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't wear that I'm wearing it today, and I was wearing it first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" You sigh, you really liked this skirt and wanted to wear it, but couldn't wear it if Sophie was \"I'll change after breakfast\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're lost in thought, while you eat, you think about the dream, something about it dream kept eating at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast You went back to your room to change, you settle on a light flowery strapless dress, that goes to your calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blow dry Your hair out, then put it into pigtails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat down to do your makeup. Even though you've done it a thousand times something felt odd, like you'd never done it before, all the same you finished up, checked yourself in the mirror to make sure you looked presentable, primping a little, you grabbed your purse and slipped on a pair of 2 inch wedge heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie was waiting for you at the door, looking lost deep in thought, then she looks up, and giggles looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is my hair crooked?\" You ask confused which only makes her laugh harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\" she says, getting herself under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you get into your shared Birthday Present a Pink Mercedes, and head to school. More of the dream was coming back to you every minute, while Sophie drove<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the dream Sophie was 14 not 16, and you were a boy, and you had a brother...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe came to a stop sign and stopped the car. That's when you suddenly remembered the Reality game You'd gotten in the dream... or wait... You used the game and woke up here, You weren't Danielle, You Were Daniel, a boy, who was playing a game, as a girl. And Sophie was your Younger Sister not your twin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Sophie with a shocked look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Finally Remember Daniel? OR Danielle?\" She says laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Just now, when did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few minutes ago when I was waiting for you, that's why I laughed seeing my big brother with pigtails, boobs, heels, and a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at yourself, for the first time for real, You've got huge D-cup breasts, long blond hair, your nails were painted pink, it was apparently your favorite color in this reality. you couldn't believe what you were wearing, this dress was staying on just from your boobs, and showed off a generaous amount of cleavage, and heels on top of that. No Wonder Sophie was laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe remembered that he had 5 goals to get through to finish. he figured out how to check them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you checked your Goal Checklist yet?\" You asked Sophie \"I'm checking mine now\"</span></div></div>",

Then, her image came back into focus. She was very slightly different, her hair was a slightly darker shade of brown and she was slightly taller. Some of the biggest changes, were the substantially larger breasts, almost another cup size larger, and the ridiculously longer hair, almost down to her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, you felt tingling all over your body. You looked down, and saw that your body was covered in the same fuzzy grey that you had seen on Sophie. You felt the tingling all over your body, and if you weren't covered in grey, you're sure you would have seen all of your body hair retracting into your body. You felt your eye level change slightly as you got shorter, and the tingling slowly faded from the rest of your body, except your chest and your hair. You felt your chest expanding, and your hair lengthening. It was really strange, as you couldn't see your body changing, but you could feel it. The grey fuzzyness faded, and your body was an exact copy of your sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing that happened, was the entire room became fuzzy, aside from the two of you, as you examined your body. Your clothes, your hair, your body: all of them, were an exact copy of your sister. You're so intent on examining your body (being respectful, and not going too far because it's your sister's body) that you don't notice the room has re-materialised until Sophie puts a hand on your shoulder. You look around. You appear to be in a hexagonal room. Two doors marked the north and south of the room, and on the diagonal walls of the hexagonal room. On the diagonal (north-east, south east, north-west, south-west) walls, there are 4 outfits: 1 appears to be a medieval suit of armour, with helmet, and axe, made to accommodate a woman's body. The second, was another set of armour, this one with a christian cross on the belt. The third was a set of leather armour, with a cloak and hood, a bow slung over one shoulder, and two short swords at the sides. Finally, there was what appeared to be a colourless robe, and hood, with a staff leaning against the wall next to it.  </span></div></div>",

The shelves were filled with bottles of different coloured liquids, and a door was open to another room, where there were various different items of equipment. Sophie had changed as well. She was now dressed in the armour that she had touched earlier, but the symbol was now different, it appeared to be a platinum dragon, wrapped around the circle (think Katniss Everdeen's Mockingjay symbol, but platinum instead of gold, and with a dragon instead of a bird). Her hair was put up into a bun, and a second symbol, this one fashioned into a hairpin. There was also an intricately carved warhammer, with the head carved into the shape of a dragon, and a shield slung over her back. As you moved over to stand next to her, you felt a tug on your now much longer hair. Feeling behind you, you felt the staff you had picked up earlier now slung over your back, and your much longer hair trapped underneath it. You pulled it out, and put it into a ponytail without thinking, then realised what you had done. </span></div></div>",

We've disabled most of the traps, and defeated the monsters guarding it, but we are unfortunately lacking a magician, and the last few traps and barriers are magical. We're willing to pay you for your services, as well as any money we need to identify any items we find, which we will use your shop exclusively for.\" <br>\r\n\"You have not yet told us your name,\" you said \"I prefer to know who I'm working for before I agree to any deals.\" <br>\r\nThe warrior removed his helmet, to reveal a handsome male human, in his early twenties. <br>\r\n\"My name is Deran,\" said the man \"And I can vouch personally for the rest of my party. If any of them double cross you, I can promise I will compensate you for it.\" <br>\r\n\"Very well,\" you said \"Come on, Terra, we gotta go, can you lock up?\" <br>\r\nSophie automatically grabbed the keys and followed the two of them out the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead on, Deran,\" said 'Terra'<br>\r\n\"Do you have horses?\" he asked \"It's a bit of a ways off.\" <br>\r\nYou led the way behind the shop, which was called 'Anarion- Relics of the Ancient World', to a small stable separate from the shop. Leading the horses out of the stable, and going to where Deran's horse was grazing. Getting on the horses, Deran led the way out of town and over a hill to an old tomb that they had found the hoard in. Two men and an elf woman stood outside, tending to horses of their own. One of the men wore a green hood, and had a bow and quiver of arrows over his back, and leather armour. The other man wore what appeared at first glance to be commoner clothes, but you noticed cleverly concealed armour, and the glint of several daggers in concealed pockets on his clothes. The elven woman appeared to be in noble garb, and had a fancy dagger on her waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Terrence, Sal and Selastine,\" said Deran, gesturing to the hooded one, the leather armoured one and the elf woman respectively. <br>\r\nTerrence led the way into the tomb, moving quickly over weapons discarded from skeletons that had sword gouges on them. Over bottomless pits, under or around collapsed ceilings, until they came to a door with a runic circle on it. <br>\r\n\"What do you make of this?\" asked Terra, examining the runic circle \"Seems to be a combination of divine and arcane symbols.\" <br>\r\n\"What will it do if we trigger it?\" asked Deran <br>\r\n\"Basically, it'll funnel all the energy contained within that circle down the corridor directly at us,\" you said, not entirely sure how you know it.<br>\r\n\"You guys can bring it down, right?\" asked Terrence<br>\r\n\"I believe so,\" said Terra \"But these symbols are so intertwined, it'll be very easy to set it off. We should take precautions first. Alicia? Put up a barrier, please.\" <br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou pull out some chalk, and begin drawing a circle, putting several different symbols within it. <br>\r\n\"Stand inside the circle, please,\" you said. The four party members stood inside the circle. You began chanting, and the circle began glowing. <br>\r\n\"You four should be safe inside the circle, if we set this off, it'll kill us, but you four should be unharmed,\" you said \"You're not confined to the circle, but I'd advise you stay there until we've disabled the circle.\" <br>\r\nYou turned back to the circle, and you and Sophie held up your hands in front of the rune circle on the door. <br>\r\nThe circle glowed slightly, and several of the runes came forwards, splitting up and going to either side. Some then vanished, as they were disabled completely. When all of the runes had vanished, the circle vanished into the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clear,\" you said, waving your hands over the protective circle on the floor, which floated up, shrank and wrapped itself around your right wrist. <br>\r\n\"Take positions,\" said Deran, moving to the front of the group, as Terrence went to the centre, Sal with him, and Selastine went to the back.

Mountains of gold coins littered the floor of the cavernous chamber, many, many intricately made weapons, many with jewel-encrusted hilts. Deran stepped into the room, looking around at the mountains around you. As he walked towards the gold, one of his feet depresses a tile on the floor. Immediately, the gold began to slide towards the group, as a red-coloured hide appeared underneath, red wings unfolded slightly, the dragon towered over you all.

The gas exploded, the dragon fell down, it's head smoking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said this dragon was dead,\" you said, as you blew on your hands. <br>\r\n\"It was,\" said Deran, nervously \"I don't like this.

Now that you were closer, she realised that two of the cylinders looked oddly familiar to you. When your hands closed around them you felt a sense of rightness that you hadn't felt since you had woken up in this body. Untying them from the iron ring, you picked both of them up, closing your eyes, feeling that sense of rightness fill you up. You closed your eyes, and breathed in and out, feeling that sense of rightness permeate you, from the tip of the long hair reaching out behind you like a party streamer, to the tip of your long, emerald tail, that still felt so alien, but so right at the same time. You reached out with your sense of rightness, your eyes closed. You felt Sophie, still exploring the cave around you, and as you pushed out your mind further, you somehow felt the life around you: the plants, the fish, even someone unfamiliar, yet familiar at the same time. As you reached out further, you felt something else. Something mechanical, manufactured. It was approaching the familiar presence fast. You tore yourself out of your meditation, your body almost on autopilot, you moved your hands so they were against your body, and began moving faster than you remembered ever moving before, towards this strange presence. You held the cylinders next to you, as you came up on the familiar presence. It was a human woman, in her mid twenties by the look of her, and she was moving as fast as she could away from a white armoured figure not far behind her. You handed the woman one of the cylinders, pressing a nub on one area of it to activate the lightsaber, and barrelled towards the scuba clone, dodging the harpoon gun with reflexes you didn't know you had, and sliced off his gun arm before stabbing him in the chest, allowing him to float off. You knew instinctively that you had to protect this woman, who you guessed was Knight Assla, and you knew she couldn't see as-well as you. She had ignited the lightsaber you had given her, but was gazing around, unable to see if any of her assailants were around her. Seeing one about to pounce from above, you threw out your hand at him, sending him head over heels, into a strong upstream. </span></div></div>",

A green hologram popped up and read \"Push to confirm age. Current age selected: 12. Confirm/Deny?\" It read with two large holographic buttons near the bottom in front of the lense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's not such a bad age. How about twelve? You already look twelve, why not be twelve?\" His sister sophie suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twelve, only TWELVE? What, no way. That doesn't sound like a fun experience at all. I wanted to be a footballer player, if I cannot do that I might as well do a stronger option for it.\" Daniel insisted instead. He continued to look through the options, going through the ages but finding out it only goes up to 16 for him. \"What, why aren't there any options for older ages?\" He complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the game doesn't let you take on an older age, or any older than you already are. Maybe what it considers you mentally or physically? She added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a darn minute, are you saying I'm not mature? I am plenty mature!\" Daniel said, sticking his tongue out and making raspberries. Sophie rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And anyway, you said it yourself I only look about 12 physically, so there clearly wouldn't be restrictions on my physical age above 12 up to 16 if that were true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie sighed. \"All right, good point bro, so just choose an option and hit confirm. Be 12, really what's the worse that can happen? I don't really see any harm in trying it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel, rather angry wanted to argue with her further, but being upset enough about only getting a female version of the game said \"Fine. Let's see what they have for 12.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe clicked 'Confirm' and another light scanned through, this time red, beeping and blinking at him rapidly as red and green bands glowed around his body suddenly. He could feel like his body was constricting, like someone was pulling on it like taffy trying to compress him, but no real changes occurred just yet. It must be all sort of building in and in waiting until all the options have been decided.<br>\r\n\"Look at all these options Dan! Which should we choose?\" Sophie asked.</span></div></div>",

I'm not so sure. That seems sort of risky, I don't want to get into any trouble or feel weird emulating some caricature of a person.\" Despite his comment, she wasn't listening and tapped the Stereotypes list. He sighed as he picked up the controller and scrolled down through the list of options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were all sorts of stereotypes, from typical ones like Cheerleaders and bubbly airheaded blonds, to less acknowledged like Goths and Emos, punks, alternative scene kids, jocks and nerds, and other lingering options like Stepford Child, Goody Two Shoes, Spoiler Brat, Religious Devout, Science junkie, Fat Kid, Class clown, Class Klutz, 'Special needs', Agricultural Enthusiast, Hippie Flowerchild, and the list went on and on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDan wasn't as keen of most of these options, and they got more bizarre and different sounding as he went down. There was even an option called \"Weird foreign kid\", which reminded him of this one student in his class, Ja'\u00f6r-skieen Mallory who spoke in a thick European accent, always wore faux leather to school, quoted the Beetles, couldn't be seen without the stick of a licorice flavored lolly in his mouth, and offered Sage-like advice with other weird tics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Daniel was beginning to really regret this decision to play this game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goth!

I don't want to be some weird freaky goth girl. If anything, I might as well pick the obvious option, a perky cheerleader or buxom blond. Atleast that way I'll get to enjoy myself.\" Daniel responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want to be some sort of giggly blond bimbo? Ugh, that's so typical. Why are all men so predictable?\" She lamented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd RATHER, not be anything at all if possible. But if I have to decide, I don't really know how some of these options would work with a 12 year old girl, but I'm just saying I'd rather pick the least harmful one to live as. And a blond or cheerleader does not mean 'Bimbo', whose stereotyping now?\" Daniel pointed out, scrolling back up to the top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Goths are like, open minded and cool and stuff right? If you pick that, you're like to hold onto yourself the most, maybe even gain an ounce of maturity or two, even as a twelve old girl. You could have a lot of fun you know!\" Sophie pointed at the goth option as she argued for it's favor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I could end up some moody snob or flirty fetish-fueled nightmare. There's a lot to a stereotype you know, it's a bit of a gamble.\" Jon complained. \"Ugh, whatever.

If you're the type that loves the be the hero in your story, and a quick witted, courageous one at that, explore what this life has to offer, it's a game play experience you won't forget! <sub>Selections include Steampunk Goth, Magical Goth, and Fantasy Goth</sub></div></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie and Daniel carefully read through all the options, nodding and shaking their heads, 'Hmming' and 'Mmphm'ing' occasionally. As they went down they discussed it carefully. While the casual goth seemed like the most obvious and easygoing option, it might be rather dull. They voted against it. The Metal Goth seemed like a flat out no, since Dan didn't want anything to do with that sorta thing. The Posh goth sounded interesting, and Sophie was certainly a heavy advocate towards it's selection, but Daniel fought against it. The idea of wearing poofy and frilly outfits, drinking tea and curtsying seemed like just too much to him to bear. With the Sexy Goth option unavailable to them, the seemingly last one was a good option, but also a bit vague. While being a spunky explorer or adventurer seemed like it could fun, there was still a lot of risk, physically and literally this time. Plus Daniel was kind of hesitant to embrace the idea of being a gothy Witch or Magical girl of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey debated the options for about 15 minutes, before Sophie got frustrated at her brothers impatience and started scrolling down, ensuring a fight with his controller against her fingertips on the hologram. As they struggled, the cursor went all the way down, prompting them to finally see another unveiled option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\"><span class=\"crose\">Experimental Beta Option: 'Eccentric' Goth. As redundant as the concept may sound, this life is a little more eclectic and forthcoming than the other options. While mixing a fair share of traits from all of the above, it's especially intricate with the <i>Fiction and Fantasy</i> setting and as such, the player will be invigorated through a daring storyline and more indepth, personal characterization than a typical session. <sup>Best used at players own digression.</sup></span></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked at each other and gulped.<br>\r\nWith nothing more to lose, they finally chose..</span></div></div>",

He shivered and woke up suddenly in a hazy mist, taking in the thin breezy air and sullen rock floor he was resting on. As he got up, he heard the sound of rattling and clunky knickknacks against him, with a weight and feeling to occupy it. As if it wasn't enough to confirm their presence, Daniel felt the objects across his body, chains rattling near his waist, a silver stopwatch lodged in his pocket, and slight metal cuffs around his wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was frightened that he might have been jailed or in danger, but they didn't restrict his mobility at all, and most of the chains and objects weren't connected to anything. Looking down from where he got up, a cotton white shirt with plaid trimmings adorned his chest underneath a long frock coat. He wore a beige leather skirt, latched with metal attachments, and along his legs Gardner Belts and striped wool stockings. Knee high stomper boots made with a velvety brown fabric encased his shins, and it seemed like some sort of brace or mechanism was locked around it as well. A pair of spiffy goggles decorated her forehead strapped comfortably. Despite the heavy cloak, skirt and boots he strangely found he could walk just fine, better even. Was he made of helium? Other than his braced leg, every part of him just felt bustling with energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt feather wait, and although clearly in a spry 12 year old's female body, the body was mobile and highly spunky. He felt like a superhero, and almost had to restrain his movements at first because the lightweight agility almost threw him off. When he finally got up and leaned over the giant pillar he was resting against, 'Daniel' brushed off the dust from his frock and shoulders. Along with running his fingers into the tied back hair combed in, he started cupping the poofy bangs across his face and sassy swirls of hair over his shoulders before being startled by a beep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA message appeared on the screen, giving him the first glimpse of his new appearance. Being identical to the girl in the display, he looked like some Victorian girl out of a pulp novel or children's book. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Welcome New Player,</i> <i><span class=\"cbrown\"><b>Elma Rosenberg</b></span>, 12 year old Plucky wonderchild and courageous, daring heir of the Rosenberg name.</i>\" A note popped up under a bunch of descriptions and summaries he skimmed over.

Goal completion earns, 5 Points. 100 required points to complete and finish Game.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighting his surroundings? That seemed like an easy enough task. From what he could see the sky was slightly smoggy, air cold, ground hard yet brittle, and himself anxious to see what more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUtilizing the virtual abnormal strength he'd acquired, Elma pressed her stompers against the ground, creating small fissures in the earth beneath her feet. Steam and bustling proceeded in her brace, feeling like someone was giving it a tight squeeze or grope, and in less than a second later she was off, soaring vertically into the air several meters ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe landed exhilarated, never having felt anything like it before.

From her pillar, she could see only a portion of it, but a rusty valley seemed to stretch out for miles. Wind swept through cliffsides and rocky ground, going through the gorges and edges of the landscape, and finding it's way through her bangs, bristling in the breeze. Slight rays and beams of sunlight shot through the sky, but most of it was obscured by dull clouds and a sepia tones skyline. By the location of the sun obscured behind the haze, she could tell it was about a little before noon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the game told me to start earning points I have to explore don't I? So I might as well do that. Time to get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma reassured herself. It was strange, she was so nervous and uncertain about trying this game out so little ago, but now she felt a weird surge of confidence and almost, brash giddy pride fill her up. She wasn't scared at all! 'She' wondered if that was part of the mental effects at all? She recalled there might have been a risk for changed like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither way she figured she best not to dwell on it, and pressed herself down in a leaping position, like an Olympic medalist with their eyes on the pride. Her brace activated with clogs and steam again, and she made a massive leap forward into the valley. And another, and so on. It was amazing she thought, she was hardly the most athletic as a boy back in reality, but here as Elma she might as well be one with the wind herself. The speed and grace for which her spirit soared, felt charitably bold, maybe even adventurous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter soaring and leaping bounds through the cliff sides, she looked up and spotted the first 'unusual' thing, well more so to the land since she'd arrived. Some pillars and hills had tilted and raised upwards, giving definition to the photographic scene. But rising from the midst of the valley, were titanic Towers raising towards the sky, tall and towering over the land. They were like skyscrapers built in the middle of these rocky lands, and were obviously built appropriately so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma pulled down her goggles and tried to focus a little closer. Aside from the smog fuming from the top, Antennas and machinery whizzed at the very top of them hundreds of feet up, and large pipes coiled it at the bottom and disappeared into the earth's surface from a distance. She couldn't explain it and had never seen such a thing, but for reasons unknown to her Elma felt instant surges of ghastly horror and hatred for these behemoth structures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped on a tall hill, and scanned around. In the very distance perhaps miles apart, the visions of more ominous towers scattered off in the distance was apparent. Elma instinctively grit her teeth and gripped her fingerless gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnforgiving place </span></div></div>",

Previously one with the wind, now she moved past it and felt the crisp and gloomy air against her face, brushing her hair, working against her body. She focused her legs harder and accelerated. The faster she moved, the tighter her brace strangled her leg, but she ignored it, all while it blasted out steam like a furious engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt strained her only slightly to move ahead like this, but something about the tower just made her so mad, even if she wasn't given any context as to why. Her speedy travels were interrupted at one point when trekking only a few hundred feet from the Tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What is that?\" She quickly dove behind a nearby pillar and got down in it's shade, hugging the back of it for her life. The spotlight from above shone atop the pillar, but didn't venture towards her before it passed away and the floating vehicle above slowly patrolled away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma gave a quick glance and then anchored her bottom rear onto the ground, splitting out her legs forward and stretching with a long yawn. \"I didn't know I still got tired in this game. I thought I was pretty limitless, but I guess the game set some realism.\" Her leg was sore and panged sharply at the girth ring where the Brace restricted it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It was a heck of a lot to admire, this crazy game so far. Daniel, taking a moment to pause himself and reassert his concentration away from being 'Elma' , took a deep breathe and tried to recount the events before sprinting forward again. With game-magic steam powered legs no less. He reached his hand out and as if by his command, a mini-menu popped out. He'd begun the game roughly 42 minutes ago and had spent a little over the last half hour exploring. There was no inventory, but he tried to go back to that information that would summarize anything helpful. It was hard to believe he was an ordinary boy before than, but now his young girl form, his eloquent clothes, his gadgets, had all transformed him into this, this splunk  heroine she was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her breath, she took off one of her leathery stompers and let that foot breathe. It was probably best to rest for a moment anyway, even if some part of her mind seemingly didn't want to.</span></div></div>",

It was sore from the brace earlier, but now it was like someone just ripped a band-aide off him. The brace, slightly loose and out of steam since he'd stopped dangled loosely. She carefully untwisted two knobs at the knee, pulled off a latch near the top, and the brace dissembled into three parts, a top, bottom and 'lock' part that held it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Elma, the soreness relieved gave way to a pang of numbness. \"Ahhh, what now?\" Elma had gotten use to her new body so quickly, but this was something new. The stripped leg, free'd of it's weight couldn't even move, it was like a dead weight being dragged from the stiffer upper portions. Deeply grooved marks were indented into her skin from the tightness of it constricting her leg for so long, and there were two metal devices built into gashes in her flesh left from where the knobs were before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd expected this game to come with some unique restrictions, but thought the fancy costume and equipment was only for show, like in any videogame. The other items didn't seem to weigh anything, so why did taking it off make her feel paralyzed in one leg? She couldn't even lift it or stand now like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if following his mental curiosity, a menu screen began to panel information off.

This miraculous technology has allowed the flighty exploratory Elma to get around where she needs with blinding speed and passing ease, whereas she'd be immobile to basic walking functions. And all a product of her own design and ingenious.</i>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma examined one of the top parts of the brace and sure enough, a small casket of water the size of a canister was wired up to lodges in the brace. A slight knock sort of showed it was slightly lightweight, and when he bent it like rubbery plastic it was truly like flexible steel, bending back into place once released. \"Huh, a steam powered body augmentation system? This might just be the coolest character I could have chosen yet. Who knows how lame those other lives could have been compared to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging her body along and peaking just slightly over the structure, she saw the large flying vehicle finally far away enough now, veering in the opposite direction and soon to be behind the tower. She'd have plenty of time before it ever spotted her, she figured. Picking up the pieces of her leg's equipment, as if by instinct she started putting it back together, front back and top piece snapping like a seatbelt around her leg, with the two knobs tightening back around the holed gashes in her leg. A quick jolt of pain went through her spine, like getting a shot or pinch, but it soon went away and felt as natural as she'd feel wearing it her whole life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith only a bit of delay, it started to feel lightweight again and she felt that it could move. Rubbing the tips of the brace, when she held it carefully she could feel a slight warmth, and supposed that was the water running through it. How hot would it be to touch when she was speeding ahead like before and steaming outwards? She didn't care to find that out, but regardless knew she'd be traveling like that again in a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up and feeling the wind brush her hair, she tightened the chains on her frock, pulled back the sassy curls of hair into the scrunched ones and donned on her stomper boot.

If this was one of the mental effects, would it be crucial to her story or game? She still had the whole Exploring goal afterall, and she supposed exploring the tower monolith thing up ahead was part of that. If only it'd given her additional memories too, maybe she could figure it out sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPacing herself and going more easy on her pumping legs, now that she knew they had limits and could over-exert themselves, she raced towards it, close in sight. Even while exhilarating her senses by moving at this lowered speed, she was probably on par with nature's finest. She'd certainly outrun any Olympic sprinter or highway conundrum. Why, at her fastest she could probably compete in NASCAR, if she wanted to over-exert herself and set her legs ablaze. They were warm enough with the brace around them, aside from her own instinct and pacing, she could tell her speed by the heat of the steam alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a decent well jogged journey, she'd crossed the canyon over and made her way right to it. Here was one, a massive monolith of black steel and ivory machinery looming before her. The tower looked more like some kind of factory or giant dynamite stick upclose, smooth and daunting, hundreds of feet up. She didn't suppose even at her strongest leap she could mount that. Because the tower's surface was so smooth she wouldn't be climbing it either. There was no entrance visible anywhere she could see, no windows or sidewalks in the middle of the bare canyon. The only place for entry was in a giant hole up-top high high up, with a landing platform. She had a good guess what that was for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPipes big enough to house an elephant spiraled out of the bottom of structure and dug deep into the ground. Elma hopped around and climbed her way up onto some of them, inspecting the way they spiraled in and out, with an red glow within the pipes, and a strange luminescent light blue one emitting out from their entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red glow atleast, was traceable.

She hopped and skipped back and forth between their contours streaking the canyon, careful not to touch them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the first couple didn't really lead anywhere. They usually just leveled out eventually, but in some parts were wide enough to expel out heated viscous fluid, gooey and bubbling across the earth. She figured it was probably molten Magma, what else would it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a while, and while sometimes Daniel felt somewhat bored or impatient, the part of him that was Elma felt excited and curious at what this phenomenon meant. She didn't want to slow down or quit, even after playing hopscotch for what seemed like miles, and luckily for her this persistence paid off. One stream she followed lead to a particular nasty crack, which flowed into a whole river of lava cascading down a cliff. The waterfall of heated material escorted down into a large hole in the earth's surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh snap! Guess it's time to dig a little lower.\" Elma realized, wiping her brow from all the heat and looking for a safe entryway. It was already past noon and the sun was starting to lower, she told herself if there was any time to look, I'd be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping like a cougar swiping it's pray, she swiftly strode into the side of the underground cavern, careful to avoid the falling flow of lava pouring from above. Luckily, the walls and space was wide enough that she could travel down with a fairly large margin of safety. She gripped a cliffside and slowly began making her descent, putting one foot after the other and climbing down. The light fading out wasn't a problem, the hot red waterfall provided a pretty good lamp, and there seemed to be some light coming from below aswell.</span></div></div>",

She licked her lips and wiped the sweat from her brow, taking another step on a more comfortable ledge to grasp. Within a climb that would put the most experienced expedition goer to shame, Elma had climbed down with no trouble at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hopped onto a platform right above where the lava finally landed and flowed, narrowing into a river up ahead. Across the side of the wall led to a deep cavern, one illuminated by the fiery river of what she could only assume to be the catechism of the depths of hell. But she wasn't about to start quoting scripture, with a powerful leap she hopped over the river and landed on a rocky safe pathway that ran alongside the flow, and made haste rummaging inside. It's bowls went deep into the earth, she went forward and made a curve and continued exploring. Even underground, the lava made the cavern warm and sweltering. Eventually pathway stopped and the stream expanded out indefinitely, simply flowing forever and presumably back into and underneath the land. But there was one stroke of luck for her to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe luminescence of a blue aura flowed out of an entry way uptop, another cavern with a cavern here, above where the melting rivers flowed indefinitely. With a stern push of her legs, she leaped 20 feet and just barely made it to the edge, gripping her fingers and pulling herself up and in. Giving one last look at the heated reservoir of boiling magma below, she continued inwards to see what she may find next.</span></div></div>",

Just earlier she had walked by a stream of red hot fluid, but now walking away from it the temperature was rather chilled, but not unbearable. More interesting was the brightness of her travels, she hadn't lost sight of any light yet. She had vaguely remembered a place looking like this at a roller skating rink she went to once as Daniel, on some boogie or disco night was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever this was unlike anything she had ever seen. As she got closer and deeper into the belly of the subterranean, she'd seen wonders not witnessed as a dull boy. The lights shone deep twinkling blue, like fairy lights twirling and dancing throughout an irradiated darkness. But hardly radioactive or seething with virulent heat or harm, these lights were musical, magical, mystical and something of an otherworldly sight to behold. Beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma peaked by behind a nearby stalagmite, and watched them dance slowly. Like fawning, whimsical fairies, they danced in organized patterns and strobes of color, from cyan to Cerulean, each in an orderly and sophisticated pattern of arrangement. The lights, the would-be fairies sprouted not pixie dust but elaborate patterns on the walls, which upon looking closer, Elma realized were something like webs or cocoons of sorts, each interconnected in marvelous patterns that not even the choicest of quilters could deny of it's lavish wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach time they were struck with a different light in the pattern of darling creatures, they sparked luminescent, electrifying and lighting up like a show of fireworks across a web, or daring display that no real world bill board or sign could match. It was naturally and unrelentingly, aesthetically, gracefully charmed and exquisite. An elegance of nature nothing else could hope to match. Poking one, Elma found them to be light as cotton candy, but abit more durable. She pinched a strand of some off and pocketed it in her frock for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was so beautiful, Elma had to chuckle for a moment to suddenly realize that it was all artificial,as part of a quest or game that had been designed and provided for him. But that didn't make it any less cool to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma walked in the ring of their marching, flying whimsy orchestra. They didn't fear her, but continued their dance all the same. She stuck her hand out, and let one fly gently into her palm. No smaller than a grape, the wonder had beady eyes, a round body like a beetle or ladybug, but long wings like a dragonfly. It was the slick and reflective black coat of it's shell, along with the electrical blue hue and beat of it's wings that gave it it's distinctive light and pattern, which combined with the sync of it's own kin made for a fantastically lovely sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma lost herself in the moment and danced, spending some time to take in the bold fresh sights before her, and reap the sows of her efforts and finest appreciations. She smiled and laughed and skipped, joining them in their merry song of life, the virtual creatures not object at all to their guest dancing with their colorful ballad.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, with a satisfied yawn, she bid the sight goodbye, waving playfully and making her way out. She hopped back onto the ledge and followed the trail of magma back up to it's surfacing source, where nightfall had cometh. With little more difficulty than before, she climbed here way up and out and soon was visited with the cold air of the world once more. Tiptoeing her way through the cracks and soon back onto the pipes again, she found her way to where they reached into the Tower at it's lowest walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closely, the hazing blue pulse emitted out was none too familiar. She took out the strand of web she had saved, and saw the same blue light charging through it's fibers. They matched identically. She wasn't completely sure what this meant for her game goal or what to make of it, but it was a connection well made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't be the only one to confirm her suspicions. A few minutes later, a light shone near the tower, and a red beacon flashed out of the very top as the large entryway opened up. The light sure enough, was from the searchlights of a large flying ship, looking like some sort of blimp or airship, the same one that had patrolled around it earlier. It made it's stop on the landing platform, which than retracted into the entryway before the gates closed once again and the night resumed it's silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft. Knew it.\" Elma quipped. She stretched out and began throttling forward, out into the wild of the canyon again. Elma didn't know for certain how this game worked, or atleast the parts from here. She sat down on a tall hill and tensed her arms behind her neck, looking towards the virtual sky. She wondered not whether she was spending an equal amount of real life time in the game, but if she should be tired specifically, or whatnot. She'd certainly done most of the things she thought she did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Game, check Goals accomplished, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short list popped up of all his objectives for the first goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><i><span class=\"cgreen\"><b>Examine surroundings - Complete</b></span></i></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, She certainly had seen quite a lot and examined as much as he could so far.

As soon as he had finished listing off the other three, a shooting star appeared. As a trail of light streaked across the sky it made it's way south back further, the opposite direction of where he first started. It lit up the night with a slight red hue, giving a magnificent homage to fortune in the glimpse of his now red eye, reflecting prosperity in the star that had just fallen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the freakin jackpot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds, steam littered the air and blasted where he once sat.

Four goals had just been completed scoring her 5 points. The sun hung low on the horizon and nightfall was imminent. The air was brisk and clean, almost feeling more fresh and natural than it ever did in real life upon that fateful night, or perhaps day. Elma wasn't sure how much time had even passed since he entered, but he could feel himself getting tired, so eventually he'd have to stop and save, if that was possible. He hoped it would be, Living as this character could be rather fun, like playing a real life videogame. Probably a lot preferable to something more casual, or the options that left him living some fetish fueled life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd traveled for about half an hour when he finally came across a massive crater where the star had fallen. Fiery red streaks outlined the area was charred, from the rocks and to the dirt and pillars. Even the sky was slightly smogged, smoking around.Elma wasn't sure quite what to do, but a strange instinct kicked in and she felt like there was something she could. She hadn't thought about it or done such before, but she turned around and put her legs near the impact, rubbing and streaking them quickly through the ashen earth, and felt a jolt of energy unlike anything she'd ever felt yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe steam in her hydraulics intensified, and feet cycled like she was on a treadmill, as a blinding flash of steam and gusting wind scored through the area. When it was finished, the gorge was slightly damp, but less of a hazard. She could see a faint shadow in the center of it, and hopped towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know I had skill-sets like that. This girl's just full of surprises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the dust and debris settled, she could finally make out a figure within the mid-center, it was squirming and approaching her suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma wobbled her legs, which had taken on a great deal of strain and felt like an iron-press, heavy and hot since her last maneuver, as the figure finally stepped out of the shadows and clear into view. She looked vacantly as Elma, and Elma stared shocked back at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe star that Elma found, has been another girl. </span></div></div>",

But here in front of her now, was a sight her vigor and bravery couldn't but prepare her for, another girl in her midst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl had crisp short, straight brunette-reddish hair to Elma's own elegant curls and shaggy mop. Her eyes watched Elma glassy and distorted, like those of a herder staring down their flock, poised yet detached. She wore a long coat and white cotton shirt underneath with a leathery pencil skirt. Atop her head and youthful face, her small button nose and wide glassy eyes, like dark marbles into the soul, despite their collected coolness and mystique gave little way for emotion. Her stance was tall and firm, but she wobbled over stilted and disoriented like a ruling figure using it's legs for the first time. She brushed her hair with an arm carefree and dismissive, and her expression changed not a wince from the stupor she gave off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" Elma said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl looked at Elma like she was the stupidest thing on the planet, turning her head and just barely giving back a delayed \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked forward, stilted and stricken, almost tipping over at times or seeming so. But she didn't faint or fall over, and despite the starchild's helping insistence, the star fallen child callously rejected her and pushed her helping hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl sighed, \"Where am I now?\" examining her surroundings as she climbed out of the cooled off eradicated patches, sighting the dark horizon ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma tapped her  braced foot and winced. Who was this girl, and where did she come from? She had obviously been accounted for by the game somehow, since she was found after following one of it's goals, but she also had an agenda of her own. Was she an NPC to help him, another player, something else completely? The girl scarcely paid attention or gave her mind, and if she was truly a program she wasn't talkative or helpful like one at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl coldly asked Elma her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-Elma, Elma Rosenberg.

Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne looked at her body, slightly dirtied by the wreckage but otherwise in pristine and healthy conditions. She flicked her hair again and snubbed her nose up towards the sky. \"I seem 'okay' enough, thank you for your concern.\" And just like that, she was off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase resumed. Anne walked slowly but composed, sighting her surroundings but not amused by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you fall from exactly? And who, or what, how are you?\" Elma sprang back and forth like a lion playing with it's prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne continued walking. \"The sky. Anne, who is a person as in a human being, and I'm fine, so thank you Rose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElma stopped. \"Rose?\" She continued to bombard Anne with questions, trying and failing to even get her attention most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking her head playfully, Anne scoweled. \"What's your deal? What do you want?\" Elma went silent. \"You see how that feels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two paced themselves in silence from there across the desert, the cliffs low and far apart now. Mounds and pillars could still be seen in the distance, but Anne walked with a sense of direction and mindfullness of someone poised for their next destination. When Elma finally got the courage to speak up again, she was 'Sssh'd' suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been playing that?\" Anne posed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>P..playing</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot waiting for an answer, Anne shook her head, even a little confused herself at that comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, out here. How long have you been out here. And where should we rest? I just have a feeling that's what we're supposed to do.is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other, and quietly turned their head to north where dim lights and sights made their way up ahead, resembling something lively and suggesting of civilization from afar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. We need to make our way over there.\" Anne told her. They started to make their way towards the long trek ahead, when Elma's visor popped game messages into her vision once again almost taking her by surprise.

I mean how many times have you played computer games for 10 hours without stopping and there has been no effort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah that's a good point Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the tasks you have been given...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne) Get through puberty. <br>\r\nTwo) Deal with you're first period. <br>\r\nThree) Get good grades at school. <br>\r\nFour) Start birth control. <br>\r\nFive) Get a boyfriend and start dating him. <br>\r\nSix) Buy you're first bra with your sister or mother.<br>\r\nSeven) Join the school soccer/football team.<br>\r\nEight) Start doing an activity outside school gymnastics, kick boxing or ballet. <br>\r\nNine) Go out for a family meal. <br>\r\nTen) Find a crowd at school you are comfortable been with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMmm...

Sophie laughed and said \"maybe after you have showered and got dressed\" you look down and see you are wearing a black vest top and knickers that you slept in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later you are showered and dressed, you are wearing jeans, a Korn top, plain black socks and black trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to leave your mother smiled and said you both look nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both head into town and you get messured and your first bra although Sophie helps you pick about 10 bra's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou but one on under you're Korn top and you both sit down and talk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight Dani a task has been done..

The first thing that she noticed was the room he was in that looked like a cheap dojo, probably the one some of his elementary school friends mentioned going to back in the day. Then she noticed the small children of around, ranging from ages six to around twelve, and the twenty-something man that was going over random instructions. The last thing that she noticed was herself, namely that she <i>was </i>a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell just happened?!\" she cried out at seemingly random. All the other children looked at her in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Danielle, what's wrong?\" the strange man, who Danielle now saw was wearing a large gi similar to all the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" the girl hesitated. \"No, thanks for asking, Sensei Peter.\" Danielle held her tongue. How did she know the man's name? Also, why couldn't she stop thinking of herself as a her? \"Sensei Peter, may I use the bathroom quick?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not. Please hurry up, training begins in five minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hai, sensei,\" she responded while giving an honorable bow that she immediately questioned herself for. Even stranger was how easy it was to locate the restrooms and how easy she chose to take the girl's. As soon as she walked inside, Danielle looked into the mirror and the reflection it gave. In it was a small girl that looked similar to Sophie when she was little, if a little different. To be specific, the girl had long brown hair tied into a ponytail, a cute face that resembled Daniel's when he was small, though obviously much more feminine, an earring in each ear, and black gi held with a black belt.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he noticed the two girls looking at him weird, he broke into a cold sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what?\" he asked while getting off the wall and awkwardly getting into a more neutral position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why were you waiting for us, Kyle?\" Stacy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, who Danielle now identified as Kyle, gave an incredulous look, obviously brought on by embarrassment. \"I-I wasn't waiting for you!

Danni was surprised to find the small, pink backpack she had brought to her class with all the supplies she needed, including a plain blue lunchbox for her break. In it, she found a small turkey sandwich exactly the way she liked it: tomatoes, mustard, and pickles. She hadn't had this kind of sandwich since she was a kid! Granted, she was basically a kid again now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanni decided it best to sit in a corner of the dojo with Stacy considering she felt the safest around her. In fact, she was starting to feel legitimately close to the girl, even letting out a girlish giggle at a number of her admittedly juvenile jokes. Though, for whatever reason, Danni was not afraid to do so, as she was already starting to feel at ease of her new role. That was except for the aforementioned teasing, obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she was just trying to eat the remains of her sandwich or drink from her juice box, every single girl in the class surrounded Danni with the sole purpose of constantly trying to get some kind of scoop on her relationship with Kyle. They kept on saying how the two were both the best fighters they had, so it made sense for the two to hook up. That was without mentioning their constant bickering, of which some of the girls likened to that of an old married couple. After a while, Danni was just one small push away from cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that moment of instability that Kyle came over the girls asking, \"Could you give Danni some room, please? I think she's had enough.\" The mere sound of the boy's voice was enough to cause her to involuntarily punching him in the face. Hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" he yelled while grasping his face. It took him awhile to release it, revealing a bloodied nose. \"What the hell was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fight my own battles!\" Danni answered. All the kids in the class ooed and awed at her actions. Of course, this didn't escape the attention of Sensei Peter. </span></div></div>",

Anyway, she soon saw the car pull up, seeing her Mom come out. Guess that hadn't changed at all in this world. She wasn't happy at all of course, something Dani noted all the way back to home, which also looked the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will think about what you did, okay?\" said Mom sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Danielle said as she went with her Mom inside the house. \"Everything is really the same.

Soon enough, dinner was set, with the whole family at the dinner table. Daniel was asked about the new game, so which he thought that it was pretty good. His Mom and Dad had no clue about the fact that he had a female version or the fact that he was a 10-year old karate girl in that world. He didn't want to say anything to freak them out. After that, dinner was soon complete, and Sophie walked up to Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how much fun was it to be a little girl?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I ended up beating up one of the classmates.\" Daniel sighed, getting a laugh from Sophie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You actually did that? That's funny.\" she laughed again. \"So how long where you there? I read that each day in the game is about 10 minutes in real time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't keep track, thought I did go through most of the class and had lunch. I also had to be taken home.

He stared at the screen, where the screen simply said to press A to continue, and thought about whether or not to return to his other life a little bit longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wait, if a whole day is only ten minutes, then a night there wouldn't get me any sleep here,' he thought to himself. 'Best if I sleep here first.' With that resolved, he tried to go to sleep. However, as he did, he couldn't stop thinking about the game.

At first, Daniel thought he might just have a rat roaming his room. Then, he noticed a dark blob within the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sophie!\" he yelled at the unveiling blob. There stood Daniel's younger sister with a defeated look on her face. \"No wonder I couldn't get any sleep. Why were you creeping in my room?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only just came in!\" she defended. \"I was just interested in the game is all and wanted to find out some more is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you sneaked into my room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to see the instruction manual or maybe see if there was some archive footage or something.

Danielle sits up groggily and yawns in a cute voice. She rubs her right eye with her fist and looks over at Sophie's bed. It looks like Sophie woke up earlier and went down for some breakfast and cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle crawls out of bed and slowly makes her way downstairs. She tries to comb some of the tangles out of her hair with her fingers as she's going. She makes it to the landing and sees her twin sister sitting on the floor in front of the T.V. eating a bowl of Fruit Loops. Sophie is watching an episode of Spongebob on Nickelodeon. Danielle wants to join her, so she walks a little faster to the kitchen. She finds her Mom sitting at the table with a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, hello, Sleepyhead!\" She says, cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, Mommy!\" Danielle smiles at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want Fruit Loops like your sister, or do you want something else?\" She asks, heading to the cereal cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want Peanut Butter Crunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As always.\" Her Mom sighs. \"So, are you excited for your first day of swimming lessons, Pumpkin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Danielle replies, ecstatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They start at two this afternoon. That means that we need to start getting ready at one. Go ahead and watch some Spongebob with Sophie. I'll come in to turn the T.V. off when we need to get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Mommy!\" Danielle gives her Mom a quick kiss on the cheek, takes her cereal, and walks to the living room. She sits down right beside her sister and starts eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peanut Butter Crunch, again?\" Sophie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Fruit Loops, again?\" Danielle retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Sophie replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this exchange, they sit quietly as they watch Spongebob, laughing every now and then. Sophie starts giggling a little and looks over to Danielle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did I spill on my night shirt?\" Danielle asks and looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, just thinking about the joke we played on Mommy last night.\" Danielle starts giggling too. However, that isn't the reason why Sophie started giggling in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir Mom eventually comes in and turns the T.V. off. \"Time to get ready. We don't want to be late for swimming lessons. Do we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Mommy.\" Danielle and Sophie reply in unison. The three of them head upstairs where their Mom braid their hair, get them into their one-piece, pink swim suits, and puts sun screen on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you two wait by the door while I get my purse and keys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDanielle and Sophie wait by the front door while their Mom into the kitchen. Suddenly, Danielle remembers everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\" Danielle exclaims. \"We're in a game, aren't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just now remembered?\" Sophie giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, when did you remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour ago. You thought I was laughing at what we did last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Danielle says. \"How long are we in the game for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we can complete some goals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Danielle figures out how to view her goals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow many does she need to complete?</span></div></div>",

Wow.\" That was all Sophie could saw as she looked at the controller and monitor. She could see an icon showing Daniel on the monitor screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*****Apartment #303 (Game World)*****<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BEEP* *BEEP* *BEEP*<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nOne sleepy arm reached out and stopped the alarm clock, as the sunny rays of the morning shone into the apartment room. Trisha Johnson, a 28-year old woman, slowly rose from her bed, holding her blanket against her bare chest. She rubbed her eyes, getting used to the sun as she smiled. It looked to be another great day. Days always seemed to be like this during summer. She briefly looked down, seeing that she often didn't wear anything during summer. It was kind of hot for that. Oh well, she was on her own anyways. It was time to get ready for the day anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked out and showered, making sure every bit of her long blond hair was nice and clean. Right afterwards, after she turned the water off, she dried her hair off and grabbed a towel, wrapping it around her torso as she walked out to get some breakfast. Still wearing just the bath towel, she walked to her kitchen area where she tried putting together a bagel among other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she heard buzzing from her right. She turned to see her smartphone buzzing. She walked straight over to see something from someone named Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hey girl, don't forget practice today, okay?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she read that message, the lights went on in Trisha's head, causing her to fall back a bit. Reopening her eyes, she looked around in confusion. Was this the game? She looked down and immediately blushed, seeing nothing but a towel hiding her DD breasts. Suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious about it, Trisha looked around a bit frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the game world? I'm really a woman?\" she asked herself. If the text was true, then she really was now. And if this really was the game world, then she had cheerleading to do, and probably lots of it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Trisha could even consider her situation any further, she heard another buzzing sound from her phone. Looking down at the smartphone she had dropped, she saw another text had came in, albeit from an unknown source. Looking at it, she saw it read \"<span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">Congratulations on your first adventure with The Reality Game: Girl's Edition! It appears that you have chosen the life of</span></span> <span class=\"cred\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Professional Cheerleader: Age 28.</span></span><span class=\"cppink\">!</span> <span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"font-family:impact, fantasy\">As such, your first objective is simply this:</span></span> <font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"font-family:courier new, monospace\">Complete a single day of practice.</span></span></font>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheerleader just stared at the phone for a good while. All of this seemed so surreal to the woman, especially since she wasn't a woman but minutes ago. Or, maybe not. As much as Trisha remembered being a boy, she also remembered plenty of being a girl, a woman in fact! She remembered her daily routine, her dancing routines, her health diet, everything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just fucking weird,\" she said out loud, glad she had no authority figure to call on her or half-pint to tell on her. It was with that thought that she realized something: she had a different family now. Wherever his parents, Sophie, or Toby were didn't matter in this reality, as here she was born a Johnson instead of an Andrews. Trisha walked on over to her living room wall to see all the photos that hung. There, in the glossy pictures above, were her new parents, Karin and Henry, and her little brother Chris. She actually cracked a smile at the view of Chris, finding it rather ironic how she had a fifteen year old boy as a younger sibling now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amusement was brief, though, as Trisha remembered the practice that her BFF Ashley reminded her of, along with the game's challenge. She walked back into her personal room and got out her gym bag with her more casual wear before taking out her Denver Broncos' cheerleader uniform. Unlike most of the other fellow peers, Trisha always preferred to come to practice in her full uniform first, instead of just changing into it in the locker room. She couldn't help but giggle a little at how she ended up as a woman that seemed to like to wear as little clothes as possible. The rest of her immodest wardrobe seemed to draw that conclusion as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least this'll be an interesting life,\" she said to herself in the mirror before putting on her uniform. Trisha blushed a little bit once she was forced to see her new bare body in full consciousness, but the awkwardness was fading as she became more used to her beautiful body. Once she garbed herself in her proper attire, she got her purse, her phone, and her keys before heading out to her car.</span></div></div>",

It was a pretty nice one too; a black Dodge Charger. She went right in, crossing her legs a bit as she turned the car on and began moving. Frankly, Trisha didn't know how she knew where to go. Guess it seemed like the game was taking charge in some areas. She still remembered that this was a game, yet this \"Trisha\" life seemed almost as real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could remember all the routines, but she wondered how the actual practice would go, since it was given to her as a goal. To be honest, Trisha wondered if anything would happen once the goal was finished. Guess she'd have to wait and see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the Denver traffic was bad this morning, and she didn't really leave early to begin with. It was frustrating, and it always seemed to happen at the most inconvenient time. She looked at the car clock, seeing that it was a little past 9:00, which was the start time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she arrived at Dove Valley, and she immediately exited, as if on autopilot. She could see some of the others already warming up, and the head cheerleader, Diane, didn't look happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trisha, did you sleep in?\" she asked sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't wake up that late, but I'm sorry.\" Trisha apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure it doesn't happen again. So get warmed up since we're about to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Trisha could see Ashley, giving her a knowing look as if she wasn't surprised. Anyway, Trisha was able to put her valuables away, getting out to the floor again. She started to stretch, the boy part of her mind amazed at her flexibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a fun practice.\" she smiled.</span></div></div>",

Weren't you planning on beating your weight lifting record?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just come on!\" Ashley sighed as she grabbed her best friend and dragged her into the cheerleaders' private exercise room. There was equipment everywhere, from treadmills to ellipticals to exercise bikes to regular weight benches, with a couple TVs playing either local news or soap operas running. All the other cheerleaders got to one thing or another, some chatting amongst themselves, the rest motivating themselves with their own thoughts. Trisha was amazed at the sight of all the women working out like this, but not like he would be as a teenage boy. Rather than be aroused by all of them, she was more impressed at just how fit they all kept themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, better get to lifting~!\" Ashley chirped while giving her friend a big push towards the nearest weight bench. Trisha reluctantly got on it and started to lift the fifty pound weights on it rather easily. She was surprised at how strong this body actually was. Heck, it was probably even stronger than her old one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, adding weights!\" Before Trisha could question her friend, she began to feel additional weights being added, causing her former tranquil lifting to become a little more stressed. Then, Ashley added another ten pounds, followed by another. By now, Trisha was now lifting eighty pounds and beginning to struggle greatly. \"Come on, Trish, don't give up now!\" Another ten pounds, even more of a struggle. By now, she was having trouble lifting the weights. \"Just one more!\" Ashley added began to add another weight while Trisha was still holding the bar in midair, only to accidentally cause her friend to fall off the bench just by adding to one side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrisha ended up falling on the ground of the gym hard, the bar barely missing her neck while falling with her. The entire rest of the cheerleaders just stood there looking at their fellow teammate's near death experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry!\" Ashley apologized while helping sad teammate up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This freaking game's going to kill me,\" she muttered underneath her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing,\" Trisha brushed off. \"I think I'll go lay down for awhile.\" With that, the two went by the nearest bench, where Trisha practically passed out.</span></div></div>",

She nodded at Ashley, saying that she was fine, getting herself up from the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you ready to finish?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, what's left?\" Trisha asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a little more on our routines for the next game is all.\" explained Ashley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, Trisha didn't feel really up to it. Remembering what this game was, Trisha didn't exactly feel very confidant about it. She remembered that the goal set for her was to finish a practice, but that last event had left her a bit shaky. Just how was she supposed to handle something like that anyway? Well, there wasn't much to do about it now. She had to finish this, otherwise it would look very suspicious. With that in mind, she walked over with Ashley to where the other girls were, who also asked if Trisha was fine. She smiled a bit, seeing how worried they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, the coach got them together to at least finish up the routines. It all kind of flew by for Trisha, as if she was on autopilot. Perhaps it was because she wasn't really in the mood, but she would have time to sort it out later.</span></div></div>",

She purposely ignored the rest of her teammates, just so she could return home and hopefully think this entire game thing over. One near-death experience was enough for one day. However, just as she was about to start the engine, she felt her phone vibrate once again, signifying another text. Sighing, Trisha took it out, only to see another text from the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Challenge completed! Congratulations! You have earned: 5 points.</b>\" Inwardly, she was hoping for a bit more of a reward for almost getting her head smashed in. Still, the text was followed by another one: \"<b>New challenge: Collect groceries! List is located in notes</b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Groceries?\" she sighed to herself before switching to more personal thoughts. 'Well, I suppose if I live all by myself, I would need to get my own food and all that. At least I should be loaded with a job like this.' With that in mind, Trisha started up her car and left for the nearest market. Like before, there seemed to be a GPS in her mind that allowed to know exactly where to go. Before long, she had already arrived at the local Winn-Dixie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering, Trisha whipped out her phone and went to her notes to inspect her shopping list. All she needed was the essentials: meant, vegetables, microwavable meals, soft drinks (though only a single two-liter. Guess she just had to uphold a certain figure.), milk, and eggs. She maneuvered through the aisles with relative ease and collected all of her items in little time. Even despite never shopping for these things before, she still knew the best name brands to get and got nothing less. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle time had passed before the cheerleader had everything she needed to checkout. However, just before she reached the front, Trisha noticed a rack of various wines. For whatever reason, basic impulses built into her body caused her to grab a random bottle and put it into her cart. Apparently the woman she was inhabiting had some various habits that were beyond her control. Still, with her loaded credit card, Trisha was outside the store in no time and headed back home. Though, not before she received a text announcing another five points well earned.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><b>Co-created with Scifiwizard and Sentinel!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Reality Game, where one can explore multiple different lives. There are two versions of this game; one for boys and another for girls. Each version contains different lives that the player can explore. Here are some rules for the game:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The game changes reality for whoever goes into it, going right into the new life selected. There are several choices for each.<br>\r\n2. The player can save his or her progress to a thumb-drive and load it into another person's game in their home, allowing them to switch families in the altered reality.<br>\r\n3. Points earned in the game can be changed into cash in the altered reality that can be taken back with the player into his or her original reality.<br>\r\n4. Goals are set for each reality. For the football player, winning the national championships For the cheerleader, winning the national cheer leading competition.<br>\r\n5.Prolonged use of a single reality will cause the player to lose his or her memory and believe the altered reality is his or her own. (Much like becoming addicted to a game to the point you think you live in it.)<br>\r\n6. A female character can not return to her original reality if she becomes pregnant until the child is born. A male character can not return to his original reality if he gets a girl pregnant until the child is born.<br>\r\n7. Other setbacks will be power failure, damage to the controller or game system, a forgotten password, etc. Such a thing could result in the player being stuck in the game until further notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Daniel Andrews receives a version of the game. The female version, to be exact. Unfortunately for him, it will land him in a very unusual situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharacters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel Andrews: 16 years old and a sophomore in high school. Short dirty blonde hair and blue eyes. A bit shy but also friendly with some friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSophie Andrews: 14 years old and Daniel's little sister. Blonde hair past her shoulders with blue eyes. A typical little sister and a bit mischivious. Curious in seeing what her big brother would be like as a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToby Andrews: 7 years old and Daniel's little brother. Short brown hair with green eyes. Typical little brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, the rest of the rules are simple, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Keep it PG-13! <br>\r\n2. You can have sex, but not descriptive and try not to have too much.<br>\r\n3. Keep language PG-13 and also keep it tame (like not cursing every sentence)<br>\r\n4. Keep the story going and no killing the characters.<br>\r\n5. Try to make it a good length if possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost importantly, have fun and write good! Write well! Write...just be awesome!</td>",
