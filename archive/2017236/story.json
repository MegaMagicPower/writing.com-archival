At the end he cleaned up and packed up his things and their parents offered him a ride. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur was left to watch his sisters in the meantime but soon enough was distracted by his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW complained to herself.<br>\r\n\"It's not fair I'm big enough to take care of myself! I don't need Arthur and his friends here bossing me around! Sometimes I wish I were big enough to be in charge\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that DW found a strange looking gun with buttons knobs and a switch.<br>\r\n\"Huh what's this thing? Dads friend must of forgot to show us this one and take it with him\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe inspected it and tried reading the labels though in typical DW fashion she had a limited vocabulary and some trouble reading or pronouncing things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh Redjuice Enlarg Cotton Us  normal eyes? That's some weird things to put on it! I wonder what it does\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she turned the power knob up a little pressed the button she thought was \"Redjuice\" but was really \"reduce\" aimed at the sofa and pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue beam shot out and surrounded the sofa. DW watched in shock as the sofa began to dwindle in size smaller and smaller until it stopped at the size of a raisin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Whoa this thing can make stuff tiny! I wonder if it makes stuff bigger too\"<br>\r\nOn a hunch  DW  takes aim at her little  sister Kate<br>\r\n( <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://arthur.wikia.com/wiki/Baby_Kate\" target=\"_blank\">http://arthur.wikia.com/wiki/Baby_Kate</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pressed the button she thought was \"Enlarg\" and fired at Kate.<br>\r\nThe 1 1/2 year old giggled as a green beam shot out and surrounded her. Soon the baby began to swell in size her clothes and diaper growing with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate's growth didn't last long but she did end up double her normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thing is great\" exclaimed DW.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to her room with a plan no concern for the couch or the larger than normal baby sister she left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in her room DW turned the power knob up a tiny bit <br>\r\n\"I hope this works on me too\" she said then turned the gun on herself a fired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beam felt odd but not in a bad way. Suddenly DW Could see and feel herself growing bigger clothes and all. Bigger and Bigger she grew until after a few minutes her growth had stopped. Excited she measured herself finding she had stopped just shy of her brothers height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn I'm still not big enough to be in charge. On the other hand I still have this thing\" she said then an idea struck her. \"Why stop here? I should go out back and see if I can become big enough to be in charge of everything! It would serve the all right for saying I'm not big enough and give them a scare as payback\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went out to the backyard then looked at the gun.<br>\r\n\"I think I should test this \"cotton us\" thing too\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fipped the switch labeled \"continuous\" to the \"ON\" position.<br>\r\nNext she cranked the power up a lot more<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well here goes nothing! Look out Ellwood City cause DW is about to be in charge of herself for once\" <br>\r\nHaving no clue what she had just done or how big she was going to get she pressed the button aimed at herself then pulled the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the beam zapped her as she stood in the backyard.<br>\r\nSoon she began growing again. Slowly DW inched up in height. Soon she was 10 foot tall and still growing. She released the trigger as she his 15 feet yet kept on growing clothes and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept on growing bigger and bigger  until  several minutes later she stopped at a size bigger than a house, at 50 to 70 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDW looked at the house and herself comparing it to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/pklewd2015/status/656170078690480128\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/pklewd2015/status/65...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow that worked better than expected I'm bigger than most houses!

Rule her only two confides were her animal friends including her pet rabbit Clover and the magical amulet she wore around her neck which enabled her to communicate with the creatures that lived in the kindgom as she sat in her room rejected  once more by her far too important parents Sofia sighed to Clover as she fed him the usual carrots and celery <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Clover things were so much simpler when we were merely common folk living in the city at least mom and dad paid more attention to me now they're so incredibly busy they hardly have any time to spend with me and it's not just them everyone it seems is too busy to notice me even most of the citizens or even my old friends there has to be a way I can get them to notice me more.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe your magical amulet can help with that!\" The rabbit suggested \"After all it does have unknown and unlimited properties.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSofia stared down at her glowing purple amulet <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be silly Clover all it does is enables me to talk to animals and-hey wait you're right! After all I can actually summon and talk to other princesses of the world! Why can't it help me in this situation? Alright I'll give it a try.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up and looked at herself in the large mirror taking a deep breath \"Okay here goes....ahem Amulet I wish there was a way for people to notice me more,I want the whole world to pay attention to me!\" She announced proudly <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that wish Sofia.\" Clover warned starting on his third carrot \"Bad things could happen if you don't watch out!\" But for once she paid no heed to his words as this was what she wanted for people to notice her for a change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while absoutely nothing happened and disappointed Sofia sat back down onto her bed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhhh this isn't working! I ask one simple thing and it does nothing! It's hopeless I'll never people to notice me now!\" As she pulled the necklace off and tossed it to the side then slowly she got up after a while clutching her chest <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" The rabbit asked looking concerned as she gasped for air <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know I feel funny all of a sudden my whole body feels like it's tingling like everything inside me is slowly expanding.\" Sofia said then as she got up once more to see if she was coming down with a fever or something she noticed Clover wide-eyed backing up slowly from her <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clover is something wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Yeah look at yourself Sofia you're glowing literally glowing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh what do you mea....oh!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There's a certain innocence that comes with being a toddler. Truthfully, Melanie had no idea her big brother Kevin was upset with her over something she hadn't even realized she'd done. Every day for her was a new adventure, a new opportunity to learn and grow. She just had no idea how literal that was going to be (nor did she know what 'literal' meant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up after that good night's sleep, she had so much energy! She wanted to go outside and play as soon as she got the chance! Fortunately, she didn't have long to wait, as her mother came in and got her out of her pajamas and dressed into her clothes for the day before she headed out to run some errands. And almost immediately, Melanie toddled off to the backyard, giggling the whole way as she finally plopped into the sandbox. \"Make castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, little Melanie's idea of a sandcastle was just a large mound of sand with a little toy flag sticking out the top of it. So she got to work piling up the sand as best as she could, stopping for a brief moment when she saw Krypto come out of his doghouse with a yawn. \"Kippo!\" She wobbled her way out of the sandbox and hurried over to hug the white canine with a laugh. \"Love you Kippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, love you too kiddo.\" Krypto had to resist the urge to wag his tail. After all, a couple wags would be all it took to put the whole neighborhood on earthquake watch. But darn if Melanie wasn't just the most adorable little girl Krypto had ever seen. So innocent, so purehearted; anything she did wrong was never out of bad intentions or malice. It was just an unfortunate result of her young age and lack of knowledge. Sure, she'd learn over time. But as a 2-year old, Melanie's sense of right and wrong wasn't even close to fully developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that meant anything to Kevin, who judging by the grimace on his face when he came outside, was still peeved over Melanie ruining his school project. \"And there she is, completely oblivious to the fact she set me back two whole days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning at the comment, Krypto grabbed Melanie by the back of her pants with his teeth and dropped her back in the sandbox, giving her a few licks on her head which earned squealing laughter before the sand captured her attention once more. As soon as she was fully occupied, Krypto went over to Kevin, whose arms were crossed in frustration. \"It's not like she meant to break it Kevin. She was just curious. Human toddlers are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! And that's what bothers me!\" Kevin griped. \"If she meant to break it, at least then I'd be justified in being mad at her, but instead she's totally clueless and I look like the jerk for being angry over a ruined school project. And I have to watch her while Mom's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a jerk Kevin. You have the right to be upset about what happened, you just can't blame her for it is all.\" Krypto looked back at Melanie, who was still blissfully unaware of the discussion taking place. \"Tell ya what, why don't I keep her busy while you get a headstart on redoing that project? If I run into anything that requires opposable thumbs, I'll give you a bark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Krypto.\" Kevin's gratitude didn't seem sincere judging by the tone of voice he used. As he turned to head back inside, he looked over his shoulder for a moment to give one last glare at Melanie. \"I said it last night and I'll say it again. I wish so much that Melanie was bigger, then she could clean up her own mess instead of me having to do it for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful what you wish for Kevin.\" Krypto snarked with a raised eyebrow and smirk. \"We've already seen what Melanie can do as a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha, you know what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the powers that be didn't particularly care what Kevin meant. Fate and luck wouldn\u2019t<br>\r\nbe kind this day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Kevin and Krypto.</span></div></div>",

As she made her way over to the slide, she noticed that something was different about it, just like the sand. \"Huh?\" For some reason, the slide seemed...smaller. As she went over to the ladder to climb it, she noticed that it wasn't nearly as hard as it used to be. In fact, it was only the day before she still had to struggle to climb up the steps. And going down the slide wasn't as exciting as it used to be...like it ended way too soon. \"Too short!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, she went back over to the sandbox to look at her sand pile for a moment. That had been confusing too. Why did she have to pile so much sand just to make it the same size she always made it. It was a mystery she couldn't solve. Then she got an idea. \"Wall!\" She remembered that her mommy always did measurements on the kitchen wall. Maybe something had changed! Maybe she even grew! She always hoped to get big again like after she found the frisbee that one time. She didn't know why it made her big, and she didn't know why she got small again, but she did know that she couldn't wait to grow again. Maybe it was finally happening!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling to herself, Melanie walked past Krypto who briefly opened an eye halfway just to make sure Melanie wasn't trying to wander beyond the house. Seeing her go inside, Krypto was content to go back to his nap, unaware of the change that had taken place. She then toddled past Kevin who seemed completely focused on his school project, oblivious that Melanie was in the house. \"Kevin working.\" She whispered to herself before quietly going over to the wall with the measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow while Melanie couldn't read whose measurement was who, she did understand colors. Kevin's measurement was blue, while hers was pink. She tried to look where the measurement was supposed to be, but she couldn't see it, it was gone! \"Hmm?\" Then she looked down, and she gasped when she saw her mark all the way down to her chest. Somehow, she really <i>did</i> grow! Now she was the height of a first grader! Not that she could comprehend that. All she was knew for sure was that she was bigger, a lot bigger! \"Biggah! Biggah!\" She clapped and cheered, jumping up and down in celebration of her spurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie, shh! I have to work!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Melanie shushed herself again and walked back outside, looking around to decide what to do next.</span></div></div>",

She didn't know how she'd grown so much, nor did she know that at 3 foot 7, Melanie was now one of the world's tallest toddlers ever. Only one child on record was taller, and he lived in India somewhere. But almost certainly, Melanie topped the charts for girls. Most girls didn't reach her current height until they were at least 5 or 6 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie was only 2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she quietly made her way back into the middle of the backyard, she spotted the toy gun she found that made her feel tickled before. Maybe it was the thing that made her grow? If a frisbee could make her grow, maybe the gun could too. And she did want to grow more! She picked it up and pointed it at herself, pulling the trigger again. Unfortunately, nothing happened. \"Hey!\" Melanie hadn't realized that the reason the tickling stopped before was because she completely drained the battery shooting it at herself for so long. Pressing the trigger several more times and to no avail, Melanie frowned and tossed the gun to the ground, pouting her lips and furrowing her eyebrows as she turned away and crossed her arms angrily. \"Still broken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grouchily walked over to the big tree next to Krypto's doghouse, plopping herself onto the ground in frustration over her inability to get bigger...but it didn't last long...as a tingling feeling washed over her body, causing her to gasp in shock. \"Tickly! Biggah?!\" At that moment, Melanie did indeed spurt a little bigger. \"Slide!\" She quickly stood back up and went over to the slide as fast as she could to make sure she wasn't imagining it. And just as she reached the slide, she spurted even higher, confirming the toddler's suspicions. \"Biggah!\" A few more spurts put her at about her brother's height, about 4 feet and 8 inches tall. \"Biggah, biggah!\"</span></div></div>",

Still though, she was pretty darn huge for a girl her age, certainly bigger than any other toddlers in the United States. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walked around the backyard wondering what to do next, her eyes locked onto the ladder that led up to the treehouse. She'd always wanted to play there, but she could never get up there on her own and it always seemed off limits to her since she wasn't big enough to climb it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now? Maybe she could! \"Treehouse!\" Giggling to herself, she started the trek up the wooden planks nailed into the tree to act as a ladder, her little 2-year old heart beating wildly with excitement and even a little fear. She'd never climbed this high by herself before. But she really wanted to see what it was like to be in the treehouse all by herself. She grunted with effort as she made her way to the last plank, just one step away from reaching the treehouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she looked down, and her eyes widened in terror as she began to sob and clung to the tree with all her might. She definitely wasn't ready to climb the tree without someone there to make sure she wouldn't fall. \"Aaaaahhh! Kevin! Kippo! Heeeeeelp!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Melanie began toddling around the neighborhood, eyes wide with wonder as her perspective was completely unique at the size she was now. Everything looked so much smaller now that she was 8 feet tall, and yet things were still a lot bigger to her than when she was 25 feet tall. It was a brand new experience for her senses to take in and she loved the opportunity to try something new like this. Much better than having to eat green foods like her mommy wanted her to try all the time. But as curious as she was about her current view of the world, she still wanted to grow bigger soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes wandered over to Andrea's house, where she saw the girl playing with her cat, Streaky. Their next door neighbor was always really nice to her, making her brownies and playing dolls with her. And Streaky was such a cute kitty! Although she wished that Andrea still dressed Streaky up in dresses and other pretty clothes. Now he only wore things like sword man costumes. Why did Andrea stop? Her curiosity and desire to play with Streaky piqued, she changed course and headed over to the house, giggling with excitement. \"Steeky! Steeky!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her arrival didn't exactly leave her hosts feeling happy to see her. \"Uhhh...is that Melanie?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky gulped. \"Uh huh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steeky!\" As Melanie carefully stepped over the fence, she made her way over to Streaky who couldn't get away before Melanie wrapped her large arms around him. \"Good kitty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie! Put Streaky down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Want pet Steeky!\" Melanie hugged the feline even tighter in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Streaky was a super cat, so he wasn't squashed by Melanie's increased strength. Not that he found the experience super enjoyable either. \"Too much of anything, even love, isn't a good thing!\" Streaky twisted his way out of Melanie's grasp, much to the little girl's disappointment, and landed next to Andrea again. \"This kid's been eating way more vegetables than you apparently!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait, I remember Kevin telling me about this! Some alien friends of theirs came from space once and Melanie accidentally became a giant then too! Maybe she got a smaller dose of what happened to her last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steeky come pway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Andrea wasn't having it, stopping the enlarged girl in her tracks. \"No! Melanie, you sit down right now! I mean it!\" Melanie frowned, but obeyed the command nonetheless, plopping onto her rear end and waiting for Andrea to tell her what to do. \"Good girl. Now you stay right here, and I'll be right back with a niiice tasty snack, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the promise of a treat, Melanie beamed and nodded with excitement. \"Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect!\" Andrea then whispered to her cat. \"Streaky, think you can keep her occupied while I go get Kevin and Krypto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky's face took on a resigned expression. \"Oh sure, you leave <i>me</i> to do the babysitting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just for a few minutes! Are you a super cat or aren't you? Just don't let her wander off, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Andrea ran into her house, intent on going out the front door and getting to Kevin's house that way so Melanie didn't get suspicious. This, of course, left Streaky with Melanie, who was still smiling at him like she wanted to play. \"Guess being a hero is more than just saving the day...it's also making someone's day. Grrk!\" Streaky was immediately wrapped into another affectionate hug, giving up on trying to escape since now the titanic toddler was his mission. \"Well...it could be worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>NOTE to PrincessKooh: Please add extra options and remove this note after you see it.</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>3rd option: Melanie gets distracted and leaves to go do something else</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b>Feel free to add more as you see fit</b></font></span></div></div>",

Once he turned around, his vision was filled with nothing but a squealing, happy baby who was a lot bigger than she was supposed to be. \"Good grief! I've heard of kids growing up fast, but this is ridiculous!\" Streaky flew up to get a bird's eye view, just out of reach of the not-so-little girl who was stretching up to grab him again. \"She almost takes up the whole yard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky looked down to see Andrea had returned with Kevin and Krypto in tow, and they all looked positively stunned to see Melanie as big as she was. \"K-Dog!\" Streaky yowled and flew down before Melanie could snag him, hiding behind the super dog and pointing up at the toddler in fear. \"You gotta do something! There's something not right with this kid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that Streaky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krypto,\" Kevin spoke up. \"Did Seek and Pleek come back to visit while I was inside working on my project?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not unless they came, did this and left without me noticing!\" Krypto activated his x-ray vision to see if maybe Melanie had something in her possession that she wasn't supposed to have. But that was also to no avail. \"And it's not like when she got the teleporter stuck in her diaper that one time either. Whatever's going on, it's a mystery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andwea...snack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh...that's right.\" Andrea scratched the back of her neck and giggled nervously. \"I promised Melanie I'd bring her something sweet in exchange for sitting still.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if you want my suggestion,\" Streaky spoke up. \"I'd get started on some brownies or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Streaky's right.\" Krypto added. \"We've got to find out what's causing her to grow again, and we can't count on getting lucky that no one recognized Melanie the last time this happened. We've gotta try and keep her here so we don't end up chasing her around the city. She already looks bigger than the first time this happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. I'll keep her fed,\" Andrea turned to Kevin. \"You keep her quiet,\" Then to Krypto and Streaky. \"And you figure out how to get her back to normal!\" Andrea rushed over to get Melanie's attention, patting the giant child's belly affectionately in a show of good intentions. \"Don't you worry Melanie sweetie, Andrea's gonna cook up a batch of brownies just for you! But you be good, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod from Melanie. \"Kay kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Andrea rushed back inside, but not before stopping at the door to stare intensely at the boys. \"I just gave you a boost, don't blow it and make her cranky. I'll be back as soon as I can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did she get put in charge?\" Kevin grumbled to the animals. But his attention was quickly diverted when Melanie started wiggling in her spot. \"Uh...something wrong Melanie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boooooored! Want pway!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin gulped. While Melanie wasn't the type to want to play violent games, it would be an extreme blow to his pride to play the games she did enjoy. Playing with dolls was not something he enjoyed doing when Melanie was normal sized...he saw what dolls meant to Melanie when she was giant, and it involved Seek and Pleek wearing clothes other than what they came with...like a dress. <i>\"Oh man...I really hope she's not wanting to play something that's gonna embarrass me.\"</i> Steeling his resolve, and knowing that the only way to keep Melanie quiet was to do what she wanted, Kevin forced a smile and went over to hug Melanie as best he could. \"Sure thing Mel, what do you wanna play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdd options - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.

We can definitely play fetch!\" Kevin ran over to Krypto with his fists clenched and a huge grin on his face. \"Did ya hear that boy? She wants to play fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard, I heard.\" Krypto couldn't help but laugh at Kevin's raw excitement. \"But before we do that, I better make a costume change.\" Krypto began rapidly chasing his own tail until he was a whirling blur...and as soon as he stopped, he'd transformed into Superdog. \"At least this way, when Melanie throws whatever I chase, no one's going to question why there's a flying dog in the neighborhood.\" Krypto turned to Streaky. \"You better change too, just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fiiiine, but there better be a trip for some fish in my future.\" Streaky's entire body briefly became electrified, and out of nowhere, a short blue cape was attached to the feline's back. \"So...what exactly are we gonna give your sister for Krypto to fetch? It's not like a plain ol' baseball is gonna cut it when her hands are big enough to hold a whole person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...that's a good question.\" Kevin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of thinking, Melanie spoke back up. \"Fwisbee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat comment got Kevin suspicious. \"I thought you said she wasn't holding anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not. I don't have a clue what she's thinking of.\" But they didn't have time to figure it out, as Melanie stood up at her full 30 foot tall height, going back over to their house. \"Oh no...don't tell me she's gonna-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking twice, Melanie once again ripped the roof of her own house, only this time with an entirely new intention. \"Big fwisbee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's gonna throw our <i>roof</i> like it's a giant frisbee!\" Kevin shouted in horror. And sure enough, moments later, Melanie used all the strength she had to toss the roof as far as she could. Of course, given that it was still fairly big for her, that wasn't very far. Not that that mattered at the moment. \"Krypto! Catch that roof!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe super dog wasted no time flying into the air to intercept the roof before it could shatter on the ground below or hurt anything. Then he put it back onto their house and carefully sealed it with his heat vision, making sure not to burn the wooden parts and focusing only on the sealants. \"It's on tight Kevin! I'm gonna go find something a little less...risky to throw around.\" And with that he blasted off, leaving Melanie sad that the game was apparently over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mowe fetch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's okay Melanie!\" Kevin quickly shouted up at her. \"Krypto's just coming with something else we can use!\" He then added quietly to Streaky, \"I hope he shows up soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Krypto returned with a huge yoga ball. It was a little on the small side for Melanie's hand, but it would suffice if all they were going to play was fetch. \"Oooh! New ball! Fetch!\" Grunting with exertion, Melanie threw the ball as hard as she could, and it went flying over the horizon with Krypto zooming after it. Within seconds, Krypto returned and placed it at Melanie's feet with a pleased bark. \"Good Kippo!\" Melanie giggled as she picked up the ball and threw it again. \"Go fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll never understand how dogs can find that fun.\" Streaky rolled his eyes as he watched Krypto return with the yoga ball again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a dog thing.\" Kevin shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steeky fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky's eyes widened. \"Uh...say what now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure she wants <i>you</i> to play now pal.\" Krypto smirked. \"So go fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh uh, no way, I ain't doing it!\" Then Melanie threw the ball off into the distance, looking back at Streaky expectantly. \"I'm doing it, aren't I?\" the cat deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you want an angry 2 year old throwing a temper tantrum that'll be heard throughout Metropolis, yeah, you're doing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky grumbled and flew off - much slower - after the ball. \"This better be worth the trouble, that's all I'm gonna say.\" Streaky picked the ball back up and grumpily dropped it in Melanie's waiting hands, prompting the girl to laugh gleefully. \"Yeah yeah, I ain't doing that again. Keep playing with Krypto or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Streaky, Melanie seemed content to play fetch with Krypto from that point on, letting him and Kevin do some investigating. \"There must be a clue around here somewhere!\" Kevin exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got nothing Kevin.\" Streaky replied. \"Whatever turned your sister huge, it ain't in our yard. Might be in yours though, and your yard is full of Melanie.\"</span></div></div>",

After 15 or so minutes of throwing the ball over and over again, Melanie's smile started turning into a bored frown as she found herself wanting to do something else. \"Boooowed...\" Melanie whined, her 'R's' slipping away as a result of her limited speaking ability. \"Wanna play something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, a chill went down Kevin's spine. \"Uh...w-what'd you have in mind little sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna play house now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!\" Kevin covered his mouth with a gasp and looked up at Melanie, whose bottom lip was quivering at his outburst. \"I-I mean...yeah! Sure! House! We can play house! Right guys?!\" He received an exuberant bark and meow in response, and that was enough to make Melanie feel better and sit down on her butt, the impact bouncing Kevin a few inches into the air. \"Man oh man, I hope Andrea gets back here soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need mommy dolly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Kevin...\" Krypto spoke up. \"Remember what I said about being careful what you wish for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to rub it in Krypto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Andrea appeared. \"Okay, brownies are in the oven.

Go put on something nice and try to look like a daddy!\" Frowning deeply and his back hunched in anger, Kevin stomped into the house with Andrea and the others watching the whole way. \"Now you be a good baby and wait here! Mommy's going to go put on something nice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dwess?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep! A nice mommy dress!\" Andrea ran into her house, with Streaky unwillingly in tow. \"Be right back!\" In just a few minutes, Andrea returned wearing a blue dress with her hair out of its signature ponytail...and Streaky was wearing a sailor outfit for some reason. \"Here I am my big girl! So what are we gonna do first? Should we wait for daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Melanie clapped and giggled as she shifted slightly to look for Kevin through the windows. \"Keeeeviiiin! Need daddy dolly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay okay, I'm here. Sheesh.\" Kevin finally appeared with a grouchy expression on his face, wearing a suit he clearly didn't feel comfortable in. \"Happy...now...\" His voice trailed off as his eyes locked onto Andrea...and he found himself blushing. \"Andrea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Kevin?\" The girl batted her eyelashes at him as he walked closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I uh...\" He found himself blushing. \"I've-I've never seen you in a dress before...or with your hair like that before...you uh...you look good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why thank you honey,\" Andrea twirled and 'fell' into Kevin's arms, wrapping her own arms around his neck. \"You look quite handsome yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin couldn't help but notice that the display was really entertaining Melanie as the giant toddler continued clapping. \"You're really good at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...you could say it comes naturally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStreaky watched with wide eyes, finally gathering enough brainpower to poke Krypto's ear to get his attention. \"Uh, Krypto?

It wasn't that long ago that Kevin adamantly denied the possibility of having a crush on the girl next door...and yet, awkward though it may have been, Kevin couldn't help but feel his heart going pitter-pat after the kiss Melanie had - admittedly - forced them into. It was, after all, his very first kiss. \"So...what now?\" Kevin chuckled as he rubbed the back of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I'm really not sure.\" Andrea replied just as nervously. \"I've never done this before. I kinda liked it though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...me too...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Krypto and Streaky were still searching for clues as to how Melanie could have grown so drastically. \"Still nothing Krypto. Our yard's clear. What about yours? X-ray vision able to look past that ton of baby bottom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to take a glance into his own yard with his x-ray vision, Krypto gasped as he noticed something was very wrong. \"I don't have to look past anything!\" He exclaimed. \"Melanie's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Streaky yowled, flying up to look over the fence. \"How?! How do we lose something that big?! And without even noticing her leave?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll worry about that later, we gotta tell Kevin and Andrea!\" It took only a split second for the super pets to appear in the other yard, shocking the two older kids out of their infatuated gazes. \"Guys! Melanie's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Kevin looked around in shock, his heart now beating wildly for a completely different reason. \"Oh no...oh nonononononono! This is bad, this is really really bad!\" Fortunately, the sound of a giggle echoed from far away, and Kevin was able to spot Melanie several blocks away. Unfortunately, the reason he could see her was because things were still getting worse. \"Krypto! She's over there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks like she's gotten even bigger!\" Krypto lifted off to give chase. \"You two get changed back into your other clothes, Streaky and I will try to find a way to corral her back towards the house! Ruff ruff, and away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kids watched as Krypto and Streaky flew off to chase after the titanic toddler, leaving them to their own devices. Briefly, the awkwardness returned. \"Um...so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea placed a finger on his lips. \"We can talk about this later...right now, your sister is in trouble and we've gotta help her...and anyone else she tries to interact with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Kevin nodded. \"Do you think you can still tell Melanie what to do like you've been doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try.\" Andrea shrugged. \"My babysitting skills are top notch, but I've never sat for a baby that if <i>she</i> sat, she'd flatten whatever she sat on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess there's only one way to find out then. Meet you back here in a few minutes!\"</span></div></div>",

Naturally, Kevin and Andrea had to ride their bikes to keep up with the enormous steps that Melanie was taking. \"Andrea, I gotta say, you never cease to amaze me these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea couldn't help but blush. \"Well thanks Kevin, that means a lot. Maybe after all this is over, we can do something fun together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great!\" But Kevin's excitement soon faded as he remembered what he was doing before Melanie turned into a giantess. \"Oh...but wait...I still have to redo my solar system project. See...that's kinda how this whole mess started, I got mad at Melanie because she wrecked it the first time, and I have to do it all over again since it's due in just a few days. I have to keep working on it or it won't be finished in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem!\" Andrea exclaimed. \"I'd be glad to help you out!

Just nonstop niceness all around? I think I liked it better when they argued with each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax Streaky.\" Krypto rolled his eyes good-naturedly. \"They're just a couple of kids who like each other. Who knows? Maybe in a couple months they'll go back to being just friends, happens all the time with humans...\" He smirked. \"Plus...it's not like you haven't had a couple run-ins with some cats you thought were too good-looking to resist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We promised never to speak of those dark days.\" Streaky deadpanned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of a sudden, the peaceful atmosphere was disrupted by an all-too familiar jingle...one that Melanie recognized instantly and reacted to just as quickly. \"ICE CEAM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh!\" Andrea exclaimed. \"Melanie, no! We're going home!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ice ceam! Ice ceam!\" Even Andrea's influence wasn't enough to stop Melanie from going after the ice cream man all over again. She quickly changed course to chase the truck, and almost immediately, the truck accelerated faster and faster, no doubt the ice cream man was having flashbacks to his first encounter with an enormous tyke, except now she was even bigger than before. \"Come back! Wanna eat ice ceam!\" Melanie exclaimed as she tried to run and wound up falling over, causing a huge earthquake when she fell. But she was so focused on her goal, she just got back up and started chasing again, with the others watching helplessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Andrea, what happened?\" Kevin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea sighed and shook her head. \"I'm good Kevin, but not <i>that</i> good. When a little girl wants ice cream, there's no force in the world that can stop her from going after what she wants...not unless there's a bigger parent around to physically drag her away and deal with the tantrum afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can't just let her go after the truck, she could cause an accident and people could get hurt!\" Krypto turned to his super friend and looked at him determinedly. \"Come on Streaky, we've got work to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Current Size Estimation</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size35\" style=\"\"><b><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ibb.co/gb1xBFt\" target=\"_blank\">https://ibb.co/gb1xBFt</a></b></font></span></div></div>",

Wanna pway!\" Giggling to herself, she quickened her pace...although moments later, she did slow down as the tickly feeling suddenly returned, which Melanie easily recognized as her starting to grow again. \"Heeheehee, getting biggah! Biggah! Yay!\" Her footsteps became increasingly large, and the earthquakes with each step grew louder as she grew. Soon she was pushing 60 feet, then 70...she finally stopped at 75, the blue glow fading away once more. \"Biggah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the others just watched in complete shock, until Kevin finally managed to make some sounds that sounded more like he was choking than talking. \"She...she...she just grew again! She's humongous!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's worse, she's headed to the city!\" Krypto exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did either of you notice that blue glow that surrounded her while she was growing?\" Andrea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! What was that?\" Kevin wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might have been a clue.\" Krypto replied. \"When I got in close to try and stop her, I felt weak for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I felt kinda funny too while she was hugging me!\" Streaky added. \"Ya think we're causing her growth somehow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if that's true...then you can't help us stop her!\" Kevin exclaimed in horror. \"Oh man, what are we gonna do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they helplessly chased after the enormous baby, Melanie finally reached the city and looked around joyfully at all the buildings around her. Some were taller than her, some were smaller. She also saw lots of cars down below, most of them honking and driving away from the girl who seemed thrilled to be in this new environment. \"Toy cars?\" She picked up a taxi and looked inside, and saw someone screaming at the top of his lungs in horror. \"Oop...no toy, weal.\" She carefully placed the taxi down, and it immediately drove off with the tires screeching. \"This toy?\" Melanie carefully kept picking up cars, until finally she found one that didn't have someone inside it. \"Toy car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girl knew was what Andrea told her, that the people weren't toys and they needed to be treated nicely. But as long as there was no one inside, that meant it wasn't real right? it was a toy! \"Vroom, vroom!\" She giggled as she made the car she was holding drive along the sides of buildings, scaring all the people inside that were watching everything take place with fear. \"Car go fast!\" Then Melanie got on her hands and knees and started crawling, finding some space for her to send the car zooming down the street at over 100 miles an hour. \"Wheeeee! Hahahaha!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, Krypto got to the car before it could crash into anything and cause any casualties. While Melanie was trying to avoid playing with actual people, she wasn't taking innocent bystanders into account. The idea that the things she did without trying had an effect on them didn't even occur to her. \"If I get too close, she's gonna get even bigger...but if I can't stop her, then who can?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie! Melanie!\" Andrea shouted up at the child as she rode up alongside Kevin. \"You've got to come with us! It's not safe here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Melanie couldn't hear Andrea over all the chaos she was unintentionally causing. Horns beeping, alarms blaring, Andrea didn't even register in Melanie's ears. However, she could see just fine, and the golden globe on top of the Daily Planet once again caught her attention. \"Ball!

It seemed, however, that no matter how many times she tried to get a good grip, she just couldn't find a way to make it more than a few stories up (relatively low in her perspective) before she fell again. \"Need biggah! Wanna be biggah!\" Then, as if on cue, the tingly sensation returned, and Melanie grinned widely and clapped with excitement. \"Yaaaay biggah! Gonna grow moah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please no!\" Kevin begged to no one in particular. But his pleas fell on deaf ears, as Melanie's body once again began spurting higher and higher, the toddler giggling and cheering herself on as she quickly eclipsed 80 feet, then 90 feet, then even 100 feet tall was left in the dust as a result of this latest growth spurt. \"There's gotta be something we can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think at this point, we'd better forget about keeping your sister a secret.\" Andrea said with a frown. \"If your mom doesn't know what's happening by now, she probably has her head stuck in the sand somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Melanie's growth came to a halt, as she reached a massive 150 feet tall, which was double her previous height. \"Really big!\" She giggled as she looked around the area. Now everything was just that much smaller in her view. But then she looked back up at the globe on the top of the Daily Planet. Still out of her reach...but maybe NOW she could climb the building? Deciding to try once more, Melanie started climbing the building once again.</span></div></div>",

The building's foundations and metal beams creaked under the strain of Melanie's incredible weight, and the people within screamed with fear as they felt the Daily Planet struggle to stay upright. \"Want...ball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the reporters could see nothing out that side of the building except for Melanie's head or her overalls, depending on which floor they were on. One such reporter was none other than Lois Lane, Pulitzer Prize winner and one of the best reporters in the country...and though she'd had her fair share of bizarre scenarios involving Superman, this definitely took the cake for her. \"Jimmy, are you seeing-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A giant baby trying to climb the Daily Planet?\" Jimmy Olsen, a young photographer who wanted to make a name for himself replied back. \"I was about to ask you the same thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Melanie, all her pulling and straining as she tried to climb the building wasn't helping. She was definitely bigger, but her 2-year old body wasn't coordinated enough for what she was trying to accomplish. No amount of size would help her in that regard. With a final grunt of exhaustion, Melanie let go...and the earthquake caused everything to shake violently for miles, knocking people off their feet - including Kevin and Andrea down below...and the globe of the Daily Planet lost its foundation, causing it to fall from its perch.</span></div></div>",

That stomp caused the entire area to shake some more, cars flew several feet off the ground and tested the suspension beyond comprehension. Alarms blared as a result of the toddler's anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Kevin and Andrea, they were now shaking themselves off after being knocked down themselves. \"Melanie, you've got to stop! PLEASE!\" Kevin shouted as loudly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at this point, Kevin's voice was impossible to hear over the noises all over the city. Melanie's big brother was nothing more than another piece of the ambient Metropolis soundtrack. All Melanie knew was that she wanted to play with the ball, she wanted to be bigger! \"Biggah! Need biggah! Biggah! BIGGAH!\" Her shout echoed throughout the city...and it was at that moment, that she spurted slightly bigger, causing her to blink in shock. \"Biggah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no no no no no no,\" Kevin whimpered. \"Please no! No more! She's already WAAAAAY too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spurted a little bigger, and a little bigger, and a little bigger, and a huge smile spread across Melanie's face as the spurts continued, and the Daily Planet globe slowly decreased in size in comparison to her. \"Yaaaay! Me gwowing again! Biggah! Biggah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer growth slowly continued, and the globe soon went from the size of a yoga ball to a beach ball, which made Melanie a ridiculously huge 250 feet tall. All the while, Kevin, Andrea and the super pets watched helplessly. As she reached 300 feet, Melanie could now hold the globe with two hands, and she lifted it up over her head even while her growth spurts kept making her endlessly larger. \"Kippo!\" She shouted as the ball was now only the size of a basketball to her. \"Play fetch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...Streaky, get ready!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie threw the globe as hard as she could. It didn't travel far, given that she still had to hold her ball with both hands, but it was enough that Krypto and Streaky both had to get underneath it to catch it without collateral damage. \"K-Dog...\" Streaky groaned. \"This is real bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fetch, Kippo!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In giving in to the growing toddler's demands, Krypto and Streaky were becoming exhausted. Each time Melanie threw the globe, she would be bigger and so she could throw it farther. The farther she threw it, the faster they had to fly to catch it. The cruelest irony of all, is that because of the unknown phenomena causing her to grow in the first place, every time they got close to give her the ball back, it would speed up her seemingly never-ending growth spurt. The 2-year old girl was now reaching an incredibly massive 600 feet tall, nearly as tall as the Space Needle in Seattle. By now, she'd grown to the point where her feet were starting to bump into buildings without even having to move, meaning she had to keep readjusting her stance just to avoid crushing buildings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Andrea had no choice but to bike away to avoid being crushed, and the entire area had been evacuated except for police and other emergency workers. \"What are we gonna do Kevin?\" Andrea moaned in despair. \"She's just so big now! There's nothing I can do anymore, there isn't even anything THEY can do anymore! Is she just gonna keep growing and growing FOREVER?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, there's gotta be a way to fix this. There's just gotta!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we better hurry and think of something! Because I don't think Krypto and Streaky can keep this up much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrea's observation was correct. Now that Melanie had eclipsed 800 feet, taller than the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge, the globe of the Daily Planet was quickly reaching miniscule sizes for throwing to her. As for the super pets, it was still the same size and weight as ever, and they were panting with exhaustion from the eternal game of fetch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I'd say this...\" Krypto said with a gasp of air. \"But I never wanna play fetch again for as long as I live!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never wanted to play fetch EVER for as long as I lived!\" Streaky offered in rebuttal. \"K-Dog, this isn't getting us anywhere. The kid's so big now that I can't even see her face anymore from under here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she still growing?\" The sound of even more alarms going off and Melanie's booming voice giggling with a gleeful celebration of yet another growth spurt confirmed the super dog's worst fears. \"Yep. Stiiiiill growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow at 900 feet, the globe was small enough to fit in-between her fingers. Most buildings in the city below were merely tiny shapes from her perspective, as she was at least 90 times the size of an average Metropolis building. There was really nowhere she could see to put her feet anymore, but in her brain, since she couldn't see people, there was no one to hurt. So she stopped worrying about it. She could see for miles, and now when the ball came back to her, she thought the ball was just magically coming back since Krypto and Streaky were too small for her to see at her gargantuan size.</span></div></div>",

Not even close!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shouts of his three companions were ignored by Kevin as he rushed down to where the police were, grabbing an abandoned megaphone and rushing back to where he came from. \"If we're gonna fix this mess, we've gotta get her away from the city so she doesn't hurt anyone! So we've gotta lure her away from the city with something she wants, and what is it she wants more than anything right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kevin, you're telling us that you're going to make her grow on purpose?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young boy glanced at Andrea and nodded firmly. \"It's not necessarily what I want, but right now our top priority is getting her out of the city while avoiding breaking as much stuff as possible. Krypto, I know you're tired, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know Kevin.\" Krypto sighed and fought his way back to his paws. \"I'll get you close enough for her to hear you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin was picked up by the super dog, and with a whoosh, he was soon taken to Melanie, struggling to remember that he was in fact her big brother. At 1,000 feet tall, the only thing little about Melanie was her age number. Looking back at Krypto for a moment, he nodded at him and then turned on the megaphone to its full strength, shouting as loud as he could to get his baby sister's attention. \"Melanie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl finally blinked as her mouth made an 'o' shape and her head whipped around to look for the source of the voice. \"Kevin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She heard me!\" Kevin cheered and then went back to the megaphone. \"Yeah! Melanie! I'm here! Do you see me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the voice getting her attention, her huge eyes finally locked on to Kevin and Krypto, and she grinned a huge grin. \"Hi Kevin! Hi Kippo! You really little!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're really big Melanie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Kevin smirked and looked back at Krypto with a wink for a moment. \"But it looks like you stopped growing sis...do you wanna get even bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggah?!\" She squealed, nearly bursting their eardrums. \"Yeah! Biggah Kevin! Wanna be biggah and biggah! No wanna be small!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then follow us Melanie! We're gonna help you grow even more! You wanna be a big girl right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's go!\" Kevin nodded at Krypto, and the two began to fly away from Melanie, making sure that they were still in her line of sight, which was no small feat with how massive she already was. \"Ok Krypto, let's get her away from Metropolis and somewhere nice and isolated!

Obviously, it was said out of grouchiness and frustration, not out of a sincere desire for it to happen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, nevertheless, it had been uttered, and all through the night, Melanie tossed and turned, a big smile on her face as good feelings rippled through her in her sleep. Her dreams were filled with everything she loved and enjoyed. Dollies, ice cream, her mommy and daddy and big brother, and Kippo was there too! But not only that, in her dreams, Melanie grew really big!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd actually started out really small, smaller than usual. But as the dream went on, she grew bigger and bigger, until she was normal sized. That's when her mommy came in to get her, giving her kisses and telling her how much she loved her, and how proud she was of how big she was getting. <i>\"Biggah!\"</i> Her dream self had exclaimed, and at that moment she had another growth spurt right there in her mother's arms, almost twice as big as she was before! Over 5 feet tall! Not that she knew anything about the actual numbers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie clapped and laughed as her mother cheered her on, encouraging her to keep being a big girl and keep growing! It was funny seeing her mommy lifting her while she was so big. She didn't even seem to be bothered by Melanie's new weight, as she carried the enormous toddler down the stairs for breakfast. There she saw pancakes stacked a mile high, her favorite! Kevin and Kippo and Daddy were there too! Mommy said it was a big meal for a big growing girl, and Melanie squealed and hurried over to start eating, shoving pancakes into her mouth while her family praised her new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You grew again, huh Melanie? Good for you! Guess that makes me the little brother, and you the big sister!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's my little girl, although you're not so little anymore, are you Melanie?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh she'll always be our little girl, Eddie. No matter how big she gets.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe she'll get bigger than when she found that frisbee!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Kippo was talking in this dream! Melanie giggled and remembered when the weird frisbee made her a really big girl! She had so much fun with the horsies and the dollhouse and the ice cream man! She was a little sad when she got small again, but now she was getting bigger again! And she was receiving so much love for it. Then after she finally finished all her pancakes, she rubbed her tummy and felt a tingling sensation through her whole body. \"Oooh, feel tickly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hey! I think she's about to grow again!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I think you're right Kevin!</i> Mommy went and hugged her, and Melanie turned to cuddle her. <i>Are you gonna get bigger than Mommy and Daddy, Melanie sweetie?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This might be the one to do it!</i> Then her daddy came and joined in on the hug. <i>You can do it Melanie, grow really big for us!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah!</i> Kevin came over too now, and Kippo too! <i>We'll help you Melanie! Grow bigger and bigger, until you can touch the clouds!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Biggah! Biggah!\" And just like that, Melanie started to swell larger, her family cheering as each spurt made her feel more and more energized, as she grew closer to the ceiling every second. She was now bigger than everyone in her family, and she was still growing! \"Biiiiggaaaaaahhh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yay Melanie, go go go! Yay Melanie, grow grow grow!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Andrea was in the dream! And she was cheering her on too along with her cat. It was at that moment that Melanie's head hit the roof, but it didn't hurt at all like when she bumped her head on the slide outside. She laughed as her spurts continued, she was over 10 feet tall and climbing, she was now forced to bend down to find more room to grow. \"Getting squished!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's okay Melanie dear, you won't hurt us! Just keep growing!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're amazing baby sis! You're getting sooooo big!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wish I had a big little sister like you Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We love you too Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house shook and began to crumble as Melanie's growth spurts had her burst through the roof of the house. Now up to 25 feet tall, she was about as big as she was when the frisbee zapped her. She thought her growth would stop there, but she gasped in excitement when she realized that not only had her growth spurts not stopped, they were speeding up! She was growing even bigger, even faster! \"Biggah, Kevin! Biggah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yep, bigger Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother spurt put her up over 40 feet. Now towering over the whole neighborhood. \"Wanna gwow moah! Biggah an biggah!\" Now she was 50 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Grow Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n65 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You're becoming such a big girl Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n80 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>We're proud of you Melanie! Bigger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n100 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bigger Melanie!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n200 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bigger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n400.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Bigger!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n800.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heeheehee! Biggah! Biggah! Biggah! BIIIIIGGAAAAAAAHHHH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMelanie finally woke up from her dream, and she realized that she was still in her bed. She hadn't grown to the size of a giant after all. For a moment, she was sad, but then she felt really uncomfortable, like something was wrong with her bed. \"Nnnngh, tight!\" As she struggled to get out of her bed due to the safety bars keeping her stuck, she managed to give one real good tug that popped her out and accidentally broke the bed in the process. \"Uh oh...bed bwoken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got back up and toddled out of the room to find her mommy, she needed to tell her that the bed was broke. What Melanie didn't realize, however, was that though her dream hadn't come true the way she'd hoped...she had grown a lot, and she now was as tall as her big brother! About 4 feet and 3 inches tall, and much, MUCH bigger than an average 2-year old. Before she knew it, she reached her mommy's bedroom door, and that's when she noticed that she could reach the doorknob. She gasped quietly and looked at her hands. \"Biggah?\" she whispered in barely contained excitement.</span></div></div>",

Truthfully, Melanie had no idea her big brother Kevin was upset with her over something she hadn't even realized she'd done. Every day for her was a new adventure, a new opportunity to learn and grow. She just had no idea how literal that was going to be (nor did she know what 'literal' meant).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she woke up after that good night's sleep, she had so much energy! She wanted to go outside and play as soon as she got the chance! Fortunately, she didn't have long to wait, as her mother came in and got her out of her pajamas and dressed into her clothes for the day before she headed out to run some errands. And almost immediately, Melanie toddled off to the backyard, giggling the whole way as she finally plopped into the sandbox. \"Make castle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, little Melanie's idea of a sandcastle was just a large mound of sand with a little toy flag sticking out the top of it. So she got to work piling up the sand as best as she could, stopping for a brief moment when she saw Krypto come out of his doghouse with a yawn. \"Kippo!\" She wobbled her way out of the sandbox and hurried over to hug the white canine with a laugh. \"Love you Kippo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, love you too kiddo.\" Krypto had to resist the urge to wag his tail. After all, a couple wags would be all it took to put the whole neighborhood on earthquake watch. But darn if Melanie wasn't just the most adorable little girl Krypto had ever seen. So innocent, so purehearted; anything she did wrong was never out of bad intentions or malice. It was just an unfortunate result of her young age and lack of knowledge. Sure, she'd learn over time. But as a 2-year old, Melanie's sense of right and wrong wasn't even close to fully developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that that meant anything to Kevin, who judging by the grimace on his face when he came outside, was still peeved over Melanie ruining his school project. \"And there she is, completely oblivious to the fact she set me back two whole days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning at the comment, Krypto grabbed Melanie by the back of her pants with his teeth and dropped her back in the sandbox, giving her a few licks on her head which earned squealing laughter before the sand captured her attention once more. As soon as she was fully occupied, Krypto went over to Kevin, whose arms were crossed in frustration. \"It's not like she <i>meant</i> to break it Kevin. She was just curious. Human toddlers are like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! And that's what bothers me!\" Kevin griped. \"If she meant to break it, at least then I'd be justified in being mad at her, but instead she's totally clueless and <i>I</i> look like the jerk for being angry over a ruined school project. <i>And</i> I have to watch her while Mom's gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a jerk Kevin. You have the right to be upset about what happened, you just can't blame her for it is all.\" Krypto looked back at Melanie, who was still blissfully unaware of the discussion taking place. \"Tell ya what, why don't I keep her busy while you get a headstart on redoing that project? If I run into anything that requires opposable thumbs, I'll give you a bark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Krypto.\" Kevin's gratitude didn't seem sincere judging by the tone of voice he used. As he turned to head back inside, he looked over his shoulder for a moment to give one last glare at Melanie. \"I said it last night and I'll say it again. I wish so much that Melanie was bigger, then she could clean up her own mess instead of me having to do it for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful what you wish for Kevin.\" Krypto snarked with a raised eyebrow and smirk. \"We've already seen what Melanie can do as a giant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ha ha, you know what I meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the powers that be didn't particularly care what Kevin meant...as a sudden sparkle enveloped the little girl in the sandbox. \"Tickles!\" She giggled. And at that moment, Melanie began to slowly grow, unbeknownst to Krypto who seemed content to curl up into a ball and take a quick nap, soaking in the sun's rays. Melanie looked down at her sand pile, confused as to why it seemed smaller than it did a few moments ago. So she piled up more sand...only to find that it still seemed small. \"Need more sand!\" The girl sped up her work, piling up all the sand she could get her hands on until she was finally satisfied. She placed the flag on top and slowly got up to toddle towards the slide...totally unaware that she'd spurted up a whole six inches taller.</span></div></div>",
