I was tired, hungry and soaked from the falling rain. My lungs burned as I stared up to the sky wondering where humanity had run too. It seemed surreal to think that 'The Exodus' had only taken place a month or two ago. I blinked away a raindrop as it splashed into my eye and turned away from the gloomy cloud cover. Heavy footfalls in the distance told me that my time to rest had ended. I quietly put my hand on the log and turned my body to face it. I got into a crouched position so that I could peek over the log, what I found sent a chill down my spine. Two eighteen foot tall figures in high tech armor. To be honest, somewhere in the back of my mind I prayed that they were wild animals or... really anything else. But deep down I knew what I was running from; Corolians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're probably wondering what the heck that is. Long story short, they came to invade earth. The humans said something to the effect of 'get lost' and fought a war against them and lost. These people were far more advanced than us and came from god knows where... so no surprise that we lost. But to be fair they weren't ruthless. They allowed us to surrender and even helped get us ready for space travel. Obviously I didn't go with them.... why? IT'S FREAKIN' SPACE! I don't know about you, but I've watched plenty of TV shows where the captain of the 'whatever' and his crew were attacked by the flesh eating space parasite crab! Or the hit by the aganozing radiation of a neutron star! Oh no! Not me! We were meant to live here on earth and this is where I'm happy. If I have to deal with an alien overlord occupation and I get captured? Fine, at least I know that I probably will be killed in a civilized fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI honestly didn't know what they'd do to me if they caught me. I hoped that if they did happen to catch me they'd be merciful because I'm a nice human and not one of the rebels that hates them... however... The problem was that I was sorta trespassing on their continent... so... yeah. I didn't seem like they knew where I was. So I decided to leave quietly, no reason to stick around if I could make a clean getaway. I took two steps before I heard what in my mind at the time was ten thousand trees falling right next to me as I stepped on a stick and snapped it in half. I cringed and slowly turned around to find both Corolians coming for me. I ran as fast as I could and headed for the denser parts of the forest hoping the trees would slow them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn most foot chases, if you're running you shouldn't ever sprint unless you're absolutely positive you can ditch the pursuer in ten seconds or less. Otherwise all they have to do is keep you in sight until you stop to catch your breath and it's over. It's always better to move only as fast as you have to to stay ahead and either outrun them or out maneuver them. That said, when you're running ahead of someone four times your size with triple the stride... your not really gonna outrun them. Unless you can find good cover quickly... you're pretty much screwed. My only real hope here was to make it to a denser part of the forest before the overtook me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the trees got denser and the foliage got thicker, I was beginning to feel more confident about my odds of slipping away. I ran through the rain soaked leaves breathing heavily, I honestly had no idea how to get back to my camp from here but at the moment I really didn't care. I slowed my run down as I noticed they weren't behind me anymore. I walked and walked as my legs ached and my feet cramped. I wanted to stop and rest, but I knew better than to do that. Eventually I came to a river. It looked pretty deep and it was rather cool out. And while it's true I was wet from the rain, I was not nearly as wet as I'd be if I took a swim. So I opted to follow the river. I had no clue where I was or where I was going. I walked the river until I heard loud splashing and birds chirping frantically as they flew overhead in the direction I was headed. I tuned to find a Corolians making a dive for me in an attempt to catch me....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story is the first installment of a series, more will follow.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Living On Borrowing<br>\r\n\"How could this happen!?\" Sam muttered to himself as he navigated the titanic landscape that was a kitchen countertop. The human's eyes frantically scanned for a place to hide from the predators that pursued him. Though he didn't have much to work with, he found a small space between a large chrome toaster and the wall. Nearly falling over in an effort to change direction mid stride, Sam made for the toaster. He scrambled to get into the small gap, pressing himself as far back as he could. After a few tense moments passed, he sank to a sitting position and hugged his knees to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to check the kitchen!\" A distant female voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam's heart began to flutter about in his chest as the thought of one of those giant creatures searching for him nearby made him uncomfortable to say the least, not a small feat as there was very little that unsettled him. Broken bones, dislocated joints, explosions, even gunfire hadn't been able to phase him... but this was a whole new ball game. He could hear the sound of heavy footsteps entering the kitchen as one of the creatures set into the task of searching the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where could you be hiding?\" The owner of the voice mused as she moved about the kitchen. With each passing moment the human's worry grew as he heard his pursuer opening cabinets and moving bowls as she searched the kitchen. \"I know you must be terrified of us, but we won't hurt you. We just want to know more about you, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam remained silent as he tried his best to control his breathing. He wasn't sure if her hearing was that good, but he didn't want to the chance that it wasn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled shout came from another room in the house. The giant in the room with him sighed before calling back, \"No luck yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human withdrew to the confines of his mind wondering what he missed. At some point there must've been something he missed. Obviously she'd noticed him... but when? She played it off so well, pretending not to notice that he was there until she could get everything in place to catch him. She'd even enlisted the help of her friends. It had happened so fast, initially he'd made his daily run to the breadbox. He slipped in through the little crack where the door didn't quite close all the way. He unfastened the tie with care and great effort to access the bread, tearing off a few small pieces to eat before replacing the tie to the best of his ability and returning to his hole in the wall. He looked both ways and made sure it was safe to return. He left no traces behind, and yet he found his hole had been crudely sealed by a cardboard box the size of a house. At first it seemed to been bad timing and coincidence, but it was a bit too convenient for Sam to be so naive so as to believe such a notion. Chills ran down his spine as his eyes teared up when a large shadow fell over him and eclipsed the artificial lighting from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... he really is real...\" a male voice noted in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam turned to face the shadow, time seemed to slow as he stared up at a giant fox. The fox though, shared humanoid traits with Sam. He stood upright and was clothed in grey cargo pants and a plain green t-shirt. A canine snout protruded from his face while pointed fox ears poked out atop either side of his head. As befitting a fox his fur was colored as such with orange being the dominating color. The underside of his chin, muzzle and neck were white while the ends of his hands were black. His fur was a little unkempt, but he stood with confidence and he seemed to be the type that kept in shape, though not to an overbearing extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSam remained silent and frozen in place until the fox began to inch closer. Rather than wait to see what his intentions were, he opted to run. He scampered off away from the giant creature and rounded the corner where he skidded to a stop once again to find another titan looking for him, this one being a raccoon. Though she had her back to him at the moment she was the only one he recognized as the house was owned by her. She wore a pink tank top and a pair of loose fitting denim jeans. She had shoulder length black hair and a cream colored muzzle. Just below the waistline of her jeans was a long furry black and brown striped tail that swayed in a relaxed manner as she scanned the living room with her hand raised to her muzzle as she tapped a finger to her chin in thought. Two wide, pointed ears covered in black fur sat on top of her head. She was rather slender in form, her muscles well toned and her fur groomed to match. Sam started to back away from the Raccoon when the fox came barreling around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shelly, he's behind you!\" The fox called excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raccoon froze and turned to face the small human. Time seemed to stop as her teal eyes locked onto him the black 'mask' of fur around them seemed to highlight her eye color. The fox held his ground behind Sam to block his escape while the raccoon crouched down and moved closer to make an attempt at grabbing him. Sam knew that he only had one chance to get out of reach, and it required perfect timing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis story will be followed by several installments and is currently my primary focus outside of my novel projects... </span></div></div>",

He'd never heard of anything like it, but to be fair he hadn't seen anything like her either. It was hard to argue with evidence that was standing right in front of you, especially when it was walking and talking with you as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen many wolves in you're realm, but it appears that you only have a much smaller and less sophisticated species that dwell there,\" Shira mused. She then shook the thought from her head and pressed on with her explanation, \"At any rate, I'm a Viperwolf because of my ability to inject venom through my fangs into my prey like a snake.\"<br>\r\n\"I-I see?\" The human was confused but doing his best to keep up with his self proclaimed guardian's explanation. \"So I get what you are... I think,\" He replied, quietly murmuring the last part. \"I don't understand where I am though! How is it so warm here? And so much earlier in the day than when I left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" Shira nodded, \"Did you manage to catch what I said about the wolves in 'your realm'?\"<br>\r\nThe boy shook his head, \"No, not really. To be honest I was still stuck on you being a giant wolf....\" He admitted.<br>\r\nShira chuckled, \"Understandable, but to answer your question in the simplest format; you've crossed a doorway between worlds. This place is a center point where various worlds in different times and spaces intersect. Think of it as a giant trading center for different dimensions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing! I never would have believed that such a place could exist! That's so neat!\" The human exclaimed while taking the time to stop and take in the sights around him with newfound appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShira couldn't help but smile at his wonder and enthusiasm. \"It's definitely the top tier as far as prime land goes,\" She chuckled. \"So keep in mind, as you walk through the city you'll see lots of creatures and races that you've probably never seen before. The realm you came from was pretty closed off, so I don't expect you to be all that aware of what you may be exposed to here, so try to keep an open mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sounds incredible... but... is really okay for me to be here? I mean, the place I came from had lots of people who hated me being around town, they even tried to hurt me...\" The boy paused and rubbed the side of his shoulder while casting his gaze to the side as recalled the horrible chases and beatings he endured for the sake of simply stealing what meager rations he could from the leftovers that were left out at the bakeries and deli at night. though he never took more than he needed and always made sure to take from the leftover's which were usually thrown out or fed to the animals, the people still hated for it. Or more accurately, they hated the idea of a filthy orphan running around their town. They saw him as an outsider, a blemish... a rodent that needed exterminating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aerostellia isn't as narrowminded as the town you came from. There are beings from every imaginable background here intermingling with one another,\" Shira assured him, \"If anything I'd wager that they'd be more curious about you being a human. And if they do decide to make trouble for you then I'll protect you, I am you're guardian after all!\"<br>\r\nThe human blinked as he looked into Shira's fiery eyes. That's right... she kept saying that, but what did it mean?\"<br>\r\nBefore he could ask Shira abruptly stopped in front of him, \"At this rate, it'll take us far too long for my liking to get where we're going.\" She then crouched low to the ground laying on her belly, \"Here, we'll get there faster if I set the pace.\"<br>\r\n\"You want me to ride you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can keep up with me at my full stride?\" Shira asked with an amused smirk. Rather than offering a retort, the boy simply did as the Viperwolf wished and climbed up onto her back. She then rose to her full height and trotted of toward the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was going to ask you...\" The human started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Shira asked keeping her focus on where she was headed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you keep calling yourself my guardian?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because... you're my knight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your knight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the complete second installment of the series \"The Fate Of Aerostellia\" if you want to read the rest of this series and watch it progress, you can follow on my page at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/deltawhiskey\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.patreon.com/deltawhiskey</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This is a story that initially was intended but due to a series of unfortunate events (excuse the pun) I lost interest in writing it and never finished it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve since started writing again and am nearly finished. This is a preview of the first draft. Any feedback would be appreciated, when complete, this novel will be for sale on amazon. Enjoy and thanks for reading!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChapter 1 Part 1<br>\r\n <br>\r\n <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A frantic and exhausted human burst through a cluster of bushes and into a clearing, a place he did not want to be. He took a moment to determine the best direction to run in, only a moment and no longer as he knew that he wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the clearing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only occupant if he lingered for too long. Just as he disappeared back into the foliage of the woods, a white blur emerged from where he had come. It stood still for but a fraction of an instant before giving chase to its prey.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A sneaker clad foot crashed through a murky puddle of water that lay on the forest floor. The owner of the shoe ran as if his life depended on it, and it very well may have. He was ahead, but he knew that if he slowed down or made even the smallest misstep, that would change. And even then, the creature that he was competing with had four legs to his two. That in itself would have been enough to double its speed, but the sheer size of the creature served to further its advantage in speed not to mention strength.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it? Where did it come from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d  The human wondered as he slid down a leaf covered embankment. Branches of fallen trees and small shrubs grabbed at his cloth hoodie and clawed it his face. Once he reached the bottom of the slope he rose to resume his mad dash through the woods. However, he froze as a silhouette blotted out the moonlight that shined down through the canopy of leaves from overhead. The figure landed forcefully on the ground several feet away from him causing dust and leaves to shoot up and flutter back to the ground after its initial impact. This was the first time that the human had gotten a clear look at the creature. The first thing the human noticed were the eyes. They were a deep amethyst color, they emitted a sense of purity and tranquility. They may have even calmed the frantic youth if it weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t for the bared fangs that resided in its maw. Looking at it, it looked almost like a wolf. The key word in that sentence being almost. Its fur coat was reminiscent of a white tiger with black stripes blanketed over a solid white. It was absolutely massive, standing at close to six feet in height at its shoulders. Its body, though large, was fairly trim and sleek for its size. Its bulk evenly distributed with its fur coat hiding the powerful muscles that lie beneath it. A long black and white tail stood pointedly on end behind it. It was long like that of a tiger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s but oddly plush like a wolf\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. Of course, the last details that stood out to the frightened young man were the pointed ears that lay flattened back against its skull and the extended claws on its paws.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0After taking in the terrifying though majestic sight of the creature the youth thought about what might be written of him when his remains were found, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can see it now\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cRay Kivaul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death at the hands of newly discovered species\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts of his obituary came to an abrupt end as he noticed that his predator was slowly advancing on him. It kept its snarl on its face and its body low to the ground as it approached. Fully aware that he was in no condition to run and likely standing on what would soon be his final resting place he picked up a large branch that had tumbled down the embankment during his short slide earlier and wielded it like a bat as he prepared to make his final stand.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have to die here, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going down without a fight,\u00e2\u0080\u009d He said as he glared bitterly at his opponent. The creature snarled at him, seemingly in response to his declaration. After what seemed like an eternity went by, Ray had finally lost his patience with the creature, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gonna kill me then do it already!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As if taking that as its que the predator leapt at its prey, claws poised to strike and fangs bared. Ray swung the branch as hard as he could when he was sure that his target was in the air and couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t avoid the blow, in the same instant he shifted his weight and took a stride to the right, like a baseball player hitting a grand slam. He felt the makeshift club stiffen in his hands before it suddenly became weightless while an earsplitting crack echoed throughout the forest in the still night air. Ray stumbled to the ground having been thrown off balance from the shift in weight when the branch broke against the side of the attacker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s snout. After tumbling to the ground Ray wasted no time in getting back to his feet to see the results of the exchange. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d hoped to see the creature sprawled out on the ground, he expected to find the creature growling at him from distance as it prepared to attack again, what he actually found was said creature baring down on him. It was completely unfazed by the attack and now it was right on top of him. It lowered its head and slammed the flat of its skull against his abdomen. Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was lifted off the ground and tossed through the air before he landed on his back. Coughing and sputtering from the, impact Ray attempted to roll onto his knees to get back on his feet. His predator though, placed a large paw on his chest. He was now effectively pinned to the ground, and despite the adrenaline that still flowed through his veins, he did not have the strength to stay in the fight.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI already told you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray wheezed as he remained on the ground held firmly in place, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to kill me, then get on with it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He never was one for theatrics, and this had by far been the most theatrical and dramatic night in his life. As if taking his words to heart the creature reared its head back, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no way out this time\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray though as the creature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head came down and its jaws clamped down on his right arm. Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupils shrank and his legs kicked uncontrollably as he felt the predators\u00e2\u0080\u0099 fangs pierce through his bicep and sink into his bone. For all his pain and suffering in that moment, whatever was left of Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rational mind picked up on something odd, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not tearing me apart like an animal should, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just holding me like this\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Of course, that thought only lasted for but a mere instant of time as it was drowned out by the sheer amount of pain that was overwhelming the youth. Eventually, after what felt to be an eternity of pain and suffering, Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision began to blur. Everything faded to a hazy collage of colors before eventually fading into darkness.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The sound of bird songs combined with the sting of cold water droplets landing on Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unconscious body caused him to stir and groggily wake from his sleep. He rolled onto his side as he waited for his thoughts to become coherent again, blinking away the sleep from his eyes as he waited. As his vision cleared, memories of the previous night began to rapidly resurface. Images of running through the forest from an unknown predator. Flashbacks of being pinned to the ground by said predator and of course the last event he could recall was that of several large fangs piercing into his arm. The glazed, uncomprehending look on his face suddenly changed to one of realization. He lurched up into a sitting position and scanned his surroundings. It was clear that he was in a cave. It wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very large, just a hollow and circular chamber of stone that had been carved by time. The only light that illuminated his surrounding came in the form of sunlight. The mouth of the cave was large and unobstructed, allowing the natural light to flow in and bathe the cave in a warm and natural glow.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray wondered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI remember it biting me, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in any pain\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought as he glanced down at his right arm. There were holes in the sleeve of his jacket where he had been bit. Carefully reaching over with his left arm, he found to his bewilderment that all traces and evidence of the injury had completely vanished from his arm. It was as if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never happened. Ray shook his head, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have healed already\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Or did that creature have something to do with this too?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray muttered to nobody in particular. While he continued to ponder and theorize on what was happening, the surroundings became considerably darker. Looking up, Ray found that the wolf hybrid from the previous night was standing in the entrance to the cave. He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bother to move, he knew he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escape without fighting the wolf and it seemed to know that as well. He kept a blank expression on his face, not knowing what to expect. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seems much calmer than it was last night\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray thought as he continued to observe the cave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second occupant, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI take it you brought me here after I passed out last night\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d thank you for finding me shelter if I could be sure that you weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to kill me\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray muttered.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no intention of killing you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0At that moment, the human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s blood ran cold. He stared at the creature in disbelief, had he been standing, he would have fell over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cD-did\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 did you just\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 speak?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Ray noted that the voice was feminine. Strong and powerful, but definitely feminine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to apologize about last night, unfortunately I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in my right state of mind and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure that I must\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve looked like a wild animal from your point of view.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression changed from awe to annoyance as he recalled the events that led up to that morning, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would be putting it mildly to say the least.

Remorse? It was hard to tell with something that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t human, but there was definitely enough there to make out that she wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happy.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI truly am sorry\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 But I really couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help it\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d She then paused as though a thought had struck her, but she seemed hesitant to share it.

And I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just pretend like last night just didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen and go about my routine, especially with you standing here in front of me! I mean\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what are you anyway? A wolf? A tiger? Or both? Because honestly, you look like both, but last time I checked, tiger wolf hybrids weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even a thing, and even if they were they certainly wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to talk!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The creature chuckled at the human\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response leading him to assume that she found his confusion somewhat amusing, \u00e2\u0080\u009cActually,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She started, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m neither. In fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not even from this world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray stared at her trying to piece together what he was hearing. His brow furrowed while his lips quirked into a quizzical expression as he tried to decipher what his newfound acquaintance was trying to tell him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m from a planet called Sarnoaval. I fell to this planet last night and landed in a zoo in a nearby city. It just so happened that I landed between the tiger and wolf exhibits and ended up taking this mixed form you see now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face was totally blank as he tried to comprehend and process what he was hearing. He was talking to an alien that had taken a hybrid form of a tiger and wolf. Words seemed to flee from him as he struggled to find something to say. His conversational partner seemed to sense that he was feeling a bit overwhelmed and gave him a sympathetic smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know it must be difficult for you to grasp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is necessary for you to understand what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to tell you next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray shook his head and ran a hand through his hair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYeah, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just kind of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 wow?

How did you even get here? I mean, didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you have a ship or something? And why did you have to take an alternate form to begin with?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The Sarnoavan nodded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBoth fair questions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo answer the first one, no. I did not come in a ship. I suppose \u00e2\u0080\u0098fell\u00e2\u0080\u0099 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the proper word, but it still seems like the most appropriate. I was actually launched from my home world to earth with a sort of matter transporting device. It works kind of like a slingshot. But to survive being literally hurled through space and crashing onto another planet, the device converts the matter into a sort of \u00e2\u0080\u0098shadow jelly\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human blinked in confusion at the explanation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have the technology to do all that, why not make it put you back together in the same form that you were in originally?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat would have been safer and strictly speaking, we do devices that are designed to do just that. However, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have access to our standard technology because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fugitives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She explained.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray raised an eyebrow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFugitives? So then, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a criminal?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We knew this world was populated with intelligent life and we also knew that we would be safe here. Earth used to be a site for harvesting natural resources for our own world thousands of years ago.

Several names came to mind, but none that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d consider calling her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is harder than I would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve imagined it to be\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d He thought, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re talking about naming something that, up until a moment ago didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After thinking hard on it, a vague memory resurfaced in Ray\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.

Eventually she turned her eyes back to him while the edges of her mouth quirked up into a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI like it, Sadie it is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray nodded in agreement with a smile of his own, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know why this makes me happy, but it just does,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he thought to himself as he watched Sadie shift herself so that she was laying down with her head resting atop her forepaws which were crossed in front of her body.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Once she was comfortable she began speaking once more, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow then, I think you have the basic gist on what led up to this moment, so now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to fill you in on the process I mentioned earlier. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m just going to give it to you in a nutshell, when I bit you last night there was an exchange. My fangs penetrated your bone and injected a biological chemical compound into your bone marrow. That chemical is currently rewriting you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re DNA as we speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Struggling to keep himself from panicking, Ray simply nodded as calmly as he could. Sensing his alarm Sadie hastily pressed on with her explanation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe changes to your DNA will allow you to do things that you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t before. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll heal faster, jump farther and move quicker than any normal human.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray arched an eyebrow up at her explanation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you saying that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going to be some kind of superhero?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He asked incredulously.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Sadie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face twisted in confusion before comprehension filled her face, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d She chuckled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot exactly. You still have limits; they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just been set a bit higher than their\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 \u00e2\u0080\u0098default\u00e2\u0080\u0099 settings.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Ray nodded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 suppose that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s believable.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                \u00e2\u0080\u009c<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter whether you believe me or not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sadie returned in an even tone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt happened, the only question now is what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeaning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done all I can to make sure that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re up to speed on why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come here. The question still remains though; will you help me and my allies change my world?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She asked. Her expression was grave but she asked the question so casually.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose I said yes? What could I do to help you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray asked.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you were fighting an opponent of equal strength, would it not help to have an ally? Even if said ally only had half of your strength?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She reasoned.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The human nodded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t argue with that logic. So then, what if I said no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d head back to my planet rather depressed and hope the others had better luck than me. What I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done with you can only be done once, I cannot duplicate the process with another human.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ray now understood the importance of what was happening to him and the role that he could play in the fate of these Sarnoavans\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 if that was what they were actually referred to as. Not only did ray feel a sense of compassion for Sadie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plight, but he also felt a sense of responsibility. He now had something that no other human did. He had the power to help change that fate of another planet.<br>\r\n                <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sadie asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                </span></div></div>",
