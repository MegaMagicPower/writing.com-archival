This is not your lab. Wooden flooring stretches into the horizon with imperections in the wood that you could probably fit your body into were you to try, thick oaken tables and chairs stretches skyward, some one them filled by equally titanic members of various races. You had shrunk to a negligible size, and if the rowdiness and laughter that carries on the mead soaked air is anything to go by, this is a tavern at one of the busiest times of day. As you try to take in the grandness of your environment, you thank the stars that the spell had deposited you at right next to one of the corners of the tavern where you were unlikely to meet the booming feet of any of the inn's patrons, be they boots, paws, hooves or otherwise. This should give you some time to plan ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that your best option is to try and get the attention of one of the many patrons of the bar and hope that they are willing to help you at your diminuitive size.

Often strict and militaristic, you've never seen an orc smile or laugh at a joke in your laugh and judging by the grim expression on the tusked lips of this one, you doubt that's going to be any different. That isn't to say orcs can't be helpful or even kind, it's just they rarely show any form of emotion other than apathy or rage in the heat of combat. You feel that the orc will at least take your situation seriously if he finds you and is one of the closest patrons to you - which will certainly reduce the risk of being trampled on or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSticking to the edge of the wall, you avoid the thundering footsteps of the tavern's guests. You however, can't do much against the whirlwind of dirt and dust that is kicked up against you on your journey, as you shield your head from some of the larger pieces of debris; you also can't do much to protect yourself from the smells that permeate your nostrils this close to the floor, particularly that of dirt and unwashed fur. Still, you make it to the booted feet of the orc without much stress and are now able to take into account the immenseness of the green skinned creature before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cracked ravines of boot leather loom above you as it stretches upward to the frayed trousers of the orc. Further above, the green muscled plains of the torso are covered by little more than a leather vest as you gawk above at the apathetic tusked face occasionally taking in vast amounts of ale. You need to decide how you're going to get this titan's attention, climbing him is an option but orcs aren't exactly a small race, typically standing a few inches higher than most humans like you. Another option is to climb the bar or chair to get to a better position to get his attention or to just bang against his foot and hope he doesn't assume you're an insect.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It is quite difficult to ignore the absolutely gargantuan yellow skinned creature standing just adjacent to the bar drinking what looked to be something more akin to a barrel of ale than a mug like the other patrons. Obviously even the smallest of creatures towered over you at this size but the titanic goblinoid made everything else in the room seem just as small as you. Bugbears generally aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, and can be prone to violence when they don't understand things but for the most part are generally docile creatures, even to those smaller than them. In addition, he isn't particularly far from you and is standing in relatively quiet section of the bar.so the foot traffic to get to him should be fairly light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour trip to the titan is relatively unneventful as you navigate the imperfections in the wooden floor on your approach; you do narrowly avoid a large paw slamming down on you at the midpoint of your journey, its owner not even noticing the crumb sized human it could have crushed but soon you are at the base of the mountain and good stars, this gargantuan did not get any smaller on your trek over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong jet black claws jut out like some kind of warped construction ahead of you, not assisted by the large, brown furred humanoid feet that flanked it. A pair of tattered trousers (the only thing the bugbear wears) stretch upwards like a pair of monoliths before reaching the massive hill like gut of the creature, the brown fur upon it stretching across it like a distant forest. You are just barely able to make out the face of your possible saviour behind the excessive paunch, but are able to make out a very distant goblinoid face, uncaring to the issues that go on underfoot. It goes without saying but climbing this creature would be no easy task, even with the fur to help you assist in climbing; that being said, an equally valid option would be to attack his foot to get his attention.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, thus far this had only extended to some spillage upon the thick pelt of the creature but unfortunately, your luck wouldn't last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the creature took one more swig of the beverage, he had clearly misjudged the speed at which he did so causing some of the ale to overspill. Ordinarily, this would have fallen onto his pelt but it seems that this time the liquid has a different destination in mind. The floor, where YOU are standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a bit of spilled alcohol in a pub is nothing to cry about but that's when it isn't the size of a descending lake. You brace yourself as the lake of ale crashes to the ground before you and a rolling wave of brown liquid threatens to pull you under. Panicking and struggling to breathe, you desperately try to regain your composure as the wave settles and you're able to swim in the relatively shallow lake; the situation was absolutely terrifying but you had pulled through with little more than a scratch. As your view returns to the visage above, you realise something is very different. The bugbear is looking right at you. Well, probably at the spilled ale and not you, but this is still a good opportunity to get his attention without the arduous climb. Desperately hoping to get the creature's attention, you wave your arms as much as you can in the shallow pool of ale as the bugbear looks on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fixation from the bugbear continues until it looks like he's doing something. Had he seen you? Or maybe he's just going to clean up the mess he made? It's difficult to say and your only option is to watch the titan put his ale to one side. The bugbear proceedes to bend down and get onto both knees, the very foundation of the tavern seemingly shaking as each knee drops to the floor, kicking up waves of the ale and threatening to pull you under once again. The horizon spanning face only gets larger as he inspects the spillage before him and you're able to get a better look at his face. A forest of fur spans the outside features of his face, resembling a large bushy beard and sideburns as they reach up to the large pointed ears of the creature. Each ear adorned with golden earrings twitches slightly at the sounds around the busy inn. As your eyes move towards the eyes of the beast, it is difficult to ignore the large cavernous mouth spewing a concoction of alcohol and whatever food the beast had earlier, causing you to gag. Lastly you notice the eyes spanning your entire vision, the piercing amber yellow eyes of the creature glare into you as he looks on quizzically.

Slowly but surely the large worm like tongue of the behemoth works its way out from its place of rest and you realise what the creature was doing. He was cleaning up his mess, without any of it going to waste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising this you try to swim to the edge of the pool of ale and find some route of escape but even as you do so you realise any action is too late at this point. The large tongue of the bugear extends upwards like a heavenly tower as it contacts the floor below, eagerly advancing as it begins to happily lick up the pool of ale before you. The waves crash against you and soon, the wall of pink is upon you. You are unable to do anything but grab onto the taste buds of the rolling wall as it returns to its home inside the maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouth closes behind you as you are deposited into the dark and humid mouth with little more than the smell of alcohol and the sound of pulsating flesh to keep you company. You bounce around as you feel your large captor get off of his knees and return to the bar, before he does so however, he has one last thing to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding on and hoping that this isn't the end for you, the ground below you starts to undulate and raise into the air. There is little you can do as the undulations throw you to the back of the throat and a large GULP deafens you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the esophagus pulls you down to the belly of the beast, you think over the choices you had made. If only you had chosen a different creature or had just decided to climb the bugbear instead of waiting around... It was no use admonishing yourself for it and as you approached the sphincter of the stomach you accepted your fate as nothing more than food for the unaware bugbear...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is little dignity in spending the rest of your short life within the bowels of some creature, but you decide to hang on to what little of it you have by accepting your fate and slumping down against one of the walls of this cavernous stomach. Soon your ordeal will all be over. Soon enough, you slip into unconciousness from the lack of air and you accept your fate as food to some unaware being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat doesn't happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oppressive humid atmosphere of the stomach is gone, replaced by the much needed feeling of wind on your cheeks. But that must mean? You open your eyes. Your previous residence is no more, but the location you have found yourself at is not exactly familiar either. Irregular jagged brown hills and mountains stretch around you into the horizon, with little else disturbing your view other than a long grey tube like rocky monolith in the distance. Looking to the skies does not provide many answers either, as shapes and colours blend together in a blur, with a dim sun barely perturbing the cacophony of colour. The distinct smell of vinegar is the only thing that your nose is able to register, perhaps the only thing you recognise in this alien landscape and welcome it. Still puzzled, you try to listen around for any errant sounds, but can only make out the sounds of distant quakes, no doubt from this land's unusual tectonics. Your current location is a mystery and you decide it is better to try and find some answers than sitting around doing nothing. Knowing this, you decide to head to the only thing of note on this plain - the long monolith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk across the landscape, trying to avoid falling into narrow ravines and keeping your footing on the jagged hills you must climb. You find the texture of the ground interesting, as while it is hard it isn't nearly as rugged as something like rock which only puzzles you further. It's almost as if the ground is made of wood, but such a thing would be prepostorous. Your trek isn't the easiest endeavour and you start getting closer to the unusual grey monolith, it's appearance softening in your vision as you approach it; its appearance is almost snake like- like some grand sea serpent of old. Of course, such a thing would be impossible. Sea serpents like the sea after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe appearance resolves some more as you approach, it's appearance looking almost scaled - several layers stacking upon each other in a way that would resemble the bark of a palm tree or something similar. While trying to think of a feasible explanation, your world is rocked by large quakes as you are thrown to the ground. Your envirnoment's source of light now blotted by an immesurably large shadow, you look up to the heavens and finally, your world starts to make sense.

Several miles in size, you wouldn't even hope to outrun the thing if it came down on you and unfortunately you are only able to watch as it makes its meteoric descent before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object crashes into the ground only a few hundred feet in front or you, causing a massive shockwave and kicking up a massive hurricane as it disturbs the ground below. As the object starts to rest and you realise it no longer poses any immediate threat to you, you attempt to scan it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe colossal object is primarily a brownish yellow, with what looks like dark brown trees growing upon the tops of its slopes. The front of it is supported by five black warped spires that each extend from the front of the objects to a few dozen feet off the ground like some unusual gothic structure. As you piece this together with the other limited information and the familiarity of recent brownish objects you are only able to accept one possible, terrifying solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had shrunk. Again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe object in front of you could only be the foot of the bugbear that very nearly added you to the fat on his paunch; the large cylindrical object next to you is a single strand of hair on the floor of this planet sized tavern. It seems that in order to keep you alive, the spell resolved once more. You were indeed alive, but now even your previous size would be monolithic as you now struggled to compete with most motes of dust for size. Knowing this, you had to physically restrain yourself from curling up into a ball and crying to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay. You were small. Microscopic even. A single hair could crush you at this size, but it doesn't mean you have to give up! Right? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking on your feet, you feel you only really have one option here. Climbing the miles of foot of front of you, even if only to get off the ground and give some protection from the harsh reality of being living dust on the floor of a busy tavern. Worst case scenario, the rest of your life on the foot of a bugbear can't be that bad right? Right...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, there is one other potential solution. Knowing that you still have the capability for the arcane after your second mishap, you could attempt to harness that energy into a teleportation spell - almost like peeling the layers off of an orange without taking the fruit. It of course carries significant risk, as messing it up will make you even smaller and you're not even sure how much smaller you could get at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing this, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps you could...what is that incessant noise?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around to scan the rest of the inn, you find the source sitting at one of the tables in the centre of the room. Maw wide and dripping drool, the spotted creature produced quite the cacophony in its slumber. A snoring gnoll. Typical. You had employed a few gnolls in your time for some help with some heavy lifting and you recall how they spent most of their time on the job sleeping unless motivated with the promise of food; of course, it wouldn't be fair to generalise an entire species like that but you doubted the one towering in front of you would be any different, as drops of his saliva fell to the floor. Knowing this, you think it might actually work to your advantage. A lazy creature is a stationary creature, and it would certainly make climbing that tawny fur much easier and risk free than the other inhabitants of the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind made up, you set out on a quest to reach the base of the gnoll. You dart from table to table, avoiding the slamming of paws and the crushing of boots as you are able to make it to your target. Looking up at your possible saviour, it really starts to dawn on you how large the gnoll is compared to you, his large paws shuffling against the wooden floor - easily able to snuff you out if he wished. Looking passed the paws, you see the only piece of clothing the gnoll could bother to wear, some woollen shorts which is clearly protesting underneath the large paunch it had to carry, no doubt itself filled with all manner of stews and ales right now. You are just about able to make out the face of the gnoll over the stomach, it still creating a racket in its dormant state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady for the next part of the plan you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If you want to scale the beast, now would be the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the paws, becoming dangerously close should the gnoll above start to rouse again. The distinct, but not unpleasant smell of vinegar permeates your nostrils as you approach the toes, the digits moving ever so slightly as the titan breathes above you. Not wasting any time, you manage to grab onto an errant tuft of fur that sat just above the paw pads \u2013 only emasculating you further as you realise you were just barely level with the fur level of the paw. Pulling yourself up the tawny fur, you are fairly easily able to grab handholds in the fur, so long as you avoid the clumps of dirt and other detritus that have become knotted inside patches of the fur; a natural downside of the gnoll wearing no footwear. Despite this, it isn\u2019t too hard to avoid them and the smell of dirtied paw is pretty light all things considered. You might have to thank the gnoll for that if you can get his attention. You continue to climb and soon enough you reach the top of the paw and breathe a sigh of relief as you hope the most dangerous part of this climb is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to climb the leg next, and while the journey is longer, you are able to steady yourself on patches of fur and take periodic breaks as you climb. It comes as a surprise then, when you reach a white plain of furless cotton earlier than expected \u2013 the shorts. Initially pulling yourself up onto the shorts proves rather tricky as you find it awkward to find handholds on the new surface, but soon enough you are able to find some purchase in some of the gaps between the thread of the shorts and pull yourself up onto the knee, allowing you to take a break from climbing as you walk along the thigh for the rest of the journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at the mountain you have scaled half of, its mouth still hung open with its tongue lolling out and face still pointed skyward. You are kind of surprised that the gnoll has still not awakened, but you felt it best not to criticise \u2013 after all, you wouldn\u2019t have had a relatively time climbing the creature otherwise. You observe the path ahead and notice that the waist of the shorts had been pulled up to the midpoint of the belly; you weren\u2019t entirely sure why, perhaps it makes the shorts easier to wear without them slipping off? Or they had merely ridden up in his sleep? You didn\u2019t know and honestly the reason didn\u2019t matter. It would be slightly harder to climb the rest of the way due to the material of the shorts being more awkward to climb on than the spotted fur, but you felt it best not to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue on your journey\u2026</span></div></div>",

You had to be honest with yourself, there was a certain beauty in seeing things at this size that really made you see the world in a much different way. The creatures you once called friends and workmates were now terrain to be explored and scouted. For example, you had probably seen more of this gnoll than he himself had seen in his entire life! If only the circumstances of you dilemma weren\u2019t quite so life threatening, you think you\u2019d enjoy seeing even more of the world at this reduced size.

It is not long before you reach the waist of the material and pull yourself up, coming face to face with the mountainous belly of the gnoll. The stomach gurgles and whines before you like some sort of wild creature as you stand on the thin waistband of the shorts, giving yourself a short breather before the rest of the climb. Not much further now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to continue, you grab some fur around the belly button and start to hoist yourself up, the climb soon becoming easier as you reach the incline of the belly and you find you can start walking to the chest for the final leg of the climb.

If there was one thing you had, was patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a different noise breaks your reverie. You hear the noise of bowls and plates being left somewhere -- noise you had been hearing a lot on your trek towards the gnoll, but this time, they're coming from way closer. You look upwards, at the underside of the table. It was up there!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...about time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear those words, like a growl hinting something ominous happening. The sound of a feast being left on the table had finally awoken the gnoll, and there you were, still trapped between the waistband and his belly. Not the best position to be in! The gnoll leaned forward, unwittingly pressing you against the waistband. It felt like your torso had gotten trapped into a vice! The gnoll's formidable body was squeezing you, and he was none the wiser!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you tried to endure it, hoping for a chance in the situation, but the gnoll kept moving. You heard noises above you, the noises of the gnoll taking food from the bowls and getting them closer to him. Before long, he'd start devouring everything up there. Things would be moving, but it could turn pretty uncomfortable. The gnoll moved, again pressing you, this time hard enough to make it hard to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp for breath once the brief grip goes away. This couldn't keep happening, you had to do something right now! If you stayed there, you'd find yourself with a few bruises in matter of minutes, if not something worse! Getting a rib cracked could prove dangerous -- not that you couldn't heal it yourself, but still! You'd rather not to suffer that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you had to move before the situation took the decision for you. You got ready, bracing for the right moment to make a move.</span></div></div>",

You fill palms with fistfulss of hair, steading your body as the gnoll shifts above. You feel his abs flex. He pulls himself closer, scooting his chair\u2014causing it to squeak across the tavern\u2019s hardwood floor. Though you\u2019re pinned for the moment, when his bottom drifts backwards after scooting, the hold of his waistband loosens.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It\u2019s just enough.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re able to pull yourself free. Your arms shake as your rise, unused to physical activity more strenuous than lifting a quill. But adrenaline gives you the strength you need. His waistband snaps behind you, sealing the sweltry portal closed. The snap waistband acts as a fan\u2014blowing hot air over your tiny form that reeks of sweat and damp fur.<br>\r\nYou hear him take a good long sniff. \u201cWild hare stew,\u201d he growls, letting the steam whet his nostrils, \u201cahh\u2014love it. The bits carrots bobbin\u2019 there? Makes taste that much better. It\u2019s the irony, yeah?\u201d His throaty speak is quiet, almost lost in the jabbering of the busy tavern. Doesn\u2019t seem that he\u2019s talking to anyone in particular. Maybe he\u2019s lonely\u2014missing the pack. Or maybe just likes talking to himself.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The bowl scrapes against its serving plate as the gnoll grips it in his paws. You decide this is a better time than any to get away and continue your ascent. You\u2019re only a few centimeters up when you see the dark shadow of the soup bowl loom overhead. Not the most dextrous of fellow, he accidentally tilts it to the side. A splash of soup pours out\u2014plummeting like a god\u2019s tear.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You\u2019re in the drop zone.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Meat soup splashes over over you, washing you onto his pant leg. The liquid is thick and viscous. It oozes over you while holding you down with a frightening amount of weight. It burns slightly\u2014but not enough to harm. Thankfully, the cook was wise enough to let it sit before serving.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cDamn it,\u201d the gnoll huffs, setting his bowl down with a clatter. \u201cHate wastin\u2019 grub.\u201d<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Another shadow looms.

Soup clings to his hairs, thickening and darkening them as they absorb the waters in the soup. You\u2019re surrounded from every which way by soaked hairs. They begin to stick together as they reach maximum saturation. The soup no longer able to be absorbed, it sits there in a basin of wet hair. You\u2019re floating in the middle\u2014like a mosquito trapped in amber.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You frantically attempt to wipe soup from eyes. But your arms and hands are drenched. Everytime you wipe it away, more of the pungent, steaming water sloshes down from your sopping hair. You\u2019re able to blink once in between. And each time it\u2019s like a snapshot.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The gnoll hefts you into the heavens.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Blink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0His tongue flops out like a lazy dog.

Nauseating breath clocks you like a brick in the face. Its rankness ranks somewhere between never-washed sailor breath and a spoiled meat pantry. His pancake, floppy dog tongue shoots at you, lapping you up with a watery slurp before you have another chance to blink.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Now swimming blindly in a puddle of spit, the world grows hot and muggy. Worse than than tropics where the feather-donned snakefolk thrive, the air sweats with rank heat. With the added wetness around you, you\u2019re able to wash over the soup covering your face. You open your eyes\u2014just in time to see the last of your light snuff with a clack of the gnoll\u2019s jaws.<br>\r\nDarkness has never felt so heavy. You can\u2019t see; but you can feel. You\u2019re swished around without even a thought on the gnoll\u2019s part\u2014just the chaotic flow of the wash in his mouth gives you a far-too-intimate tour. You skid across his gums, feeling the squishy flesh on your back. You bounce off his fangs: bumpers hard as ivory.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Your own dinner wanting to come up, you shake your head and try to get any sense of your surroundings.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The dawn breaks. The gnoll opens his jaws. The white light of the taverns cracks through. The black shadow imprint of his fangs hang above and below: the stalactites and stalagmites of this fermented meat-smelling cave.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0In his hands: a soup bowl. It tips forward.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But where are you when the flood arrives?<br>\r\n</span></span></div></div>",

Right now, when you see a bowl coming, it feels like that's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're not in the best place to weather a deluge of soup. All that bouncing you did around in the gnoll's mouth brought you to roll there in the middle of his tongue, saliva slowing you down and making you stick there. Great! You're in trouble. You can see the near future: soup washing you down the gullet of an unaware gnoll. As if that was going to be a fun thing to do. There was no way you were letting such a thing happen, not if you could do something about it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps it was a desperate move, but you tried to crawl forward, towards the tip of the tongue. You were trying to get away, you didn't think of going towards a side to avoid it -- you didn't want to be in the gnoll's mouth, you wanted to be out! Did you even want the gnoll's help anymore? After it ate you and what not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably not. Not unless this was your only choice in the entire world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like the saliva stopped you before, now it's slowing your escape. You can grasp the tastebuds, you can drag yourself forward, but it's like crawling on a thick film of slime -- not too far from the truth, really. You're going much slower than you'd like. The soup makes contact with the gnoll's lips before you're able to get to the tip of the tongue, the tongue extends slightly a little to receive the incoming liquid. Oh god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's like being hit by magma...by lukewarm magma. Tasty liquid, really made from wild hare and carrots, hit you, forcing you to close your eyes. Your grip on the tongue relaxes, you're washed away by the liquid. Bits of carrots smack you, you're in a river and your destination is obvious: you're going towards the back of the gnoll's mouth, towards the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis may be your last chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help!\" you call. At this point you don't care about anything but getting out of this alive. You're right there in his head, surely he can hear something! You manage to pop your head from the soup, yelling again: \"Help!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's no response from the gnoll other than a satisfied murmur. He didn't hear you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had never thought you'd experience how it's like to be swallowed, but here you were, a bit of meat more in addition to the soup. You don't see a thing before the throat catches you and you plunge down his throat, soup enveloping all of you. You tumble down the throat, into the esophagus, while you hear the gnoll say to the air:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that hit the spot\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood for him, bad for you. So many times you had hired gnoll as help by offering them food, now you were part of food for a gnoll. Was that some twisted irony? Didn't seem so, but right now that was all you could think while you plummeted down the tube, towards a stomach where your death could await.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't notice when you entered the stomach, next you knew you had plunged into a swampy place. You're completely drenched, soaked in warm liquids, and forced to swim upwards until you break the surface. You cough right away, the acid air making you ache right away. Oh, this wasn't good at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou needed to find some stable terrain, fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you grip a piece of carrot larger than normal, getting on it as some sort of improvised raft. Right now you can't see much, but a hastily murmured enchantment solves it. You didn't like the thought of using magic while you were shrunken, but this was an emergency, a big one. If there was a time to take risks, it was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were greeted by the stomach walls contracting, the contents sloshing around while the gnoll continued his feast. Judging by the state of the carrot piece, it wasn't going to be long before you fell into the contents of the stomach again, and things could get dicey if that happened. For now, you started working on something that could protect you, even if it was temporary, a reprieve from the possibility of getting digested by the unknowing gnoll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you worked, you considered your options. At this rate you were in mortal danger, you had to solve that first. Afterwards, it was all about getting back to the lab. How to do this...</span></div></div>",

Probably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact you were still trapped most likely meant you hadn't been noticed yet. The gnoll was sleeping -- his snores rattled everything around. You could make a lot of noise, and he would be none the wiser. Great! You still were on your own, still held there. But since he was sleeping, you may be able to move without he noticing, too. You were at liberty of trying much harder to get out of there, and given it was a horizontal position, you should be able to go in any direction you wanted. You grabbed some of the gnoll's belly fur, pulling yourself upwards a little. Indeed, you managed to move. Good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, preparing yourself. All you could hear was the gnoll's snores, and the noise of his digestive system working on his meal. Time to make your move.</span></div></div>",

Ruddy scaled, snub-snouted, with a shirt full of holes, the vermin struggles to hold his mug\u2014courtesy of his twig-stick arms. You, being a noble practitioner of the arcane magics, don't have a high opinion of kobolds. They're pests who steal your unused mixing bottles and help themselves to your potion ingredients\u2014like it's some sort of buffet. You don\u2019t care to consider that not every kobold is a thief\u2014or that most could actually be good people. You'll never forget the day they ate all of your manaworms\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0But desperate times call for desperate measures. You're smaller than a toothpick. And you'd rather try your luck attracting the attention of the smallest giant here. After spending a healthy minute observing the creature, you see him finally succeed in lifting the ale. The froth sloshes down, soaking his face in a tidal wave of foam. He sputters, letting the ale slam onto the hard wooden table before barking a curse in his native draconic tongue. You adjust your shrunken (yet still fine) green robes and begin the long trek forward. Hiding under barstools, passing under kicking, rowdy feet, you're able to scamper towards the big-little lizard. His shoeless, clawed feet dangle above you. Your gaze traces from his clawed feet, up his two-joint leg, and ending at his scaly face\u2014soaked in alcohol. His eyes are half-closed with an irritated acceptance. Wading through puddles of spilt drink, you pause to think: how in the nine realms are you going to get up there?<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0...Aha! His tail\u2014spindly\u2014covered in interlocked scales that, at your size, look like a finely-made suit of dragon scale mail. Tiny spikes poke from between his hide, lining the top of his tail with bone-colored pricks. His tail is quite the ways up, but with some creative jungle-gyming up the frame of the barstool, you\u2019d surely be able to grab on! Staying on there, however, is less than certain.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You clamber and climb. Next came a handful of risky leaps to one wood beam to another. You leap off with all the grace of an untrained adventurer\u2014barely managing to reach the kobold\u2019s tail. Without a second\u2019s waste, you scramble to find a handhold\u2014managing to wrap your hands around a spike. Your heart rises in your throat as your stomach rattles in your ribcage. You\u2019re tossed about with the tail\u2019s lazy movements, swaying back and forth like the tail of an idle cat. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tAfter an arduous, yet uneventful climb, you climb to the root of the kobold\u2019s tail: the thick part between his legs and above his butt. His pants have a haphazardly-cut hole in the rear for his tail to pass through. Clearly sized for a halfling, the old cloth smells like mildew and hobo.<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tRight at the moment when you\u2019re about to latch onto the hem of his pants, vying to climb higher, the feeble lizard wobbly stands up\u2014balancing on the beam of the barstool\u2014reaching for the ale placed just out of his reach. You rise with him. Digging the tips of your fingers between the gaps of his scales, you hold on for your life. The poorly-sized hole of his pants shadows over you. The scent of mildew grows stronger, coupled with the funk of what has to be kobold ass. Uh oh\u2026<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\tYou <i>have </i>to get out of here\u2014and fast!

After a handful of heart-pounding moments where you slap your hands uselessly against his scales, your slide concludes with you tumbling into the cloth bed of the insides of his braies. In the dim light, you see his sweat-soaked scales trembling slightly as he struggles to hold his position over the table. The fiber of his braies are uncomfortably moist; dark splotches pocked across the surface show that parts most soaked in the kobold\u2019s nervous sweat. It comes as a bit of a surprise: you conclude that the kobold is clearly warm-blooded. Body heat irradiates the cramped, musky chamber you\u2019ve been dumped in. His unwashed scales vomit a smell that bestows upon you a mental image that\u2019s so gods-damned clear, you\u2019re sure it had to have been painted by an elf: his ass smelled like a rat\u2019s\u2014a rat\u2019s ass that had been smothered in an ratfolk\u2019s dirty underwear that was rescued from the garbage heap. Or perhaps the sewer. From what your nose has gathered, this blasted, scale-covered rat probably wasted his only two silver buying drinks\u2014instead of proper toilet paper.<br>\r\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u201cHnngh\u2026 I got it!\u201d the kobold squeaks. You hear the screech of the ale dragging across the countertop. You feel yourself moving\u2014backwards. The kobold is reeling the ale towards the end of the table like the catch of the day.

You were much, much smaller than its patrons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall and unnoticed by the many inhabitants of the bar, your only option is to find some way back to your arcane lab and reverse the effects of the spell. Will you be able to find your way back to your lab? Will you be able to get the attention of one of the patrons?  Will you survive being SHRUNK AT THE LITTLE DAGGER INN?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\nI'm not going to be too strict with the rules here other than the obvious (no excessive gore, no underage characters, no one line chapters, kinks are fine so long as they don't break the above) however I will give some advice:<br>\r\n- Try to avoid having the main character noticed straight away, you can have them be noticed after a few chapters if you want<br>\r\n- While I prefer male characters, I'm not going to stop people from adding female characters<br>\r\n- If you're adding a new race to the tavern try and be creative with it. I made this story to give some love to some of the races I never see in these kinds of stories.<br>\r\n- None of the races here are evil by nature, they have strengths and weaknesses just like anybody else<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, enjoy your stay at the inn :)</td>",
