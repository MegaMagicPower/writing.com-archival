In actuality, there was old and new, she didn't bother checking every day, more like once a week. There she inspected the envelopes. Her spectled eyes glossing over the mail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, bill, bill, ad, ad, magezine, bill, notice, bill-wait notice?\" The dark-haired girl grabbed the bill and opened it. Her eyes rose, apparently her landlord has upped the rent on the entire complex due to the recent tax increases the government has passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Without her welfare bill, she may not have enough money to take care of herself and pay the rent. She may get kicked out and on the streets in two months!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do I do...\" Anri doesn't have any grandparents, and her parent's siblings don't want anything to do with her, considering how her parents died and they fear misfortune may come to them. She could work at a maid-cafe, but if she did she would never hear the end of it from Kida(but he would be a loyal customer, as will Mikado). Maybe that Africa-Russian Simon has some openings? But if he really does do \"Russia Sushi\" then the ingredients and words would be in Russian, and the only other language she's decent at is English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe study abroad? No...they would want money for her schooling and board there, something which she lacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is Saika...and the hundreds of people she controls. Maybe she can control them to give her money?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo...She is willing to use Saika to protect others and maintain the balance of power in Ikebukuro, but not to take advantage of others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needs help, and she heard of a man who has information...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--The next day, Saturday--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Miss Sonohara. What an unexpected surprise.\" Anri kept her eyes to the ground as she entered the office of the lion. No...more like a devious cobra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies for coming in unannounced, but I seem to be in an unexpected predicament.\" Anri sat down on the couch, in front of her a coffee table with a shogi board and other pieces of assorted stratagey games. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not a worry at all! I was getting bored and you seem to be a quite a bind. What can I help you with?\" Anri kept her eyes on the table. She heard many rumors of this man, and she would rather try not to stare at him in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well my apartment complex has increased their rent prices...\" She was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes, the tax increases. While our debt is decreasing thanks to it, many people are mad about. How interesting humans can be, ignoring the long term benefits for something like this,\" oiled the dark haired man. Anri mentally kicked herself. She could see his reflection on the bright and shining coffee table and she can see him staring at her reflection, his eyes vulpine and his grin nearing a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIzaya Orihara.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...I need to find a place of work that can help me get by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wouldn't a young lady like yourself would want to work in a maid cafe? I'm sure you may attarct quite a few customers if I say so myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already considered that option but a maid cafe job would not give me the benefits I recquire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the benefits beyond living on simple welfare yes?\" Anri shifted uncomfortably. He knows about her situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if you know of my situation, do you know of a job where I can get better benefits outside my welfare check?\" Izaya fiddled with a pen through his fingers as he gazed at the tool nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Miss Sonohara I would charge you for me giving you information of where to locate a job that has what you want...But I'm in a generous mood today,\" He turned towards her, his smirk deepening. \"I know of a place just for you...\" Anri had no choice. She looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know of the recent eating disorder scare in girls your age? People claimed that it was an epidemic and that it was even spreading to boys. They were forced to take part on these afflictions due to harassment on the internet or by someone else, or trying to secure a place in society or better yet try to earn the eye of one they admire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do. What does this have to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Miss Sonohara, a branch of Yagiri Pharms named Ouma Medical are accepting test subjects for a new drug to help people that suffered from eating disorders return to a healthy weight. But no one is biting for their offer due to the rumors of Yagiri Pharms. You understand where I am going with this right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnri seemed to understand. She knew of the rumors of Yagiri kidnapping humans for human experiments, usually people no one cares about. Would this Ouma Medical be the same?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if you're thinking that Ouma would spirit away people in the dark of the night like their evil big brother does then you're wrong. The head of Ouma happens to have a moral conscious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's starting to get annoyed on he can practically read her mind. But she doesn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, I'll send an email to Ouma saying that they have a potential test subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the pay and benefits? Forgive me for interrupting you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright. Anyways, Ouma covers medical(duh) insurance and gives other benefits that I can't name of, and 4500 Yen a day for running their trials.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4500 yen a day!? How brain dead must their other offer-ers be...But is it worth it? She can tackle other jobs and be with her friends, maybe ask Dollar members for assistance with her job(or jobs). But this potential job seems...</span></div></div>",

Like I said,\" smiled Izaya as he lounged back in his chair. \"I'm in a generous mood and I'll charge you later when you have enough money in you pockets. I'll write up the email ASAP and they will let me know. What's your email address though?\" Anri cringed mentally. If she gave it to Izaya, he could hack into her email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, she needs this job...4500 yen a day is too much of a good offer to pass up. She grabbed a sticky note and a pen on the info broker's desk and wrote it down, then gave it to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah wonderful! I'll forward this address to them and you'll hear back from them in no time! Thank you so kindly!\" Anri bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should be thanking you. I'll give you the money when I get a couple of paychecks,\" replied the glasses wearing girl. Izaya nodded and turned his chair away as one hand began typing and the other fiddled with a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your most welcome. Be sure to come again~.\" Anri turned about and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she won't be coming back, only with the paycheck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Skip to that night).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnri stepped out of the shower, wrapping a towel around her body as she dried herself. She walked into her apartment room and began to dress up in her PJs. Afterwards, she sat down at her computer and inspected her email.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scrolled. Ad, ad, ad, email from Kida with hearts on it, ad, ad, school notice, ad, Ouma-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it.\" She muttered as she clicked on it, and read it's contents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ms. Sonohara<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe are glad to find out that you have taken in interest in experimenting with our new medical drug. We at Ouma Medical can assure you that you will be payed handsomely for your time in addition to medical benefits and other opprotunities. Perhaps we can even give you a scholarship</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Anri seek the job even more. A scholarship to any university would help her substanitally financially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>If you would like, we can give you the experimental drug by mail or you can stop by Ouma Medical to pick it up. However, we will need you to stop by and allow us to run some tests, all held in medical confidentiality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I bet you're wondering, \"what does this drug do?\" This drug was made to help those who have been suffering from eating disorders such as Anorexia and Bullimia. Our goal is to help them recover their weight and give them a healthy life while doing so. What you are doing is for a great good Ms. Sonohara.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I am helping people heal,\" said the girl to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>There are 2 effects to the drug. 1.) It can multiply the amount of calories you consume. For instance you eat a McDonald's burger which as 300-400 calories. Upon eating this pill, it will mulitply 600-800 calories. This was instilled that Anorexic victims can still eat light yet regain a healthy weight. And 2.), there is a special enzyme that goes through your bloodstream that serves as a cleaner of some sort. This enzyme dissolves high concentrations of cholesterol that could cause heart failure or stroke. We have tested it on mice and it shows no signs of cancer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel respond to this email whether you wish to pick up our product or we have it mailed/delivered to you.

She was stiff and sour on her body all over from the crash she had when her motorcycle hit a curve and she falls over on it. \"Celty, You look like you need a day off so you just stay home and rest.\" Shinra had said leading her over to the couch as she was tipping out a message on her phone. \"Look Shinra I'll be fine.\" \"Celty your take the day off you need your rest to\" \"fine one day Shinra but only because I'm so sour today got it.\" \"Okay Celty just as long as you feel better tomorrow.\" Celty, as unwilling to take a day off from her job, lazied back on the cough and napped a  little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a few hours latter she awoke to the smell of something being cooked near by in the kitchen and looks at Shinra and could see him cooking. \"Oh you were having such a good nap I thought I'd cook you a special meal for you to unwind today.\" \"Oh you did? Well I am hungry Shinra.\" He brought he the food which he had made 12 plates of food. \"why is there so much?\" \"okay truth I was wanting to make you something that you would love but I didn't know what you wanted so I made you all I could before you woke up so you could tell me what you like best.\" The smock bellowed out in a massive plum as she started eating the food and soon had ate a hole plate in a moment and moved onto the next but Shinra seemed strangler to be like he has gotten away with something on her. \"Shinra that was a good start but I feel hungry I think I can eat more of your cooking still.\" She then just chowed down seemingly unaware of a growing bulge in her gut to which Shinra seemed very happy about the growth as he had made it  so she would have to eat all that food and it was very fattening so she was gaining weight each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon though she was done and lend back and put a hand on her gut and was shocked to see the size her belly had gotten. \"Shinra what did you do?!?!?!\" Shinra then explain what he did to the food. \"Shinra why did you ruin my figure for?\" \"Well to tell the truth Celty, I was wanting to see if you gained weight like a normal human and well you look really amazing like these because you well you look better then ever before me love.\" Sits down next to her and rubs her belly some and smiles. \"Your belly fees like I was hoping it would Celty.

Figured it was about damn time I made another interactive, and since there's a depressing lack of any material around this site revolving around the awesome anime/manga/novel series Durarara!!, I figured I'd step up and create one myself!  Hopefully enough people know about it; it's pretty popular online, and is currently showing on Adult Swim.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyhow, there aren't too many restrictions; after all, I'd like to keep things accessible.  However, I do still have some expectations:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.) This is primarily a weight gain story, so try to keep that as the focus.  Gaining is allowed for both genders, and there is absolutely no limit on just how huge anyone can get, or how fast they get there for that matter.  <i>However</i>, I try to maintain at least a minimal level of quality in any interactive, so try and make sure that if you intend to go the insane route, exercise some effort to make sure that your premise is at least somewhat believable, and has at least some kind of build-up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.) Feel free to include at least some secondary fetishes; I quite enjoy burping and futanari stuff myself, so fire away with either if you so please.  Also, sexual activity is allowed as well, without any age limit.  And, if you aren't one for immobility when it comes to extreme weights, GTS/GT is allowed too.  Oh, and vore, but <i>only</i> of the soft variety (eg., swallowing whole; <i>no</i> chewing, blood, etc.).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.) Try your best to at least maintain some semblance of a character's canon personality.  I mean, any kind of pairing is allowed, but for God's sake, try to make sure the characters are recognisable as themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4.) Please keep things like shrinking, inflation/fruit expansion, scat, and guro/gore out of it.  I find them unpleasant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all of that aside, please add and enjoy! <br>\r\n</td>",
