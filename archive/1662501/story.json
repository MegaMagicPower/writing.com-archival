The weight of them is noticeable and you can feel the strain of the bra she had put on earlier in the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow mom. These things are heavy.\" You say as you bring your hands up towards your breasts to give them a feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melissa did you say something?\" Came your father's voice. The wound of his voice caused you to freeze up with your hand or rather your mother's hands right in front of your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lover your hands and begin to smooth out your mom's skirt as she has done so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Daniel.\" You say finding it weird to call your father by his first name as opposed to Dad. \"I was just saying how much Matthew was telling me how greatful he was for everything we did for him.\" You reply trying to hold back tears as it was the truth you were greatful and they should know it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to your girlfriend and she smiles up at you with water in her eyes. She was only your girlfriend for two years but you grew close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jane... I am so sorry.\" You say as you wrap your mothers arm around your girlfriend. \"Thank you Mrs. Smith.\" Jane said with a warm yet hurt smile/ \"I just wanted to let you know that Matthew will always be watching over you and protecting you.\" Which you would be. If she was in trouble you would help out no problem. You couldn't keep her from dating but you would like to but knowing her it would be a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Mel.\" Your father says as he heads to the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow and sit in the front seat on the way home which is the most quiet car ride you ever had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at home with family and friends behind you head out into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit there...</span></div></div>",

This death situation's been a lot to take in, you deserve a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked into the bedroom, looking at all your things.  It's exactly as you remember it being.  If it wasn't for your mother's body greeting you when you looked down, you'd almost swear you were still yourself back in your old room.  Your mother's body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat on your old bed, you thought about your mother and the fact that you essentially were her right now.  You looked like her, sounded like her, but mentally knew who you really were.  Now that you thought about it, you were scared to leave your mother's body.  You were able to exist in spirit form before, but you couldn't help but worry that you'd disappear completely if you left her body for too long.  There wasn't any way of knowing if there was some kind of time limit to this thing, and not existing was a pretty scary thought, so you figured you'd remain here, for now at least.  Almost like being in your mother's loving embrace again, only you were her.  Her spirit still existed within you, there was really no way for you two to get closer.  That thought kind of comforted you, in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, by being here, you can further help everyone cope and move on.  You couldn't expect them to be alright, not for awhile.  It's an eventual process and if you can help, you're all for it.  Maybe you could even swap between them on occasion, so you're not stealing your mother's life.  You definitely wanted some time to experiment with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up a picture you had of your old self and your mother.  You didn't keep many pictures, but this one was definitely a keeper.  You thought about how you never told her how much you loved her, how good of a mom she always was to you.  You could feel the tears well up inside your eyes, thinking back on it all...</span></div></div>",

You took a deep breath and went to your mom and dad's bedroom to just take a nap, not bothering to change out of your mom's clothes she wore to the funeral. You knew your dad would understand. A mother just lost her son, it's perfectly okay for her to just want to be alone for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nap ended up being sleep, and you woke up the next morning still in the same clothes. You got up, took off the clothes, and went into the shower, washing your mother's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the shower, you dried yourself off and went to change clothes. Your mother loved the professional look despite being a housewife, so you changed into a white blouse, grey slacks, a grey blazer and black high heels. You walked around for about 10 minutes making sure you could walk in them and looked in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here mom,\" you said softly in her voice. \"You took care of me all these years. Now let me return the favor. You deserve a break for a bit. Let me do what you normally do. I'm going to be the mother for a few days. The wife. You.\"</span></div></div>",

You were almost done with your mother's chores and your family won't be home for another few hours. You decided to take a break from all the hard work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never thought cleaning would feel different as your mom, maybe she was more use to it than you ever were. You sat down on your parents' bed to relax for a bit. While you were breathing, your eyes notice your chest moving up and down based on your breathing. Your mom has a huge set of lovely breasts. You remembered the day you possessed her at your funeral. You were about to grab her huge breasts if it weren't for your dad talking to you to catch your attention. Now there is no one to interrupt you again. You did shower in her body, but you never took your time to have fun. You didn't want to think about doing something like that, but your curiosity was getting the best of you.</span></div></div>",

Shocked about this discovery, Mathew exclaims in shock \"How is it you here Joe, and do you know how we're both able to do these things?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chuckling that the ruse was up, Joe merely beckons Matthew into the car. Wanting answers, Matthew doesn't hesitate, and rushes to get buckled in for wherever Joe is taking them. Silence fills the car, as each time Matthew thinks of asking a question about the situation, Joe merely holds up a hand, indicating he should wait. Getting frustrated, Matthew opens his mouth to start berating Joe, when his deceased friend bursts into laughter, barely getting out, \"Took you long enough to reach your breaking point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking over what he had said, Matthew starts to laugh as well, and things felt as if they were back to normal, if only momentarily. After they both calm down, Matthew looks at Joe, still amazed that he's around, and in a similar state as him. As he muses about this turn of events, Matthew misses the car pulling into a parking garage downtown. He's jolted from his thoughts with the engine turning off, as well as Joe suddenly shoving a hand straight into his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sudden ceasing of sensation is the first thing that registers in Matthew's mind. Seeing the look of surprise on his face, Joe chuckles, while poking his hand, the ghostly one that seems to be extending out of Lindsay's body, and moving it around, as if affecting something that Matthew couldn't see. Finished with what he was doing, Joe retracts the ghostly hand, and then seems to slip out of Lindsay, who slumps over, much like Jenna did after Joe was done with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, I know that face, so I know that I have to start talking, before you reach a point where you wont listen even if I tell you what you want or need to hear. The short story is, that when I died, I was disoriented until i found out I could possess others, much like you figured out. I tried to reconnect with my family nearly right after my funeral, but none of them wanted to believe it, and the one that did, felt that i should move on. In the end, I ended up altering their memories into thinking it was a hallucination, and then started on my journey to exploring all that ghosts can apparently do.\" Joe explains, looking solemn at first, before devolving into a grin at the mention of ghosts capabilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ok, but that doesn't explain how you or I am still around, nor what we should do with our abilities.\" Matthew states, watching Joe start to drift around and do patterns while listening, but also randomly making airplane noises, just like he would do while alive when he thought someone was being boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Matthew, were both dead, and you're the first 'ghost' I've seen since i became one, so at this point, unless we find some reason to do anything besides have fun, well....i'd say we have fun!\" Joe stated, doing a perfect loop-de-loop while gliding around like hes on a roller-coaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Exasperated, yet amused by his friends antics, Matthew thinks on what he's heard, and wonders if their are others in a similar situation to him and Joe, or if it is a random occurrence. Broken from his musings, Matthew is beheld by the sight of Joe being suddenly in his face making odd faces. 'Apparently his brand of humor has only gotten slightly more insane after death' Matthew thinks to himself, hoping that in 6 months he's not that bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hey, any chance you can explain what you were doing earlier to Jenna, also do you mind if we possess the girls again, I was starting to enjoy being Jenna,\" Matthew asks, unconsciously shuffling in place, anxious to get back the feeling of being alive. Upon hearing his friends response, Joe bursts into laughter, and seeing Matthews confused face at this, makes the laughter even louder.....relatively speaking at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Dude, there are way more things to do as a ghost besides possessing people. Stick with me, and you'll learn a lot more than you would have dreamed of,\" Joe states, and as he is part way through his sentence, his face slowly morphs into that of Leonardo DiCaprio's, causing Matthew to hop backwards in surprise!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Whoa, how the hell did you do that?\" Matthew exclaims, wondering what else is possible, and feeling somewhat stupid for not experimenting more, though in his defense, he felt being alive to be a top priority....almost like an instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's easy,\" Joe says, his face morphing into that of Matthew's mother now, tone and voice matching perfectly. \"As spirits, our forms are malleable, and the only limit is our imagination, and how much energy we have. While we cant fade unless we exhaust said energy, we gain it back by being in highly active areas, like parks, or malls, etc. Possessing people works just as well, but then you get that nasty addiction to possess people all the time, and miss out on being able to imitate life,\" and upon his last words, Joe's ghostly figure lowers to the ground, and seems to coalesce into a darker tint, and as he walks, starts to make sounds on the pavement, like a real, 'live' solid person would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amazed by what he's seen, Matthew is even more shocked, and excited by Joe's next action. Slowly, Joe's figure starts to change, his face slowly shifts to that of his former girlfriend that is only ten feet away from him. The brown eyes he had been seen with in life, slowly darkening into a navy blue, while his nose seemed to become sharper, more defined. His brown hair darkened, turning into a mixture of midnight black, with a green patch growing in to drape his shoulders. Stylish butterfly earrings seem to grow into place, dangling prettily off his new feminine ears. His clothing starts to shrink in some places, and shift in others, until it looks like a tube top with a cape attached in the back, somewhat similar to the dresses one would see in anime. The colors on the top shift to a deep black, with gold inlays running along the shoulders, and flowing down towards the top of his breasts, that have slowly grown in to a nice orange-sized pair. A intricate necklace with gold beads and a strange symbol forms around Joe's neck, and rests snugly between the new bust. The jeans he had been wearing before is the least dramatic change, as they simply fuse together and billow out into a knee-length skirt, that starts to shift into a dark black, with green shapes flowing over the new feminine hips that formed with the dress, accentuating a sexy figure that many would stop to stare at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Staring at all the changes that Joe made to his shape, and noticing that he looks considerably more solid than before, Matthew is snapped out of his staring, especially the bare midriff that seems to be pulling his attention like a magnet, by Joe's giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"See something you like Matty?\" Joe teases, striking a pose, causing his now feminine form to call attention to all the fine details that Matthew ignored in favor of the amazing abs and tone of the siren calling midriff that he had been fascinated by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Shaking his head, and ignoring the annoyance of his name being shortened, Matthew can only wonder how Joe was able to do all that, and puts voice to his question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How were you able to do that, and is it possible for me?\" Matthew asks, with some trepidation in apparent in his voice, as well as a small amount lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's like I explained earlier, it's all about your imagination as well as your energy level. Before you can become corporeal enough to fake life, we'll have to get you somewhere more lively, but we can still get your form shifted right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0Upon hearing that, Matthew's trepidation is replaced with excitement, and he takes to heart what Joe has said. Going off that, Matthew floats to the ground, and starts to focus on changing his appearance, and suddenly feels changes begin to take place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0While looking at his former girlfriend, Matthew decides to take a cue from Joe, and add some flair to his clothing. The first change he notices, is his hair extending out, and changing from dirty blonde, to bright pink, flowing down to the middle of his shoulder blades. A feeling of lace runs across his scalp, and forms into a headband, and an extremely large rose forms on it. Moving over to the car's mirror, Matthew sees his current changes, and continues, excited that it's working so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next change is his chest, which slowly expands, feeling similar to the sensations he felt as Jenna, but muted, stopping at the size of melons. 'Glad I don't currently have actual weight, or else these would hurt after awhile,' Matthew thinks, while hefting up his new breasts, which, while muted, still tingle with pleasant sensations. Next his shirt and jeans fuse into a two piece dress. The top part seeming like a long white dress shirt, with lace and frills at the wrists, flowing inside the 2nd piece of the dress. The second piece begins to form, starting at the breasts, and adding a second layer over them, it flows down in a form hugging fit, accentuating Matthew's new curves and showing off his slowly forming hips. The dress flows to his ankles, and a slit appears on his upper left thigh, and goes down the dress to his ankles, showing off the now pale while, and well toned looking legs. The last thing to change was a pair of large, heart-shaped earrings that slowly grew in like fruit, finishing off the image of his girlfriend with a few alterations, and a dress to show off what she could be like with a few changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wow, have to say, you got that pretty quick\" Joe states, closing in on Matthew, and running a hand up and down his body. Slightly surprised, it takes Matthew a few moments before he starts to return the favor, focusing on the alluring midriff that keeps drawing his attention for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Before we explore more, we need to get you solid\" Joe states...</span></span></div></div>",

How could you be caught? \"You know, it's never good to run away from a fight.\" <br>\r\nNicholas curled your girlfriend's lips into a snarl, laughing slightly, coldly. <br>\r\n\"You're probably wondering how I can catch you.

That fatal day was no accident, it was on purpose. For you see, you're wanted by my 'employers'. They paid me to learn about your miserable existence and to punish you for interfering with their practices. To erase who you are, and to erase your whole family. You shouldn't exist, and it's my goal to make sure that you'd had never existed. I know about your life, your norms, your insecurities. I could pose as you, a perfect replica if I wanted. But no, my job isn't to do that, although I wouldn't mind the sweet 'assets' of a girlfriend you carry around. You are an oblivious fool, believing in your own fictional fantasy. But it won't be much of one soon enough. Your girlfriend cheated on you as soon as she found out the news, ashamed and regretful, here she is. Her loneliness fractured her into post fatal depression, which she believed she could relieved if she came here to mourn for you. But no, here she is, directly under my control. A puppet with no strings, how pathetic.\" \"No, no. LIES. ALL LIES!\" You blared out, refusing to believe the lies your assassin had presented to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choose what you want to believe; it does not matter to me one bit. I have come to what I should had finished, because I do not EVER fail!.\"<br>\r\nWhat followed afterwards was a menacing laughing flowing out of your girlfriend, sending chills down your spine.

It is then that you realize that she was reading <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> by Harper Lee.  You remember reading it, but that was about it.  The teacher goes over the last few chapters of the book asking questions every so often before going on to assign a book report due by next week.  She then puts on the movie adaptation of the book to watch for the rest of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister noted that she had taken a liking to the character from the book called \"Boo\" Radley, while you had liked the character Atticus.  The movie went on and your sister was totally engrossed in the movie whilst you were only half-interested in it.  You only really payed attention when Atticus was on the screen as the plot revolved mainly around him.

Although most of the other students use to struggle in physics, like your dear sis.<br>\r\nIn class your sister tells you to stay quiet in order for her to try to pay attention, but you can feel that she still can\u2019t catch up. In the middle of class Mr. Joubran started asking random questions and your sisters turn cake around. Your sister nervously goes up to the board and looks at the question, but she can\u2019t seem to do it and you realize that you know how to solve it so you take a bit more control over her and solve the problem all while explaining to class how you did it (they also seem to not understand), Dr Joubran complements by saying: \u201cyou seem smart like your brother, I\u2019m sorry for what happened, it was a shame\u201d you nod and go back to seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class has ended an the principal announced that everyone can leave because the rest of the teachers are A on a field trip with the 9th graders. You both go home (It was a Friday so you now have a weekend) and straight after arriving your sister asks you if you can teach her the physics material that she doesn\u2019t understand. You agree and take control of her right hand with paper and explained to her the material for a couple of hours and solved a couple of example problems with her. After that exhausting day (for your sister especially, you feel she is tired) she takes a magazine and  lies in bed. She says (dialogue she speaks then you):<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Today was hectic, I mean you died 2 days ago and now I\u2019m possessed by you, can you believe that?!<br>\r\n-I still can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m dead, and I\u2019m a ghost!<br>\r\n-What happened after you died? Was it painful?<br>\r\n-No I woke up a couple of hours after the accident and say my body, and I was floating and I feel weightless and realized that I was a ghost and that I\u2019m dead, so I went to my funeral and saw my mom and you crying, so I thought I can possess people like how I saw in the movies and I tried it on you and I succeeded in possessing you and comforted my mom. But really I still feel guilty for using you like that and still you have to be my host and you have to carry me around. <br>\r\n-Don\u2019t say that, I am always here for you, and my body is always yours, I trust you with my life and love you. By the way I\u2019m sure that there are people who would be happy to help and share a body with you, such as your girlfriend Layla and your friend Ron, they seem trustworthy and are also very close. So if you want we can visit them tomorrow morning and talk to them about the situation. Layla will be so happy to hear that you are still around even though you are a ghost.<br>\r\n- Thanks sis and yes that might be good, and I would sometimes use you all to check on the family or even help you out like how I did now, and hang out with you since being a ghost is nice and cool but boring at the same time. <br>\r\n- Don\u2019t say that! Your lucky to still be something and still with us, or shall I say inside us. You can do all the stuff you didn\u2019t do when you were alive, like visit and explore every country in the world.<br>\r\n-Yes that\u2019s a great idea, expect a lot of postcards. <br>\r\n-\u201cBy the way with your powers how did you find my body? Was it comfortable and how is being...a...girl compared to a boy?\u201d She says while pushing her boobs and you both feel pleasure from it (she has mid sized boobs, not too large and not too small, just right.<br>\r\n-it\u2019s so comfortable but I still haven\u2019t had the chance to explore you and really take in what it feels to be you<br>\r\n-well I\u2019m all yours, I don\u2019t have anything to do and I think that you deserve to try me for a bit and try to be me in order for me to be your host and for you to use my body, since you will possess me and share me from time to time. But don\u2019t do anything too crazy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking with her about her offer you agree but you won\u2019t fully Possess her for long because she is your sister. You focus on taking over total control of your shared body and you succeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strip, use her boobs and orgasm a couple of times and take in what it feels like to be a girl (for about an hour or two). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter your experience your body feels exhausted. So you return to shared control over her body and she takes a shower (with you in her), goes under the bedsheets (talks to you about what you did and about life for a bit) then goes to sleep early (she is so exhausted from today)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, after your family goes leaves the house (mom and dad have work), do you leave the house with your sis and visit them? or invite your friends over to your house to discuss the matter?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You head into the gymnasium where your teacher is getting stuff ready for after the mile run is done.  Your sister heads straight into the locker room to get changed.  You notice that your sister barely keeps her locker locked, opting to keep it on the 2nd number and turning it to the last number to unlock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any special reason you keep your locker barely locked?\" You ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's mostly because of ease-of-access. I keep it on the 2nd number then just turn it once and its open. No one really said anything yet about anyone taking stuff from gym lockers so I don't see anything wrong with it.\" She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just that you keep a little more than your clothes here, so just looking out for you.\" You told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh.  Look nothing has happened yet so we're all good.\" Your sister replied, a little bit annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour sister heads out of the locker room where the other classmates are waiting for the teacher and last few classmates to show up.  The gym teacher asks who was ready for the mile as your sister and the majority of the class started groaning at the mention of it, and the few others stayed quiet.  As the last few classmates came out of the locker room, the teacher motioned everyone to head outside and onto the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you going to do it or am I?\" She asked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'll do it.\" You said, taking a bit of control back but just enough to let your sister still be aware of what is going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher first explains how long everyone has to run the mile, reminding everyone to pace themselves and drink plenty of water afterwards.  Lastly, the teacher warns everyone that just because its a practice run does not mean that people should be walking.  The teacher then told everyone to line up to get ready and start running once the first few people reached a specific distance away from the start.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were doing the practice run you noticed that your sister wasn't as fast as you used to be, however you still managed to beat most of the other girls and even some boys.  After everyone was done running, the class played dodge ball for the rest of gym.  Once gym was over, you went back to having mutual control over your sister's body.  This is when your sister told you she had a break.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly,  a woman figure appeared in front of you. You stumbled back a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n        \"Don't be afraid.  I'm just your guardian,  Matthew.\" said the figure. You dazzled. How she knew your name?? She walked towards you and whispered to your ear,  \"Do you want to be alive?? Do you want Felix's body??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          You are silent in a moment.  This was a chance for you to be alive again and took care of Melissa. As you were lost in your thought, the woman offered her hand to you and guided you to somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           When both of you stopped,  she questioned,  \"Your answer??\" Without hesitation,  you replied,  \"Yes\".  She grinned.  \"My name is Hecate. I am the guardian of spirits. Usually,  I will guide the spirits to afterlife without any problems. But your case is special and lovely indeed\" Hecate chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            She flicked her fingers and a screen with picture of Melissa revealed. \"Matthew,  why you love her so much?? What she mean to you??\"  You blushed. Maybe it's a little embarrassing to tell her.  \"You don't have to tell me...  I know all about it\" she laughed.  Your face became redden like tomato which about to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Back to business,  if you want to be alive again,  you need use the power that have been bestowed upon you to help the others.  Likely to start with your family and friends\". The power must be the possession. \"You mean possessing other people??  asked you. Hecate nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n               She flicked her fingers once again and the diamond contained Felix's soul popped up in front of you. \"Another one,  you also have to find a way to obtain his body permanently without having two souls in a body\". When she mentioned about permanent body that mean you have to eradicate Felix's soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n                \"How about Felix, is he will not live again??\" Hecate's face looked sour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

For awhile, you felt guilty for what you have done. \"Never mind to answer it, I know about it already\" again she mentioned she knew everything about you. She flicked her fingers and \"The reason for my words is if you want to be alive as Felix, you must sacrifice him. This is what we call the ultimate sacrifice. The person you choose must have a strong link with you because it will make the process better\". You looked upon Felix's soul. \"I'm sorry, Felix. I have to do it for Melissa\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        After you agree to help the people with your power and to sacrifice Felix, Hecate summoned a scribe. The scribe wrote an agreement that you must fulfill in order to become alive again. \"If you break this agreement, something unpleasant will happen to you. Now, you are ready to go\" She pushed you towards a deep pit. You fell down into the darkness of abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n        Now, you have remembered what you must do after this. The doctor said that you will be staying in the hospital for a week, to make sure your body in a good condition. For this whole week, I need to leave Felix body for awhile every night to complete my task.</span></div></div>",

He was driving you to a party when the drunk drivers hit his car and killed you; he probably feels guilty for your death. Your dad hasn't talked sense the accident. He tried to talk during the funeral service, but he could barely speak. Your mom is upstairs. She hasn't been downstairs sense after the funeral service. You decide to possess your father so you can comfort her. You try phasing into him, but you just pass through his body. Your dad feels a slight chill, but he just brushes it off and walks up stairs. You follow him to your old room; it looks just as you left it. You see one of the video games you use to play on the floor and remember a game where you had to scare the host before you possess them in order for it to work. You figure you'd give that a shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to possess the picture of yourself your dad's holding and it works. You concentrate and are able to break the glass. \"What the hell?\" your father says confused by what just happened. You then concentrate on changing the reflection of the glass. As your dad inspects the glass plate, he notices in the reflection of himself  he sees someone standing behind him. He sees you standing behind him! He turns around, then looks back at the picture. You used your powers to fix the glass while your dad looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Jon. You need to get a hold of yourself.\" Your dad says to himself. You dispossess the picture and head toward the radio. You notice a thin yellow glow around your dad. That means it's working. You turn on the radio and play your favorite song; the song that annoyed your dad to the point where he told you never to play it in the house again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on.\" Your dad walks over to the radio. \"Dad.\" You whisper through the radio. He leans closer to the radio. You then play the sound of the crash and break your radio. \"Holy shit!\" Your dad freaks out. You know see that the lining is red. Now it your chance to possess him. You phase into his body from the front, but your father puts up a fight. He falls down on the floor and fights for control over his body. He tries to scream, but he can't. All that comes out are grunting and moaning sounds. He starts to convulse for a minute, then you are in complete control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand your father's body up and walk over to your parent's room to comfort your mom. \"Sarah, you should come down.\" You say in your father's voice. It feels weird moving and speaking in his body, but you try your best to act like him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom doesn't respond. She just sits on the bed and stares blankly into space. You walk up to her and put your father's arm on her back. \"We're all upset, but you need to say good bye in order to heal. Come down stairs with me.\" She looks at you and starts crying. You wrap your dad's arms around her and after a few minutes of crying she say \"Ok, just promise you won't leave me.\" \"I promise.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\nYou say in your dad's body for a few days. Things seem to slowly be getting back to normal. Your mom seems to be holding up well and your siblings are back in school. Your dad's leave of absence from his job as a paramedic ends tomorrow and you wonder if now's a good time to leave his body.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your body arches on the body and contracts, and you can feel your spirit being pushed out. You and your dad let out a scream at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey!! Wake up!\" you heard your mom say as she vigorously shook your dad. \"W-what? What happened?\" your dad yells. \"It was just a dream. You're fine\" your mom replied back. You looked at your dad's rugged face and saw tears rolling down. He must've been thinking about me while he was dormant, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou float around the house and see your uncle sleeping on the couch. He's a member of the military but has come to visit your family and to see your funeral. You felt your stomach grumble and realized that you needed to eat breakfast, but had no body to do so<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/2836b13c08b2fb67448f87ba69b6c25d/tumblr_n4q1b2fMl31qbbjkro1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://41.media.tumblr.com/2836b13c08b2f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give his broad shoulder a tap, but he gives no reaction. You levitate a couch cushion and throw it at his protruding belly, which startles him awake. A yellow outline contours his body as he says \"w-who did that?\" You float into the recliner beside him and force it to push out. You possess the couch he's on and shake it violently, which causes him to jump off of it. \"M-matthew? If that's you I'm going to need you to s-stop. No n-need to freak out Uncle Mike here\" he says as red outlines his shivering form. You float up directly to his eyes, though he doesn't see you, and you push in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour uncle gets slammed into the wall and you can feel his heart rate rise. He arches his bavk and contorts his facial muscles as you fit your face into his. At the same time, you expand your scrawny form into his beefy torso. He moans, yet no screams exit his mouth. You place your small dick into his huge one, your butt into his bigger one, and expand your legs to meet his feet. He stumbles to the T.V. screen and looks at himself but instead sees your head and face wearing his shirt and shorts in his bulky body. At that moment, he convulses  for the last time and falls back on the couch he was sleeping on and you gain control of your uncle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see his belly poking out of shirt. Both you and your uncle were hungry but you had to put your hygiene and bladder under priority. You walk to the bathroom, unused to your uncle's larger everything and run into your little sister. \"Good morning, Uncle Mikey!!\" she said with an enthusiastic voice attributed to only young children. \"Hey hey Macy,\" you bend down to ruffle her hair. \"...Matty used to do that\" she mumbles as you see tears start forming in her eyes. \"Shit!!\" you think as you swoop her up and walk into her room, where you place her on the bed. Scratching your uncle's neck, you figure it woildnt be bad to tell her. You sit down on the bed, which sinks to your new weight, and say \"hey Macy can I tell you a secret?\" which sounds weird with your uncle's scratchy voice that only exists because of his military training. \"I guess so\" she says. You get off the bed and kneel on leg in front of her and say \"notice anything different about me?\" She squints and says \"your eyes green like Matty's!\" This catches you by surprise. Were they really green? \"Uh... yeah. Macy, listen. Your big brother is in here\" you say as you place your indoex finger on your uncle's chest. \"Is that why you have green eyes?\" she says. \"I didn't know I did but I guess so. Now listen Macy. You can't tell anyone about this. It's our secret.\" Her eyes widened and she yelled \"Matty you're a ghost!?\" You covered her mouth before she woke up the entire house. \"Shhhh. Yeah I'm a ghost. Don't tell anyone.\" You get up and begin to walk towards the bathroom. \"I have to wash my face, alright?' you say. She winks at you and says \"Alright, Uncle Mikey\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look into the mirror above the sink and brush your hand through your Uncle's short, graying hair. \"Never had one of these before\" you say as you rub your uncle's beard. You examine his shirt and realize it's the same one you got him for Christmas two years ago. Your pecs, big arms, and fat stomach stretch the fabric just a tad but otherwise it's a perfect fit. You look at your uncle's eyes, which are indeed green.\"So my eye color is transferred to whoever I'm possessing...\" You feel your bladder about to explode after brushing your teeth.  \"Aw shit. Oh well. Had to this twice a day with dad. Now I'll have to do it with you\" you think. You open the front of your uncle's shorts and pull his boxer briefs down. As you take a leak you think \"bigger than mine and my dad's...huh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the kitchen and see your mom, your uncle's sister, cooking some bacon and eggs. \"Good morning Michael. How's the couch last night?\" You don't respond at first, forgetting you were in your uncle's body but then you say \"h-huh? Oh well. Better than the night before. Think I'm getting used to it.\" She smiles and says \"well don't break it big guy or else I'm going to have to kick you out.\" You laugh but Michael's hearty chuckles leaves your mouth instead. Your dad walks in and says good morning to you and your mom. \"Geez what day is it today? Feels like I've been asleep for longer than I should have been.\" Your mom gets a face of concern and says \"Wednesday, honey.\" Your dad's eyes widened and he says \"oh yeah?  Well I don't recall Monday or Tuesday. I remember some weird stuff happening on Sunday but then I passed out.\" You felt bad for your father but couldn't apologize so you say \"you were walking and talking no doubt Rob.\" He scratched his head and said \"don't remember a thing. But I'll worry about that later. Let's eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
