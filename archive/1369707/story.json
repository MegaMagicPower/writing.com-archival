            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Troy Jenkins, a 17-year-old boy genius, is in his attic completing his life\u2019s work, a fully functional molecular miniaturization machine. As a younger child he had been obsessed with a certain movie where a somewhat eccentric scientist had created a shrink ray and had accidentally and unknowingly shrunken his children. His mother Cindy; a middle aged blonde hair, blue eyed insurance agent, had assumed that him watching the movie over and over was harmless and when he began to study physics in an attempt to design his own device she told herself it was only a phase and at least he was studying. Now three years after its beginning his machine was ready for testing. He decided he would wait until all of his family was out of the house so he wouldn\u2019t be risking any accidents, the movie had taught him something after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe woke up as usual to the sound of his father, Ricky Jenkins, shouting down the hall, \u201cTroy, time for school!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy had this all planned out, he didn\u2019t answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTroy? Hello? Get your lazy butt up!\u201d Ricky tended to be a little on the high strung side. He owned a diner in the town where his family lived and it was not what you would call easy going work what with the customer always being right. In Ricky\u2019s mind the customer is and always has been a jackass. Unfortunately this stress followed him home at the end of the day. Running a business and being a father of three is not an easy task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy waited with his head under the covers hoping his predictions would be correct, and they were. Ten minutes later there was a soft knock, and he managed to get his head out from under the covers just before his mother Cindy opened the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she knock if she\u2019s just going to come in anyway?\" Troy thought to himself but his plan had started, no time to hesitate, he let out a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel good mom.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy entered and stepped over the discarded clothes and other objects that littered her son\u2019s room that she had repeatedly told him to clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not going to school today are we?\u201d She asked as she stood over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI really feel cruddy mum.\u201d Troy replied with another soft groan added in for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt his forehead, \u201cYou do feel a little feverish.\u201d At least His blanket trick had worked. \u201cWell I\u2019ll be taking your brother and sister to school then. Will you be ok here by yourself today?\u201d Troy nodded his head slightly and his mother walked out of the room. His plan had worked! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy waited for half an hour listening to the sounds of his 13-year-old sister Amber, and his 12-year-old brother Adam doing their normal morning routine; chasing each other around the house, stomping up and down the hallway, getting Belle, the family\u2019s dog riled up and barking, and finally getting ready and leaving for school. Troy jumped out of bed and peeked out the window to be sure there were no cars in the driveway, and he was off to the attic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he entered the room everything was just as he left it; the dinosaur of a computer sitting in the corner, the ray on the table pointing at a chalk drawn square on the floor, it was all a little dusty and cluttered up here but it was an attic so that was to be expected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy pressed the power button on the computer and waited patiently for the system to load up. He glanced around the room once more and let out a sigh, \u201cSo many boxes.\u201d He really wanted his own lab but his parents still believed this was a phase and never in a million years would he be able to make an actual machine that could change the size of an object, that was just crazy, a child\u2019s fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer beeped signaling that it was ready for work and Troy turned back and began loading the program size_edit.exe. The machine whirred to life. What should he test it on first? Surely not himself he was too smart for that. Human testing is never the first step. A bark resonated from downstairs,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelle you just volunteered!\u201d Troy got out of his chair and went downstairs, returning shortly with the dog and its food bowl. Setting the bowl down on the square to ensure that Belle would not be moving Troy went back to his computer and began the firing sequence. \u201cHere\u2019s hoping you don\u2019t disintegrate Belle\u201d Troy said as he pressed the enter key. A bright flash that eclipsed the bulb in the lamp on the computer desk, and Belle was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly Troy jumped up with his magnifying glass in hand and searched the square his jaw dropped when his glass hovered over a tiny, confused, and barking Belle. The barks weren\u2019t even registering to Troy\u2019s ears. \u201cWow!\u201d was all he could say as he returned to his computer, and with the press of a button and another blinding flash, Belle was back! Tail between her legs she ran down the attic stairs leaving her food bowl behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had worked! It really worked! Troy\u2019s mind was racing as he contemplated the possibilities of his new invention; the end of world hunger reversing the ray could grow an apple to the size of the empire state building and feed millions, government spies could infiltrate enemy strongholds right under their noses! He would be rich! \u201cBut first,\u201d Troy said to himself, \u201ca successful human testing is in order.\u201d He gulped nervously but he did not intend to chicken out after spending the last 3 years of his life on this invention. He turned to the computer and set the timer for the ray to fire in 30 seconds and then to reverse and fire after another 30. If all went right he would <br>\r\nbe the first person in history to successfully be shrunken and returned to normal size!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPressing the enter key once again, he stood up and made his way over to the square, nudging the dog food bowl out of the way and closing his eyes as the countdown continued. The inside of his eyelids suddenly got very bright and then darkness he opened his eyes and looked around, his jaw dropped he had done it! Troy turned and saw lettering the size of his 2-story house \u201cB.E.L.L.E. Oh my God!\u201d it was the dog\u2019s bowl it was titanic! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something struck Troy as strange, it wasn\u2019t this dark in here before was it? In fact the only light in the room seemed to be coming from the small octagon shaped window at the far side of the attic. Fearing the worst he looked over toward the computer, no signs of power whatsoever. He had in fact blown a fuse and the power was out in the entire house. \u201cOh no... No! No! No, no, no!\u201d He was trapped like this; a bug in his own home, insignificant in comparison to everything in his house, and in deep, deep trouble! </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hours had passed since the fuse had blown and Troy\u2019s Troubles had started since then he had not moved from his chalk drawn square. He had gone over every possibility in his mind and he realized he could not get out of this alone he had to get help from someone in his house\u2026 The sunlight streaming through the window told Troy that it was getting towards the afternoon his mother was probably picking up Amber and Adam from school right now... \u201cWell I can\u2019t stay up here it could be days before someone comes up to the attic\u201d Troy thought out loud to himself as he stood up and brushed himself off. With one last look around the room that used to be so familiar he turned around and headed to the door and the unbelievably tall stairs\u2026 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTroy was definitely happy the stairs were carpeted now the fibers made it a much easier climb down. He had made it halfway in an hour at this rate may be he could make it before... As soon as the thought crossed his mind as if on cue he heard the front door open and the sounds of his younger siblings rushing in and dumping their backpacks and kicking off their shoes in the hall. \u201cIT\u2019S FRIIIDAY IT\u2019S FRIIDAYY YAY YAY FOR FRIIIDAYY\u201d his little sisters voice reverberated all the way through the house. \u201cI\u2019m only 4 stairs away I can do this\u201d. The door at the bottom of the stairs still ajar from where Belle ran out whimpering earlier creaked open in front of him and his mother appeared in the frame, \u201cTROY ARE YOU UP THERE? WE BROUGHT CHINESE FOOD HOME\u201d. He cursed his habit of not answering his mother when he worked if he had been a little more courteous in the past she might have realized something was wrong and come looking for him, but instead she disappeared from view leaving the door wide open. Amber rushed past the door being chased by Adam who was closely followed by Belle letting out barks like thunder. Troy looked back up the stairs amazed at how far he had come and when he looked back he was face to cold wet nose with the giant dog. \u201cWah!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSNIIIIIIIIIIIIFFF. With hurricane scale winds Troy is lifted off his feet and into the air. \u201cNo! Bad dog!\u201d Troy lands on Belle\u2019s nose still screaming at the dog as it trots up the stairs he spent so long climbing down. In a matter of seconds he\u2019s back in the attic and he knows where Belle\u2019s going even before he feels himself slipping, then falling, then landing in the empty stadium sized bowl. Troy is so concerned about the giant furry monster looking down at him that he never heard the stairs creak as Adam came up to the attic. In fact He doesn\u2019t realize there\u2019s another human in the room until Adam reaches down and grabs his prison. \u201cWhy is your food bowl up here Belle? Goofy mutt.\u201d Adam turns in a circle looking around the room sending Troy rolling head over heels in the bowl. \u201cWonder where Troy is. Probably not even home, He gets away with everything even skipping school. It\u2019s not fair...\u201d Adam\u2019s gaze locks onto the shrink ray. \u201cI wish this stupid machine would work May be he\u2019d disappear and not come back.\u201d Troy couldn\u2019t believe his ears his little brother surely didn\u2019t hate him that much! As Adam carried the food bowl back down stairs Troy tried to think back over the past few years had he been a bad brother? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

My machine works!\" Troy screamed at his gargantuan brother but it was no use, his tiny voice couldn't even come close to reaching Adam's ears at this distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of Adam's footsteps change to the slap of barefeet on tile and Troy knows they've crossed over into the kitchen, he begins to panic because if Adam feeds the dog he's surely kibble. Luckily Adam simply sets the bowl on the counter next to the sink and disappears from view. </span></div></div>",

As Belle leans down, she kicks the bowl, throwing Back across the bowl.
