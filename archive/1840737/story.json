Eventually, after endlessly roaming the planet, and finding nothing but blue grasslands and green water, she gave in. She decided it was in vein to look for a way off the planet now, but then all of a sudden, she found a Namekian elder, who looked like he had been through a bad day. He probably had dealt with the loss of his village, by Frieza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there.\" Bulma had said, trying to sound polite. \"Oh, hello there young lady.\" Said the elder. Bulma had thought that this Namekian could get her off the planet. \"Say, do you know how to get off of this rock?\" Asked Bulma. \"Rock?\" the elder said, sounding insulted. \"Yeah, rock. Seriously. This place is nothing but wierd blue grass, and terrible drinking water!\" Bulma had said. The elder sounded shocked \"Terrible!?\" \"Exactly. Who'd want to live on such a sad excuse for a planet here. OOPS!! Sorry.\" Said Bulma, realizing that she probably sounded rather offensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder had enough, and but his hands on Bulma's flat stomach, and then focused Ki into it. Bulma wondered what he was doing, but then the elder stopped and put his hands away. \"LEAVE!\" Shouted the Namekian elder. Bulma left, awfully scared by this elder.

What is this!?\" Bulma had screamed into the green, Namekian sky. Suddenly her entire body had expanded. Her butt had looked like two watermelons. The yellow space skirt barely covered her rump. Her thighs became HUGE, and started rubbing against each other, and made her yellow boots expand. Her arms grew very chunky, and her hands puffed up, making her fingers look like sausages. Her belly had expanded into a nice big beer belly. Her breasts grew into the size of beachballs, and her cheeks puffed up to look like those of a chipmunks. Luckily, for her, her black and yellow space suit had grown with her. It's made of expandable fabric. Much like the Rit armor, that the Sayians and Frieza's armor wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the--!?!?\" Bulma had shouted. \"How could this happen!?!? I'm too beautiful to become fat!! I can't become a big, bloated fatty! What would the others think!?!? What would YAMCHA THINK!?!?!?!?!?!?!?\" Bulma went into a huge panic. Pouting like a little girl would, when she wouldn't get what she desired, however all the jumping around made her whole body jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't get any worse than this!\" Bulma panicked.

And, if possible, maybe Krillin or Gohan could help her. The problem was that she was too scared to show herself to them with her new, bloated body. She then decided to suck it up, and look for them for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma then sat her flabby butt on a Namekian rock, so that way she could think of a plan. She stroked her second chin heavily, trying so hard to think of how to find her friends. She kept trying, but for some reason, she found it much harder to think. Slowly, Bulma was getting dumber. Bulma was very oblivious to her mental transformation from one of the smartest scientists of Earth, to a dumb, drooling idiot. \"Hmmm... Maybe I need... Bacon! Mmmm... Bacon. Wait, what am I saying? Focus Bulma, focus!\" Bulma tried so hard to stay on course and think. But her mind kept wandering off, and with each passing second, it got worse. \"Why can't me think? Wait, did me just say me? Me mean, uhhhh... Is Bulma getting dumber?\" Bulma said to herself. \"Me can't be. Me no want be fat idiot!\" Bulma got back into panic mode, after finally realizing that she was getting dumber. Her mind started forgetting a lot of things, and she got short term memory loss. She even forgot that she was getting dumber, so she stopped being in such a panic. \"What Bulma do again?\" Bulma said, starting to drool. She scratched her butt, and Bulma...</span></div></div>",

By the end of three months, she was rather obese and smelled quite badly, but her burps a farts were still rather average. This meant she would lose the gas contest portion of the wager unless she did something fast! She needed a Master, but who? </span></div></div>",

Although used to watching vast swathes of food be demolished by a single individual, she was baring witness to a massacre of food unrivaled by any Saiyan or Majin Buu. The table, counters, chairs, and floor were being flooded in various utensils, pots, pans, cups, et al, all of which were literally licked clean. However, that was the closest thing to sanitation in the room, as every other square inch of surface area was being splattered in food, drink, and saliva. Not even the ceiling and windows were spared the carnage. One of them was covered in artificial protein and chlorophyll-based nourishment to such a degree that Videl\u2019s vision of the outside was completely obscured. While the sight was repulsive, the smell and sounds were far more repugnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you invited me here for what reason, again?\u201d Videl questioned, wincing at the older woman\u2019s sick behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"duLink\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Chi-Chi\"> Chi-Chi</a> \u00a0<a title=\"New Window\" href=\"http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Chi-Chi\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><img style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a> was either too engrossed in her meal to know what she asked or couldn\u2019t hear her due to the noises made during the feasting.  The Son matriarch was practically unhinging her jaw to accommodate the steak bones, brown banana peels, lumpy milk, and other inedible food being shoveled inside. There was so much food that she physically couldn\u2019t chew with her mouth closed, not that she\u2019d want to. This meant that her guest was subject to watching the food crammed between Chi-Chi\u2019s chipmunk cheeks moisten with saliva. As she weakly grinded her jaws to further break down the food to the point where it could be safely swallowed, some of it was flung out of her mouth and landed damn near everywhere. Videl had to swerve and duck to avoid the regurgitated meal hitting her, though a few specks nailed her in the head and arms. Eventually, Chi-Chi managed to choke down a whole cooked turducken, drool leaking from her mouth as she did. She then felt particularly parched and began sucking on a 2 litre bottle of soda like a baby on milk formula. The bubbles tickled her tongue, making her giggle as it cascaded down her throat like a carbonated waterfall. After five minutes, the drained bottle was crumpled and carelessly discarded onto the littered floor. The chemical reaction between the sugary beverage and the partially digested solid matter caused the Ox-Princess\u2019s swollen meatball of a belly to roar in agony, a sound that startled Videl but Chi-Chi had an easy way to remedy that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*BBBBBUUUUUURRRRPPPPPPPP!*~ ~*PPPPPHHHHHHHRRRRRRRTTTTTT!*~</b></i></u>\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimultaneously, plumes of green and brown gas erupted from Chi-Chi\u2019s north and south ends, respectively. Like an explosion, both fart and burp were short but loud, though the older woman still felt she could\u2019ve done better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, that was so weak!\u201d She yelled in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe recently stunned Videl could think of just one response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026And that\u2019s why I invited you here.\u201d The slovenly Chi-Chi explained, trying to lick some BBQ sauce off of her purple cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel just sat in her seat, her eyes widened as she tried to process the new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happens after this competition is over?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-Chi gave a stare, unable to some up with a response. Yeah, she wanted to win, but even if she did, was it even possible to lose this weight after it had served its purpose? She was 220 lbs now for Kami\u2019s sake! Twice what she was before this bet was made, and she didn\u2019t know what her family would say about it when they returned. She was uncertain if winning was worth the potential embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI-I honestly don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been so focused on beating Bulma that I never considered that.\u201d The Ox-Princess answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, my dad\u2019s away on business and he won\u2019t be back for a while, so I guess I could help\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you! With you as a master, Bulma can\u2019t win.\u201d Chi-Chi declared, raising a pit-stained right arm in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, whoa. Just make sure no one else finds out. It\u2019ll be humiliating if the wrong person knows.\u201d The junior Satan requested with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal.\u201d</span></div></div>",

In fact, some would say say she could surpass her husband Vegeta in this quality when given proper motivation. Such motivation came the day Chi-chi came over to show off what she called \"the new her.\" The Capsule Corp heiress was shocked to find the Son matriarch had gained at least two hundred pounds since their last meeting and was dressed in stained, wrinkled clothes. Adding to Bulma's amazement was the way Goku's wife was outdoing him in the eating department, devouring the buffet lunch that Mrs. Brief  had laid out for guests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it wonderful Bulma? Now that I've finally gotten to loosen up and forgotten about being a perfect wife, I feel great!\" Chi-chi punctuated her sentence with a huge belch. Bulma waved the smell away and tried to smile. \"Uh...that's great and all, Chichi, but what about Goku? Don't you think he'd be a bit... shocked to see you this way?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi scoffed. \"Oh, he never pays attention to me. Who cares, anyway? The slob life is the life for me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBulma shrugged. \"Suit yourself. I could never do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi barked a laugh, spraying food from her mouth. \"You? Of course not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught Bulma's attention and she frowned, raising an eyebrow. \"Excuse me?\"  \"You're too prissy for the slob lifestyle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prissy!?\" Bulma exclaimed \"I could slob out just as easy as you, and probably do it even better!\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-chi snickered. \"Sure. Wanna bet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I bet I could slob up more than you within six months and if I can't, I'll support your lifestyle for the next ten years!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...deal.

The humidity made Chi-Chi\u2019s hair poof out a bit. Her sweat glands poured cooling, but smelly liquid all over her body because of the heat. This only made her job more difficult as she had to stay farther away from the food in order to avoid dropping sweat in it.

However, despite all of the obstacles she faced, the Son monarch gritted her teeth and somehow managed to complete the feast to end all feasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*pant* Darn it. *huff* Usually, I don\u2019t get this winded until the boys ask for seconds. *puff*\u201d Chi-Chi said in between bouts of exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spread that was laid out on the dinner table had a size that was thought of as only possible in an All-You-Can-Eat Buffet with a special on all of the food. Its smell was almost incomprehensibly great. The only thing keeping it from being perfect was an unidentified raunchy odor in the room.

Chi-Chi felt a odd pang of hunger in her flat and firm stomach. As she clutched it, a loud and low growl emitted from her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOr I could just start eating right now. I mean, I could just clean up after dinner.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pondering for a bit, Chi-Chi decided to\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After finishing that she devoured the whole chicken, from there she grabbed onto the pork chops, the beef steaks, and the duck and more; she even gulped down a big pot of beans! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dug into the food mercilessly, with sauce and grease dripping everywhere on her shirt and developing pudgy belly. In a few minutes, half of the food she had prepared was gone, but her small belly was visibly bigger, her shirt riding up her soft skin.  She smiled with a disgusted pride, somehow, with each bite, she cared less of how she looked and cared more about how her belly felt. Eating another piece of beef with dripping greasy hands, she suddenly stopped when she heard something she thought she would never do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>PPPPRRRRRPPTTT!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nChi-Chi froze in place and blushed in deep red at the sound of her fart.</div></span></div></div>",

Also Pan's appearance will be based around the GT one: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120322142821/dragonball/images/5/53/PanDragonBall.jpg,\" target=\"_blank\">http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120...</a> however her personality will be some form of continuation of the one we were introduced in Dragonball Z.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a relatively peaceful time in the world for the Z Fighters, eleven years have passed since Majin Buu's defeat (Kid Buu specifically) and the encounter with Bills. Since then there was virtually been no evil villains anywhere for the Z Fighters to tackle, but that wasn't stopped them from enjoying themselves with a couple of friendly sparring sessions and so on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen year old Pan, the daughter of Son Gohan and Videl, was out soaring through the air far away from the city where she lived. Flying across various places, pushing herself to see whatever she could find in the far distance. You see Pan was out looking for something, recently she has been hearing all sorts of stories from her dad and grandfather, whenever he visited to see his family while training Uub. The two have told Pan about their experiences growing up and all the things that had to go through to tackle and accomplish their goals of getting stronger and protecting the Earth. Tales such as learning long traditional techniques like the Kamehameha, transforming into the various forms of the Super Sayian and the challenges they had to overcome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince that very day Pan has been really enthusiastic of going out and discovering a set of skills and techniques of her own; that she would like to show off to her friends and family. Continuing flying above some mountain tops Pan noticed a small yellow and green shrine near a waterfall. She lowered herself to the ground and landed in-front of the shrine. There she found the place to be completely deserted, as if no one has touched it in years. Cob-webs and dust was all over the place once she entered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello...? Anyone home?\" Pan shouted but the only response she got was a faint echo of her voice. While looking around to see what she could find, she came across a huge chest with a broken lock attached. \"I wonder what's inside here...\" she said. Carefully opening the lid of the chest, there she found inside were nine scrolls bundled together, a book with a blue hard cover and next to it were two jars filled with seeds with multiply colours and the other jar filled with some sort of black liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's all this stuff,\" asking herself, she picked up the book and gently opened it making sure she didn't tear any of the pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masters Arts of the Slobocola Fu,\" she read. \"Whoever finds this chest and the contents inside it, I hope my legacy will continue on from the grave. When I was still alive I wasn't sure if the world was ready see the potential of the Slobocola and I've shouldn't have waited too long, with no prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to take under my hand; I died before showing it to the world. I hope you lone wanderer will somehow manage to continue my legacy and life-long dream. Signed Master Fartcii\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the book, Pan couldn't help but smile. This was exactly she was looking for on her travel. She carried the chest outside in the daylight to carefully read the pages and scrolls before getting herself started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, where do I begin?\" turning to the third page of book she read out loud, \"In order to begin the art of Slobocola, you need to drink up the jar with the black liquid, later on you will be taught how to make more in the future. This liquid contains a special 'medicine' which increases your appetite and modifies the natural flow of your absorption of fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot bothering to question the book's logic she picked up the jar, opened the lid and drank the liquid in one gulp. \"Mmm... that was actually pretty goo-UURRPP!\" instantly blushing from what escaped from her mouth. \"Heh, don't know where that came from,\" she said to herself giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's next?\" turning to the next page the book said...</div><br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Maybe this involves doing something similar.\"<br>\r\nPan breathed deeply and concentrated hard. She manifested her Ki in her stomach and tried channeling it under her, but instead of flying, she was trying to release a Ki blast from her butt. At first, nothing came out, so Pan squatted down and began straining, hoping to force herself to fart out a Ki blast. After a few minutes of screaming and sweating, she felt a huge burst of energy build up in her lower back side. This feeling made her smile in anticipation.<br>\r\n\"Oh, boy. Here it comes\" Pan said excitedly.<br>\r\nWith one final painful grunt, Pan became the first person in years to fart out blasts of energy.<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*FFFFFFAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTTT!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\nThe ground beneath Pan's feet rumbled from the force of her fart as a yellow Ki blast shot out of her butt flew into a nearby mountain, leveling the top half instantly. Pan looked behind her to check the damage.<br>\r\n\"Whoa, didn't expect that.\" She said.<br>\r\nThen, she turned back to the book.<br>\r\n\"After learning the first half of firing gas blasts, you must learn the second half, which is firing them from your mouth.\"<br>\r\nAt first, Pan didn't think it was a big deal. She thinks that since her father's friend, Piccolo, could fire Ki blasts from his mouth, so what was so special about this technique? Then, she realized that since her last gas blast was caused by farting, then this would be caused by burping.<br>\r\n\"Okay, that black liquid already made me burp so I think I can do this a bit more easily than the last one.\"<br>\r\nPan began gulping down air to fuel her belch. After wards, she started pressurizing the gas in her stomach by charging up Ki in order to increase the power of her burp. When she was done building up pressure, Pan used her energy to force the gas out of her belly. It entered her mouth, causing her cheeks to bulge outward. She then turned away from the book to avoid possibly destroying it.<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBBBBBBBBBBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLLLLLLLLCCCCCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHH!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\nThe female quarter-Saiyan's burp echoed throughout the mountain and caused an avalanche somewhere on the lower half. A purple Ki beam rocketed past Pan's lips and pierced through several mountains in front of her. <br>\r\n\"Guess I've got this gas blast thing down. I wonder what the next lesson is.\" Pan said.</span></div></div>",

Seeing she had successful learned how to control her Ki from her rear and mouth; she was willing to try and see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcentrating once again, she stepped away from the book and got herself into position. There Pan started clenching her hands and started to manifest her Ki into a ball of energy in front of her. Luckily for her this didn\u2019t take too long, when she was channelling her energy inside her stomach. In a few seconds she had a ball of energy in front of her; ready to be used in whatever way she liked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, here goes nothing,\u201d she said nervously.

Her thighs bulked up and started rubbing against each other. Her flat belly expanded into a nice potbelly, which her red top could barely cover. Her arms grew thicker and chunky, including her hands puffed up, making her fingers resemble sausages. And lastly her breasts grew into the size of soccer balls, and gained a double chin on her cute face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh....\" she sighed, patting her belly, followed by a small belch.  \"Oops!

However she didn\u2019t take the time to notice that it was already sunset, she was going to be late if she doesn\u2019t get back home on time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGathering the things she had taken out from the chest, she re-packed them and placed the chest under her sweaty elbow and flew away from the mountains in top speed (thanks to her Gas Ki abilities).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had arrived home\u2026.</div></span></div></div>",

Food will be ready once your father is back,\u201d Videl replied, not once looking away from the T.V. Using this opportunity to surprise her folks later on, Pan silently flew up the staircase and went straight to her room. Once inside, she pulled all the things she had collected from that temple and laid them out on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she wanted to continue learning the hidden secrets of Slobocola Fu, she had to wait until tomorrow before causing any problems in her home. Bending down while letting out a small toot, Pan saw the jar of seeds and wondered what they may be. Dumping her ass on her carpet, Pan opened the book and searched to find any answers of the seeds. There near the end of the book, she discovered what purpose they served.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe seeds are known as the Slabzu, once planted they will grow and offer replenishing fruit that can give a burst of energy for learning the arts of Slobocola,\u201d She read aloud. Continuing to read more about it, Pan found out it roughly takes a day for the plant to grow and start offering its fruit; and that black liquid she drank was the juices of the fruit. Picking herself up from the carpet, she waddled to her closet and pulled out a small pot she kept when she tried growing a Senzu bean awhile back. Placing the pot on her desk, she went back to book and checked what the preparations were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn order for the Slabzu to reach its full potential, it must be watered and buried in\u2026 FECES?!\u201d she screamed in horror!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPAN? Something wrong?\u201d shouted Videl downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cU-Um nothing! I just tripped! I\u2019m o-okay!\u201d Pan responded back immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShocked by the discovery what needs to be done, Pan sighed and took a deep breath. She undressed herself until she was fully naked in her bedroom, she dumped her clothes onto her bed and pulled the empty pot underneath her. Once ready, Pan crouched and clenched her fists, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nnnnnghh.... C'mon...\" she said to herself. Finally, she managed to push out a fat, solid log of poop into the pot and then another and another! Pan\u2019s eyes crossed and her nostrils flared, with her teeth and gums showing; making all sorts of odd facial expressions as her crap kept building up in the pot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh\u2026! Aaaaahh...! Mmmm! Ooh\u2026 this is kinda nice!\" She said with a crooked grin and eyes rolled back. Explosive farts blasted out of her flabby behind one after another, sometimes lasting more than half a minute each! Eventually she finished and looked down to see the pot was filled to the peak. No longer disgusted by what she had to do, Pan collected one of the seeds and shoved into the pot making sure it was wedged in between her crap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her room, she went to the bathroom to water the pot.</div></span></div></div>",

Hearing the word dinner, instinctively made Pan\u2019s stomach gurgle with hunger; followed by a small trail of drool that leaked out from the mouth. Forgetting to dress up, Pan remained nude and proceeded to go to the kitchen and eat whatever her mother had prepared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel was humming a lovely tune to herself, when suddenly she heard a chorus of loud thuds coming down from the stairs. \u201cWhat on earth?!\u201d she remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mommy! That looks delicious!\u201d Pan says with a cheery grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention from the table to the kitchen entrance, Videl was speechless at what she saw, expecting to her little girl from earlier today, was now seeing the first time her daughter\u2019s recent growth spurt. \"PAN?! Is that you?! WHAT THE\u2026?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling up to the table and giving her mother a small kiss on the cheek, she pulled out a chair and sat down to have her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, it\u2019s me alright! Do you like what you see mommy? I found this awesome training guide!\" said Pan as she bent over and squeezed her soft breasts together on the table, whilst collecting whatever food she could reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVidel struggled to find words to say for this sudden event, while her blob of a daughter was ravenous with the dinner, as she ate almost all the food that was presented. Chowing down all the contents that her mother had served, Pan\u2019s flabby body started to gain more mass, slightly pushing herself away from the table. Videl watched silently as Pan continued to cram food into her mouth as fast as she could, getting crumbs and stains all over her body. She thought nothing else except of eating, even when she was letting out farts; she didn't seem to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she was done eating\u2026</div></span></div></div>",

The adult demi-Saiyan strolled through the living room, humming a catchy jingle as he carried mountains of groceries meant for tomorrow\u2019s dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVidel, Pan, I\u2019m home.\u201d He called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reply to his greeting came in the form of a house-shaking belch that originated from the kitchen. Its odor wafted through air until Gohan\u2019s nostrils were exposed to it. He hunched forward and clasped his nose shut to cut off the scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh! Wha wus that schmell?\u201d He questioned though his closed sniffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding no other way to get an answer to his not-completely-rhetorical question, the first son of Son Gok\u016b marched into the kitchen and saw an obscene scene taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<u><i><b>~*BBBUURRRRPPPP!*~</b></i></u> That was great!\u201d Stated the now 200 pound quarter-saiyan youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan shielded his nose again, damning his alien-enhanced sense of smell for making the burp smell worse to him than to a full human, and turned to see his loving wife, who was in a fit of hysteria. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cH-How is this\u2026? Where could? I don\u2019t understand?!\u201d She stammered, her hands pulling down her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVidel, what happened?\u201d Gohan asked, resting the groceries on a counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe daughter of Hercule was still stuck in a trance before the words of her husband finally snapped her out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cG-Gohan? I don\u2019t know! Pan was the same as always when she left earlier today, but when she came back, she was like this.\u201d Videl spouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan, for her part, was completely ignorant of her parents\u2019 concerned conversation. Instead, she was contently drilling her right pinkie into her ear and popping any left scraps of food in her mouth, all while sporting a grin that showed her new laid-back personality. Then, she felt a large rumble in her lower stomach that migrated to her watermelon-sized ass, making her smile wider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*FFFFFFRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTT!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan\u2019s fart blasted from her butt with an odor far surpassing any currently emanating from her. The bent wooden chair that was already struggling to house her corpulent form at last shattered. The teenager landed on the ground with a thud, giggling at the ripples that the impact sent across her blubbery body. The fart\u2019s blare caught the attention of the mother and father, and they gasped at what\u2019d happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPAN! Are you alright?\u201d Gohan inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl merely giggled in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, daddy. I\u2019ve just did some really cool training today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTraining?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe said she found a training guide while she was out today.\u201d Videl explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! It\u2019s in my room if you want to look at it.\u201d Pan stated, still oblivious to her parents clear discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan and Videl entered their daughter\u2019s room and noticed the chest filled with torn scrolls, seed-filled jars, and a blue book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Videl said, flipping though the book. \u201cWell, I guess Pan was telling the truth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but why woul-Hurgh!\u201d Gohan groaned, having encountered another foul air that made his eyes water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it, Goh-aaaaugh!\u201d His wife followed suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth adult\u2019s looked around the room until Videl caught sight of the small shit-filled pot and a pile of Pan\u2019s clothes sitting next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains why she\u2019s naked.\u201d The woman mused with her left thumb and index finger pinching her nostril.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to talk to her about this.\u201d Gohan said, to which Videl nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut first, we\u2019re bathing her.\u201d She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking the plant pot outside and giving Pan about 3 thorough baths, the family of three sat in the living room, where Pan had exposited her exploits from earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...And that how I got like this.\u201d She finished, now sporting a larger version of her clothes courtesy of Gohan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would you do this, though?\u201d He questioned, adjusting his ebony-rimmed square glasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfter hearing about all the cool stuff that you and grandpa Gok\u016b did, I wanted to discover something for myself. I thought that if I\u2019d learned some special technique or fighting style, then I\u2019d be a hero like all of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Videl and Gohan smile. It was nice that even at her age, Pan still looked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPan, we\u2019re glad that you want to do something great to make us proud, but are you sure that being a slob is the way to go?\u201d Videl asked, putting a hand on her daughter\u2019s right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young hybrid contemplated her decision\u2026 for approximately 10 seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah! I\u2019ve already come this far, so I might as well finish it.\u201d She declared with a confident smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan and Videl shared a look for a moment before turning back to Pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m still not sure\u2026\u201d Videl mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut I\u2019m getting good at it.\u201d Pan whined. \u201cAnd I can it to help in a fight, too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d Gohan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah. I told that I burped and farted ki blasts and made force fields with my BO. That\u2019s useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan sat quietly for a few seconds. He felt her daughter\u2019s ki and noticed that it <i>had</i> increased significantly over today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to show us what exactly you can do with your new training. If you\u2019re right about your new abilities being useful, then I\u2019ll support your new lifestyle.\u201d He offered. \u201cWithin reason, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut if not, then you put this behind you. Do we have a deal?\u201d Videl questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Pan accepted, then yawned. \u201cBut can we do it tomorrow? I\u2019m tired.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That was crushed underneath her weight and covered in her sweat and mess. While she was told to wear her clothes again last night, after that discussion with her folks; she felt a lot more comfortable sleeping in the nude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not wanting to displease her parents, Pan decided to just put on her shirt that barely covered her breasts; while her belly apron hid her private bits in-front. As she admired her growing body in the mirror, her stomach suddenly gurgled loudly; literally making her belly vibrate and rumble a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm so hungry right now...\" Scooping up her belly before dropping it down, making it slap against her thick legs. \"But I need to check on my plant, Daddy took it outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't quite understand why he took it outside, but nevertheless she was excited to it's progress. Not bothering to walk (Or waddle for her case) Pan instead decided to gently levitate above from the ground and fly out of her room, down the stairs and head straight to the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she arrived at the garden, she looked around to find pot but she sadly couldn't find it anywhere. \"Awwww... Don't tell me Daddy threw away instead?\" She said to herself, getting a little depressed from the mere thought of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that idea was put to rest when she discovered a plant she had never seen more. \"Oh -UURP- wooowww!\" She burped between her gasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere sitting between some bushes was this weird curly looking tree that looked as tall as her father. The bark was coloured with many stripes of brown and black, orange and yellow leaves that grew out from it's branches that had a weird autumn feel to them and looking down to it's roots, there she found the pot she used was broken into pieces as the tree's roots dug their way into the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome!\" She applauded at her 'farm' work, making her bounce a little from sudden enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she noticed underneath some of the branches, the tree was already baring some fruit. Light orange colour weirdly shaped fruits that almost resembled a pear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrooling uncontrollably as her lips quivered at the sight of the fruit, still feeling hungry from earlier, the fruit did look rather appetising...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan flew up slowly to the tree and collected a couple to try out. \"These look very nice,\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the grass floor with her bare ass, Pan sloppily licked her lips before taking a bite out of the first fruit. With a loud crunch, the fruit tasted very sweet and sour at the same time, making Pan shut her eyes very tight and moan a little from delight. Then all of a sudden, Pan felt a overwhelming boost of power filling up inside her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body started to bloat and expand like before when she ate those Ki based meals, growing another chin on her face while her breasts and ass grew a lot bigger than before; along with her belly that was now starting to reach the ground where she sat. Her red shirt was slowly becoming a bra for the massively obese girl, ripping a little in the center. Eventually it came to a stop and Pan was huge in comparison to weight she was before!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>UUUURRRRRPPPPP!!!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelching loudly and devouring the rest of the fruit she bit into, Pan gazed upon her body and smiled joyfully with the changes. \"This is perfect!

Her strong Saiyan muscles, having been further magnified by the decadent fruit she\u2019d consumed, were capable of working through several inches of flab to keep the young girl standing. Though despite her newfound power, she still had trouble breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c*huff* *huff* What\u2019s this feeling\u2026 *cough* in my lungs?\u201d Pan pondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan pressed her right fist to her bouncy breasted chest, hoping to dislodge the squirming substance that clung to her insides. After several forceful thumps, the mass bulged up her throat and quickly filled her mouth. Pan grimaced at the flavor of mucus that assaulted her taste buds and evicted the slimeball with a quick spit. The six inch wide green blob of saliva and snot soared through the air, landing on a large boulder 30 feet away. The slab of stone began to dissolve as soon as the glob made contract with it. Vapor rose from the once solid parts of the rock until the entire chuck of earth was liquefied into a bubbling soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, guess I can spit acid loogies now.\u201d Pan summarized. \u201cSweet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more questioning the new limits of her repulsive, yet interesting abilities, Pan\u2019s attention circumvented back to her newly acquired adipose. She gave it a quick shake, giggling as the fat rippled around her body, and got an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStarting with a right hook, quickly followed by a high kick and left chop, Pan planned on working up another sweat, though not on using it for the same purpose as before. After a few minutes of surprisingly swift movement, every gland on the Sayian hybrid\u2019s skin oozed sweat, especially on her perfectly spherical stomach. Her shirt-bra was completely damp, and her constant movement was what finally ripped it apart. Now stark naked outside (and reeking even more), Pan initiated the next phase of her plan by flying high into the sky, until her corpulent form blotted out the sun like a solar eclipse. The sun\u2019s rays refracted off of the drops of Pan\u2019s belly sweat, like with rain drops after a storm to create a rainbow, but Pan had something different in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands close to the center of her stomach with her fingers spread toward her popped out navel, Pan uttered the newly christened moniker of her somewhat inspired technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBELLY FLARE!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the adults in the family were still in their bedroom, resting from the ordeal with their daughter, among other things. Their bed was in the same ruined state as Pan\u2019s, albeit for completely different reasons. The two were spread out across the mattress, both half covered in messy sheets. Videl\u2019s hair, normally tied up in a hip-length braid with an orange hairband, was now undone in a wild unkempt heap. Gohan\u2019s hair was relatively unchanged from the usually spiky short style, but if one were in their room a couple hours prior, they\u2019d see his ebony locks lighten into a pulsing gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe window was closed, though with open blinds and a black curtain, which led to something that would give the two a rude awakening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*FLASH!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with closed eyelids, Gohan and Videl were still exposed to the brief, yet powerful burst of white light that shone through the window. Gohan roared in agony and collapsed off the bed, while Videl buried her face into her white pillow to get rid of the blinding feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Pan watched the aftermath of her impromptu attack. The light that emanated from her was so intense that a circle of grass below her was charred by it. Pan gave out a nervous giggle, before being greeted by her aggravated parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPan! What happened out here?\u201d Gohan inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, Mom and Dad. Why is your hair ruffled?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this question, Gohan and Videl were momentarily flustered, Gohan blushing and his wife looking away from her daughter, but they quickly got back on topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the issue. What caused that bright light?\u201d Videl asked back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd why are you larger and naked again?\u201d Gohan continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, it was Pan\u2019s turn to fluster as she blushed and rubbed the back of her head with her right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, the seeds in the pot that Dad took out grew into a big tree. Wanna see?\u201d She suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPan flew down to the tree and snatched a different fruit than from earlier, and went to Videl, who was back on the ground. However, Gohan was examining the newly planted tree, plugging his nose as the scent of the \u2018soil\u2019 that it was fertilized in still lingered. He plucked some fruit from the tree too, noticing that the one in his right hand was light orange and spiky, like a durian. In his left hand was what appeared to be an apple, but this was smaller, blood red and looked a bit over ripe. These fruit seemed familiar to him, and then he came upon a realization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan turned to his family, seeing that Pan offered the spiky fruit to Videl, unaware of the consequences that it would have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVidel, stop!\u201d</span></div></div>",

Long ago him, his father, Goku, and friends became across a very sinister being who too had sacred fruit to offer.

Then, she gobbled up the ball, moaning in delight at the unexpected taste. Pan jumped up and down, excited that she was able to learn it so quickly. However, Gohan was still in a fit of shock, wondering how exactly his wife and daughter\u2019s mentalities were warped so drastically by just fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that something weird is going on here.\u201dGohan mused. \u201cI should take these fruits to Korin. Maybe he\u2019ll know what they are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan turned to the tree a plucked a few of the fruits. Then, he pressed his left index and middle finger up to his forehead, sensing of Ki of the old cat master. Instantly, Gohan was transmitted to the top of Korin\u2019s Tower above Upa\u2019s village. The white-furred feline was initially startled by the sudden appearance of the half-human, but quickly got over it. Gohan explained everything that he knew about the slobby issue concerning his family; Pan\u2019s swift weight gain, the tree\u2019s growth spurt, and the strange fruit that had radically altered Pan and Videl\u2019s personalities. After several minutes, Gohan\u2019s story had ended and Korin cleared his throat to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see. This is the work of my old enemy, Master Fartcii.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Gohan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is the dangerous mystical martial arts master; a disgusting, repugnant one who was also condescending and deceptive. She and I have quarreled in the past, when she attempted to obtain the Ultra Divine Water and somehow corrupt it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that the Water <i>could</i> be corrupted.\u201d Gohan stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, she tried.\u201d Korin explained. \u201cI outmatched her combat skills, but she cheated by using magic. Although I prevented her from attaining all of the Water, she was able to get a cup of it and fled.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHowever, I do have some information regarding the fruits that you\u2019ve brought.\u201d Korin continued. \u201cYou see, in addition to participating in magical combat, Fartcii was also a certified botanist with an impressive knowledge of agriculture. Using these skills, she was able to grow and harvest these monstrous vegetations that can greatly affect those who consume them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorin pointed to each of the fruit currently cradled in Gohan\u2019s arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one that look like a pear caused rapid weight throughout the entire body, but also bestows an incredible boost in power. The durian-looking one gives whoever eats it intense gas. Finally, the apple dulls intelligence and can even send the eater into an inebriated-like state.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan was mortified by this revelation, especially at the mention of that apple, as it brought up bitter memories of when he had to be rescued by Goku and Krillin from the little blue deicidal conqueror, Garlic Jr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll three of these fruit also possess the ability to alter one\u2019s mind to be more complacent and child-like, willing to obey someone with little hesitation.\u201d Korin added. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective way to recruit followers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, how do I return my family back to the way that they were?\u201d Gohan inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKorin paused, rubbing his soft chin in contemplation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm. Well, I might be able to concoct an antidote with the fruit that you have, but it\u2019ll take some time.\u201d He answered. \u201cIn the meanwhile, you should worry about keeping your kid and wife out of trouble, and destroy that tree while you\u2019re at it. We don\u2019t want anyone else possibly falling under the influence.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will, and thank you, Korin.\u201d The young scholar bowed with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Gohan.\u201d The centuries-old martial artist replied in kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan returned to his home, preparing his next move.</span></div></div>",

Once complete, an aura engulfed Pan, but rather than the yellowish white one she had previously, this was a dark brown hue. Videl gasped and even Pan was surprised. \u201cHuh, I wonder why this is a different color. It might be because of how much bigger I\u2019ve gotten.\u201d She mused. Nevertheless, she materialized a dark brown dome-shaped barrier of Ki around herself. \u201cOkay mom, I want you to fire an energy blast at me.\u201d Pan instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?

Just follow our instructions once you're in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my lord,\" Fasha responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe raised herself up from the ground and waited for Frieza to leave into a different room titled \"Moderation.\" Following orders, Fasha made her way to the next room titled \"Test: Slob.\" The Saiyan wondered what the title meant but merely shrugged it off as she attempted to keep her composure, remembering that Frieza had said that he'd be monitoring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Fasha entered the room she was greeted by...</span></div></div>",

Hell, she would've even killed whoever said such words to her. The only exception is Frieza, who wouldn't hesitate before wiping her off the map. Knowing to keep her cool, Fasha ignored Frieza's comment. \"This will be simple. Just drink the vials I tell you to drink in order. You will not argue or drink the vials other than the ones I tell you to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Lord Frieza,\" she replied, wondering if Frieza can hear her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Frieza said, which obviously meant he can hear her. Fasha observed the different vials before her. They each had different colors and seemed to glow vibrantly. She began to ask herself if they were safe. Judging by the looks on them, they probably weren't. They didn't even have labels on them, which made her further question this experiment. However, as much as she objected, she knew she couldn't fight back, already running through her head what Frieza would do to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, to begin, drink the...\"</span></div></div>",

When she was done, she was craving more, forgetting that the vial is supposed to have an effect on her. Just then, Fasha can hear Frieza laughing over the intercom. It was a wicked, maniacal cackle.

At first she assumed the formula was super fattening and immediately made her chubby. However, this theory was disproven as soon as she saw her gut still growing. She put her hands on her stomach, trying to conceal her expanding flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No use hiding it, I can see it clearly,\" said Frieza over the intercom. Fasha knew Frieza, along with whoever else was possibly accompanying him, could see her clearly. However, she felt as if she still had dignity to protect, so hiding her gut was the only desperate solution she could come up with under pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were moving forward as her stomach was pushing them, growing to the point of obesity. Her belly wasn't the only thing growing. She was now getting some junk in her trunk as her butt was growing wider and pushing back. It would keep growing until it was resemble two beach balls. Her breasts started expanding to an enormous size. They reached the size of two soccer balls that would sag with fat. Her arms and legs would plump up as well, her legs growing big enough to support her new rump, and her arms growing with flab that would hang downward. Fasha's hands would become bigger and softer, with her fingers resembling sausages now. She even formed a double-chin, however with her weight growing, a third one seemed to be in the making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFasha was relieved one the transformation finally ended, but was still horrified to see her new body. She looked as if she weighed over 300 Ibs thanks to Frieza's stupid formula! What's worse is that she knew Frieza had more vials ready for her, so she could only imagine what would happen by the time she would finish. Fasha took a moment and poked her enlarged belly, cringing in disgust. She then felt her enlarged behind, which let out a small toot due to her size, making the obese Saiyan blush immensely, despite how quiet it was. Luckily for her, Frieza didn't hear it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFasha was absolutely terrified by her new state! Would the gargantuan warrior be able to fight again? Not in this flabby state! She only hoped that Frieza was at least kind enough to give her a cure by the end of this experiment. Meanwhile, Frieza was still laughing as the Saiyan's dismay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my! You look so helpless! I almost feel bad!\" he laughed, making Fasha blush in embarrassment. On the bright side, Fasha's clothes still fit her almost perfectly, due to the armor and spandex being elastic. However, due to her stomachs curvature, her armor and top-spandex rode up her belly, revealing her bellybutton. Other than the lower half of her belly being open, the rest of the woman's clothing fit her quite well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally ending his insane laughter, Frieza took a moment to breathe before finally giving the next order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhh, alright. Now for the next vial,\" started Frieza. Fasha couldn't help but fear what Frieza had in store for her next. Frieza continued, \"Okay monkey, drink the...\"</span></div></div>",

Part of her thought she should just blast a hole in the wall of Frieza's ship and try to fly out. However, she knew that option would end badly, as Frieza is watching her, plus is faster than her. In fact, even if Frieza wasn't faster than massive Saiyan before, he certainly is now that she a walking tub of lard. Flying away was certainly out of the question. Ideas rushed through her head as to how to get out of this. One involved possibly contacting someone for help, but again, with Frieza monitoring her calling any of her allies to come to her rescue was nearly impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't got all day! Drink the damn vial or I'll be having fried monkey for dinner!\" threatened Frieza with an angered tone. Snapping back to reality at the sound of Frieza's rage, Fasha stumbled toward the purple vial and immediately attempted to scarf it down quickly and get it over with. The taste was definitely not as good as the previous formula. As a matter of fact, it had no taste. It felt as if she were drinking water. Getting every bit of the compound into her system, Fasha took the empty vial away from her mouth and burped loudly, resulting in her covering her mouth and blushing. Just then, a gurgle can be heard from Fasha's gut, turning her face more red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is going to be hiliarious,\" Frieza told himself aloud. Fasha was suddenly scared to death, wondering what this vial has done to her. She looked all over the body as best as she can, finding no differences. She was scampering for thoughts as to what has happened. Suddenly, she let loose a very audible fart. Suddenly, it hit her as to what happened to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, does this little monkey need to go to the bathroom?\" laughed Frieza, watching the poor Saiyan burp and fart up a storm. She felt defeated and humiliated. She was a Saiyan warrior! Not some morbidly obese gasbag! What could she do? The answer was nothing. She was stuck between a rock and a hard place and couldn't get out. She could only blush as she would fart and burp, her wet farts making her blush the most. She would sometimes burp and release saliva with her gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see you buy the end of this experiment,\" chuckled Frieza. \"Now drink...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fasha sighed while breaking wind, knowing there's no way out for now. She realized a cycle of her drinking a concoction, something embarrassing happening to her, Frieza laughing, then barking orders. Fasha finally decided to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Frieza,\" she began cautiously. \"If it's not too much trouble, may you just tell me what two vials to drink? I know I must drink the pink one, but what should I drink after?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrieza pondered about Fasha's idea. It wasn't really a bad thought. Just tell her two and get it over with. While it wasn't in Frieza's nature to agree with any of the Saiyans due to how primitive he believed them to be, he had to admit that this would speed things up while still allowing him to get a good kick out of this monkey's misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" responded Frieza. \"Take the pink and orange ones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female fighter knew she should be careful taking two though, not knowing the effects of taking both simultaneously. Fasha was still smart, and knew how things like this worked. She opted to take the pink one, wait a second, then take the orange one. She grabbed the pink vial and immediately drank from it while cutting the cheese. Fasha didn't notice any chances, but again, she was disappointed and embarrassed. The difference was how this time she was scratching her butt instinctively, making her blush and cover her face with her free hand. Meanwhile, she smelled horridly. Her breathe instantly became foul and smelled of rotten eggs and meat. She farted again and would begin to cringe at the eye-watering scent. It became clear that this chemical made the once-powerful soldier smelly and have horrid manners that she couldn't control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAttempting to ignore more of Frieza's wicked laughter, Fasha took the orange formula with one hand and drank quickly, picking her bellybutton with her other hand. Putting the glass down, Fasha unleashed a smelly burp, the smell instantly reaching her nostrils and making her cover them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, this shouldn't be... U-Uhhh...\" Fasha was stunned in the middle of her sentence. She couldn't speak as her mind began emptying. Groaning from a giant headache, Fasha placed both hands on her cranium. She felt so dizzy to the point of heading for and leaning on the nearest wall. As she kept groaning, drool began making it's way out of the Saiyan's mouth. Obviously, she didn't notice that she was drooling due to her excruciating headache. However, Fasha's mind began deteriorating. Her thoughts started getting cloudy, some of her memories were being blocked, and so many of her skills including language and math began fading away. The worst part was, Fasha was aware of it. The Saiyan woman knew she was losing her IQ, and didn't know how to stop it. She felt like crying as she was no losing her body and mind. She felt weak and helpless during all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least her headache and dizziness had vanished, but the damage had been done. Fasha was now a drooling idiot, and was now fully aware of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanie make me dum-dum,\" cried Fasha, thinking she'd never see herself shed a tear in her life. Frieza was literally at the edge of his seat. The galactic emperor was also shedding tears, but out of joy and laughter. He couldn't contain himself at this Saiyan's humiliation. He was laughing so loud, he had to move away from the microphone. Feeling like he needed a moment, Frieza went to the mic to say one thing;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll be stepping out for a moment to regain myself,\" chuckled Frieza. \"Just give me a moment, and don't get any ideas, monkey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling his way out of the Moderation room, Frieza didn't feel too worried about Fasha. Now that she was an idiot, there seemed like there was no way for her to realize that this was an opportunity to escape. Frieza felt free to take his breather with no consequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this really the case though? Very limited thoughts and ideas raised the the Saiyan slob's head. She picked her nose as she stood in the test room. However, one of the thoughts that went through her dimmed state was escaping. Fasha hated herself, and this form. The thing was, she was very stupid. How could she realize that she could no escape?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas Frieza right? Could Fasha realize she could escape?</span></div></div>",

She simply raised her arm forward and attempted to shoot a ki blast. However, she only release fart after fart. Fasha was becoming frustrated. How can she open this door!? She kept trying and trying to the point of pooping herself. Luckily for her (As Fasha would die of humiliation even during this state), she didn't notice that she pooped herself thanks to her new idiocy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReady to throw a tantrum, Fasha started flailing her arms at the door like an infant, crying and screaming to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fasha want out! Mean door no open!\" she shouted. Much to the girl's surprise, the door finally fell down. Apparently, her strength, stamina, and speed did decay, but she was still just strong enough to break down a metal door. Fasha felt happy and cheered for herself, clapping her hands like a dumb baby. The obese slob started waddling out the door, trying to escape. Luckily for most of her trip, she didn't encounter a single Frieza soldier. The only flaw in the girl's escape plan was where she could get out. Unfortunately, she didn't notice the flaw in her plan, so she was just aimlessly walking until she would find something interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mean need leave,\" Fasha said to herself as she was picking her nose. It took her a moment to notice her picking it and immediately took it out in disgust. She may be dumb, but the old Fasha was still there, hating both her stupidity and her slobiness. \"Ew, ew, ew!

So naturally, at this point, Zangya found it outright hilarious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cables began to alter her mind, her laughing became stronger, to the point where she started laughing even when nothing \"funny\" was happening on screen. This nearly made her choke on some mashed potatoes, dropping the fork she was using to eat it with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"phew, must be Stick Thingies being mean more.\" reaching for the fork, she paused, completely drawing a blank on what the purpose of the shiney object was. \"What was I...\" her focus was cut when she noticed someone doing dance badly on the TV, causing her to giggle, and forget the fork existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How I eat again...? Oh right!\" Zangya grabbed a hundfull of the creamy mashed potatoes, and shoved into her face, only successfully landing half of it in her mouth. With her face covered in soft food, licked her lips, before putting her face straight onto the plate, releasing some gas while doing so. the room reaked of waste and farts, but the orange haired alien's supposed mother just stood there watching her baby girl make a fool of her self. Her grammar was failing, her memories of how to eat were dissapearing, and she'd no doubt believe literally everything she was told in less than an hour<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mommy's little girl is all messy, let me get that for you~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a napkin, the thick woman started wiping off some of the food left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's my little slob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangya, no longer understanding such a word, tilted her head in confusion, but decided to make a wild guess<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M... me? Me mommy's slob?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue skinned girl was rewarded with with a giant hug, her face engulfed by the woman's breast!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sweety! Good job!\" She never thought it would of worked this well, but that just meant better results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the hug ended, Zangya returned to feasting, laughing, and making noises from her bowels. Over an hour passed before she finished, and the results of the woman's plan showed all too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZangya...</span></div></div>",

She knew that the thought of her brain scaring her was nonsense, but she was willing to believe that over her gaining weight. She belched very loudly, making her feel embarrassed, despite being the only one in the Time Vault's garden, besides Toki-Toki.<br>\r\n\"Please, make this end!\" she begged to herself.<br>\r\nHer wish did come true about a minute after the growing stopped. She let go of her stomach once the pain ceased, and began breathing heavily. She had never breathed this heavily before in her life! Not even after a major exercise! She was quite stiff, but mustered up the courage she had to see her reflection in the lake. Moving closer to the lake (Which that alone felt like torture, due to her new weight and her now sweaty thighs rubbing against each other), she finally saw her new form in major shock. Trying her hardest to hold in a scream, as not to attract patrollers to come and see what was wrong, she could only gasp as quietly as she could.<br>\r\nSKT's body was nothing like her former self, in terms of shape. Her cheeks were very puff, similarly to that of a chipmunk's. Her breasts looked like a pair of only somewhat smaller basketballs, being very saggy. Her giant arms were full of pudginess, flab clearly hanging from them. From just raising her arm, it can be seen sweating and jiggling. Her hands faired no better, being quite pudgy, her fingers looking very plump like sausages. SKT's belly was even softer and bigger than before, drooping over her waist like an apron. The belly would gurgle and churn, much to the Kai's dismay, symbolizing it was holding in some massive amounts of gas. Her huge butt looked like to big watermelons. It was perhaps as big, if not bigger, than her belly. Her cheeks drooped down her legs and would sway and jiggle with each step. The Kai's thighs looked like logs and would share in the jiggling madness whenever she stepped. Sweat stains could already been seen in her crotch area, and even underarms.<br>\r\nHer breathing more labored, and a huge fart escaping her rear-end (Making SKT blush), the poor SKT could only think of a solution before things get worse... And knowing Demigra's magic, it's bound to get worse otherwise! SKT plopped her enormous rump on the ground, creating an unseen crack under her rear as well as causing her to force out a small belch, as she tried to ponder the answer to stopping her old nemesis' magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her...</span></div></div>",

Me want food! Me want food!\u201d she chanted while waddling until she noticed the water in the moat. She immediately jumped in, causing a loud splash for everyone to hear and go investigate.

Her gut's gurgling heard even through the surface of the water, the Kai finally stopped drinking and managed to heave her way out, now sitting on the ground by the moat. She let out a long belch before noticing the Namekian frogs that were hopping around by the water. Being dimwitted and having the attention span of a fly, SKT forgot that she was even hungry and began giggling at the frogs.<br>\r\n\"Hehe... He hopping,\" she giggled moronically. \"Me want do.\"<br>\r\nSKT went on all fours, her limbs spread out as far as she possibly could, attempting to hop just like the frogs. However, each of these said attempts ended in failure. The first hop she tried ended in her slamming on the ground, the impact forcing out another burp. Nevertheless, she would keep going. The second hop ended similarly, except the impact released a very wet fart. Finally, the third, obviously failed hop, ended with her... Crapping herself.<br>\r\nFFFRRRRPSHTSHPTTRRRRTT!!<br>\r\nSKT didn't even notice she had to go to the bathroom. However, even if she did, there would be nothing she could do about it. She was too stupid to know how to use a bathroom, let alone eve know what a bathroom was. It took a moment, but once the smell of her feces hit the Kai's nose, she immediately became curious. SKT started trying to trace the scent like a dog. Maybe it was part of Demigra's magic or it was possibly a trait of Kais even when they gain, but SKT was somehow flexible enough to have her nose reach her butt, wasting no time sniffing like a puppy. This would clearly further her humiliation.<br>\r\nSpeaking of humiliating, the patrollers who would pass by would notice each and every action SKT did. Their reactions of which were mixed. They would either become quite disgusted, wondering what the hell they would witness, become very confused, thinking of why she would do behave so... Strangely... Or just they just wouldn't know what to think, believing they could possibly be dreaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this didn't stop SKT...</span></div></div>",

Getting even angrier that before, she farted and lifted herself up from the floor and dived straight onto the frog, trapping it between her cleavage. \u201cFroggy going nowhere!\u201d she grinned. It took a moment for her to decide what to do next, as her mind was jumping back and forth on wondering what she could possible do with the poor thing; when suddenly she heard her stomach cry out again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill hungry\u2026\u201d she groaned.

The clothes could no longer handle the pressure her body was forcing on it, and finally ripped to shreds-- Her pants, shirt, robes, you name it! It was ripped off of her, leaving the Kai in only a pair of panties and a bra. And even then, both of which were near the breaking point. Half of her crack could be seen, since her feces was pulling down her panties, combined with the panties being too small to fully engulf her rear. Her bra had clear sweat stains, and looked like they could snap at any moment.

In fact, she actually feels relieved now that the pressure of her clothing isn't hindering her comfortability. She saw the remains of her clothing and sat on the floor, as opposed to bending over, to pick it up. Not getting up however, she brought the tattered remains from the ground to her face and sniffed it in curiosity.

She continued to stare at Kai\u2019s mammaries, watching them jiggle and slosh as she waved her body around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstincts kicking in, Towa dived straight into one of Kai\u2019s breasts and placed one of her tits into her mouth and began sucking away. Towa guzzled down the breast milk and moaned in ecstasy. Despite it tasting a little sour, it tasted better than she thought. Interrupting her switch for food, Kai was taken by surprise but didn't stop her. Instead she just moaned happily as Towa suckled her dry, shuddering in delight. Towa sucked harder on the nipple and guzzled down more milk. As gallons of milk went down her throat, Towa's stomach and body began to expand once again.</div></span></div></div>",

However, the Kai instantly noticed, her face leaping from her meal with an \"Ooh!\" before turning her obese head to see Videl licking her butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe... Angry lady like poopy-hole,\" giggled SKT like a moron, followed by picking her nose dimwittedly. The Kai took a moment to process the situation (Considering her... Current intellectual state) and finally came up with a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does angry lady... Duuuummmm... Like poopy-hole?\"</span></div></div>",

Watch where you\u2019re going, bud-Burdock?\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a better look at the person her knock over, she could see that was her mate: the low-class Saiyan warrior, Burdock, sporting a crazed look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, running into me?\u201d Gine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI came here to get help from the other Saiyans. I got a vision that Freeza would destroy the planet and he sent his mook, Dodoria, to kill my squadron. The others think that I\u2019ve lost it, so I\u2019m going to take him on by myself.\u201d He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all stunning news to the meek meat package employee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBurdock, you can\u2019t. Freeza\u2019s too powerful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven if it seems impossible, I\u2019ve to try something to defend us.\u201d Burdock argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I won\u2019t be of much help. I\u2019m not a fighter, remember.\u201d Gine pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but you can still get off of the planet in case the plan fails.\u201d Burdock stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat plan? You\u2019re probably just going to fly into space and try to blast Freeza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than doing nothing! Find a space pod and go to another planet, now!\u201d Burdock instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine thought about it for a bit. Sure, it sounded crazy, but Freeza wasn\u2019t exactly the nicest guy in the universe. That, and her lover sounded pretty serious about the situation. Eventually, she decided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll go, but I hope you make it out of this alive.\u201d Gine agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Burdock said with determined smirk, though he was surprised when Gine pulled him in for kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t an ordinary good-bye kiss, it was passionate. Their tongues entered each others\u2019 mouths and Gine\u2019s right leg lifted up. Gine wanted them to remember this for the rest of their lives (Spoilers: which in Burdock\u2019s case, wouldn\u2019t last much longer). After a few seconds, she relented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s in case your \u2018plan\u2019 doesn\u2019t work.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatching her playful gin with his own smirk, Burdock ran out to the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove as fast as you can! We won\u2019t have much time left!\u201d Burdock shouted behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine nodded and headed back to the place where Kakarrot had been sent to Earth. In a few minutes, she\u2019d arrived and was in the midst of determining where to flying her pod to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShould I follow my son to Earth? If someone found out where he was, then I wouldn\u2019t fare much better.\u201d Gine questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving little time to dwell on the matter, she ultimately chose to go to\u2026</span></div></div>",

Though she was sleeping the whole way through (After all, it was a long trip from Planet Vegeta to Earth), that didn\u2019t stop the Attack Ball from causing a shit ton of damage to the place it landed in. Once it did land, Gine awoke and disembarked. She yawned and stretched like any other person would, except her \u2018bed\u2019 was a 1.5 meter (4.92126 foot)-wide space pod that moved at 2,627,980,686,828 meters per second (5,878,625,373,183.607422 miles per hour). The attractive alien floated out of the smoldering crater that was about 7 feet in diameter and 9 feet in depth and was surveying the environment around her. She could tell that she was in a building of some sort, judging from the gaping hole in the ceiling above her. On the bright side, it was daytime so it was easy to see what was around her. There were 6x6x6 foot wooden crates surrounding her that were filled with something. Gine easily popped open the top and saw stacks of frozen beef patties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm\u2026 What are these things?\u201d Gine thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sniffed them cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey smell like meat, but they\u2019re cold and hard and flat.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a bite and chewed for a few seconds\u2026 then she squirmed in disgust and spat it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Bleck!</i> This tastes awful.\u201d The pink-clad female muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe decided to heat it up using her ki. Forming a small ball of yellow energy, Gine placed it under the patty and it heated it to normal standards in a couple of seconds. The once red disc of dead cow was now a brown, juicy, steaming piece of dead cow meat fit to serve to the average fast food customer. Biting into it again, Gine\u2019s eyes widened as she had a different reaction this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow! This is much better!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she lacked the violent nature of her brethren, she damn well possessed their appetite, as she began gobbling down the strange delicacy. Gine ate quickly, but still kept it at a pace where she could savor the flavor. Its soft texture felt heavenly to her and the thick grease brought pleasure to her taste buds. I just a couple of minutes, the food was utterly gone, lost forever in Gine\u2019s digestive tracts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmm, that was so good. <u><i><b>~*BBBRRRAAAPPP!*~</b></i></u>\u201d The oil-haired woman emitted a ghastly, 3-second burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks darkened to a light shade of cardinal and she clapped her hand to her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me.\u201d The female Saiyan apologized in spite of the supposed absence of witnesses to her slight lapse in manners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she decided to look for a way out of this place, hoping to discover what city this building was in. Seeing a door, Gine stepped through and found herself in the front side of the building. She could a counter, some tables, chairs, and, booths, and a big screen with pictures and names of food. Finally putting two and two together, Gine realized that\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m in a restaurant of some kind.

One day became two, then three, then a month, then a year. Though to her, it just blended together. Over that time, she had grown overly complacent with her odd living arrangements. You see, she <i>had</i> planned on finding her lost son, but the food was so damn good that she just couldn\u2019t bring herself to abandon it and her love showed. Her fairly toned abs had melted into a thick mass of blubber. That pretty face had grown a couple chins. Her pink armor expanded to conceal most of her body, but it was littered in sticky soft drink, French fry grease, and sweat. Her perky ass was now sagging. The perfect skin that encased her body was slathered in shiny oil and populated with pus-filled pimples from the greasy grub that had passed for her diet all these years. With a supply of food so vast that it would\u2019ve lasted decades even without rationing, she had no need to hunt, so she moved around less and less often. On occasion, she\u2019d muster up the energy to use the primitive restrooms inside of the building, but that was the extent of the \u2018exercise\u2019 that she engaged in. Even then, she found herself voiding her bladder and bowels in places other than a toilet, like the floor for instance. Soon there was more Saiyan urine and fecal matter <i>out</i> of the washrooms than in them, so the place became an almost literal shithole. That wasn\u2019t the only reason that the place stunk, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i><b>~*BBBBBBUUUUUURRRRRRPPPPPP!!*~</b></i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relative silence surrounding the building was blasted into nothingness by a rocket of gas exiting the woman\u2019s mouth. It clocked in at five seconds and was loud enough to scare off some bird perched in a few nearby trees. Luckily, they didn\u2019t stick around for the smell. If it were possible, the restaurant smelt <i>worse</i> after the booming belch bellowed from Gine\u2019s mouth. Any life form that for some reason still inhabited the area around the building could see actual lines of green smoke come out of the windows. And what response did the guilty girl have to her disgusting display?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was a good one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, Gine was content with her actions. Why wouldn\u2019t she be? With no one around, she felt less self-conscious about minuscule things such as bodily emissions or personal hygiene. In fact, she enjoyed it. Pushing limits on the length, volume, and foulness of her belches and farts. Using all parts of the restaurant as her own personal toilet. It was like heaven for her. Gine donned a goofy smile and resumed feasting upon her seemingly endless bounty.  She slurped down the myriad sodas that lied before her, long since abandoning the need for a straw or a cap. Pespi, Coke, Mountain Dew, all so delicious and all so cold, found their way into the extraterrestrial\u2019s gut. It was required to wash down the double bacon cheese burgers that she\u2019d so vigorously scarfed down a few minutes prior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis \u2018Sprite\u2019 tastes wonderful, though it\u2019s not as decadent as the \u20187up\u2019.\u201d She muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how she knows what they are? Well, the Saiyan had gradually learned what food was inside of the restaurant by using the menu and labels on the crates. Although, she probably would\u2019ve gorged on the delicacies anyway, given her current weight of 300 or so lbs.  Yes, her way of life was pretty good. However, one person would arrive and change it significantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello. Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mouth stuffed with onion rings, Gine shifted her widened eyes toward\u2026</span></div></div>",

She may have grown accustom with her slobby lifestyle; but Gine was still a mother deep inside buried underneath within all that fat and filth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Son Gohan, ma'am,\u201d he replied, bowing down.

Do you know him?\u201d Gohan inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was unbelievable news to her. Her little boy that she came to this planet to protect grew up to have a family.

You\u2019re my dad\u2019s mother? You\u2019re another Saiyan?!\u201d Gohan shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! This is great news, grandson.\u201d Gine answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demi-Saiyan had to do a double-take. Here he was, checking out an odd noise in a remote area and in the space of a few minutes, he finds two things; a) There was another Saiyan on Earth and b) That Saiyan was his grandma! Though, upon further inspection of her attire, which was definitely Saiyan armor, it was rather obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>Sooo</i>, how long have you been here?\u201d The boy asked awkwardly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine had to think about this. So many cycles of night and day had transpired during her time on Earth that she actually lost track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Your grandfather Burdock told me that Freeza was going to kill all of the Saiyans. I came to Earth because I sent Kakarot here to keep him safe from Freeza.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan\u2019s eyes widened after hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been here for about thirty years. And my dad wasn\u2019t sent to Earth to wipe out humanity.\u201d He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t care about the people of this world. All that mattered was that my son was safe.\u201d She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGohan was somewhat disturbed and relieved by this. The former because his grandmother basically said that she was apathetic to the destruction of the human race and the latter because this means that at least his dad wasn\u2019t sent here just to take over the world. After a while though, he got over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you want, you can come over to my house. You should meet the rest of the family.\u201d He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine simply smiled warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to, Gohan, and my name is Gine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGine tried flying on her own but with her lack of exercise and surplus of weight, all her exertion did was push out a giant fart. Gohan fanned the air away from him, damning his enhanced sense of smell that his alien genetics granted him, and chose to just give her a lift, making the mother of Goku blush in embarrassment. Gohan just hoped that he could tackfully break the news to her that \u2018Kararot\u2019 died merely two days ago  at the hands of Cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they get home...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">I've noticed how there's been no slob story of DB/DBZ/DBGT yet. So, I took it upon myself to make this. In here, make the girls of DBZ gain weight, get gassy, lazy, smelly, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, here are the rules:<br>\r\n1. No killing off the main characters. Minor characters can die, and as for major characters, they can die, but must be brought back sooner or later.<br>\r\n2. I'm being generous, and allowing sexual content, but just don't be too descriptive with it. Same goes for swearing.<br>\r\n3. Vore is allowed, but not too much of that, either.<br>\r\n4. OCs are allowed, but make sure you either describe them thoroughly, or post an image on them.<br>\r\n5. Stories about female OCs becoming slobs must include some of the actual characters from the anime/manga.<br>\r\n6. I probably should have put this up a little earlier, but no males can become slobs. Males can appear, and encourage females to become slobs however.<br>\r\n7. Please, no farting to gain weight. Characters can fart, just not gain weight from doing so.<br>\r\n8. Try to refrain from GT character looks, unless the character only appears in GT.<br>\r\n9. In the beginning story, in parentheses, put in what saga the story is set in, unless it's obvious. I.e. if the story starts off with Pan and Giru. Giru obviously appeared in GT, so it's clear the story takes place in that saga.<br>\r\n10. Dragon Ball character looks are allowed. I'm also allowing in some TF, and GTS. Just remember, however, that slob is the main focus of the story.<br>\r\n11. Scat is allowed, as well as being hairy.<br>\r\n12. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, anything goes. DB, DBZ, and DBGT belong to Akira Toriyama, Fuji TV, Funimation, and Toei Animation. I do not own DBZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and btw, if it's not too much trouble, please make sure that at least some of the female slobs become dumb? I seriously think that's one of the most underused and underrated slob traits out there. You don't have to, but I'd love if you would. Thank you, and please remember to add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: Male-to-male couples is now allowed, as are female-to-female couples. Just keep the focus on the slobs, though. Also, remember only females can become slobs.</td>",
