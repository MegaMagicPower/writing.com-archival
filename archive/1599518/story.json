Finally, you have escaped your prison. You run up the sleeve, towards the light of outside Zac's shirt, when you think that this could be a perfect opportunity. You look to the expansive bicep on your side and get out your camera. You step back to the wall of the cavern and snap a photo of the veiny wall of muscle. The sleeve lifts up and rotates so that you fall onto his bicep. Zac yawns and you hold onto some of the light hair that covers the muscle. He sits up straight, rolls back his sleeve, revealing the world to you, and lifts up his arm to his face. You manage to gain your balance and stare up into his face, thinking that he's seen you. The ground beneath your feet turns to iron and rockets up. Zac's other hand looms over you and grasps his arm, pressing you inbetween the floor of steel and his finger. He hadn't seen you at all, he was just checking out his arm! He lets go and you take another opportunity to get some pictures of the flexed collosus. His arm drops and you are left falling through thin air again. Once more you land on the soft surface of the couch, but with his cotton t-shirt no longer between you. You give a sigh of relief that you are no longer on this roller coaster ride, Until you turn around. You are standing in between his legs facing his shorts-covered package.

Suddenly you are blown forward, rolling across the couch. When you breath in you almost faint. The smell that assaults your nose is a noxious fart, magnified a thousand times to your size. It is the most vile scent you have ever encountered. \"Oh god.\" Zac chuckles. His ass begin to bear down upon you once more but stops short. The rumbling of the next fart shatters your eardrums and flings you across the couch, finally out from under Zac's ass. You hold your breath until you can't stand it any longer. You breath in through your mouth and taste the foul air. You vomit and feel a bit woozy. You'd known that this job involved risks and sometimes casualties occurred but you never thought it would be like this. Tormented by the body of a hulking heartthrob turned into a giant. Every drop of sweat and puff of gas is an inconvenience to a normal person, but to you, the smells are magnified a thousandfold. You break down weeping. You only stop when you notice the couch cushions shift as Zac gets up. You wait to see what he's doing. He's left the T.V. on so you figure he's either coming back or is careless.

After hearing some word that the paparazzi had come into the possession of some illegal tablets it immediately peaked your interest. Now, this happened because of two things: One, it was in your nature to want to be in on soemthing if it was new, that way you could have bragging rights later and there was also the satisfaction of keeping a secret, even if that was from the police. Still, since this was a very covert organization (though it wouldn't appear that way) you would be fine. Or so you believe, anyway. And how could you pass up this opportunity to spy on celebrities without the slightest chance of them actually spotting you? It was the perfect plan, you would say. Now all you would have to do was sign some papers and you'd be on your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you headed forward in the line, you could go to one of five booths. Each one had a designated size that you would prefer to be once you started your mission. It sounded exciting, and somewhat professional. You glanced at the signs over each booth, and decided to pick the one that read \"ONE INCH.\" It seems the most basic and not to mention it was probably a good choice. You had always gone with the generic options, they usually paid off. Striding over to the booth you grabbed a pen and scribbled your signature on a couple of forms and headed through another doorway behind it. From there you were assigned to a team of five people, three other men and two other women, all about your age. You tried to restrain yourself from checking out the particularly hot blonde you'd been paired with for the trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It told you all about your target. Name, residence, age, height, all kinds of juicy info. You hungrily snagged one and looked up, jaw agape. You had been lucky enough to be assigned to spying on Megan Fox, the actor from movies like Transformers and stuff! Savoring your delight, you stepped outside and into the sleek vehicle that would bring you deeper into the city, to a hotel where Fox would be staying in. It was only a short drive away, and once you were let out along with your team you all filed inside. The particular hotel was massive, easily one of the best in the city. Your unit also wasted no time, scanning their papers for the room number. Once you found it and took the elevator up you were sweating in anticipation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door now lay in front of you, and you wonder which course to take. Two of your male counterparts wanted to shrink themselves now, using the \"size reduction tablet (SRT)\" to slip udner the door without being detected. The other man was apathetic, and so were you. The blonde and her female friend had another idea; the three of you (you and the other two men) could go under now, then report back on Megan's status. After which they would shrink down as well and go in as a team. After checking the equipment one last time, you all simultaneously swallow your tablets and feel the instant effects of it. After about thirty seconds you could feel yourself diminishing in size, quite rapidly. Before long you and your two \"friends\" were now an inch tall in height, standing before an enormous door. The underside of the door was twice your height, so it would be easy to slip under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then another thing catches your eye. Down on the carpeted floor of the hotel hallway you weren't exactly alone. The two women, now giantesses to you, also stood. Towering giantesses at your size, you crane your neck up to look, only to find that you can barely even make where they ended. By comparison, they were both at least three hundred feet tall, and that many times as beautiful as before. You found yourself just about six inches from the sandaled foot of the blonde you had been admiring earlier, who looked down at the three of you with an amused grin. Insects in her eyes, you can imagine. A slight chill runs up your spine, but you suspect that the women are a lot more professional than that; you could trust that they wouldn't play anything. But then, could you even trust these strangers? </span></div></div>",

After a couple moments you're ont he other side, and light is streaming into your view.

Everything was so massive, not to mention different from your worm's eye view. Tables were now football stadiums, lamps were Seattle Needles, and so on and so forth. Your companions are equally surprised, but you keep on moving at a steady pace.Your logic kicks in, and you search around for your taregt, the insanely hot Megan Fox.

That would be  a major disappointed, though according to intel she was at least inside the hotel complex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant that even if she wasn't in at the moment she was bound to arrive. Better that way actually; because you would have time to set up rather than lugging all of this photo and video camera equipment that you hope still works after the shrinking process. For now you can see nothing of anything to high, so she could very well be laying on her bed for all you know. You scan the room with your eyes, hoping in your gut that she's around so that you could get your instant gratification. Well, there wasn't much you'd be bale to see from so low. The trio sets their equipment down and looks around for an idea.</span></div></div>",

Marty equips a rope and hook that should hopefully reach the top of the table. He swings violently for a long time, until he releases the rope and the hook catches in a notch in the woodwork. You have to admit this guy must have a good arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom grabs the other end while Marty tests the rope's strength and ascends.

The giantess that Megan Fox now appeared to the three shrunken men below was oblivious. After waking up from a midday nap she had quickly eliminated the need for digging through her purse and just decided to dump it out. Someone else would clean it up later anyway. After that she quickly found the nail polish and got that over with, using a bright shade of green. \"Eh, while I'm at it I guess I'll add some lipstick for tonight,\" Fox said quietly to herself. She'd been doing that a lot lately. Still a little tired from waking up, she lifted the bottle to her lips slowly.</span></div></div>",

Everything inside was being shaken up, including the junk you had been standing on originally with your camera. In the jostling wake,you lose your camera among the debris and fall,sliding down a slope of bouncing cosmetics and a cell phone. you would have liked to use that right about now (the phone), but your life was in danger, as well as Marty's.

If only you were bigger...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom jammed his leg into Megan's skin as he tried to scale the placid, seamless skin within the dark recesses of the space between Megan's imposing boobs. Everything was fine until a minute ago, when a women had come into Megan's hotel room and interupted everything. He couldn't get agoodlook at first, but after climbing back up and standig just below Mega's right breast he saw her. Jessica Alba, in all her glory. Any other day and this would have been such an amazing point in Tom's life, but now it was just double the trouble in the log run. At last he reached a spot where he could actually stay under and hide, lodging his back against the bottom. A fairly perverted choice, but he honestly didn't intend it that way, it was just that going any other direction would send him sliding down a smooth slope to oblivion. Worst of all, Tomonly had his handheld camera left.</span></div></div>",

But never like this, not the way some of the higher-standing members were suggesting now. Supposedly there was a tablet that some had come into possession of over the black market that would, in layman's terms, shrink a human to a variation of sizes. The one that you had signed up for was to be half an inch, the ideal size in your mind to spy on celebrities even more efficently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course it would have it's cons, but as long as you stayed smart and stuck to the plan that you had been shown everything would work fine. One thing they hadn't mentioned was how long this shrinking would last, but it was farthest from your mind right now, which was buzzing with excitement. To think that you were getting paid to be one of the first men to ever shrink. Not to mention that for a long time you'd had fantasies of what it would be like to be so small, especially with a woman around. Even so, you were more professional than that. Or so you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the clipboard in front of you that had been passed around, you and five other men and one woman were going to have Lindsay Lohan as your first target. She was currently residing at a hotel in Los Angeles, one of which you had specific directions and schematics of. But you had already studied all of this, and so had your companions, if they knew what they were doing. Surprisingly the paparrazi were very organized these days, ever since the introduction of the size reduction tablet, or SRT. Well, here you would go. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the long hours of flight from New York City to LA you start to get drowsy and just drift off into sleep, dreaming of your next expedition. You are jarred awake as the plane lands, and you follow along with your other six companions as they race off of the plane. Once there, a cab was already waiting to take you to the exact hotel where you'd find Lohan. All according to plan. Upon arrival, you walked inside, lookign at your map. According to this she was on the third floor, room 406. Interesting. After a few more minutes you and your team were there, in front of the door.</span></div></div>",

Deep in thought about how amazing this opportunity truly was, however, you weren't actually accomplishing anything. Just as you were hesitating on when to swallow your SRT and begin the journey, you notice that the rest of you team hadn't made it yet. Perfect, the less competition the better, even if this was supposed to be a group effort. You knew enough about the paparazzi to know that teamwork was all fine and good, but when it came down to the dirtiest, most enticing secrets of a celebrity's life it became survival of the fittest. And you, as of now, were by far the fittest candidate. Taking a deep breath, you pop the pill-shaped tablet into your mouth and swallow hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last few seconds were a blur. The sensation of your diminishment felt like you were somewhere between melting and freezing, all repeating several times before you finally lay flat on your back, jaw dropped. You leap to your feet, feeling a little woozy. Glancing at your legs, arms, and torso you can't believe it actually worked. True, you had never actually doubted that the SRT would do it's job, but seeing was believing in this case. By your own judging, it would appear that you were about a half-inch tall, slightly different than your expected outcome. But wouldn't smaller be better when the objective was to stay unseen? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, you rush underneath the door frame as you hear the booming footsteps of what you can only assume is the rest of your team with all of the filming equipment. They must have been quite stealthy to anyone else, but your magnified sense of hearing (to be more truthful it was just that you were so small and now were picking up the much larger waves) alluded to the opposite. Just as you pass below the doorframe which was at least two inches high, a whole new vista of enlarged objects met your view. The hotel room was simply massive in your eyes, and you look around quickly, neck craning.</span></div></div>",

However, there was no way you would be able to get any of that from on the floor, and to be honest you felt a little vulnerable down so low at your new size. So, looking around, you see all of the stuff you normally would in a hotel, only beefed up an much more fancy, since it was easily the nicest one you'd ever seen. That was one of the fundamental problems with celebrities, you thought; they had so much money coming out of their ears that they spent it on useless trappings. It might be an unfair stereotype, but it was your job to judge the people that society was attracted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, you decided that you should do less thinking and just get to higher ground ebfore your team showed up and ruined everything. Walking over to the bed, you notice that there were three routes that could lead you to the top. One was quite risky, and you could almost rule it out now: climbing Lindsay's arm which was dangling almost to the floor. But then you realize that it's still to high, so there are only two. The bedpost, which had grooves cut into it for ornamental value, which were on other side of you. As you had briefly witnessed before the titanic young woman had been laying with her head to your right, only several feet above you, with her feet laying on your left. So one bedpost would lead you to her feet and the other to her face. The face would have more coverage value, but starting by the feet would let you get a body shot which you also no will have value.</span></div></div>",

Kind of unsanitary but that wasn't big on your mind right now. Now you're ready to climb the vertical bedpost and get to your first targeted celebrity as an inch tall man. Bullshit. The experience is losing its effect, but you still had a job to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou test the wood with one hand while testing the lowerparts with your legs. Both seems sturdy enough to support your near incomprehensibly light weight, so you don't deliberate ay further and begin.

You must be out of shape or something. However, there was the possibility that the SRT took a toll on one's muscles, but you had only heard that in a theory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut you push on through your tiring and reach that elusive summit, feeling a lot better than you had before.

A shiver runs up your spine, although you can hardly move between the two sealing toes. It smelled less rancid than you would have suspected, since Lohan was a pretty, clean girl on most accounts.
