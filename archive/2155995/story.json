            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are Roland, Evan's chief consul and one of his closest friends. One day, while out and about Evermore, Evan's kingdom, Roland finds himself walking around it's streets, solving folks\u2019 problems and checking that the kingdom is in top shape. As Roland is walking around town, a glint from an object catches his attention. Taking a closer look, he finds that the source of the glint is a mysterious blue jewel. Examining the jewel, it looks like there are shadows dancing inside of it, like fog moving around. Entranced by the beauty of the jewel, Roland comes closer and touches the jewel. Once he touches it, a sharp pain courses through his body, causing him to blackout. Once that he wakes up, he finds himself only a few inches tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoland could not believe his luck. A second ago he was normal sized, standing at about 6 feet tall, and the next he was only a few inches tall. He looked around and spotted the stone that had caused him to shrink to this size a few feet from here, under a bush on the side of the road. He damned the damn rock in his head and his stupidity. He thought to himself why would he play with something that clearly had some sort of magical nature. He knew almost nothing of magic since he came from a world where there was no magic, only science. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he would examine the object once again. If it made him this size, perhaps it could revert him back to his normal size. As he approached the jewel, it appeared to be inert. There were no longer shadows dancing in it's interior. The stone's magic appeared to have died down. All he could look was his own reflection as he peered inside the stone. Roland kicked the stone in anger, which only caused him to yelp in anger and the stone to remain in place. As he regained his composure, Roland took a quick breath and looked around him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right next to a stone road, each stone as high as his head, while the grass around was chest high. Getting around at this size would prove to be difficult, but his body was young, and he had participated once in the Olympics in his previous life. Still, the distance to travel back to the palace would be quite difficult at this size and it would take him hours if not days, not to mention the perils of getting stepped on or getting eaten by roaming animals or monsters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe scanned the horizon, blocking the sun from hitting his eyes with his hand, looking for an idea on what to do. After he finished looking around, he summarized that he had a few choices:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Visit the Hubble-Bubblery. There are doctors in there and alchemists. Perhaps one of them would be able to cure him or perhaps prepare a size-altering potion for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Visit the Spellworks. Surely one of the magicians in there would be capable of returning him to his normal size. After all, the jewel was magical in nature, so perhaps a mage there would be able to undo the spell?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Visit Tasty's Cookshop. It's the closest building to Roland and he knows that Floyd works there. Floyd was one of the very first citizens to join Evermore and a friend of Evan. Or maybe Roland could seek food there for the long road to the palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Visit the Humble Bazaar. Roland knows that Persha works in there, a grimalkin and one of Evan's closest friends that worked in the palace back in Ding Dong Dell. Or maybe Roland could use one of the bazaar's products for survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Hitch a ride on a nearby passerby. Perhaps this way it he would end somewhere closer to the palace and one step closer to getting help from his friends.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
