In other words, a typical day in the life of the Doctor's companions. She scanned the room looking for any sort of way out or conviently close off switch, no such luck. Just as she had given up hope, some sort of alien creature walked...well more like floated into the room. It's singular eyestalk stared hard at Rose's body, seemingly making mental notes. It's long tentacles started to move about machinery and all other sorts of bits and bobs, making the machine that Rose somehow just noticing was sitting a foot or two above her. Finally, the tentacled alien floated over to Rose's side and spoke in perfectly clear, if not a bit awkward, English.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are an associate of the Doctor. He is an enemy. You are,by effect, an enemy. The Fandus Codex of Law states we may not kill in this quadrant, but we may...incapacitate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fandus returned to the machine and pulled a lever downwards. Immediately a blue light flashed on Rose as she immediately felt it's effects taking hold. Rose felt her chest swell as her breasts rising up. She gave a hard look at the Fandus and said \"Really? I mean that'll cause some back problems but that won't really do much else.\" The Fandus realized his error and went back to the machine pulling more levers pressing switches, etc. Then she felt her body entirely swell. Her stomach pushed out over the belt constraining her to the table, aided by her butt pushing her upwards. She felt her fingers becoming pudgy and thick. She additionally felt her face becoming fuller as she gained more and more. Finally ending the onslaught on Rose's body, the tentacled alien stopped the machine and again looked Rose over. \"Yes, this will do fine. For now. You will go to your cell now. Do not attempt escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReleased from her shackles, Rose stood up and walked over to where two more Fandi were floating as they led her to her cell.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Several months had passed after the events involving their adventure that would have caused The Doctor to be separated from Rose, if he had not gained help in saving her. In those events, together, they simply spent time residing in that which was called \"The Tardis\", floating about with nothing to do. Unfortunately for Rose, after saving her with help from a few other allies, The Doctor learned from Rose what her feelings were for him, only for him to reveal he did not have the same feelings for her, with an explanation being made as to why. Though Rose understood and accepted, she felt very depressed, secretly. That was why, during their time in The Tardis, whenever she was by herself, she would use one of the small movable machines within The Tardis owned by The Doctor that could bring into being any kind of food that she wanted, with it for her being \"snacks and junk-food\". She didn't care, though. Though despite it looking like the kind \"made by humans from Earth as she had come from\", they were also had \"more in calories\" and were \"more addicting\" and not only did Rose not care, but she was also \"officially hooked\". Since then, she started indulging herself, frequently while by herself while The Doctor was by himself entertaining himself in whatever room he was from inside the Tardis with Rose doing the same, only by herself with whatever food she had. She made no messes, fortunately. She was good mannered. But, these foods she had included chips of many types, candy bars, candy of chocolate types, cookies of various types in shapes and toppings, etc., cakes, \"high-in-calories non-sweet types\" from hot-dogs, burgers, and other types, along with \"desert types\" like \"cake\" and \"ice cream\". Very little of it went into her \"hips\", \"breasts\" and \"backside\", the third of which was slightly \"bubbly\", while a huge amount of it went into her \"stomach\" which now was becoming \"a belly\". She, however, paid no heed to it. Instead, she just continued to indulge herself. Eventually, some months later, she had on her lap a huge bowl with enough ice cream of various chocolate and vanilla types to satisfy a hugely wealthy family with lots of guests in an incredibly wealthy \"Victorian Times Wealthy Home\" and a huge platter with a huge hole cake rather than a single slice,, using a spoon for both while in a \"living room place\" in the Tardis while having a \"movable object\" to get them to appear.  She had been eating it up, and by eventually it was all gone. Her belly had soon become so big, it made her look \"pregnant with 40 kids\". She hiccuped, and then laid down on her back after using the machine to make the now empty dishes disappear before hiccuping some more. Eventually, after a nap, she used a nearby \"remote\" like object to scan her weight, even though it was out of curiosity rather than concern for her own weight, discovering that she had now weighed ...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rose Tyler had been in a funk. A serious one at that. Her separation from The Doctor that took place in their last time spent together had been prevented from happening through a parallel timeline merging, that also led to the destruction of all The Daleks. Unfortunately, even so, not only was it the case that every other female human companion and other human companion of The Doctor alike from before and after her was soon to be returned to places they first met The Doctor at, respectively, but The Doctor still <i>did</i> <i>not</i> romantically love her back, but after all of the other of The Doctor's human companions of female and male genders alike from before and after Rose were being dropped back off at their homes, with her being dropped off last. Coming to accept the fact the Doctor would never romantically love her back was hard. Naturally, rather than facing this, she sat in the one of the many in her sleeping room group of residential quarters in the TARDIS and ate. Meanwhile, she did at least ask for a \"food machine that could get to come into being any food she wanted\" for when she was brought home. At this point, however, it was stored for when she was returned so that it'd be given to her right before she left the TARDIS. So she \"had regular foods\" instead. She did so in the aforementioned place in The TARDIS she was in, all the while in an armed chair.<br>\r\nShe dug her hand into some extra large bags of chips of diverse types, taking a handful and mindlessly put them in her mouth, chewing slowly. It's not as if she <i>cared</i> how much weight she'd put on, given her fixation on romancing the Doctor. Since that wasn't happening, she decided this: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy should she care if her \"figure\" \"goes away\"? In fact, she decided she <i>did</i> <i>not</i> <i>care</i> <i>anymore</i> about whether or not she'd \"get fat\" or anything like that. Feeling her pants button strain on her stomach, Rose loosened her now-tight-despite-being-stretchable-due-to-being-made-of-stretchable-fabric-type -of-blue colored jeans type pants by placing them further down, letting a huge amount of swollen and bloated fat roll out from her belly. She had not been paying attention to it but she had still grown quite the chubby and distended belly. She then disposed of all of the extra large chip bags of diverse types after finishing them, and moved on to some multiple and diverse types of boxes of cookies with these boxes being also in extra-large size. The cookies were something she then started eating for about \"four \"Earth\" hours\" for each of the types like with the chips, saving the chocolate chip types of cookies for last since they were among her many favorites, with it all ending after \"four \"Earth\" hours\", again, that is. She felt very tired, after that, then. And she fell asleep, her eating craze finally over as she laid herself on her bed to rest. The next morning, Rose awoke, seeing that she had been resting a hand on her belly. When she woke up, it was the \"Earth Hour\" of 4:45 AM. She felt hungry as a result of what she had been eating, and then started eating tub-gallons of diverse types in quadruple-times-eighteen-times-more-extra large composed quantities of multiple types of an ice cream, saving the best for last in chocolate types, all the while managing to mix all the cookie types up to chocolate chip type as well. All the while, her \"weight gain\" increased itself and she grew bigger and fatter as a result. When she finished, her belly was <i>incredibly</i> <i>swollen</i> and fat. It was 6:00 AM the \"Earth Hour\" when she finished. Suddenly, she let out some hearty hiccups, after which it was then that she realized something was dreadfully wrong. Rose waddled over to the mirror next to the shelves of old books, nearly knocking over a table with a strange, alien lava lamp with her new girth. She knew she had been eating compulsively for a week, and she knew it was showing. She was wearing the largest clothes she had in her wardrobe, though, at this point.<br>\r\nFinally slowly but surely getting herself to be taking a look in the mirror and after a hard look at her reflection, Rose suddenly took a deep breath and sigh immediately after she saw how she appeared. When she made it to the mirror, what she saw shocked even her.Each and every one of those parts of her body that she saw was plainly visible. Her eating habits had certainly gone quite to the point where she both <i>felt</i> and <i>looked</i> <i>absolutely</i> <i>fat</i>. <i>Literally</i> <i>and</i> <i>metaphorically</i> speaking alike. She had known she'd been putting on a huge amount of weight somehow, in the last few weeks. Her pants were getting tighter--in fact, if she was honest, most of them she would be a huge amount of difficulty managing to button if she tried them on now despite whatever success she could still have. Rose's shirt would only conceal her small breasts, and her pants, no matter how stretchy and fitting they still were, all but felt uncomfortably snug around her behind body parts despite their success in concealing her behind body parts. Yet, in her depressed state, she pretended not to notice, often consoling herself with the thought that the Doctor wouldn't notice. But thinking that someone such as her own self may be getting fat and taking an honest look at it happening are two different things, and Rose finally fessed up to herself and she saw that she had put literally and exactly put on 280 pounds. Quite a lot by cosmic standards for someone like her and enough that for the first time since her awkward preteen years she didn't like what she saw. She saw her once-flat stomach now turned into a round, bloated, swollen, huge, heavy, drum-taut-hard-and-drum-tight-hard-as-a-sphere-shaped-boulder-type-rock-quadrupl e-times-eighteen-times-the-size-of-a-sphere-shaped-boulder-type-rock-and-yoga-ba ll-combined-and-heavy-as-a-led-made-object-of-sphere-shape-and-the-aforementione d-times-as-much-type-of-a-boulder-type-rock-and-yoga-ball-combined type of size-resemblance-and-heavy-amount-carriage-resemblance carrying swollen and round and big and fat belly of a stomach, causing her shirt to ride up and only be able to cover her small breasts, despite how stretchable it was. She saw her jeans digging into her sides, with her belly being exposed as such. Her small breasts were still small despite being slightly given a small amount of weight and her toned arms and legs were now still soft, almost sausage-like, as she gave some thought about this disapprovingly. Her face, she placed both her hands on her mouth to silence her gasps upon noticing, was also slightly soft despite how small it still was, with still small and yet still slightly puffed up cheeks. In many more pounds she knew she'd have quite a lot of difficulty getting up, getting around, getting here, getting there, getting anywhere and getting about. She didn't have to turn to her side to know her small as ever and yet slightly bubbled up backside was taking a truly small amount of the weight with the same being true for her small and yet-now-slightly-widened-hips, and she didn't want to see proof. It was <i>one</i> <i>more</i> frustration to deal with. Going on dangerous adventures with a man/alien who could never romantically love her was getting sad enough. <i>Now</i> she <i>had</i> to be ending up at a point where this was the case as she and she as in: -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose Tyler, had all but ended up causing herself to have ended up at a point where she had ended causing herself to have managed all but to <i>get</i> <i>fat</i>, too. She rubbed her round belly for a brief moment. She tugged on her shirt to cover the huge bulge unsuccessfully. She checked her pants and saw that it was still covering every behind part of her body. She buttoned her jeans only to have them end up back open. Her breasts and upper body looked a little pudgy but were as small as ever, her derriere and thighs were slightly porked up and all of her belly from top to bottom had become expansive, wide, swollen, bloated, enormous, drum-taut tight and drum-taut hard combined and fat. Rose didn't care about the weight, with the Doctor not interested in her romantically, the only problem with gaining weight was the effects on her health, which she knew about full well. Rose quickly pushed these thoughts away, but then briefly thought about them again. With the Doctor completely oblivious and uninterested, why not indulge herself a little more? She rubbed her round belly in thought.<br>\r\nMaybe she should just <i>stop</i> <i>giving</i> <i>a</i> <i>care</i> anymore. Besides, the Doctor was both completely oblivious and uninterested, so upon returning home where she had been living at, in an upstairs and downstairs-house-resembling-apartment-room that the wealthy employers of that were also friends of her father offered her father and mother both some help in making some generous enough investments that though the both of her parents would be the real owners, she would still have this as a residence of her own to stay at, for which the Doctor had arranged for investments somehow enough for her 'til old age, she would start indulging herself for as much as she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the \"Earth Hour\" 5:30 PM with the sky very night dark when Rose stepped out of the TARDIS and into the main room of her aforementioned home. Her goodbye to the Doctor had been short and sweet, etc., she knew he was not romantically interested in her and she was not going to stay forever. The TARDIS began to dematerialise as she looked on, wondering how her experiences will change her future, how she could ever go back to her old life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour months after leaving the TARDIS, with it being October at this point, laying on her living room couch in front of her living room TV, wearing clothing concealing only her breasts and her behind parts, Rose had gained 240 more pounds since her aforementioned departure without even noticing and her attention otherwise occupied.</span></div></div>",

Her shirt was stretched too snugly around her middle and breasts, as well, showing unsightly bulges growing underneath.  But this was temporary, she told herself with a firm resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wouldn't let herself stay in this sorry state.  She also wouldn't let the Doctor, whose recent distance was part of the cause of her own depression and weight gain, remain so aloof and listless.  He seemed to have been running pointless errands for weeks now, doing busy work, leaving Martha with little to distract herself.  Both of them had to pull themselves out of this funk.  Martha would get them traveling to exotic locals again, helping locals when necessary, and living the exciting, satisfying life she remembered when she first boarded the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i>But first<i></i>, Martha thought as she walked towards the control room as fast as she could in jeans that were almost painfully restricting her waist and thighs, <i></i>I need to get back into shape.<i></i>  That parts of her were jiggling when they shouldn't be with ever step was only adding to her resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor busy doing something no doubt technical and highly futuristic under the TARDIS's console when Martha stormed in and spoke with a command she hadn't since she had fallen into her depressed, gluttonous mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor!  Listen here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor popped up, a thick cord between her teeth and a small, handheld radar-looking device in one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmpph?\" he mumbled.  Martha definitely had his attention.</span></div></div>",

But, and this was good for the planet, the first people to arrive there were environmentalists.  They made the whole planet a nature reserve.  Some of the most brilliant scenery I've ever seen, and all unspoilt.  It's called Paradise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is,\" Martha said, \"Can't wait to see it.  What's it have to do with me getting back into shape and you getting back into the game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's quite inspiring.  Some of the elements are vibrationally attuned to sentient minds.  It's a great place of deep thinking.  Also, turned out the first colonist weren't too lucky in colonizing the planet.  So while they're dying out, a little . . . oh, let's just call it a specialized society, came and settled a small part with the agreement that they wouldn't spread beyond their original colony.  And they didn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would we want to visit a cult in a nature reserve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it was a health cult-or a beauty cult, as they'd see it.  Obsessed with being healthy and perfection, you see.  They were living to be 200 naturally when most humans were dead by 150, so they were certainly onto something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obsessed with beauty?  Sounds a bit superficial.  How can they help us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they are, but they're nice enough people if I remember.  Lots of humans were in those early space-faring days.  You'd be proud of them.  And these Paradisians were always willing to lend a hand.  So, you will get to be in the best shape of your life, while I will wander the wilderness, soaking up the scenery.  It'll do us both a lot of good and we'll only have to be there a couple of days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll be a tourist and I'll be at a spa?\"  Martha nodded with approval as the TARDIS arrived.  \"Doctor, this might be one of your better and less dangerous ideas.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not speak too soon!\" the Doctor smiled as they stepped outside.</span></div></div>",

The Doctor took a big whiff himself.  The too took in the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were mountains surrounding them in the far distance, some looking like crystals while others were covered in unearthly plant life.  The ground was a kind of flat, polished cobblestone and the buildings were made from sculpted versions of the same material, the electronic aspects blending in organically with the smooth, stone theme.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the people, and there were a few, were what took Martha's breath away.  They all appeared young, middle-aged at the oldest, and were all exceptionally gorgeous.  Some were in ridiculously good shape, while others were in a more reasonable-but still obviously quite good-shape, leading Martha to note that while the Doctor may have been right in his description of this place as being obsessed with beauty, they at least had some leeway in that, and that didn't mean everyone was an identical drone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Martha whispered, feeling more and more self-conscious as they strolled down the street, \"I think they're staring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?  Maybe they're staring at me.  Not every day you see a Time Lord and a TARDIS, you know.  We're a rare breed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha placed her hand over her jiggling belly as they walked, wishing she had thrown on something less restrictive and revealing than her usual clothing, perhaps a potato sack of some kind.  She heard a few whispers as people stopped, sometimes pointing, and then hurried off.  One couple caught her eye particularly.  The woman gasped and smiled, pointing with great delight, while the man shushed her and tugged her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me they're not used a girl my size,\" Martha said, \"And I'm not even that big!  I wonder how they'd react to most humans from my time.  They'd flip if they saw how fat most of us were back then, you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Martha,\" the Doctor said, sounding concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very urgent, very beautiful, and very authoritative woman was marching towards them, two beefy men behind her who Martha could only assume were guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!  Hey, you there!\" she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha prepared to flee with the Doctor the minute he gave the word. </span></div></div>",

Martha took a step back as the woman reached out to grab her hand.  Martha relaxed as she saw the woman, who like everyone on the planet she had seen was gorgeous, had an expression brimming with either empathy or pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-?\" Martha started to say but the woman spoke over her, holding her hands and staring into her eyes.  She was dressed in what looked like a futuristic nurse's uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You poor thing, you came to the right place.  And not a moment too soon!\" she glanced back to her two companions.  Looking at them now, Martha started to think they were probably more assistants than body guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" Martha said, attempting to subtly pull her hands from the woman.  She wasn't sure she should be offended or not.  She looked to the Doctor, who only shrugged, perhaps as confused as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're condition, dear!\" the woman said, releasing Martha's hands.  Martha got the impression that despite her youthful appearance, she was probably much older than her.  \"Why, I haven't seen anything like it in years.  You must be from the outer colonies, they eat so dreadfully there.  It's tragic, really.  But don't you worry, we are going to take good care of you.  Your friend will be good as new, better even,\" she said as an aside to the Doctor.  \"What is your name, dear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha.  Martha Jones,\" she said.  She wasn't sure yet whether she liked the woman or not.  Her concern was certainly genuine, but she still wasn't sure what she meant by \"condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Ms, Jones.  My name is Dr. Inga,\" she shook Martha's hands, holding on too long again, \"And I can tell just by looking at you that you must be a very beautiful person under all that.  It's a shame you had to wait so long but I assure you we have cured much, much larger guests.  Your . . . what is it, twenty pounds? . . . your extra assets will be dealt with and you will leave here a new woman, better than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Under all that\"'\" Martha repeated, her eyes going down to her puffy belly and unbuttoned jeans.  Now she was fairly sure she should be offended.  \"It's only about twenty pounds like you said-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to put on a brave face, Ms. Jones,\" Dr. Inga said, almost solemnly, \"While I have never experienced such a thing myself I can imagine how difficult such a dramatic change must be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that dramatic,\" Martha said, still deciding whether she should be amused or annoyed.  If they could help he shed the weight she would put up with them being condescending for a while, but they were acting like she had been afflicted with some horrible disfigurement.  One of the male associates of the woman was staring at Martha's exposed belly with some obvious disgust.  Martha pulled her shirt down enough to cover most of it, but did not attempt to rebutton her jeans.  \"But you <i>can</i> help me get back into shape then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be my personal pleasure to do so!\" Inga said, apparently overjoyed at the question.  She then turned to the Doctor again, giving him a once-over.  \"Mmm.  Your friend is in good hands.  Shall we set you up in a hotel, sir?  We have many guests like your friend who are too embarrassed to come alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not embarrassed,\" Martha said testily, although she was a little bit.  Maybe a lot, now that everyone was staring at her like she was a freak of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, doctor, it looks like you have everything under control,\" the Doctor said, shaking Inga's hand vigorously, \"But if you don't mind, I'll be seeing the sight, traveling, roaming the earth, as it were.  Nothing wrong with that, is there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, of course not, we encourage all our guests to take in Paradise's natural beauty.  We are very proud of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll treat you right, Martha,\" the Doctor said, noting the misgivings in Martha's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they don't condescend me to death first,\" she muttered as he brushed by her.  She recognized that the Doctor was eager to see the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will only be five days, and you can have your friend visit any time,\" Inga said, taking Martha by the shoulders and leading her away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you?\" Martha said, watching the Doctor stroll off, his head towards the distant mountains.  Then, Martha saw where they were heading.  From the grounds, and the building, it really did look like a giant spa.  More emphatically this time, she turned to Inga, \"I mean, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks necessary, dear,\" Inga said, patting her shoulder again and giving it a squeeze, \"This is what I live for.  Mark my words, you may have been beautiful before, but you will leave here even more so, and feeling every bit of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha wasn't sure what that meant.  She took some exception to the idea that gaining twenty pounds made her into a hideous troll, even if she did feel dumpy and unattractive since she started putting on weight.  Still, with the peaceful atmosphere and a delightfully calming aroma wafting from the health center, Martha stopped having doubts and being offended and decided to relax and enjoy this.  She as due a vacation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>So what is this health center spa really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: It really is a high-tech, future weight loss clinic, using a combination of physical and mental controls to make a person thin and want to remain so.  But things might not always go as planned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It's a brutal, punishing \"fat camp\" where examples are swift and fattening, especially when freewheeling do-gooders stick their noses where they don't belong.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Inside the clinic was as lovely as outside.  Smooth, white walls curved gently around them, opening into hallways and indoor parks with open ceilings.  Stone columns with a glittery, crystalline texture were spaced intermittently around the open space.  Martha detected a faint buzzing as she passed them, although it wasn't unpleasant.  She remembered the Doctor mentioning something about the minerals on this planet having psychic properties, and wondered if it was used in the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people she saw were mostly staff, wearing the same white uniforms as Dr. Inga and her associates, but others were obviously patients.  Many appeared older, but none were remotely fat as far as Martha could see.  As outside, she was the largest person there simply by virtue of having visible flab.  Flab which, she noticed self-consciously, jiggled with every step.  She tried to peer around the two men flanking her to look around.  She was already calmer just being there.  A few patients glanced at her, and Martha thought she saw surprise in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the potbelly.  They haven't seen someone with such an obvious one in a while, I suppose,\" one of the men said in a pleasant voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Potbelly?\" Martha said, yet more annoyance in her voice, as she cupped the quivering belly she still wasn't used to in her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or your hips.  Wider than usual, you know,\" the other said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha scowled.  Her hips, always a prominent feature of hers, had actually gathered very little of the weight that had pooled in her belly and ass.  She then realized the two were flanking her as they were to hide her and prevent other patients from getting a good look at her.  This came closer to angering Martha.  They just assumed she was as ashamed of herself as they would be.  True, Martha had always been thin, and assumed she always would be, but gaining a little weight was hardly debilitating injury.  She was more upset with what it represented, her listlessness, growing laziness, and unrequited love leading her to depression, than she was with the weight itself.  Of course, she would be more than happy to part with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked up to a stand where another staff member with a thin tablet stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Martha Jones,\" Inga spoke quietly, \"Here from the colonies.  Height, 5'3\", weight, 144 pounds-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere the clipboard-holding man's eyes went wide.  He peered between the two nurses flanking Martha.  Martha smiled smugly and waved.  She was, however, pleased to hear that she had only gained twenty-four pounds, and not the dread round thirty she feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"--here for the five day total treatment.  Can you please reserve a room and file the necessary work orders?\" Inga smiled broadly, turning to Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we do her in five days?\" the man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Irv, I'm sure she feels bad enough without your snide commentary\" Inga snapped, then smiled back at Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrv shrugged, entering the information on his tablet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are, as always, the boss, Dr. Inga,\" like everyone she heard here, Martha felt a strong disconnect between the silky voice the man had the words he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me show you to your room, Ms. Jones,\" Inga said, dismissing the two others as she led Martha down a hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here are the Paradise Health Clinic we know how important your body is to you, and we will do our best to return it to its natural state of beauty.  How do you like the surroundings?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lovely,\" Martha said, and meant it.  \"So what does his involve?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five days, Ms. Jones, is all we need.  We will give you the finest, purest food, teach you the most basic exercises, and of course we will use our planet's own natural elements to ease your mind as well as your body.  It will not feel like work at all.  After your first day you will notice a difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha grabbed a few inches of flab around her waist, \"A few days?  It took a few months of binging to get this, I supposed five days is reasonable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey entered a stark white room with a large, round bed and little furniture.  Inga closed the door and motioned for Martha to sit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too hard to talk about it, please, could you tell me how it happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How it happened?\" Martha repeated, unable to hide how ludicrous she found the question.  \"I was depressed, and I ate and bummed around my place.  Nothing happened.  I just made a pig of myself, is all.  And I decided enough was enough.  I wanted to make a change, get my life back together.  So my friend, the Doctor, suggested here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pig is something you don't want to be then?\" Inga said, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yes, it's an animal, from Earth-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" Inga seemed to make a mental note of it.  Martha had gotten used to appreciating and accommodating alien cultures, but still forgot that some basic things she knew of Earth in her time might be forgotten by humans in the distant future.  The door opened, and a young woman with a tray of food silently entered.  Like the ubiquitous aroma that was calming Martha's nerves, the food had a scent that was so attuned to the surroundings that it barely registered as food in Martha's mind.  It was just another pleasant sensation.  At least it looked delicious.  Some sort of vegetable dish, she knew, albeit with alien plants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga stood up, looking outside at the sun setting quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please enjoy your first dinner here, Ms. Jones,\" Inga said.  \"You'll find a dressing gown in the closet, and your other necessities should you need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha stood up to see her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor,\" Martha said, \"I do really appreciate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing at all.  It's what we live to do,\" Inga smiled.  \"Good night, Martha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInga left Martha to her meal, which she promptly consumed.  It was not a large meal, but still left her satisfied.  She had been stuffing herself so fully the last few months that being satisfied and not having to undo her jeans (which were already undone anyways) was an unfamiliar sensation.  As she lay down, she found herself thinking of her med school days.  She barely ate then with how engrossed with studying she was.  As Martha drifted off to sleep, she found herself thinking more and more of herself.  Images of herself, before her current gain, drifted through her mind, wearing outfits she thought looked good on her, or would if she hadn't outgrown them.  It struck her as strange, but then, given the circumstances, she dismissed the strangeness and drifted off to a dreamless sleep.</span></div></div>",

The Doctor closed the panel he had been working in and began pulling levers and pushing buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been there before then?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not personally, no, but I have always wanted to see it. They are a sort of high tech, quasi-feudal type of society. Very sparse on the surface but concentrated in these great tree cities. Could be interesting. I'm willing to look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So am I,\" Martha smiled. She knew the Doctor would be able to get things moving. \"I suppose some tree climbing will do me good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" the Doctor said, navigating the TARDIS but not looking over at Martha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha put her hand over her puffy tummy self-consciously. \"I need to lose a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-mmm,\" the Doctor said, not looking or paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha frowned. \"Don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced over and nodded but without really noticing. Martha sighed. <i>Well,</i> she thought, <i>I suppose it's refreshing he doesn't care if I'm turning into a pig.</i> Or maybe her gain wasn't as noticeable to others as it was to her, she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any rate, they arrived in little time. The Doctor motioned for Martha to step out into a breathtaking view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sky opened up before them. There were above the clouds on a large, wooden platform. It curved ahead of them for another mile, joining what looked like a thick tree trunk studded with other platforms, buildings, and windows and doors built into it. It took Martha a moment to get used the mass of the structure. She took a few steps until she reached the edge of the platform and leaned over the railing. The platform sat atop a branch which continued into separate smaller branches, all of them many feet thick, for what looked like hundreds of feet into the air. They swayed gently but the branch they were on seemed completely stable. Looking down through the clouds Martha could make out similar structures. The tree they were on appeared to swerve and grow as it went down to an unseen ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, this is incredible,\" she said, losing herself in the scenery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded, glancing about. Towards the trunk of the tree there were signs of people, but no people were visible. It looked desolate. They could see many branches in the distance, many buildings and even stationary vehicles about. But other than the gentle swaying of the unfixed branches, there was no movement at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we go into town? Or towards the trunk, whatever they call it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm,\" the Doctor said, \"I kind of expected a few people around. Ah, here come some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf a dozen people were making their way towards them from the trunk. From a distance they looked mostly human, perhaps a little shorter and stockier and with a greenish skin tone, but otherwise quite humanoid. One of them rode a cart vehicle made mostly of wood but containing a motor and sleek electrical parts. Like the Doctor said, they were dressed like futuristic medieval citizens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor clasped his hands and prepared for a friendly greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there!\" he said. His bright smile faltered. Martha saw this and was now on her guard. The citizens did not look happy.</span></div></div>",

Still, it did come with problems all it's own, the horrors of other monstrous species that shared the universe, the fact that they still couldn't save them all, and the most current problem, the irrestible cuisine. By no means was it terribly tasting or disgusting to look at, quite the opposite really. It was simply scrumptious and rather appealing to the eye (generally), no the problem lay in how fattening it all was. Despite all the excitement we see every Saturday on the ol' telly, there was an abnormal amount of down time for the Doctor and his redheaded companion. The truth simply was that they were at the right place at the right time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore accurately as to when the food problem started, that would be when the time-traveling duo stopped on the planet of Terg. A popular vacation spot for tourists (for the hotels) and historians (for the fascinating local culture) alike. The Doctor identified with the latter, Donna being the former. Excusng herself from the lectures of Terg archaeology, Donna soon found herself at the hotel's free, public buffet. The rest, as they say, is history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna was practically hooked on anything she could find at that point, taking it all in in massive displays of the potential of human gluttony. Said displays got her into her current weight problem, and out of her favorite pair of jeans. She huffed and puffed for a good half-hour trying to get into them, failing due to her bigger tummy preventing her zipper to close. Donna gulped as she grabbed a long-forgotten box underneath her bed, a box whose contents she hoped never to use but what always prepared to just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed from the box her old \"fat pants\u201c as her mother snidely called them. It was true that in the first few years of university, Ms. Noble had put on a freshman fifteen (followed by a sophmore seventy). For four years she had been known as the fat girl on campus and the daughter with no future at home. Shortly after her studies at university were complete, Donna dropped the weight but kept her larger jeans in case of a relapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out her pair from when she was in the 180s, she was saddened to find they fit snugly and comfortably.</span></div></div>",

After all, she travelled with the Doctor, for crying out loud. The job of being his companion (and she did sometimes consider it a full time job keeping him out of trouble) required a lot of running away from horrible monsters and evil dictators and their brain-dead minions. She shrugged to herself. She could probably shift the weight in no time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to sweat it for now she put on a light jacket to disguise her curves a little bit. The Doctor was never intentionally rude, but he had a tendency to be a bit alien and thus was capable of forgetting that you just don\u2019t tell a woman she\u2019s gained weight. She wandered out of her room and headed for the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the dome-shaped coral-lined room, she looked around for any sign of the Doctor. She saw his brown suit jacket slung over the back of the jump seat, but she couldn\u2019t see its owner anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoctor?\u201d she called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDonna?\u201d his voice responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna walked around to the other side of the console and looked down. There was a section of the grilled floor missing, and she could just make out a familiar head of sticky-uppy brown hair poking out of it. She chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing to this poor ship now?\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was making a strange humming sound. Just trying to determine the source. I think it might be something to do with the thermo couplings and their linkage to the helmic regulator.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh, simple as that, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncredibly simple,\u201d the Doctor replied with a smile evident in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed any help?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 Well, maybe\u2026 Yes. There\u2019s a button on the console. Could you press it for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. She looked at the console. There were about six different panels going all the way around, and each one had several buttons on it. \u201cWhich button, genius? There\u2019s about fifty per panel, here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed. \u201cThe third on in the sixth row on the first section of the panel directly in line with the doors,\u201d he replied irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s temp brain memorized the directions exactly, and she set to work on the console. She lined herself up with the doors and found the correct button, stabbing it with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief moment of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas that right?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 This is odd. It doesn\u2019t seem to be working. Try the second button on the third section of that panel.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe response was a shower of sparks that erupted from under the floor. Donna wasn\u2019t sure at first, but it seemed to be coming from the Doctor\u2019s section. She knew for certain when he let out a yelp in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOuch! Blimey\u2026!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou alright, Spaceman?\u201d she asked, trying not to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine. Just burnt,\u201d he replied. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t right\u2026 Are you sure you pressed the right button?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, how am I supposed to know if it\u2019s the right button? It\u2019s your time machine, matey!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a tired sigh. \u201cFair enough\u2026 Okay, change of plans! We\u2019ll swap!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026We\u2019ll what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on! I know that console like the back of my glasses. You stay down here and just hold the thick black cable in place, and I\u2019ll deal with things up top.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed irritably, but she went with it. \u201cAlright, come on, you,\u201d she said, heading for the open section of the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled himself out of the hole, and Donna stifled a giggle when she saw that the end of his tie was smoldering. He shot her a warning gaze and headed for the console.<br>\r\nDonna removed the coat she\u2019d put on and set it aside before getting down and slowly lowering herself into the hole. She was halfway down when she realized it was a bit of a squeeze. Granted, she\u2019d never been down in the TARDIS\u2019s inner-workings before, but it had looked like a fairly large hole from above it. Now that she was within it, it was beginning to feel a bit claustrophobic. She closed her eyes and took a big intake of breath as quietly as she could, sucking in her girth. She found herself slotting in almost perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing with relief, she let out her breath, and she was dismayed by the fact that her stomach had begun to push against the massive amounts of circuitry and wiring. She was pleased to find, however, that the thick black cables were easy to find. She worked around and grabbed hold of them and held them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got them in place,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019ve I got to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just need to find the right sequence of buttons and switches that will rectify the power fluctuations and redirect the excessive power into the helmic regulator. Won\u2019t take a tic!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cJust don\u2019t set me on fire.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hush. Just give me a second. And\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a flurry of clicks as the Time Lord began working the console in madman fashion. She twisted her head round as much as she could to witness his silhouette against the glow of the console practically dancing around the console, flicking switches and pushing buttons with an unbridled glee on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched him in amazement. He really was daft sometimes, but then there were times like this when he was absolutely brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot that she\u2019d ever tell him that, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was so mesmerized by this that she was taken by surprise when he suddenly stopped, slammed a lever, and all the lights suddenly came on, and there he was, striking a pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And\u2026 we\u2019re back to daft</i>, she thought to herself, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took a bow. \u201cWell done!\u201d he exulted. \u201cRight then, that\u2019s the old girl sorted! Time to have a bit of fun!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s that include? Running from more of those Sontarans? Fighting some huge green slimy monster that feeds on desire? Fixing some \u2018timey-wimey\u2019 thing that endangers all of creation?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked. \u201c\u2026Do I detect a hint of sarcasm in your tone, Ms. Noble?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe merely smirked in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNahh, nothing like that, I assure you,\u201d he continued, working at the console again. \u201cThere is a planet that is ninety-nine point nine percent ocean!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the other point one percent?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe dock where tourists can come and board the mini-subs and go exploring its depths,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds incredible,\u201d Donna replied. \u201cCan\u2019t wait.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned and started making plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head and proceeded to get herself out of the floor. Unfortunately, she found she was stuck. At first, she thought a piece of clothing had caught on something, but to her dismay, she found this wasn\u2019t the case. Her girth had wedged her in tight. She pushed against the floor and tried to lift herself out, but she was stuck fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was still talking at one hundred miles per hour, so he didn\u2019t seem to notice at first, but after three minutes and no sarcastic quips in his direction, he began to suspect there was a problem, and he turned to look at her. He was confused when he saw her still in the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing down there?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked up, shamefaced from having been caught. \u201cOh! Just\u2026resting,\u201d she said awkwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s cozy down here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor raised an eyebrow, but decided it wasn\u2019t right to question whatever it was she was up to. He continued on his merry way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes and struggled, twisted and turned, holding in her stomach to her best abilities. It took five more tries, but eventually, she was up and out of the hole, and she landed with a thud on the thoroughly uncomfortable floor. She got her legs out and struggled to her feet, rubbing her sore waist. She slid the section of flooring back in place and stood up, relieved that the Doctor didn\u2019t seem to have noticed, and if he had, he wasn\u2019t commenting on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow should I dress for this?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what you\u2019ve got on is fine,\u201d the Doctor assured her. \u201cHang on \u2013 here we go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed the lever into place, and the TARDIS ceased making that funny wheezing noise as it settled into whatever location it had chosen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight then, come on!\u201d he declared, rounding the console and grabbing his trench coat off the piece of coral he always slung it over. \u201cOne fish, two fish\u2026?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \u201cRed fish, blue fish,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they headed for the doors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A week later, Donna was wandering around the TARDIS\u2019s various corridors. To her disappointment, after a week of running around and fighting monsters, she had only lost three pounds. She knew in the back of her mind that it was her own fault. Not only had she been helping to save planets, she had also been eating whatever had been offered to her (as soon as the Doctor assured her it was safe to). Her waistline hadn\u2019t necessarily grown, but it hadn\u2019t really shrunk either, and her fat jeans still fit snugly around her pudgy middle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was off working on some sort of side-project of his. It was something that involved anti-gravity and a stuffed gorilla, so she wasn\u2019t all that interested in finding out what it was.<br>\r\nShe wandered around until she found a strange-looking vending machine sticking out of the wall. She walked up to it and looked it up and down. She saw a single red button siting in the middle of it, and so she shrugged and pushed it. Some lights lit up and a holographic screen was suddenly projected from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared in amazement \u2013 particularly the words that said, \u201cSelect Your Meal.\u201d She could feel her heartbeat speed up. There was such an abundance of choices to make that she couldn\u2019t decide for a full five minutes. She finally decided for something simple. She pressed the \u2018pizza\u2019 option. Then she went through the various sizes \u2013 she chose large. Then she went through toppings \u2013 extra cheese and sausage. She chose side dishes \u2013 cinnamon sticks with heavy icing. She finally chose a soft drink \u2013 decidedly not diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was really only doing this because of curiosity. She couldn\u2019t help herself. She just wanted to see if it would be any good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA door suddenly opened up under the machine, and she was surprised when a large pizza box with a heavenly aroma emanating from within it. She was giving a two-liter bottle of soda and a fresh pan of cinnamon sticks, which were dripping with sugary icing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself, she knew she\u2019d have to eat all of this herself. She couldn\u2019t disturb the Doctor when he was busy, and she had nothing else to do. She carried all of these things to her bedroom, where she sat down on the queen-size bed the TARDIS had given her, and she got comfortable. She turned on the telly, found a film she\u2019d been meaning to watch, and she settled down against the pillows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe popped open her pizza box and stared at it. It looked so fattening that she felt like she was gaining weight just from the scent. She took out a slice and sank her teeth into it. It was delicious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn\u2019t help but smirk \u2013 the Doctor\u2019s ship was a better cook than he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished one slice and moved onto the second. She poured herself a glass of soda, which was somehow cold even without ice. She became rather engrossed in the movie she was watching, and so she didn\u2019t really notice that she\u2019d eaten half the pizza in under ten minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the credits were rolling ninety minutes later, the pizza, the soda and the cinnamon sticks had all been devoured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s shirt had a few stains on it, but she knew the TARDIS could do the laundry better than any launderette on Earth. She involuntarily let out a hearty belch, causing her to let a hand fly to her mouth in shock. She felt her face go red despite there being no one else in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her overstuffed stomach gingerly, moaning softly as she did. She was so full she could barely budge. She managed to reach the remote and switch the TV off. She settled back into the bed and settled down for a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would be sure to return to that vending machine many times in the future\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cDonna! You\u2019ll never believe where we are now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna jolted awake in surprise, looking around in every direction at once. Her eyes finally managed to find the source of the noise \u2013 the Doctor. Of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha\u2026?\u201d she asked. She realized that wasn\u2019t a very intelligent-sounding question, so she quickly followed it up with another one. \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just landed the year 1560! London! Guess whose birthday it is outside!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. \u201cI dunno\u2026 Were we supposed to bring them a present?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cQueen Elizabeth the First! Her birthday is right outside the doors!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few moments for Donna to register this information. She struggled to get up and off the bed, trying ignore sudden emptiness her stomach was trying to alert her of. \u201cThe Queen Elizabeth the First?\u201d she asked, getting onto her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and the same!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and the same who once ordered you killed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor came up short for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smirked \u2013 a rarity indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026What did Martha <i>not </i>tell you?\u201d he asked at once, narrowing his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll find out one day, Martian Boy,\u201d she replied, patting him on the cheek affectionately. \u201cSo what do we do if she orders us killed on her birthday?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no, that was in the future with Shakespeare \u2013 way in the future. About fifteen years, give or take. Won\u2019t have happened yet. I don\u2019t think. Maybe. Shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. \u201cHow shall we? Do we have to dress up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I suppose a little bit of dress-up couldn\u2019t hurt,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s hit the wardrobe room. If we\u2019re quick, we\u2019ll be just in time for the dancing!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed up and around various corridors until they finally found the spiral staircase that took them up into the wardrobe room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the ladies\u2019 section?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDown in that direction,\u201d the Doctor replied, pointing off in the distance. \u201cThe TARDIS will help you. Just have a looksee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded and headed in the direction he\u2019d pointed in. She rounded a few corners and found herself surrounded by loads of dresses and skirts. She tutted to herself, wondering how the Doctor had acquired all these womens\u2019 clothes in the first place. She knew he\u2019d travelled with other women before, but it was a little strange that he just happened to have clothes that suited every location they landed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter going through a few, she found a red dress that was her size. It looked very posh indeed. She felt a girlish grin tugging at the corner of her mouth as she took it down and headed for the nearest changing room. She peeled off her stained shirt and her fat jeans and proceeded to slip into her new dress. It had poofy shoulders and was cut rather low in the front, but not too far. She didn\u2019t trust all those men from the Elizabethan era. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had to put on the very last piece \u2013 the corset. She sighed to herself. Her recent binge probably hadn\u2019t done her any favors. She wrapped it around her midsection and proceeded to take a deep breath and suck in her gut. She tied it up as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done, she looked like she was thirty pounds lighter \u2013 or she would\u2019ve, if it weren\u2019t for the little bulges of fat trying to escape through the material.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOof,\u201d she sighed, taking a labored breath. \u201cYou <i>better </i>hold together\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving rather awkwardly, she left the changing room and walked up the gangway towards the control room. Her sneakers clanked the entire way. If there was one thing she had learned from the Doctor, it was that it paid to have a pair of good running shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found him already there, going over some controls. He was wearing a very smart-looking suit that was made up of a velvet jacket, black trousers and a cravat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh, look at you,\u201d she cooed, looking him up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned. \u201cI haven\u2019t dressed like this for a few bodies,\u201d he murmured. \u201cRight then \u2013 ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held out a hand. \u201cLead the way, kind sir,\u201d she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took her hand and led her down the ramp and through the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked out into a very welcoming atmosphere. There was lots of laughter and singing and music going on just outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS had evidently landed in a stable near the festivities, but they could see activity occurring nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like we\u2019re just in time for some fun,\u201d the Doctor grinned. \u201cThis way, I think!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked around, her grin growing larger as they walked along. There were loads of Elizabethan party-goers all walking around, playing games and dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she found herself in the middle of a rather spirited dance with a group of people, all of them taking turns twirling her and various other women around. She became disoriented and tried hard to keep up, not to mention locate the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this movement was causing her to jiggle all over, and she could feel her breasts bouncing madly, almost threatening to burst out, and she was beginning to wish she\u2019d done a better job tying this thing up. She was spun around in several directions, growing dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found herself being thrust into a faintly familiar-looking suit, and she looked up to find the Doctor grinning down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHaving fun, Donna?\u201d he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Oh\u2026 I\u2019ll let you know as soon as there\u2019s only one of you\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor laughed heartily. \u201cCome on. What say we find some dinner. Sample the local cuisine?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s stomach rumbled. \u201cOhh, you read my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Wait, you didn\u2019t, did you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever! Only in the direst of emergencies, like when your birthday\u2019s coming up or something,\u201d he said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not talk about my age. Let\u2019s see what they\u2019ve got for nibbles.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looped his arm through hers, and they headed inside, where they found the dining room, where various people were gathered around a massive table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s mouth fell open at the large amounts of food that were piled upon the table. There were huge amounts of meat, vegetables and desserts that made her drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my God, look at all that!\u201d she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they need enough to feed all the whole party,\u201d the Doctor replied with a shrug. \u201cCome on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor and Donna grabbed a pair of plates and began to load them up with food. While the Doctor was loading up, he became distracted by all the people who were talking to him at once, trying to include him in their conversations, and the Doctor ended up trying to come up with a cover story for who they were and why they were invited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let him do just that. While he was trying to figure everything out, she was piling more and more food onto her plate. She had loads of chicken, beans, pork, carrots, peas, and various other things that she wanted to sample while she had the chance that most humans in her day and age never got to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Doctor managed to get away from the crowds, and she sat down with him at one of the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating people,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cRather nosey, but very talkative.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019d you tell them?\u201d Donna asked with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat I\u2019m the Lord of Gallifrey, and I\u2019m here with my sister from Chiswick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSister?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy not? You\u2019d rather I was your husband?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot in a million years.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere we are, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood call.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor began to eat his dinner as well. \u201cManaged to find out what else is scheduled for today,\u201d he went on. \u201cThere\u2019re going to be fireworks later tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSixteenth century fireworks?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, it should be a treat. Enjoying your dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d she replied through her full mouth. She\u2019d already put a sizeable dent in her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor half an hour, they sat there, talking and observing the local color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ended up going back for seconds, and then thirds, and then just a little bit of fourths. She kept eating more and more, absolutely loving the food and drink she was consuming, only somewhat aware of how full she was getting. Her stomach was trying to stretch outwards, but the corset was growing tighter and tighter around her mid-section, and the bulges of fat were working their way through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was night time, and before she knew it, the Doctor was leading her to a hill with some other people, and they were sprawled out in the grass, looking up at the amazing display of fireworks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna lay back on the hill, resting her hair in the grass. She began to subtly undo the corset a little to relieve the pressure. As she admired the beauty of the colors in the sky, she rubbed her stomach, helping digestion take place. She sighed inwardly. She wasn\u2019t about to lose weight any time soon.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was just a little tipsy after partaking in the various ales available at the party \u2013 so much that his acute sense of hearing could almost hear her sloshing and gurgling as she moved. He kicked the door shut with his heel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on, Donna, we\u2019re home,\u201d he said, helping her with the step up onto the central section of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHome\u2026 My mother\u2019s not here, is she?\u201d Donna slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope not.

The TARDIS should be able to help you find the way.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna merely belched in reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor crinkled his nose. \u201cMaybe she\u2019ll help you find your toothbrush first,\u201d he muttered, aiming her towards the internal door. \u201cGoodnight, Donna.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Night, Spaceman,\u201d Donna replied, waving behind herself as she waddled off down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled and set about taking them back into the Time Vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, meanwhile, staggered off down the corridor, hoping dimly that she was on her way to her bedroom. As she walked, she slowly began to undo the corset, feeling it was very difficult for her to breathe with the blasted thing on. Bit by bit, as she found the doorway to her room, she began to undo the knots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had opened her door and made it inside, she had just about gotten halfway through it when there was a sudden snapping noise, followed by several more, and she realized that her stomach was snapping through the remainder of the restraints, until finally it had made its way all the way forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared down at the various pieces of broken string that dangled around the globe that was her belly. She sighed unhappily to herself as he got the thing off and began to peel out of her dress. She got down to her underwear and headed for her private bathroom. Her feet were killing her, and she needed a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t bother with the bathroom scale. She didn\u2019t want to know. She simply got a nice hot bath going with lots of bubbles, and she tiredly waited on the side for it to fill up all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, she was lying on her back in the full tub, which was loaded with perfectly hot water and loads of suds. She settled back into it and relaxed. She let one hand drape outside of the tub, while the other one rested comfortably upon her store tummy, which grew and shrank with every strained breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a long time, she just lie there, listening to her own digestion taking place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after half an hour, she knew she needed to get out and go to bed, so she heaved herself out of the water and grabbed her softest bathrobe, wrapped it tightly around herself, and put on her softest slippers as well. She wrapped her hair up in a towel and padded over to the sink where she proceeded to brush her teeth, and then she headed towards her bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got there, she found a glass of water sitting on the nightstand. Silently thanking the TARDIS for her consideration, she took a long gulp from the glass before setting it down and lying down on the bed, hoping tomorrow\u2019s hangover wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Her stomach had settled for the most part, but there was still the odd gurgle emanating from it. She let out a small hiccup and rolled over again, listening to it slosh. She could feel her eyelids getting heavier and heavier until she finally drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weeks that ensued were quiet ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was quite content to continue traveling around the universe, managing to take them to quiet places. But for the most part, they remained in the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tried to stay active while they were in there. She tried to keep going to the gym and work out, but she found she was getting winded faster than she cared to. Then, to make matters worse, whenever she tried to go back, it was never in the same place twice. The Doctor simply said the TARDIS was in a playful mood, but Donna thought it was just torturing her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing the old time machine had no shortage of was vending machines. They seemed to be popping up all over the place, sticking out of walls invitingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tried to ignore them, and she managed to for at least five whole days. By day six, though, she realized that unless she took something from them at some point, she was probably going to starve, and of all the ways to get thin, that method appealed to her the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing to herself on the sixth afternoon, she clutched her empty stomach mournfully and headed for the vending machine. It was in a secluded part of the TARDIS. The Doctor was off working on another one of his projects, so he\u2019d be busy for some considerable time, and he most likely wouldn\u2019t want to be disturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to order something healthy, but the machine seemed to be on the blink, because when she ordered a banana, she got a banana split. When she ordered an apple, she got an apple pie. When she ordered a glass of milk, she got a vanilla milkshake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at all the desserts that lay out before her and sighed heavily. Then she attempted reverse psychology. She ordered a large cheeseburger with everything. To her disappointment, that\u2019s exactly what she got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked up at the ceiling. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to fatten me up, aren\u2019t you?\u201d she snapped irritably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS offered no reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach, however, gurgled hungrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at everything sitting on the floor in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, all right, fine,\u201d she grumbled. She picked up the burger and bit into it, feeling the grease dribble down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if expecting this, a robotic hand extended from the machine and produced a paper napkin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes, took it, dabbed at her chin and took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin five minutes, the entire burger was gone, washed down by the milkshake. She took a few slices of pie, followed by half the banana split, which took her a grand total of thirty minutes altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat down on the floor, leaning against the wall, her legs sticking straight out and her hands on her belly, which protruded firmly in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo more\u2026,\u201d she moaned. \u201cI just can\u2019t.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic arm extended again and produced a pair of antacids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna snatched them away and popped them in her mouth. Much to her surprise, they worked rather quickly, and her tummyache subsided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOooh,\u201d she sighed. \u201cMuch better\u2026 Still can\u2019t move, though\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robotic arm reached down and picked up the leftover ice cream. Donna thought it was merely clearing away the dishes, but to her surprise, a second robotic arm extended, picked up the spoon and scooped out a small scoop of half-melted ice cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at it, wishing she was somewhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, she opened her mouth, allowing the ice cream to be placed inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the robotic arms proceeded to feed her the ice cream. In no time, the entire thing had been emptied, with the remaining melted ice cream being poured down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it proceeded to the remaining apple pie. It took out slice after slice, letting Donna go at her own rate. It wasn\u2019t long before the entire thing was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna\u2019s stomach protested against all this. She felt like she was going to explode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to her astonishment, the arms reached down, lifted up her shirt and undid the button on her trousers, allowing her swollen gut to expand to full capacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna would\u2019ve been furious if it hadn\u2019t felt so good. She just sat there, patting her belly, enjoying the fullness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a nice fifteen minute sit, she wanted to go to her room. The hands held themselves out to her, encouraging her to take hold. She did so, and she was startled when she was suddenly hoisted back up again. She wobbled a bit, but she was back on her feet. She turned and waddled off down the corridor, and she felt relieved when she found the door to her room was closer than it had been this morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went inside and collapsed on the bed, listening to her recent gorge gurgle and slosh inside of her. She rolled over onto her back and patted her stomach with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust her luck. The TARDIS was a chubby chaser.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The weeks passed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor took Donna to all sorts of places, but to her surprise, they rarely found themselves doing any running. In fact, they had had some rather relaxing trips as of late, to all sorts of leisure centers where they didn\u2019t have to do much of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Donna always had a good time at these places, the Doctor was beginning to get a little bit bored with always having an easy time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the while, Donna found herself constantly be offered loads of calorie-loaded snacks from the TARDIS. She tried to turn them down, but she just couldn\u2019t help herself sometimes. They were just so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, though, something interesting was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was inspecting the TARDIS\u2019s circuitry, trying to figure out why the old girl was always taking them to nice, relaxing, boring locations. He managed to find an override system that would give them complete random coordinates. Not even his ship knew where they were going to land next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was doing this, he didn\u2019t notice Donna coming from behind him, finishing off a chocolate ice cream cone. She was just popping the last bit of it in her mouth when she came to a stop next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d she asked through her chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d the Doctor said with a grin. \u201cWe are going to a new exciting alien planet!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t. I\u2019ve set the controls to random. Completely random location! No idea where we\u2019re going!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame as usual then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled. \u201cHow much longer \u2018til we get there?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot long. Should be any \u2013 whoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe TARDIS suddenly lurched to the side, causing both passengers to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was back on his feet in an instant, working the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, however, was finding it a little tricky to stand up. She\u2019d had more than an ice cream cone. She\u2019d had five ice cream cones and a jumbo bag of chips. Her stomach gurgled as she found herself on top of it. Wincing in pain, she tried to roll over and get up, but it was a little difficult, considering how heavy she was feeling right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a grunt, she managed to reach over and grab the edge of the jump seat. She gripped it as tight as she could, and with three gallant attempts, she managed to haul herself up onto it, where she turned around and sat down, clutching the sides, her whole body jiggling as the TARDIS shuddered and rocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Doctor managed to find a way to slow everything down. With a loud THUMP the ship settled down, and all was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd after a few seconds, Donna\u2019s flesh was still, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d the Doctor said, with a big childish grin. \u201cShall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded uncertainly as she shakily stood up. She was definitely curvier than she\u2019d been before. Her breasts were a cup size larger, her rear swayed back and forth mesmerizingly, she was sprouting an extra chin, and her bulbous stomach was protruding rather far ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the Doctor didn\u2019t seem to notice. Instead, he dramatically opened the doors and looked outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were in a jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned. This looked promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he asked excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jungle was huge. That probably went without saying, but everything in the jungle was HUGE. The plants, the trees \u2013 they all towered over her like giants. Even the smallest flowers there seemed bigger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf ever there were a place that could make her feel thin, it was this place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned and strode out into the open. Donna followed, absently closing the doors behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anyone else here?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDunno. Let\u2019s find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor proceeded to march straight ahead, digging his way through the vines and branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna waddled after, pleased to be walking a great distance and therefore burning calories.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Somehow, the vines had all wound themselves around each other and were holding each other up, allowing them all to take in the sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love it!\u201d the Doctor exclaimed. \u201cLook at all this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ran her fingers along the side of an orange-colored plant. \u201cWhat are these?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and scanned the plant in question. \u201cEdible,\u201d he said at last. \u201cDon\u2019t know the actual name, but it does show a low acidity factor, and curiously high in essential vitamins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re huge!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, they are. Well done.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOi.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, everything else on the planet\u2019s huge. It only stands to reason they\u2019d grow at roughly the same rate.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I\u2026? Can I try one?\u201d Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course you can! Totally safe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying not to appear too eager, Donna wrapped her hands around the fruit \u2013 which was about the size of her head \u2013 and pulled it down from the vine. \u201cHow do I open it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor responded by aiming the sonic at the stem, which caused it to split, and then he proceeded to \u2018unzip\u2019 the plant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you do that?\u201d Donna asked. \u201cHow do you use a screwdriver to peel fruit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUsed the sonic vibrations to split the stem open. Are you gonna try it or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna decided to just forgo the technobabble and dig in. She wasn\u2019t really sure how to start, so she just turned her head to an angle and opened her mouth as wide as she could, taking a huge bite. She felt the juices dribble down her chin, but she didn\u2019t care, because suddenly she was in heaven. She chewed and chewed and swallowed, and then took another bite, eagerly and ravenously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was taking her fourth bite, the Doctor raised an expectant eyebrow. \u201cGood, then?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019sh Gorgoush!\u201d Donna declared through her full mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood. Swallow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna did so, feeling the huge amount of chewed fruit settle in her belly, feeling it stretch slightly from taking on so much at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most incredible thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve never had anything like it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked around at the other plants. There were different kinds of varying shapes, sizes and colors. \u201cI wonder if there\u2019re any banana-flavored ones,\u201d he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled at him. She continued to snarf down the whole fruit with gusto, and after a few minutes, all that was left was the core, which she let drop to the ground carelessly before she tore into a different fruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a large green one, this time. She found this one to have the skin of an apple or a pear, so she simply bit into it. Once again, an explosion of flavor ripped across her taste buds and sent an unmistakable signal to her brain: \u201cEat! Eat! Eat! Eat!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so she did. Donna chomped down on the fruit with gusto, eating as much of it as she could. It took a few more minutes, but at last, all that was left was another core, which she once again tossed aside before looking around a little more. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She turned to look, not letting go of the large peach-like fruit in her arms. As she looked around, she took a bite from the fruit, enjoying its flavor while looking around curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in the middle of her second bite when she heard the noise again, definitely behind her, and she turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was there with his hands up in surrender, and there was a small gaggle of what appeared to be warriors holding spears to his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEr, Donna?\u201d the Doctor said, trying not to sound too nervous. \u201cCould you be a dear and tell these nice people that I have not come here to rape their land and defile their women?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, chewed and swallowed. \u201cHe isn\u2019t, you know,\u201d she said to the natives. \u201cThose are the very last things on his mind.\u201d And she took another bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you!\u201d the Doctor said with a grin. \u201cShe\u2019s Donna Noble. You can take her word for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe natives looked at each other uncertainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of them, possibly their leader, lowered his spear, and then all the others lowered their spears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked forward. He was fully dressed in skins, with tribal markings on his face, and his hair was wild and graying. He approached Donna cautiously, and she eyed him warningly, somehow managing to look authoritative even while slowly devouring a giant piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have eaten from the Sacred Garden,\u201d he said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna swallowed the last bit of fruit, and for some reason, this one felt heavier than the others. Her stomach began to quiver with fear, trying to contain the large amount of fruit it had just been tasked to hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSacred Garden?\u201d she asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d the tribe leader said. \u201cAnd they say those who eat from the Sacred Garden are to be worshiped and obeyed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all the tribesmen got down on their knees and proceeded to bow before Donna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked rather peculiar, sticking out of the group of kneeling people. He looked over at Donna and shrugged with a bemused expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked bemused right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo,\u201d she said at last. \u201cYou, er, worship people who eat from the garden, eh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, my lady,\u201d the leader replied from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Why\u2019s that? What\u2019s so important about this garden?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he looked up. \u201cYou do not know?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAfraid not.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThose who eat from the plants and live must have otherworldly powers. Only a goddess such as yourself could survive these plants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they began to chant some sort of holy prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor managed to slip out of the field of people\u2019s backs and made it over to her. \u201cNot bad for a temp,\u201d he said under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCheeky,\u201d Donna replied. \u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about? Are the fruits dangerous or not?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re not. I\u2019m sure of it. It must be something else. Maybe it\u2019s their biology and they can\u2019t digest the fruit. Maybe someone made up the legend to keep these people away from here. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the tribe leader was on his feet again. \u201cGoddess, you must command us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked surprised. \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are a divine holy messenger! You have come to show us the way!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked. She looked at the Doctor, but he was just grinning away, loving this. She wrinkled her nose at him and looked at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026 what have you all been doing so far?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe hunt. We gather. We raise our young so that they may learn to hunt and gather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd is that it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there more?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed. It wasn\u2019t really her place to change these people\u2019s lifestyles. \u201cJust\u2026keep on doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she assured them. \u201cYou\u2019ve been going the right way all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 We have?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. You have good lives. You don\u2019t need me to show you anything. You\u2019ve had the answers inside you all along.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribe leader stared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned to his people, held up his hands and shouted, \u201cThe Goddess has spoken!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd they all erupted into cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot bad, Goddess,\u201d the Doctor chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better believe it, Time Boy,\u201d she replied, smugly crossing her arms over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome!\u201d the tribe leader declared. \u201cWe shall have an enormous feast in your honor!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at them. She let her arms uncross and cradle her belly, which was still rather full from all that fruit. \u201cOhh, I dunno\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on, Goddess!\u201d the Doctor said eagerly. \u201cCan\u2019t we stay? Please?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at him for a moment before sighing. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tribesmen cheered again, and they began to lead the Doctor and Donna towards their city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna began wishing she\u2019d worn elastic.</span></div></div>",

When they said feast, they really meant it. She was so stuffed as she followed the Doctor back to the TARDIS. Not that he'd noticed. He'd spent most of his time helping to defeat a so-called \"god\" that was terrifying the natives. Turned out to be a genetic mutation that had been dumped on their world decades ago. With the creature neutralized and the people saved, they'd been very grateful and treated like heroes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was still talking a mile a minute about god knows what, but Donna was just waddling after him. Her pants were unbuttoned, but they were in no danger of falling. Her stomach stuck out so far ahead of her that they didn't budge. She waddled after the Doctor as they entered the TARDIS. He was still talking. Where did he find the energy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat down on the jumpseat and got her large posterior as comfortable as possible. She sat back and rubbed her stomach. She was almost certain she would burst. She rubbed and rubbed while the Doctor set the TARDIS in flight and back into the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well!\" the Doctor said cheerfully. \"That was good fun! Maybe we'll go back there someday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna hiccuped. \"Yeah... someday...,\" she moaned, leaning back. \"Blimey... I can't believe I ate it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were impressed! Said only a goddess could pack it away like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm paraphrasing, but that's what they meant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes but smirked fondly. \"God, look at me. Don't know how I'm going to move from this seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you're more than welcome to stick around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wanna fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor turned and disappeared behind the console. She heard the sound of the metal grating he called a floor being lifted, and a moment later, it slammed shut, and he returned with a neck pillow. \"Here you are! Try that on for size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled gratefully and slipped it on. God, that felt good. She put her hands under her enormous belly and rubbed it. \"So go on, then. Say something science-y. Should put me right to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor gave her a stern look but continued working and talking anyway. She knew that he just needed someone to hear him talk sometimes. It's what she felt he needed from her the most - to not be lonely. She snuggled into the seat and rubbed her belly, drifting off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Doctor made it a point to bring Donna home periodically so she could see her mother and grandfather. He'd experienced his companions drifting away from their normal lives too often and wanted to ensure that she still had a life on Earth. Living with her family, she had no rent to pay or anything, and her chronic unemployment meant she remained free to gad about the universe without being missed too much. Still, they agreed that they would try to arrive a week or two after her departure, regardless of how long she'd really been away, if only to reassure her family that she remained safe and not-dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, her mother didn't know about all the zooming around space and time. Donna knew Sylvia would never approve of her misadventures. Her nagging would be cranked up to eleven, and it already seemed to routinely be at ten and a half anyway. The last thing she needed was Sylvia Noble's patented brand of \"intrusive parent\" sticking her nose into her already stressful life as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking out an outfit for reuniting with them proved difficult. After a few more heavy fat meals in the last few months, her belly stuck out whether she was stuffed or not. It jiggled vertically and horizontally, mesmerizing passers by. She'd had to adjust her wardrobe accordingly six times now, going up many trouser sizes. It had become such a normal part of her life now that she had to admit she'd gotten used to gaining weight. What with all the running for her life that came with a standard life in the TARDIS, she hadn't really worried too much about it. She made sure to get some healthy food in with the junk food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, now she would have to face her domineering mother, and she knew she would never let that sort of thing off the hook. To have ballooned like this in the months she'd been away, only to come home a few weeks after her last visit, she didn't know what to do. She looked over her clothes in the hopes that she might find something less revealing. Something to take the focus off her gut, or at least disguise it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she found something she'd hoped she'd never see again -- the girdle from when they'd gone to the Middle Ages. Okay, the official name was a \"corset\", but all she could think of it was it helped make Captain Kirk look svelte on Star Trek. She looked down at her bowling ball of a belly and sighed with cold dread. <i>Just power through it</i>, she thought. <i>You're only staying for dinner.</i> That's all it was. In, out, a few hours, a cup of tea or two, and then back to the bigger-on-the-inside phone box to let her flab fly free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrimacing, she slipped it on, finding it difficult to get over her belly, but she sucked it in as best she could until the corset fit neatly around her enlarged middle. With all her might, she started tying it up. She'd just wear something bulky like a sweater to make it less noticeable. After a few minutes, she had it ready. She slipped on a thick dark blue sweater and a pair of her fat jeans and posed momentarily for the mirror. Frowning, she made sure the girdle wasn't too noticeable. She looked a little lumpy, she supposed, but at least her gut didn't protrude... <i>quite </i>as much. Taking a deep breath -- but not too deep -- she moved awkwardly out of the wardrobe room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor brought the TARDIS in for a landing with minimal bumps and checked the readings. \"Right!\" he said triumphantly. \"Chiswick! 2009! Home to Facebook, smart phones and the last half-decent season of <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never heard of that,\" Donna replied bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the best. You're not missing out on much.\" Then, his head tilted like it always did when he was bemused. \"Are you all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, your breathing seems a bit... awkward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn alien senses. \"I'm fine. I'm just... wearing a little extra support under this sweater.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Support?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've gained weight, and I'd rather my mum didn't notice, so I thought I'd just... hide the evidence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked her up and down before his eyes lit up. \"Ohhhh!\" he exclaimed. \"I didn't notice there seemed to be less of you! Sorry, not the sort of thing I normally look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I'm glad. That's what friends are for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled and prepared to open the doors. \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never. But let's do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pulled open the doors, revealing they were in a lot just down the street from her house. She knew her Gramps would want a look at an actual alien space ship one day, but it would have to be on a day when her mum wasn't about. They trudged up the sidewalk until they were walking up to the house. Not even bothering to knock, Donna pushed the door open and poked her head in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here!\" she called out. \"Mum? Gramps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'ello, sweet'art!\" Gramps called from the kitchen. \"We just put the kettle on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at her grandfather's voice, Donna moved hurriedly into the kitchen and gave the old man a peck on the head. \"How've you been, Gramps?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not too bad, considering,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Considering what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shrill voice cut through the air. \"Donna?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia came into the kitchen, looking a bit frazzled. She barely held back a scowl when she saw the Doctor. \"Oh, you brought <i>him</i>, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" the Doctor said, waving slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mum, he's my friend,\" Donna said with an eye roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia still eyed him with great suspicion. \"Funny how we don't know anything about this 'friend', isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, leave it, luv,\" Wilf scolded. \"I'm just glad our Donna has a friend she can rely on in her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Gramps,\" Donna said gratefully. \"Now how about that cuppa?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brilliant idea,\" the Doctor agreed. \"Wilf -- how's the telly working?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better since you tinkered with it. Although, I'm still getting the hang of that new remote control you built. Keep getting a channel called the 'Venusian Home Shopping Network'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, might have extended the range a bit far. I'll fiddle with it before I leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit back a smile. If only he were husband material. But then again, she felt she needed a friend more than a husband anyway. She helped get the tea together, keeping her breathing nice and even as she got out the sugar and honey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not taking yours with sugar now, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, <i>mum</i>, just a bit of honey. That's all. The sugar's for him. He can't drink it unless it rots his teeth out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia nodded distantly, glancing back at the Doctor as he chatted with Wilf before readdressing Donna. \"So what are you up to these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know -- just traveling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With <i>him</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, with him. What's wrong with that? It's more fun with a mate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as long as you're taking care of yourself. I don't want you falling apart out there without me to keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smirked. \"Mum, I feel as though you're watching me no matter where I go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia thankfully didn't realize that wasn't strictly a compliment and sat down at the table while Donna poured the tea for everyone. She passed out the cups and went to take her seat in the sole empty chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately regretted this. She felt the corset struggle as her stomach bulged against it. She winced slightly as she tried to lower herself naturally into the chair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, the Doctor was talking a mile a minute about re-configuring a hairdryer into a particle accelerator, so nobody was really paying attention to her. She eased herself down into the chair, hoping to disguise the fact that she sat perfectly straight in her seat, her legs at an awkward angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was going to be a long day after all. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The day went by fairly uneventful. The Doctor and Donna regaled Wilf with the adventures they'd had lately. Zooming around time and space, fighting monsters, saving planets and running away from danger had given them plenty of stories to tell, and he held onto every word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sylvia had been largely forgotten, mainly because she'd been toiling away in the kitchen, making dinner. Donna had long since given up trying to help her mother cook. She never seemed to get it right. Every attempt ended in criticism. So now she just hung out in the living room with her gramps and ignored it. Of course, then her mother would complain about doing all the work, but hey, at least it was less for Donna to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she heard that shrill voice call out. \"All right, it's ready! Come and get it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna awkwardly got to her feet, feeling the corset under her clothes groan slightly at her stomach attempting to bulge behind it. Thankfully, it held together, and she followed the others into the kitchen. Her mouth about fell open at the spread before them. Roast chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, devilled eggs...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilf whistled. \"Good grief, Sylvia luv, that had to take a bit of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia shrugged as she wiped her hands with a rag. \"Well, you know how it is when we have guests over. Never know how much to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it looks amazing, Mrs. Noble,\" the Doctor said politely as he joined them at the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her attempts to look like she didn't care, Sylvia still grinned slightly. \"All right, you lot. Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit her lip slightly as she picked up her fork. She already felt like a sausage crammed into a tin with this corset on. She didn't need even more pressure. Perhaps she could get away with keeping it light. But it all looked so good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor passed her the mashed potatoes, she found herself scooping a hearty spoonful onto her plate. She'd just go easy on everything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept she didn't, because she kept piling more on as it came around to her. Her plate loaded to maximum capacity, she winced to herself. For a woman who nagged her about her weight, her mother really shouldn't be so good a cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConversation carried on to the latest gossip around town, with her family giving her updates on the various friends and neighbors and what they'd been up to lately. Pretty tame stuff compared to traveling through time and fighting monsters, but she knew she needed to experience the tedious monotony of the universe as well as the exciting bits. She chatted away with her family, the Doctor throwing in the odd question here and there, and soon, she began to forget how much she ate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, about twenty minutes later, she began to feel the swell in her stomach grow against the corset. She squirmed in her seat as she felt it dig into her flesh. She really needed to stop eating, but to do so would leave uneaten food on her plate, and her mother would only take that as an insult. She forced herself to keep at it. She ate every last scrap of food on her plate while still holding together a half-decent conversation with everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passed, and at last, dinner ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt like she would explode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach pressed hard against the corset, which she feel straining against her. She swallowed down a belch and set about helping tidy up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that went well,\" Sylvia remarked as she washed the dishes. \"Don't know why we don't do this more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled wryly. \"Yeah, well, maybe don't say 'oh, it's <i>you</i>' every time I have him over, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWashing up took another ten minutes, and each one seemed to pass slower than the last as Donna kept herself moving. Her stomach gurgled angrily, demanding breathing room at once. Sighing heavily, she pretended to check her watch the minute the last plate went into the cupboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's the time,\" she said. \"Better get back before I completely fall asleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia shrugged. \"Well, all right then. But I'd like you to call more than just once a week,\" she said, awkwardly hugging her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll try,\" she said in a fake annoyed voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled to the living room and fetched the Doctor. He'd managed to finish repairing the TV remote and had spent the evening showing Wilf some of the more human channels. She gave him a hug and promised to call him at her next destination before hurrying out the door with the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the rush?\" he asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't breath with this bloody thing on,\" Donna gasped as they made their way. \"Why the hell did you park so far away?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed and followed her up the street back to the empty lot where they'd left the TARDIS. Once they got there, she waited impatiently as he got out the key and unlocked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, all a -- oop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pushed past him and got inside, immediately reaching under her sweater. She pulled on the knots and began to breathe a little easier as she felt her stomach expand with relief. She didn't even care when the resulting expansion caused the button to pop off her trousers. Her sweater rode up, and her full belly pooched forwards proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor didn't seem all that concerned. He just stood off to the side, hands in pockets. \"Better?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much,\" she sighed. \"God, that was the longest dinner of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought it was one of my better interactions with your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \"Yeah, I think she's coming 'round to you.\" She plopped down on the jumpseat, hands atop her belly. \"God, I'm exhausted. I swear, I need a place where I can just relax for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor thought about that for a moment, and then he smiled. \"There's a planet I've always wanted to visit,\" he grinned, already working the controls. \"I've heard it's one of the best leisure planets in the universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah?\" Donna asked sleepily. \"What are the odds the TARDIS will actually take us there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"Well, she won't with <i>that </i>attitude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, all right, sorry,\" she chuckled. \"What's the planet called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Midnight! Almost made entirely of diamonds! You can relax to your heart's content!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pondered. \"Will I have to wear trousers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost certain they give you a bath robe the minute you get there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed a finger at him. \"Book it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grinned and started inputting the coordinates.</span></div></div>",

She briefly wondered if the Doctor had carried her here, but she also knew the possibility of the TARDIS simply \"putting\" her there could be just as likely. Either way, she enjoyed a good night's sleep, rolled out of bed and got on her fat pants. She had to admit -- it felt great to breathe normally for a change. She took in her profile in the full-length mirror and shook her head. Her stomach still protruded outwards like she had swallowed a bowling ball. If she kept this up, her fat pants probably would be replaced by a pair of \"fatter pants\". It would get extra difficult hiding this from her mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd gotten dressed and done her hair up a bit, she made her way down to the control room. The Doctor stood at the console's monitor, typing away on a keyboard with his brainy specs on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning,\" she said, walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gooooood morning,\" he replied, not looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouted slightly at his lack of looking at her. She walked up behind him and put her chin on his shoulder, looking down at the screen. \"Whatcha working on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our reservations on the planet Midnight. Told you about this last night, remember?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah,\" she grinned. \"Pleasure planet, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis nose crinkled. \"No, relaxation planet. Pleasure planet is something else entirely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, can we go to one of them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes, making her grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're such a prude,\" she sighed dramatically, walking off and plopping down on the jumpseat, ignoring how loudly it creaked under her considerable rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here we are!\" he said triumphantly, finishing up. \"Reservations booked! We're all set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. So when do we leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe just grinned excitedly before running down the ramp and opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna sat up a little straighter at the white light that poured in. She got up and scurried down after him, peering out the doors. \"Oh my god, we're already here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sent the reservation back through time,\" he explained. \"Which means, we should be receiving a greeting right about...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, a humanoid woman in a white uniform and a pleasant smile walked up, holding out a pair of white bathrobes to them. \"Doctor John Smith, and Miss Donna Noble,\" she smiled. \"Welcome to the Midnight Spa and Relaxation Center. Here are your customary robes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna got over her shock -- plus her relief that they hadn't been mistaken for a married couple -- and took her robe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall show you to your rooms,\" the woman continued, leading them away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey followed her into the complex, the Doctor making sure the TARDIS locked behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Separate rooms,\" Donna whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With adjoining doors,\" he replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived at their rooms. Donna popped inside and immediately gaped at the place. Queen-sized adjustable bed with massage feature, big screen TV with an easy-to-understand remote, huge bath tub in the corner with a shower feature and a small balcony that overlooked the diamond world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's gorgeous,\" Donna murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence. She turned around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the interior door swung open, and in walked the Doctor, his bathrobe on over his suit like his usual trench coat, and carrying a small jar. \"Ooh, Donna, look -- macadamia nuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but laugh. He could be such a child sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know! I've always wanted to visit! You know, the sun it orbits emits phenomenally lethal X-tonic radiation and there is no atmosphere. Exposure to the surface for even a split second would result in the unfortunate person being instantly vaporized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, then looked outside. \"So... why am I not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The leisure facility is encased in a fifteen-inch-thick glass dome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, that's good, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite. Gosh, there's just so much to do around here, I don't know what to do first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I came here for some relaxation,\" Donna reminded him. \"Not a load of running up and down corridors, even if it's only to the tourist shops.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded understandingly. \"Ask, and you shall receive,\" he said, pulling a brochure out of his pocket and handing it to her. \"Came with the room. All the attractions in the facility -- restaurants, games, shows, relaxation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna opened the brochure and let out an impressed whistle. \"It all looks good. Don't know how we'll cram it all in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, between the two of us, we can cover a lot of ground. Personally, I like the look of the anti-gravity restaurant, and then there's the diamond-cutting demonstration...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a hard time picturing you sitting still for one of those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged. \"Well, y'know, they might learn something from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna chuckled. \"Well, I need to change first, and then I need to kick back for a bit. You can catch the show, and we'll meet up later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. Where are you going to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at the brochure again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Clad in her bathrobe and very comfortable pair of walking shoes, Donna made her way through the complex, nodding politely to all the other people in white bathrobes as she followed the map on the brochure. She wondered if this could be considered \"self-destructive behavior\". After worrying about her weight so much, it felt counter productive to go to an all-you-can-eat buffet and pig out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of course, I won't pig out</i>, she told herself. <i>I'll behave myself. I just want to experience an alien culture that no other human being on Earth will ever see. At least, not in my lifetime. Hell, I probably won't even like half of it. Just gotta be sensible.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepeating this to herself mentally, Donna finally found the Midnight Buffet. The opening resembled the entrance to a fancy restaurant in a shopping mall, but with large booths and plenty of room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist at the front desk smiled pleasantly when she walked up. \"Table for one?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please,\" Donna replied politely, showing her a plastic payment card the Doctor had given her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist rang it up and directed her towards the buffet line. \"Help yourself and enjoy!\" she said, handing it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and grabbed a large tray. Keep it simple, she told herself.<i> Just having a late breakfast. Or an early lunch. Whatever.<br>\r\n</i><br>\r\nShe got into line and felt her nostrils flare at the scrumptious smells wafting her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe both.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the food looked vaguely familiar, but others looked quite bizarre. Still, she couldn't help but marvel at how delicious most of it still looked. Still, she thought, just because something looked good didn't mean it was, in fact, good. She'd been led astray by normal-looking food in the past. Tomatoes, for example. They looked perfectly edible from the outside, but then, you got inside and found a lot of jiggly jelly-looking stuff. Not appetizing in the slightest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she'd make a go of it. Just a few small samples here and there. She scooped up something that looked like beans, followed by some blue stuff, then some stuff that looked vaguely like cannolis, something that resembled a buffalo wing, and a beverage that looked neon orange but had the most delightfully fizzy bubbles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at the heap of food on her plate. So this would be breakfast and lunch for the day then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she made her way to a small booth not far away, she took a moment to look at the crowd. Mostly human, or humanoid anyway, but some obvious aliens milled about, chatting amiably with everyone. She also couldn't help noticing just how large a lot of these people more. All of them with bulging bellies all protruding as they tucked into their meals. Several of them got up and went for more, despite how badly they waddled. It made Donna feel just that bit more secure about her own size -- she looked downright skinny compared to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that happy thought, she settled into a booth and tucked into the food. She tried the weird-looking stuff first. To her surprise, it tasted like raspberry ice cream. Pleased at a familiar taste and texture, she continued to spoon it into her mouth. In fact, it seemed as though a lot of the food tasted like something back on Earth. Perhaps the food had been genetically modified or something to be more appealing to humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she plowed right through the meal and gobbled it down in minutes flat. Soon, an empty plate sat before her with the remnants of her meal. She took one last sip of the fizzy orange drink and leaned back in the booth. Making sure no one was watching, she loosened the belt on the robe a notch. She felt very full. She licked her lips and took another glance at the buffet line. Still plenty to go around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>... What the hell?</i> she thought, and grabbed her tray for round two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so many options, it'd be a crime not to try a few more, she reasoned. She loaded her tray again and returned to her booth, eating it all down in nothing flat. She went back a third time and got much bigger helpings. More refills on that orange drink. More piles of that blue raspberry stuff. More food for her already-too-full belly. She chomped her way through it, losing the ability to care how much she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, though, she had to give in. She'd definitely had enough. Six trips through the buffet in total, and each time, she'd had to adjust the belt on her fluffy bathrobe ever-so-slightly. She lounged in the booth for a long time. She imagined she looked like she had swallowed a bowling ball, pressing against the table now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she realized she couldn't just sit there -- not with the belt on the robe about to give any second. With a miserable grunt, she heaved herself out from the booth and dragged her way to the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you had a good time, ma'am!\" the receptionist called out cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna managed a dazed smile in her direction but reserved her energy for getting back to her room. Her stomach gurgled and churned as it struggled to digest everything. It jiggled horizontally and vertically with every footstep. She needed to get back to the room, if only so she could rub some of the pain away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she staggered up to her door and inserted the room key. Once inside, she immediately shut the door and let the belt on the robe pop open. She gave a huge sigh of relief as her belly jiggled outwards and sagged heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes scanned the room, and then she noticed the in-ground bathtub in the corner. Smiling to herself, she grabbed a pillow and lowered her bloated self into the bath, and then started the warm water. Adding some bubble bath, she got comfortable on the tub's seat and leaned back, enjoying the sound of the water running as it filled up the bath. She smiled dopily as it rushed up over her ankles and along her legs. She put her hands atop her belly and smiled beatifically as she became slowly submerged. Once it was up to her breasts, she lazily reached over and turned the water off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in complete silence for several minutes, enjoying the warm, the bubbles and her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen --<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>URRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRP!!!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed with embarrassment, then shrugged since there had been no one to listen anyway. She laid her back against the pillow and enjoyed a nice long food coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, when she woke up --</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna carelessly draped a fluffy white towel around waist and waddled about the room, feeling nice and cool after the warm bath. She scanned the room for an idea of what to do next. Her eyes fell on the brochure again, and with a shrug, she snatched it up and gazed over its contents. She saw the restaurants list and winced -- she was far too stuffed and bloated to even think about food again. She needed something else to do besides gorging herself on anything set in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her eyes lit up -- a spa with a massage. She briefly let her mind wander to the idea of some tall, muscular bloke rubbing his nice strong hands all over her naked body. She shook the thought out of her head, though. Best not to get her hopes up. Alien planet -- it might be all done with robots for all she knew. Still, she could definitely do with some relaxation. She finished drying off and slipped on her robe and shoes, making tracks for the spa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing the directions, she beamed when she saw the place. A few people milled around, chatting, going over some papers and so forth. She approached the woman behind the counter, who smiled pleasantly when she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you, ma'am?\" she asked in a soothing voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blushed, feeling a tad ridiculous asking this, but she held up the brochure anyway. \"Yeah, I was wondering how you go about getting one of these massages?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist smiled, clearly used to this. \"Just fill out this form, and a masseuse will be with you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took the clipboard and form handed to her, and took a pen from the mug on the counter. She took a seat and sat back. She wondered how much of this she could make up on the spot. Her billing address probably didn't exist this far in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as her eyes flitted across the form, she found it didn't look like an ordinary form. After name, age, and height, she found a few check boxes inquiring what areas of her body she would like to have focused on. She wondered briefly if she should just check all of them. Then, she noticed that a few body parts that probably would be inappropriate were listed as well. Swallowing, she decided to skip those and kept to the basics -- legs and thighs, shoulders, arms, back, feet, etc. She came across one for \"stomach\" and hesitated briefly. She didn't know why a stomach would need massaging but, curious as ever, she checked it to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing filling the form out, she handed it to the receptionist and retook her seat. She thumbed absently through a magazine, waiting patiently for her name. A few other people came and went as their own names got called. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, she heard her name. \"Donna Noble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna got up and went through a sliding door into a hallway filled with more sliding doors. She looked around for the source of the voice, only to find it to be a speaker on a wall. \"Good afternoon, Miss Noble,\" it said. \"Please report to suite seven. Your masseuse shall be with you shortly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... All right then,\" she replied, shrugging as she made her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding the door with a seven on it, Donna stepped inside and immediately lit up. Candles everywhere, soft music playing, dim lights and a massage table. She made her way over to it and briefly considered whether or not she should retain her robe. She'd never been to a fancy spa before and wondered what the protocol could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a small diamond-shaped object rose from a nearby desk and hovered in the air. Donna backed away, not sure what it would do, but then it began to project little beams of light that started to swirl around, slowly increasing in speed until they took the shape of a six-foot-tall strong-looking man in a uniform. He smiled a cheesy good-looking smile and took her in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Greetings, Donna Noble</i>,\" he said in a slightly stilted voice. \"<i>I am Holo-Masseuse Number Two-Five-Nine, but you may call me Rupert.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, dumbfounded, before finally finding her voice. \"Oh! Well... hello, Rupert,\" she said awkwardly. \"Er... what's a 'holo-masseuse'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I am a hard-light hologram designed to be your ideal masseuse</i>,\" he replied. \"<i>I shall be carrying out your massage today</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt a silly girlish grin split across her face. \"Well, all right, if you insist!\" she said cheerfully. She made to move for the table, then stopped. \"Erm... robe on or off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Off would be preferable</i>,\" Rupert replied with nary a change in expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoo, I'll say it is, mate,\" Donna breathed huskily as she immediately let the robe fall to her feet. She probably should've felt a bit silly, she reflected, but what the hell -- he was a hologram. She let all her flab hang out and heaved herself on top of the table. It felt a bit awkward -- her stomach still contained most of her earlier gorge. She had to reposition herself a few times as her belly expanded beneath her. Once satisfied, Donna put her face in the hole and relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt strong hands start rubbing on her shoulders, and she let out a small squeak of pleasure. It felt so good, feeling her muscles relax instantly as he tightened his grip on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not half bad at this,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I am programmed to seek out all your tensions areas</i>,\" he replied. \"<i>You seem very tense</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, y'know how it is. Very active. Sometimes feels like the whole universe is resting on your shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I can tell</i>.\" He rubbed her shoulders and gave them a good squeeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's dopey grin threatened to split her face apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next fifteen minutes, Donna enjoyed those hands moving up and down her body, rubbing her shoulders, then her back, and then right down her legs to her feet, making sure each toe got its much needed individual attention. She bit her lip -- this was the most action she'd had in ages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he asked the big question: \"<i>You may now roll over.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's eyes widened as she remembered what she'd asked for. Awkwardly, she rolled herself onto her back, allowing her mountainous stomach to sit in all its rotund glory. She braced herself. She had no idea what this would be like. Hopefully, not ticklish, as that would destroy the mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, she began to feel his fingers on her stomach, kneading it as if it were a lump of dough, gently yet firmly rubbing it up and down. Donna's eyes rolled up into her head as she realized how much she enjoyed this feeling. She still felt stuffed after lunch and his hands felt so welcoming. She bit her lip again, this time to stifle a moan of pleasure as his hands worked their way up and down, left and right, gently jiggling her belly and dancing his fingers across it. She felt something stir in her downstairs department and felt like something had just been awoken from a long slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, all too soon...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Your massage is now complete, Donna Noble.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's eyes fluttered open as she peered over her breasts at Rupert, who stood expectantly to the side. Still in a daze, she struggled to sit upright, her gut spilling into her lap as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Thank you for visiting our spa, Donna Noble</i>,\" he said pleasantly. \"<i>We hope your experience was satisfactory.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded faintly. \"Bloody marvelous,\" she gasped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Please gather any belongings and continue to the exit. We welcome you to enjoy our sunbathing resort, where the fifteen-feet-thick glass will enable you to enjoy the natural tanning effects of Midnight's sun. Thank you, and come again.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on that note, Rupert's form broke down into basic points of light that retreated back into the projection device, which then set itself down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna fanned herself. Where had <i>that</i> come from?! She looked down at her bulge of a belly and ran her hands over it, hefting it up and down a bit. Still amazed -- and feeling more relaxed than she had in weeks -- she got her shoes and fluffy white robe back on and headed for the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching into the pocket of the robe, she scoped out the brochure. What should she do next?</span></div></div>",

It felt good to have so much tension removed, and she didn't want to ruin it by overthinking how good it felt to have her belly rubbed... fondled... jiggled... Ugh, no stop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe arrived at the sunbathing area and checked in with the receptionist. \"Any chance I can get a spot?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist checked the records at her computer. \"We have one room left,\" she said, \"but it's a small one. Is that all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that'll be fine,\" Donna smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good. I'll get you checked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited, Donna felt her mobile start buzzing in her robe pocket. Holding up a finger to the receptionist, she turned away and answered. \"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna!\" the Doctor's enthusiastic voice called back. \"What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About to go sunbathing. You?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know. This and that. Went to the diamond-cutting exhibition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you get into trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohh, you know me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do. Did you get into trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I didn't! And security only frisked me the once!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna snickered. \"You naughty boy. Do I want the details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you them later. Now come on -- I can get us a spot on the shuttle bus going to the sapphire waterfall!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, no thanks. I'm here to relax. Not go on a bloody field trip. Need time to relax.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, c'mon! Where's your sense of adventure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got used up after the Library, plus the other half a dozen things I get dragged into. Need some sunbathing to replenish it. Now, you have fun, and come get me when you're back. I plan to spend the rest of my day here. Just ask the receptionist for me. After this call, the phone turns off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Donna -- !\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbyeeeeee!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Donna hung up her phone and switched it off. She felt a little bad doing that, but he knew her well enough by now. She turned back to the receptionist, who smiled at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist led her down a long circular corridor and into the sunbathing suites. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The beautiful thing about our suites is that they offer absolute privacy. No one enters these chambers unless you invite them with the call button on your chair. You needn't ever get up unless you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heavenly,\" Donna smiled, keeping up with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon arrived, and the door slid open. Donna had expecting the \"small one\" to be, well, <i>small</i>. It towered over her. Pillars lined the white walls, with a huge glass dome over her as the sun shined down. Hell, it even had a pool!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you are, ma'am,\" the receptionist said. \"If you require anything, the call button is on the left arm of the sun-lounger. If we need to contact you, a light will flash on the arm -- green for moderate and red for urgent -- and you can choose to answer or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's handy,\" said Donna, already sitting down and looking at the arm in question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. If you require refreshment, there's a menu tucked underneath. Television and music options as well, with a thought remote. Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I'm fine for now. Thanks, luv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist smiled. \"Then I'll leave you to it. Enjoy your day, Miss Noble.\" She turned and left, shutting the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and leaned back on the sun-lounger, already feeling the warm shining on her. She felt so good, she could just doze off right here. Finding a pair of complimentary sunglasses, she slipped them on and proceeded to take a nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she awoke, it had been an hour and a half. Feeling properly refreshed, she slid off her sunglasses for a moment and glanced around. She wished she had brought a book or something. She reached under the lounger and found the laminated sheet with her menu options. She peered down at her belly. Lunch had been a while ago, and she felt like a snack, but she really didn't need even more calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her relief, the green light flashing proved to be enough of a distraction, and she pressed the button. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phone call for you, Miss Noble, from a Mr Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. The man never gave up. \"Yeah, I'll take it. Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, a smartly-dressed waiter entered with a cordless phone on a tray. She plucked it off and immediately greeted her caller with a resounding, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>A sapphire waterfall! A waterfall,made of sapphires! This enormous jewel, the size of a glacier, reaches the Cliffs of Oblivion, and then shatters into sapphires at the edge, they fall a hundred thousand feet into a crystal ravine.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bet you say that to all the girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh come on, they're boarding now. It's no fun if I see it on my own! Four hours, that's all it takes.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's four hours there and four hours back, it's like a school trip. I'd rather go sunbathing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You be careful. That's X-Tonic sunlight.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm safe. It says in the brochure, this glass is fifteen feet thick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sighed. \"<i>All right, I give up. I'll be back for dinner, we'll try that anti-gravity restaurant. With bibs.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna grimaced at the thought of more food, both wanting it and not wanting it at the same time. Still, maybe after eight hours, she'd be hungry enough to not care. \"That's a date,\" she said. Then, she caught herself. \"Well, not a date. You know what I mean, get off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>See you later!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oy, and you be careful, all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard him scoff. \"<i>Naaah. Taking a big space truck with a bunch of strangers across a diamond planet called Midnight... what could possibly go wrong?!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe line went dead, and after a moment, Donna wearily returned the phone to the waiter. \"Thanks,\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will there be anything else, madam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked up at him, then glanced at the menu tucked next to her in the lounger...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna pulled out the menu and skimmed it. Something light. Something to tide her over for the next -- ugh -- eight hours. If she had this place for as long as she liked, she'd make sure she enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get...,\" she said, scanning the menu. Good lord, this laminated piece of paper had a scroll option. She flicked through the list and found something from Earth. \"... a foot-long meatball sub with Parmesan and a sugar-free cola?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing simpler,\" the waiter replied with a smile. He snapped his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a flat piece of metal -- some sort of tray -- extended from the side of the lounger, and then a cup holder popped out from the other side. The sandwich materialized out of thin air on the tray, while the cup holder suddenly acquired a fizzy ice cold soda. Donna stared at them for a long moment before smiling weakly at the waiter. \"Er... thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you require anymore refreshment, just select the item you desire on the menu and snap your fingers. The telepathic synthesizer will do the rest.\" And with that, he turned and walked out, the door shutting behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned at the thought of being able to summon food just like that. She picked up the sub. Maybe it wouldn't be that good. But of course it was. It tasted delectable. Just like from her favorite sandwich shop on Earth. She took a sip of the soda and moaned at how good it tasted -- even without sugar. She let out a sad moan and continued to eat. She wondered if the TARDIS had planned this. She couldn't shaken the idea yet that the Doctor's time machine might be a chubby chaser constantly dumping her at places that would fatten her up. It'd be a helluva coincidence otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she had the whole foot long in her stomach, and she finished off the last of the soda. With a thick belch, she laid back in the lounger and enjoyed the warmth of the sun. She tried to ignore the fullness and how good it felt, focusing on the sun. She basked the lethal rays and tried to take another nap. However, she felt a teeny bit uncomfortable. She'd been wearing the robe for so long that she found her skin needed to breathe. She tried to ignore it, but after fidgeting awkwardly a few times, she finally yanked the robe open and slipped out of the sleeves, and now her naked form lay prone beneath the dome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took a moment to enjoy the warmth now spreading across her body as she took on the sun rays. She closed her eyes, trying not to care how she looked at the moment. She finally couldn't stop looking anymore and peered down at her body. Fairly large breasts, but then, she'd always been busty. Now, of course, her belly overtook them in the race to stick out the furthest. She gazed at the pale dome that rose and fell with every breath across her midsection. How it swelled, inflated, bulged... gurgled... Her meal continued to digest inside of her, making the most curiously cute bubbling sounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around for any security cameras, Donna began to appreciate how alone she was. She gently placed her hands atop her gut and began to rub. It felt so firm yet soft -- jam-packed full of food and drink, with an extra-cushioned layer of flab encasing it. She rubbed it gently up and down, then gave it a few slaps, listening to the smacks reverberate through the big empty room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bit on the plump side, aren't you,\" she murmured to her belly, slapping a light rhythm against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel a small smile tugging at the side of her mouth. If only her mother could see her now. All the men who ever turned her down for being 'too big'. She jiggled and caressed her flab with increasing glee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she pulled out the menu, skimmed through it, selected an extra-large chocolate milkshake and snapped her fingers. It appeared in the cup holder beside her. Her heart racing, she chucked the straw and began to chug it eagerly. The size of the cup required the use of both hands, and she didn't even care as some of it dribbled down the sides of her face. She got at least ninety-five percent in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of what she'd had before, she could feel herself getting fuller. Even before she reached the halfway point, she could feel herself getting far too stuffed to continue. She didn't care. She needed this. At least, she told herself she needed this. All those times her mother denied her sweets, all those times she felt ashamed for looking like herself, she needed to avenge those times and just wallow in some proper gluttony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the cup clattered to the floor beside the lounger -- empty. Donna's stomach simply couldn't hold another drop. It heaved and churned noisily with its new load.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's face, stained with chocolate, sported a dopey smile. She struggled into a sitting position and peered down at her belly's enormity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look at you, Miss Noble,\" she murmured. \"You've really piled it on now, haven't you? Proper pig, that's what you are, eh?\" She grinned mischievously. \"Ooooh, look at how found and <i>fat</i> you are, you naughty little piggy-wiggy!\" She gently jiggled her belly, listening to the cargo shift inside. A tiny hiccup escaped, and she knew she had to hold still. Too much jiggling, and she'd be in real trouble. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands atop her belly, she fell asleep again.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Donna awoke, she could tell it had been much longer this time. The sun had changed position, now a great deal lower than before. She lay in silence, staring up at it, for a few minutes. Then, out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a red light flashing on the lounger's arm. Dimly remembering being told the red light meant something urgent had happened, she pressed the intercom button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Apologies for the interruption, Miss Noble</i>,\" the voice on the other end said, \"<i>but I'm afraid something has happened. Your fellow traveler -- the Doctor? -- has been in some sort of emergency.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt some of that tension return to her shoulders. \"What kind of 'emergency'?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>We're not sure, but it seems the shuttle bus he was traveling on was attacked by some sort of creature. Emergency shuttles have already brought him and the surviving passengers back to the leisure center. He's on his way to you now.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Yeah, thanks. I'll be here for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe immediately got her robe back on, all thoughts from earlier forgotten. Sod her weight and any concerns or pleasures that might come with it -- her friend needed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after she got herself cleaned up, the door slid open, and the Doctor walked in. No stride, no energy, not even a twinkle in his eyes. In fact, his eyes had never looked more lifeless. Almost as if he'd been... broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout missing a beat, Donna closed the distance between them and pulled him into the biggest hug ever. At first, he only halfheartedly returned it, but then, he wrapped both arms around her and squeezed her tightly, holding her as close as he could. She could almost feel the pain he'd been through just from being with him. She rubbed his back soothingly and waited for him to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n****<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly ten minutes, he finally began to talk. Telling the story of how the trip to the sapphire waterfalls had gone so horribly wrong, and how the creature had taken over a passenger, and how everyone had been suspicious of him, and how all his usual methods had been turned against him. And then, to have that <i>thing</i> in his head, stealing his voice, how it had almost manipulated them into killing him. Had it not been for the Hostess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they'd finished talking, he seemed a bit less dead inside, if only for getting it all off his chest. Before she knew it, the Doctor began informing the local authorities of the dangers out there. The creature could very well still be alive. There could even be more of them. Not the best place to build a leisure facility. Best to find some other place. After getting testimonials from the other passengers, they managed to ensure that Midnight Leisure would be shut down for good, saving anyone else from being endangered by the creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair returned to the TARDIS not long after. The Doctor hadn't quite gotten over his ordeal yet. He quietly set the controls and returned them to the vortex. He stood in silence for a long time, but Donna stood by him, not about to abandon him unless he said to. She sat on the jump seat and watched the time rotor rise and fall, her eyes occasionally flitting over to him. Sometimes it amazed her how much of his usual personality turned out to be bluster. Take away all that 'Doctor-y' stuff and, deep down, he's just a regular bloke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter almost an hour of watching him, he finally seemed to come out of whatever thoughts he'd been lost in and started to move slowly around the console, making the odd adjustment and checking the readouts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't look up from the monitor when he spoke. \"Have I ever told you how brilliant you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna snorted, as if by instinct. \"Pfft! Am not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you are,\" he said quietly, finally looking at her. \"I think you're something I've always needed. I've always needed a friend like you.\" He began to walk again. \"Sometimes, I think I only bring people along just so I have someone to be impressed by me. People who make me feel wonderful through their adoration as they lead them through death and carnage... And then, there's you, and you just utterly refuse to be impressed by me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, bemused. \"Well, sorry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's my point! You're the friend I need more than ever, because you don't see me as this unstoppable force of charisma and heroism and brilliant cleverness...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only cuz you're not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see me as... a person. I mean, Rose, she just always seemed to have stars in her eyes, and Martha, well, you've met her -- I think I stamped those stars out a little too well... But then you come along and call me a 'big long streak of alien nothing'...\" He began to smile. \"You're the best friend I've always needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt her heart begin to swell. Not just from the relief that this hadn't ended with an undying declaration of love, but from the eloquence and the thought he'd clearly put into that speech. Had he just spent the last hour mentally practicing that? Damn it, why couldn't he be husband material? So unfair. The only truly decent bloke she'd ever meet, and he's a damn alien with two hearts and doesn't make her heart pound in any way, except when they're running from something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to come up with the words, she got up from the seat and pulled him into another hug. He returned it and held her close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're gonna all right?\" she asked. \"It's okay for you to not be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be all right,\" he assured her. \"Been through so much worse... I just... after what happened, I didn't want to miss the chance to say all that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \"Well, I'm always here whenever you want to heap on the praise,\" she replied, allowing herself a small moment of pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe chuckled and let her go. \"All right,\" he said, straightening his tie as if shouldering himself back together. \"What do you fancy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Change of clothes, for a start,\" Donna chuckled. \"Been in this robe for too long. After that... I dunno. Maybe skip the fancy leisure worlds and find something simple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned. \"I think I can just about manage 'simple'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna shook her head and turned to leave, only to almost trip over something. She looked down and groaned. \"And why is your weird severed-hand-in-a-jar always sitting out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked, then peered down at the hand in question. \"I dunno...,\" he murmured. \"Just... felt like it should be there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because nothing finishes off a room like a severed hand in a bubbling jar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe seemed to consider this for a moment before shrugging. He got a hook from the console and used it to haul up one of the steel meshes that made up the floor, finding a storage cupboard underneath. He took the jar and gently slipped it inside. \"There we are. Out of sight, out of mind,\" he beamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes but smiled gratefully before heading for the wardrobe -- a journey she'd been dreading.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna made it back to the wardrobe room, peering through the clutter and seeking out some clothes. She dug through everything, trying to get her hands on something comfortable. If they really could get to a relaxing place, she needed something she wouldn't be squeezed into. Something that would give her room to breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCertainly a lot of clothes in here -- although most of them were far too small. She guessed that a lot of them belonged to the Doctor's past companions. Did he never travel with anyone plus-sized? Rolling her eyes, she dug out some more clothes, trying to find something that would fit. Infinite storage space -- there had to be something. If not, she'd have to take the Doctor on a shopping trip, and she couldn't bear the thought of trying to take him shopping. He'd be like a kid -- bored out of his skull and more interested in the toy section and begging for a sweet. Last thing she needed right now were sweets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as she came out of another cove of clothes, her eyes fell on something familiar -- her fat jeans. Those trousers had always been her trousers of last resort. Never went anywhere in those unless she had no choice. Grimacing to herself, she went over and began to slip them on under the robe. She got them up to her waist and began to fasten them. Except, she didn't quite, because they wouldn't fasten. There was just too much belly for them to simply button up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, no,\" she moaned sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to see, she slipped the robe off and dropped it on the floor. Now completely topless, she set to work trying to do them up. She sucked in her gut and tried to squeeze them on. The gap shrank, but not quite enough. She took a deep breath and tried to suck it in even more, but it didn't make much difference. She pulled and pulled, but nothing happened. She tripped over the robe and landed on her back in a pile of clothes. Barely noticing, she tried again. Suck in gut, lie on back, fasten the button. Just as simple as one... two... three! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button slipped through the hole and held. She did up the zip. She lay there on her back, feeling smothered by these damn jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who designed jeans, anyway? </i>she wondered. <i>Sadists?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried sitting up, but they squeezed her middle so hard that sitting up straight proved an even bigger challenge than getting the damn things on. She thrashed briefly, hoping to get onto her feet, but the jeans proved too painful for that sort of luxury. She rolled this way and that, trying to get herself upright. She shrieked in fury as the jeans simply refused to let her move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she managed it. She rolled herself backwards, and the opposite momentum catapulted her upright. She sat on her considerable rump and realized her success, letting out a triumphant \"Woo-hoo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe button promptly gave. It shot across the room, vanishing into another pile of clothes. Her belly surged forward, absolutely relieved to breathe and stretch out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna let out a yelp, then stared after the missing button. Her hands rested atop her belly, which she peered down at and positively marveled at how far out it protruded beyond the jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a curious thing happened. She began to laugh. Slowly at first, then a bit louder. She covered her mouth, not sure what was so damn funny, but she supposed it had to do with all the years of worrying about her size, and yet, here she was, finally the biggest she'd ever been, and arguably happier than she'd ever been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted her stomach delightedly and walked around, still in these super-tight jeans, her belly jiggling freely. She found a button-down shirt that clearly didn't belong on someone her size. She promptly slipped it on and held in her stomach as she buttoned it up. Then, standing in front of a full-length mirror, she let out that breath. Her stomach expanded to its true size, and all the buttons went flying. She let out another gasp and laughed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a black vest and repeated the process. Suck in gut, button up, breathe out, buttons fly. Her belly dominated every button she put over it. She laughed like a lunatic and continued the process, finding shirts, vests, skirts, trousers -- and her belly utterly destroyed all of them. Buttons flew, seams ripped, zippers burst -- she didn't know why this was so much fun, but she suspected it to be something cathartic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a good twenty minutes of this, though, the novelty began to wear off. Tired but still giddy, she plodded naked among the sea of ruined clothes and finally came across a much more size appropriate pair of slacks. She slipped them on and buttoned them up, smiling at the way the button easily fastened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure I'll get around to ruining these one day,\" she muttered, giving her belly one more pat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out a light sweater and a long coat to go over them before turning and heading back for the control room.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna made it back to the control room and took it in. The Doctor continued to work at the console, briefly looking up when she came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right!\" he said. \"Let's see if I got this right... Simple! Relaxing! No monsters or aliens or rips in space and time! Just simple relaxation!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to see that he'd started to cheer up, she walked all the way in. \"So where is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grinned and pulled the main lever. They came in for their usual bumpy landing and clutched the railings as the ship settled. He led her down the ramp and opened the doors to a picturesque autumn afternoon. Green grass, orange leaves fluttering around, a river with ducks quacking, and people walking around, laughing, chatting, eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna saw the amount of snacking going on -- hotdogs, hamburgers, ice creams, drinks -- and saw that some sort of festivity taking place up along the sidewalk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"United States,\" he said, \"but I aimed for one of the nicer bits. Nothing fancy -- just gravitated towards a fun evening. This is a little festival this lot have every year. Lots of places to walk, talk, feed ducks, feed fish, feed yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit her lip. It all looked delicious, and the concession stands seemed to go for miles along the river. \"I don't have any money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Hang on.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a plastic payment card. \"There. I've got a bank account somewhere. Go mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mouth fell open as she took it. \"And you're just now telling me about this <i>because</i>...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Off her look, he added, \"And I lost it until last week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked as she took his arm. \"That sounds like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set off into the lovely day ahead of them. As they got further out into this new location, Donna marveled at the catfish that swam just below the surface. The Doctor, naturally, went into a long story about the time he and his friend Peri once saved a race of alien catfish from something called the Goronite, but she zoned in and out of the story. The place was simply too gorgeous to listen. She enjoyed looking around the scenery, listening to music and people talking. Little kids trying to feed the ducks, and their parents having to fish them out of the river afterwards. All the sorts of things she missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, she wouldn't let such a veritable feast go to waste. So many food stalls, so little time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate a cheeseburger while the Doctor made conversation with some ducks. She ate a bag of chips while wading in the shallow water. She drank at least five cans of pop while watching people ice skate in a small rink -- while the Doctor showed off his moves, of course. She ate three hotdogs while they walked the length of the river to see where it all went. She ate two ice cream cones while they watched the sunset over the town. She ate a bag of popcorn while they enjoyed a colored-light show set to music in the town square. She ate another cheeseburger, along with pop and chips, while they sat on a hill and admired the stars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor had gone quiet some time ago, just taking in the world around him, admiring the fun in that way aliens always seemed to find so curious about humans. Donna finished off her burger and washed it all down with one last drink of soda, before lying back, hands atop her stomach. She simply couldn't eat another bite. Her stomach had that jam-packed feeling she'd enjoyed on Midnight, and the once comfortable slacks now felt tight around her middle. She smiled as she took in the view around her. So many people, so much fun to be had, and all of it to be had with her best mate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need more days like this,\" she murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's good, this,\" the Doctor agreed. \"Still, have too much fun, it gets a bit dull.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're not all adrenaline junkies like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, I'll have you know I don't go looking for trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but you have to answer <i>every </i>distress call. Even the ones that turn out to be nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't about the Moonites again, is it? Because there <i>is </i>such a thing -- just not on <i>that </i>particular moon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes but felt too stuffed and bloated to argue. \"Phew,\" she sighed, lying flat on her back. \"I'm exhausted. I could just lie here all night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can try,\" he said, lying down with her. \"Of course, that's up to the park security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let them try to move me. I'll show 'em I'm secure enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled. \"Not touching that one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gave him a mock-annoyed look before leaning back and gazing up at the sky, listening to the lovely digestive soundtrack her stomach provided.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next week was largely spent in the TARDIS. Aside from the odd stop off to look at alien worlds, the Doctor and Donna spent some downtime together. Of course, the time ship had plenty to offer in ways of entertainment. They watched some future television series, particularly enjoying a miniseries called <i>Good Omens</i> -- the Doctor insisted he had <i>nothing </i>to do with production and that snake contacts only made his eyes itch -- and also the 2030 reboot of <i>Last of the Summer Wine</i> -- somehow including every character from the old version in every episode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna appreciated the downtime, and she suspected the Doctor did, too. She tried not to eat <i>too</i> during this time. She made use of the library to reread some of her favorites, and she'd done a few laps in the swimming pool in the interest of getting at least <i>some </i>exercise. She didn't know why they felt the need to go somewhere fancy like Midnight -- the TARDIS often seemed like a futuristic leisure center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it also had a gym with workout equipment, but for some reason, Donna just couldn't bring herself to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, one day, the Doctor announced he'd found another planet that would give them some fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shan Shen!\" he announced. \"Brilliant place! Been here a couple of times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been here with Martha?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, long before Martha. Lifetimes. I was a different man back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna frowned briefly but let it go. \"So what's it like, this Shan Shen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor threw the lever, and they felt the TARDIS land. \"See for yourself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gasped when she looked outside. They'd landed in an alleyway decorated with flags and pagodas, with lots of Chinese-style writing on them. People -- possibly human -- milled around in what appeared to be some kind of celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, brilliant!\" she exulted. \"This place is amazing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it is!\" the Doctor said as they stepped outside, pulling the door shut behind him. \"Shan Shen -- land of opportunity!\" He frowned briefly. \"And okay, yes, an old enemy said that as a way of tricking me out of my exile on Earth, but whatever -- it's still true!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey walked into the crowd and admired all the stalls and fun. Wooden stalls, crates, barrels, cages of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are those real chickens?!\" Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I believe they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked up at the sky, which looked fairly blue except for all the other planets she could clearly see. \"So are these people human?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them, yes. Shan Shen is largely a trading post, but we've landed during one of their many celebrations. Always something to celebrate on Shan Shen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna greatly enjoyed this place. They chatted with a few stallholders, who had loads of stories to tell about their products. Some sold clothing, some sold knickknacks, some sold animals... and, of course, some sold food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, Donna eagerly sampled plenty of the local cuisine. She tried to limit herself to small portions, but a little could go a long way. Certain meats and cheeses, plenty of exotic fruits, and some frothy sugary drink that left her with a foam mustache -- so many different flavors, and all of them delicious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point, she noticed the Doctor had become enraptured with some sea urchins at another stall. Smiling fondly at his enthusiasm, she left him to it and looked around, hoping to maybe find another snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell your fortune, lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna turned and saw a young dark-skinned woman standing in a doorway, giving her an intriguing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The future predicted. Your life foretold,\" she continued with all the charm of a used car salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thanks,\" Donna replied politely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you want to know? If you're going to be happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna continued to force a polite smile. \"I'm happy right now, thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got red hair. The reading's free, for red hair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, this woman was relentless. But Donna felt suspicious. If she didn't want money...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, all right, then,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe followed the woman through the doorway, and found herself in a dark room, shrouded with drapes; incense in the air; the walls just broken concrete, like this downtown society had built itself into abandoned warehouses and tenements. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sat across from each other at a small table. The Fortune Teller took Donna's hands and breathed in deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh you're fascinating,\" she breathed. \"No, but you're <i>good</i>. I can see... a man. The most remarkable man.  How did you meet him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna raised an eyebrow. \"You're supposed to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the future. Tell me the past. When did your lives cross?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of complicated. I ended up in his spaceship on my wedding day. Long story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere behind her, she thought she heard a quiet noise -- somewhere near the floor -- that went <i>hissss-tic-tic-tic</i>, but she dismissed it as coming from the marketplace outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fortune Teller continued. \"But what led you to that meeting?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna thought back. \"Well.  All sorts of things, but... My job, I suppose. It was on Earth, this planet called Earth. Miles away. But I had this job, as a temp, I was a secretary, in a place called H.C. Clements - \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, images of her working at H.C. Clements slammed into her mind, causing her to reel briefly from the mental impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa... Sorry,\" she breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fortune Teller smiled. \"It's the incense. Betters the memory. Just breathe deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scuttling noise behind her sounded a bit closer now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D'you ever think...?\" the Fortune Teller asked, regaining her attention. \"What if you'd never met this man? If your life had taken a different path?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I got lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But was there ever a choice? This job of yours. What choices led you there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There <i>was </i>a choice. Six months before. Cos the agency offered me a contract at H.C. Clements... but there was this other job, my mother knew this man...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the flashbacks of her mother telling her about another job at a different place, with better money and opportunities...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your life could have gone one way, or the other. What made you decide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I just did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But when was the moment, the precise moment? When did you choose??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's mind filled with images -- the car, her mother nagging her, turn left or right... She'd turned left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned left. But what if you'd turned right? What then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the incense couldn't disguise the fact that this meeting was going very wrong. Donna tried to wrench herself free, but the Fortune Teller held tight. The hissing and ticking behind her got louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if it changes? What if you go <i>right</i>? What if you could still go right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever hissed and ticked seemed to be right in her ear now as something landed on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?! What's on my back? What is it? What's on my back??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make the choice again, Donna Noble, and change your mind, turn right! Turn right! <i>Turn right!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt that choice before her all over again... and the world changed around her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"<i>Bad Wolf</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words echoed in Donna's mind as she came out of it. They faded into the background as a loud hissing and clicking made her look back and spot the large Time Beetle that kicked and screeched as it died. \"What the hell is that?!\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fortune Teller cowered in a corner at the sight of her. \"You were so strong...,\" she whimpered. \"What are you? What will you be?!\" She scuttled off into the darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, the Doctor arrived and, upon seeing the beetle, explained it belonged to something called 'the Trickster's Brigade'. Apparently, it had reached back along her timeline and changed her personal history, creating a parallel world around her, and but she'd been strong enough to fight and changed things back. Donna, however, couldn't shake something as she tried to remember that world -- a blonde woman telling her that the \"darkness\" was coming, and those two words: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad Wolf... What does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the blonde woman was Rose Tyler, and 'Bad Wolf' meant the end of the universe, so the Doctor and Donna fled Shan Shen and went to check on the Earth, only to find everything the same as they'd left it. However, when they popped back inside, the planet disappeared. With little choice if they wanted to find it again, they headed for the Shadow Proclamation; basically a sort of space police. After a chat with some albino women and talking rhinos with guns, they found that twenty-four planets had disappeared in total, and then, they realized three more from different times. With twenty-seven planets, it seemed they would be used for some kind of engine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, when Donna made mention that the bees were disappearing, the Doctor realized they could use the Taconda Scale to follow the planets. They followed the trail in the TARDIS, only to find that it ended at the Medusa Cascade. For a moment, it seemed hopeless they would ever find the planets, but then, Martha's cellphone started ringing. Instead of her voice, they heard a signal being transmitted. Straight away, they managed to get inside the Cascade -- it was a second out of sync with the rest of the universe, making it the perfect hiding place -- and got in touch with their callers: Captain Jack Harkness, Martha Jones and Sarah Jane Smith, who reported that the Daleks -- whoever they were -- had taken the planets for some reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen filled with static, and a sinister voice that apparently knew the Doctor spoke. The feed switched to an emaciated man with a glowing robot eye and in a futuristic wheelchair thing covered in silver bumps. This man, Davros, had created the Daleks from cells of his own body, and he had been saved from the Time War by something called Dalek Caan -- a weird-looking squid-like thing that cackled and flailed inside a destroyed Dalek casing. The Doctor, however, cut the call short and set the TARDIS in motion for Earth. They would find his friends and set to work on beating them. Donna knew he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey landed in a deserted London street. Stepping into the night air, they stared at the empty streets, cars and litter scattered everywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a ghost town,\" Donna murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah Jane said they were taking the people,\" said the Doctor. He rounded on her. \"Think, Donna! When you met Rose in that parallel world, what did she say to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just 'the darkness is coming'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna started to reply, but then, she saw a familiar blonde at the far end of the street. \"Why don't you ask her yourself?\" she asked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked confused for a moment, but then, he followed her eye-line and spotted her. For a moment, he didn't do anything. Then, he began to run. From the other end, Rose began to run as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna watched on with a smile. Perhaps due to all those soppy romance novels she read, she loved a star-crossed reunion like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, when they were almost to each other, a voice rang out, \"EXTERMINATE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA blue bolt of laser shot through the air, and it glanced the Doctor's side, lighting up his body in a sad blue flare. He fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp of horror, Donna began running. It proved difficult, but even with her extra heft, she wasn't about to let it slow her down now. She saw another bolt of laser from the opposite direction, but this one was white and fired by that Captain Jack bloke. The Dalek exploded in flame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got there, Rose was already cradling the Doctor and begging him not to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get him back to the TARDIS! Quick!\" Captain Jack ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Donna hoisted the shivering Doctor up and half-dragged him back to the TARDIS. Jack covered them with both his and Rose's guns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce back inside, they unloaded him on the floor. Donna's panic began to take control of her mouth. \"What do we do?!\" she nearly wept. \"There must be some medicine or something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just step back,\" said Jack calmly. He looked to Rose. \"Rose -- do as I say and get back! He's dying, and you know what happens next!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Rose wailed. \"I came all this way...!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, however, felt a grain of hope in Jack's words. \"Whatcha mean? What happens next?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor grunted in pain on the floor, and then he held his hand up. To Donna's shock, it began to glow with golden energy. \"It's starting!\" he gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed Rose and dragged her to safety on the other side of the console. \"Here we go! Good luck, Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will someone please tell me what is going on?!\" Donna demanded, shouting at the world because no one was listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose managed to regain some composure. \"When he's dying,\" she choked, \"his body... it repairs itself. It changes.\" She broke again. \"But you can't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor regarded her sadly. \"I'm sorry. It's too late,\" he struggled to say, as if holding something back. \"I'm regenerating!\"</span></div></div>",

I'm dying, so my whole body is changing. I'm just... ugh... holding it back to...\" His head dropped briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to raise his head again. \"... to say good bye,\" he finished with a sad smile. \"Just... things I wanted to say... while I still have this voice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna could feel the tears coming. \"But... you're gonna be okay, right?\" she whimpered. \"I mean, even if you change, you'll still be you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tapped his forehead. \"I will be in here, where it counts. Just trust me, all right? Don't give up on me. Because I've changed. Promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded, still crying. \"I won't,\" she replied, her voice thick with sorrow. \"I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled, the energy slowly burning creeping up his face again. \"Right then,\" he said, stepping away from them. \"For real this time.\" He took a deep breath, flashed a determined smile and let the fire take him. \"Allons-y!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face and hands lit up in volcanic bursts of gold, causing her to bury her face in Jack's chest. She tried to watch, but it was far too bright. It seemed to on for ages, but soon, the light faded away, and a moment later, she could see again. She blinked before looking over at the Doctor. He stood with her back to them, but right away, she could see how different he'd become. Taller, nowhere near as skinny, crazy strawberry blonde hair -- a whole new man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe new Doctor made a face as if he were chewing something he didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New voice,\" he said at last. \"Tastes weird...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis legs gave out, and he went crashing to the metal floor, landing in an unconscious heap. Donna ran to his side in an instant, followed by Jack. He began checking him all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he all right?!\" she asked urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack checked the Doctor's pulse. \"Hearts are still beating. Thing about regeneration is -- it can shake up the brain cells a little. Might cause temporary amnesia, mood swings, light coma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's him, isn't it? I mean, he <i>is </i>the Doctor, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put a hand on her shoulder to reassure her. \"Yes, Donna, I promise -- he is the Doctor. Tell her, Rose.\" At the blonde woman's silence, he looked up. \"Rose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Rose just looked catatonic, staring straight ahead with no emotion in her eyes, her tear-streaked face absolutely blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got up and gently shook her shoulders. \"Rose, I'm sorry, but we need your head in the game. I know it hurts, but he's still here. Right in front of you. And he needs us right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose closed her eyes, squeezing out a few more tears, but she nodded and walked over to join Donna by the Doctor. Gently, they rolled him over so he was flat on his back, and they took in his new face. A bit younger, although not much. Fresh face, some freckles, bushier sideburns, very pale -- and the suit really didn't fit anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor...?\" Rose ventured. \"Doctor, it's me. I'm here. Please, wake up. We need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looked like she would start to cry again, but she also looked a little angry. \"Doctor, please. Daleks are invading. People are dying. We need you right now.\" She paused. \"I need you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna didn't like just doing nothing, so she leaned in closer as well. \"Doctor, come on, you great big dumbo. You're not about to let those ugly tin cans win, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, nothing. Then... the Doctor's face screwed up in a wince as he put a hand to his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor, are you all right?\" Rose asked urgently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm fine, thank you, Susan,\" he replied, eyes still not open yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose looked mildly put out, but Jack quickly reassured her. \"Like I said. Brain's a bit shaken up. Give him time. He'll be all right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right, Jamie,\" the Doctor said, rubbing his face. \"Just need a moment to gather my thoughts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he lowered his eyes and looked right at Donna. She saw that his eyes had changed from dark brown to a sort of bluish-green. He looked at her with a foreboding brow, as if absorbing every last thing about her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asked warily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stared a moment longer, and then he smiled. \"Much better now, Donna. Thank you,\" he said, unaware that Rose looked indignant behind him. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna squinted her eyes suspiciously at him. \"You're really the Doctor?\" she asked. \"Prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought for a moment, and then he smiled again. \"One day -- one of the saddest days of my life -- I thought I would never be happy again. But then, I looked up, and there was this woman in my TARDIS, wearing a wedding dress. She turned around, and the first thing she said to me was...\" He made a high-pitched indignant squeak. \"And then, in return, I said, 'What?!'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, it <i>is </i>you,\" Donna breathed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SLAP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Jack winced as her hand collided with his face, making him stagger back in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that for?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For not telling me you could just change bodies like that! That's important to know, you dunce!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sorry, but it's not an easy thing to talk about! Ugh -- that was a brand new cheek you've just slapped, and now it's gonna go all red!\" Then, his eyes widened. \"Ooh, red! That reminds me! Very important! Matter of life and death!\" He took a very serious tone. \"Am I... ginger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared, then glanced at his hair. \"... Sort of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, 'sort of'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's sort of... blondish-red. Sort of... strawberry blonde.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe considered this for a moment, then began to smile. \"Well! That's all right then! Probably because of you and... her...,\" he said, gesturing vaguely to Rose, who looked rather put out again. \"Blonde and ginger together -- rubs off!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, and you got your accent from Captain Jack?\" she smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned. \"Accent? Have I got an accent? Doesn't sound -- ohhhhh I hear it now! American! I've gone American!\" He looked a bit nauseous now. \"Ugh, does this mean I'm going to become all condescending and entitled?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna began to laugh, and then he began to laugh, too. Then, she noticed Rose and Jack had been standing off to the side, looking a little left out, so she gently turned him around to face them. \"Er, Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor calmed his giggling and seemed to notice the other two for the first time. \"Ah! Yes! Hello!\" He looked intensely at Jack. \"Haven't we met somewhere before? ...Julius Caesar...? No, too tall... Newton? No...\" Then he smiled -- he had it. \"Oh yes! Captain Jack Harkness! How are you?\" he asked, immediately shaking the other man's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, thanks,\" Jack replied, beginning to smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor noticed Rose. \"And Rose Tyler! Welcome back! Good to see you again!\" Then, without even really waiting for a response, he looked to Jack again, perplexed. \"Now then... what was I doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the lights went down, plunging them into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes,\" he said in the gloom. \"Daleks.\"</span></div></div>",

He was just so\u2026 different!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stood at the controls, leaning against the console and looking lost in thought. It had been thirty-six minutes since they\u2019d left Bad Wolf Bay - a decidedly bittersweet affair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all could\u2019ve been much worse, she kept telling herself. The universe nearly ended. Major not good averted. Everyone on the team survived. Sarah Jane returned to her son, Captain Jack to Torchwood, and Martha and Mickey\u2026 to do whatever they were going to do. She recalled the smile on the Doctor\u2019s face as he\u2019d bid them farewell, hugs and all. She smirked as she remembered Sarah Jane\u2019s admonishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cDon\u2019t go changing again before next time! It\u2019s getting difficult to keep up!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered whether Rose rejected him because of that. Those changes, they took getting used to. Donna still kept glancing, waiting to see if it turned out that an imposter now roamed the TARDIS and she found her Doctor locked in a cupboard somewhere. She listened for any knocks on the walls, but nothing. Anyway, he seemed to know what he was doing, so she left him to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah Jane\u2019s words of reassurance gave her comfort. <i>\u201cSometimes, you look at him, and you can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the same man. You feel like you lost someone. But then, after a while, you realize, you didn\u2019t lose anyone. You\u2019ve just met the same person a second time. Or, in my case, a third or fourth, but the point still stands.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered Jack\u2019s assurances as the new Doctor struggled to walk in his now-super-tight suit. She remembered Mickey laughing that he\u2019d \u2018gone and done it again\u2019. She remembered Jackie asking him if he wanted a cup of tea to \u2018help the ions or whatever\u2019. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also remembered Rose\u2019s heartbreak. Rose\u2019s silence. Rose\u2019s coldness. Oh, she got on with saving the universe, fine, but she hadn\u2019t said a word to him once they boarded the TARDIS to tow the Earth home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMartha gave him a brief physical on the way home, but she overall took the change in her stride. Apparently, she met another Time Lord (not so dead after all, eh, Spaceman) and witnessed him regenerate, so she at least knew about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to know about it, but it\u2019s another thing to live through it. Still, it\u2019s not so bad. Sometimes, I look into his eyes, and I think I can see him.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna couldn\u2019t see his eyes right now. The Doctor disappeared under the console to work on it. Just a distraction to get his mind off it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce on the beach, Jackie gave Donna a hug and said goodbye, then hugged the Doctor, who smiled sheepishly and apologized for never having dinner with her. Old joke, probably. Rose, however, said goodbye to them, took one last look around the TARDIS, then turned and left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glanced across at the Doctor before he snapped his fingers and shut the doors, pulling the lever that took them back into the vortex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDefinitely a day for surprises. The surprise from the Supreme Dalek when the Doctor stepped out of the TARDIS with Rose and Donna, wearing a new face. The surprise from Davros when the TARDIS materialized safe and sound in the Vault, piloted by Captain Jack, who immediately kept him at bay while Sarah Jane and Mickey freed them. Surprise from Martha when she found she wouldn\u2019t need the Osterhagen Key after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Dalek Caan expressed surprise at how his prophecies got away from him, but he simply giggled madly and expressed joy that \u201cdeath has been averted\u201d, whatever that meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite all the fun they had destroying the Reality Bomb and pushing the Daleks around, the light never really entered Rose\u2019s eyes again. Donna attempted to talk to her during the flight home, but it wasn\u2019t until they were en route to the parallel world that she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cMy Doctor is dead. I know it\u2019s supposed to be the same man, but it\u2019s really not. No matter what he says, he\u2019s so\u2026 different\u2026 He\u2019s</i> not<i> my Doctor. He\u2019s literally not the man I fell in love with.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked over at the Doctor. Huge feet sticking out of the console, working on the wiring or something, he remained quiet. So unnatural. Used to be when he was upset, he raced around the control room, trying to outrun his sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence unnerved her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got up from the jumpseat and sat cross legged next to him on the grated floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe poked his head out briefly before resuming his work. \u201cHey,\u201d he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou all right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c... No.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded. Not even trying to hide it. Something she could work with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatcha working on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZyton Crystals. Seems they got a bit fried towing Earth.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gently placed a hand on his leg, and he stopped working. He didn\u2019t look up, but he stopped working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe just doesn\u2019t understand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know. It\u2019s just\u2026 everybody else did. Why didn\u2019t she?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna gently tugged on his plaid button-down shirt - which she\u2019s totally going to make him change out of later - and made him sit up and look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf she can\u2019t accept it, then she was never really in love with you anyway,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cShe just\u2026 wasn\u2019t the right one for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, he looked up, but the eyes looked less sad, and the boyish twinkle returned. She really <i>could </i>see him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slammed shut the console and got to his feet, groaning as he did. \u201cOooof, I tell ya. This metal grating makes a lousy floor\u2026 You know, I think it\u2019s time I made some changes around here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh goody, more changes,\u201d she sighed. \u201cGonna get a proper sofa in here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I was thinking of replacing the metal, the grime, the coral and maybe getting something with wood paneling. Maybe a smaller console. Might make flying it less hectic. Save energy for running from monsters\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked around the giant control room with dread. She didn\u2019t like the idea of DIY-ing the TARDIS, but whatever got him up and running again. \u201cWell, you know what we need if we\u2019re going to rebuild?\u201d She smiled. \u201cDoughnuts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyebrows rose in surprise. \u201cDoughnuts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh God, yes, and fresh ones. I\u2019m so famished, I could eat a dozen chocolate iced with sprinkles. Can we find a doughnut shop somewhere?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stared at her, and then he laughed, heading for the controls, nabbing his new wide-brimmed fedora off the stand and wrapping his scarf around his neck. \u201cCome on then, Miss Noble! I know an excellent doughnut joint on Bandraginous Five! More rainbow sprinkles than you can stick a shake at!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShake a stick at,\u201d she corrected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy would I want to shake a stick? Come on!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. This seemed like the re-starting of a beautiful friendship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna stepped out of the TARDIS and took in Bandraginus Five. Purple sky, with the celestial system of many nearby planets -- presumably Bandraginuses One thru Four, and maybe a Six -- with the odd shuttlecraft zooming overhead. People with rough humanoid shapes -- save for the extra limb or two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stepped out behind her, locking the door as he did. \"Ahhh, just as I remember it!\" he said cheerfully. \"Unless we've arrived before last time. In which case, it's just as I'm going to experience it later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, it's great,\" she said. \"When is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuck his tongue out as if licking the air. \"Tastes like 6043,\" he said at last. \"Fairly quiet time in the planet's history.\" He gave the air another taste. \"Possible chances of rain in the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at him for a long moment. \"You can actually taste the air and know what year it is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. Depends on the tongue. Clearly, this one has a more refined palette than the old one.\" Then, his eyes lit up. \"Oooh! Doughnut shop! That way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hooked her arm and led her towards a small building that stood alone on the street and took her through the door. Donna felt annoyed -- he had longer legs now and keeping up with his pace felt exhausting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, arriving in the doughnut shop made it all worth it. After the universe nearly ended, she could very much go for some sweet sugary confectioneries right about now. She saw them lined up neatly in the display -- so many different kinds! Glazed, chocolate iced, sprinkles, crullers, custard-filled, creme-filled, raspberry-filled...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" she breathed. \"Just... there's just so many!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Paralyzed by indecision,\" the Doctor chuckled. \"I felt the same way when picking out a new scarf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant behind the counter walked up to them. \"Have you decided on your choice of doughnut, ma'am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna thought for a moment as she looked over what the place had to offer. She could feel the longing in her empty stomach as her taste buds cried out for everything. Her eyes glanced up at the menu options and scanned it: <i>Single Doughnut, Three-Pack Doughnuts, Half a Dozen, A Dozen, The Challenge</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's 'The Challenge'?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant smiled. \"That's the promotional offer we give. We have fifteen kinds of doughnuts, y'see, and if you can finish one of each kind, then you only have to pay for the price of a Single.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna mouth fell open in shock. \"That's an option?! Bloody hell - has anyone ever managed it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a few, depending on species. What do you think, miss? Are you up to the Challenge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at the Doctor, who looked back at her with a shrug. \"Up to you,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can manage? I mean... I dunno, it's a bit daunting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So was defeating the Daleks, but you managed that. I have every faith in you.\" He grinned. \"But then, I think you're brilliant, so maybe I'm biased,\" he added with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded, then turned back to the attendant. \"Challenge accepted,\" she said coolly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attendant nodded eagerly, then began to direct them to a table. \"It'll be along shortly,\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna pushed her chair back a bit to give her belly some room. \"I'm gonna regret this tomorrow,\" she muttered, \"but you know what -- I deserve this. I helped save the universe from a bunch of plunger-wielding pepper pots. I should splurge now and again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the Doctor. He pulled out a bottled water. \"Here -- just to help you wash it down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took it and marveled that it was still cold. \"How...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a fridge in my coat pocket.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or maybe I nabbed it before we left the TARDIS.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes but smiled. She had to appreciate how much a regular bloke he seemed to be now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, a server arrived with fifteen doughnuts -- each a different kind -- and set the tray down on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are simple,\" said the server. \"All fifteen doughnuts must be consumed. No help from friends. You have one hour to finish. Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took a deep breath and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe server set a stop watch. \"All right. You may begin.\" She turned and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at the small pyramid of doughnuts. So many different kinds. She started with the top one -- an original glazed -- and munched away at it. She finished it in nothing flat, and then plucked out the chocolate iced one. It didn't exactly sound like a lot. Fifteen doughnuts -- sounded easy enough. But she knew deep down the difference between fifteen doughnuts and, say, fifteen crisps. Doughnuts filled you up quicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finished the chocolate-iced and picked up a vanilla-iced. Surprisingly, it tasted very good. She'd always been a hardcore chocolate girl. Felt like betraying chocolate to admit vanilla tasted just as good. She finished that one and grabbed the custard-filled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor sat obediently on the other side of the small table, glancing out the window every so often while she pigged out. She wondered what must be going through his head while she did this. Probably something about how Time Lords would never degrade themselves like this and how small humans could be sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he spoke. \"I remember the last time I changed,\" he murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna had just wiped the last bit of custard from her mouth. \"... What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time, when I became pinstripes and trainers. I had to absorb the time vortex itself out of Rose. That's where the whole Bad Wolf thing came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked as she picked up the sprinkled doughnut and began to eat it. \"How's that cause 'Bad Wolf'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, with the power of the time vortex, she could send the message to herself throughout time and tell herself what to do. Stable time loop. So she broke into the TARDIS console and used the power of the vortex to destroy the Daleks. Also accidentally made Captain Jack immortal. Very human. Couldn't control it. So I took the power from her, and also took her death, causing me to regenerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at him for a long moment. \"Blimey,\" she said as she swallowed down the latest doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, he started talking about some of the other times he changed. Old age, forced by the Time Lords, radiation from a crystal cave, a nasty fall, Spectrox Toxamia, beams of radiation from the Rani... Didn't seem like he had any quiet or peaceful deaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround the time he described his seventh regeneration -- which he seemed to regard as a rather embarrassing one -- she realized she had gotten through twelve doughnuts. She hadn't really noticed just how stuffed she felt. Only three more to go! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she began to think -- maybe that's why he had started his stories: to distract her from feeling too full to finish. She felt a bit silly, taking that long to figure it out, but hey ho, it'd worked. She picked up a cruller and slowly shoved it into her mouth. Her belly already bulged so far forward, it almost pressed against the table. She got the cruller down and groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god...,\" she moaned, gently hefting her swollen belly in her hands. \"I don't think I can do this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pfft,\" the Doctor replied. \"I think you can do anything. You're not gonna let a couple doughnuts slow you down, are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned, rubbing her stomach and taking a sip of water. Just a couple more. She took a few deep breaths and braced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the maple-iced one. Never been a favorite, but she could fake it if she could just get through it. She chomped down on it, not letting a single crumb go to waste. Her stomach gurgled angrily at the addition, stretching even more as she swallowed it down. Her head lolled back as she let out a groan. She rubbed her stomach miserably and regarded the final doughnut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChocolate-iced creme-filled. One of the best doughnuts known to man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor checked his watch. \"Five minutes left,\" he warned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna whimpered. The doughnut sat there, taunting her. She didn't know if she could bring herself to reach down and finish it, but she knew what would happen if she didn't. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna moaned softly, but she forced herself to pick up the damn doughnut. She took it, took a bite, and relished the creamy filling. So gooey and sugary. She enjoyed the buzz it gave her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also felt her stomach gurgle in protest. She really wished she'd worn a dress, or at least an elastic waistband. She wailed sadly through her full mouth as she made herself swallow down the first bite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor checked his watch. \"Two minutes,\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna glared at him but said nothing. She steeled her resolve and continued taking bites out of the doughnut, chewing slowly and carefully, too afraid to eat it too fast. She felt like she would pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw the look in the Doctor's eyes. That look that always encouraged people to be better than who they were, that could make anyone believe they were capable of greater things. That look that he always gave her when she needed that last bit of encouragement, be that fighting alien monsters like Sontarans or Daleks, or doing something ordinary like standing up to her mother or... eating doughnuts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSteeling her resolve, she took the last half of the doughnut and shoved the whole thing in her mouth. She chewed, took a swig of water and swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" cheered the Doctor excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna slumped back in her chair, her enormous stomach protruding far in front of her. She let out a sigh of relief, and almost immediately, the button gave, and the Doctor effortlessly snatched it out of the air before it hit his forehead. He didn't even look the slightest annoyed. He looked downright proud! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done, Donna! I knew you could do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at him incredulously. She'd just almost caused him to regenerate again, and he seemed so much like a proud parent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serve came over and let out a whistle. \"Very impressive!\" she said. \"Don't see a lot of human stomachs that can handle all that! Here's your prize!\" She handed Donna a coupon. \"Just show that whenever you're here, and you get free doughnuts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh, very handy!\" said the Doctor. \"Makes it all worth it, eh, Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna tried to glare at him, but he was just adorable sometimes, so she allowed a small smile. \"Yeah, worth it,\" she gasped. \"Great doughnuts. Now... I need to lie down for about a thousand years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded and helped her out of her chair, bidding farewell to the staff as they clapped for her. She waved halfheartedly and leaned on him as they made it out the door and crossed the street back to the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I daresay this is another planet where you'll go down as a legendary hero,\" he said, pausing to put his hat on the stand before helping her the rest of the way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, t'rrific,\" she muttered. \"Oh god, too much sugar. I need a break. Just need to... find somewhere to... sleep it off...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then,\" said the Doctor, guiding her towards the interior door. \"Just trust the TARDIS -- she'll guide you to your room -- and get some shuteye, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Sorry, I'm about to collapse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Goodnight, Donna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. G'night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving him in the control room, she made her way deeper into the ship. She could feel a tiny little nudge in the back of her mind, probably the TARDIS sending her in the right direction. At last, she found her room. Filled with relief, she kicked off her shoes and struggled out of her trousers, tossing them aside. She peered down at her belly. It protruded as if she'd swallowed a bowling ball. It felt so soft yet firm. She looked at herself in the mirror over her makeup table and couldn't help but marvel at how huge she'd become. She slid out of her top and stood in her underwear, admiring her bulging curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blimey,\" she murmured. \"Turning into a right tub o' lard, aren't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran her hands up and down her bodacious hips, and turned to examine her profile. Her belly bulged, her breasts sagged, and her butt wobbled furiously with every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt a mischievous smile split her face. How would she hide all this from her mother?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gluttonous overeating overstuffed pig,\" she murmured, rubbing her stomach before the mirror. \"Just look what you've gone and done. Mother would never approve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know where all this came from, but it felt so good. To be out from under her mother's thumb, to be free from societal norms for a while... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly settled onto the bed. To think she'd only been in Shan Shen this morning, happily gorging her way through the stalls. Then, of course, Time Beetle, Rose Tyler, Bad Wolf, Daleks, regeneration, Davros, etc, all happened, and with fifteen doughnuts filling up her stomach, she needed to sleep. She stripped out of the rest of her underwear and slid her bloated body into bed, which felt extra-comfortable thanks to her exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand on her belly, she fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen later she awoke...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna found some much bigger jeans in her closet and quietly thanked the TARDIS for preparing them. She got on a pullover and a jacket, did her hair up a bit, and then made tracks for the control room. After everything that happened in the last few days, she felt like relaxing for a bit. Her belly jiggled horizontally and vertically as she waddled up the long hexagonal corridors of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she briefly thought she'd entered the wrong room. Then, she saw the central column in the center and realized she'd got it right -- the room had somehow changed. Gone were the grated floors, coral struts and domed walls. In their place, she saw wood paneling and stained glass windows. The police box doors led from a long narrow pathway that stretched down a raised platform that met the main console, which sat on another wider platform, that then linked with the interior door she stood in. To her left stretched another raised pathway that led to a library with books, lamps and a couple chairs. To her left stretched a spiral staircase, the bottom of which led to another section beneath the main console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor emerged from this underside, in his shirt and vest with thick rubber gloves and a pair of goggles. He hummed a jaunty tune until he saw her and smiled. \"Donna! Good morning! Sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stared at him, then at the control room, and then back at him. \"How the hell long was I asleep?!\" she exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe frowned, then realized what she was talking about. \"Oh, this? You think <i>you're</i> tripping. I swear, I was only gone for five minutes, and here we are.\" He tilted his head. \"Don't you like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked at it again. Indeed, it was very pretty. Definitely cleaner than the grubby organic-looking control room he'd had before. Something spooky about it, but also kind of... cozy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Still need to turn the heat up,\" she said, walking inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe let out an annoyed grunt before taking off the gloves and goggles and making for the controls. \"Well, I just got the thermo-couplings set up, so we should be ready to resume traveling. Anyplace in mind today?\" he asked, already working at the console.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna took a moment to note the console was much smaller than the old one. Perhaps he'd be able to fly it without having to dash about the room like a maniac. \"I'd like to go home,\" she told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, alarmed. Then, he took a moment, and then asked, \"For a visit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled in amusement. \"Yeah, I'm not done with you yet, Spaceman. I just need to check in on them. They sounded all right on the phone, but it'd be good to see them again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled. \"Right. Off to Chiswick. I'll aim for an hour after the Earth returned home.\" He set the controls and the new time rotor rose and fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes later, they felt the TARDIS bump into a landing, and he grabbed his hat and scarf as they headed for the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! How do I look?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna looked him up and down with a shrug. \"You look fine. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's their first time seeing me with this face. Wanna make a good second first impression.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rolled her eyes fondly. \"We'll try and explain what happened, all right? They'll come around. Plus, Mum knows you're an alien now, so maybe that'll widen her narrow little mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor gave a small smile before straightening his jacket. \"Right then, let's get going.\" He snapped his fingers, and the doors popped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show off,\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always,\" he replied cheerfully, doffing his hat briefly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey set out into the warm summer air and walked up the street to her house. The Doctor took one last moment to get himself ready before following her up the steps to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rang the bell. She heard her granddad yelling her name as his footsteps clomped up to the door and yanked it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's my girl!\" cheered Wilf, pulling her into a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gramps!\" she said, hugging him right back. \"Everyone all right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, 'course we are,\" he replied, holding her tight. \"Everyone's fine.\" He looked over her shoulder. \"Oh, hello,\" he said. \"Who's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna braced herself. \"Granddad...,\" she said slowly. \"This is the Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor politely raised his hat in greeting. \"Hello again, Wilfred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilf stared at him in stunned silence. \"Doctor...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donna!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna jumped at the familiar voice, but she saw the relieved smile on her mother's face and melted. She pulled her mother into a huge hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my girl, my sweet girl, thank god you're home,\" she squealed, rocking her back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, mum. I'm fine,\" Donna laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Sylvia glanced over her shoulder. \"Who's he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She says it's the Doctor,\" said Wilf, still looking spellbound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello!\" said the Doctor, raising his hat once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be ridiculous!\" said Sylvia. \"How can he be the Doctor?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he sort of got... shot by a Dalek,\" said Donna, \"but it's okay because he can regenerate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that even mean?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means when his old body dies, he can change into a new... not-dying body. He just looks a bit different, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all stared at him again, and he simply smiled and raised his hat a third time. \"Hello!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilf finally shrugged. \"Well, if our Donna says it's the Doctor, that's good enough for me. Come on in, Doctor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled and followed him into the house, putting his hat on the rack as they went into the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stood next to Sylvia before glancing at her again, wondering what her mother would say. The usual stern expression was replaced with one of genuine concern. After another moment, her mother found her voice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Shall we get dinner started?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked as her mother turned and headed for the kitchen. She was suggesting food? Now? She looked down at herself. Nice though these clothes were, they didn't really disguise the fact that she'd gained a lot of weight since the last time she'd seen her mother. Normally, there'd be at least a moment to criticize her size. She wondered if her mother felt all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNevertheless, she followed her into the kitchen, finding the place to already have a decent amount of food prepared. A casserole, a couple chocolate cream pies, steamed vegetables, and now she was putting together a lasagna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Donna. \"What's all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Sylvia sighed as she finished putting the lasagna together, \"I needed something to do while waiting for you to come home, so I guess I got carried away. Still, what's one night, eh? Survived the end of the world. Ought to celebrate that, at least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled as she came over to help. She sliced up peppers and added them to the sauce Sylvia made. \"So... you're okay with it, then? I mean... me, traveling with the Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSylvia scoffed. \"No, of course, I'm not. I'd rather you be here where it's safer. I just... the thought of you out there, when there are monsters like the Daleks, and I'd have no way of knowing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna bit her lip. \"Mum, I promise we don't go looking for trouble. It's just that... sometimes we come across people right in the thick of it, and they need help, and we can't just turn our backs on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just promise me you'll be careful, luv,\" said Sylvia. \"And call a bit more frequently. If only to tell me what you're up to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled. \"I'll definitely try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Now, come on. Need to get this finished.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded and helped her finish the lasagna. It all looked so good, she briefly wondered if she could eat it all herself. She didn't know if she ought to hold back or not. With her mother in a rare forgiving mood, maybe it would be safe to pig out just a bit more than usual. Of course, she had no way of knowing whether or not this attitude would last very long. She could start eyeing the portions Donna took and making comments. But did that really matter? Should she be so worried?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Twenty minutes later, dinner was ready, and Donna knew she'd never be able to resist gorging herself silly. Might as well take advantage of her mother's understanding mood while it lasted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey called the Doctor and Wilf in to join them, and after setting the table, conversation started. Naturally, her family wanted answers on what happened with the Daleks, what they were and what their beef with the Doctor was. He gave them the family-friendly version -- leaving out most details of the Time War and everything horribly depressing, and mostly focusing on the several times he'd defeated them. He also talked a bit about regeneration and how it worked, how many times he'd done it and what it meant for his future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt relieved she didn't have to talk so much. His chatterbox nature meant she was free to eat. Her mother always cooked enough food to feed a small army. Of course, she always criticized her for eating too much of it, and complaining when she didn't eat enough of it. She didn't care about that right now -- she wanted to eat as much as possible. She piled on the lasagna, the steamed vegetables, the casserole and set to work eating it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a long job. Her mother had always been a fabulous cook. She ate everything slowly enough to savor it all. She knew the Doctor would keep Wilf and Sylvia entertained enough that she'd only really need to thrown in occasionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if he's going to go about like that, he's going to need some new clothes,\" Sylvia said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm wearing new clothes!\" the Doctor objected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's saying you need to ditch the plaid,\" Donna said between mouthfuls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with plaid? It's Scotland's official color!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not in those colors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her surprise, her mother laughed. \"You're gonna have to get him 'round to the new shopping mall. Do him up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, try shopping with this bloke is nearly impossible. Try taking him to a mall, and he disappears in under fifteen seconds. Once found him trying to tinker with a massage chair with his screwdriver.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only trying to improve performance!\" the Doctor retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You nearly got arrested!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner continued in with more stories -- both from outer space and right here on Earth -- while Donna continued her assault on dinner. Every time it looked like she was finishing up, she'd reach for more, piling her plate high. She didn't care if she made an utter pig of herself in front of her family. She'd saved the bloody universe. She deserved to let loose for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of 'loose', her pants felt anything but at the moment. As her belly expanded, she felt the trousers get tighter around it. They'd felt so freeing when she'd got dressed, and already, she felt like she was bursting out of them. Part of her felt embarrassed over this, but another part felt thrilled. She wondered how far she had to go before she swelled up enough to pop the button. She remembered her turn in the wardrobe room a few weeks ago when she popped all the buttons off those skinny clothes. The idea that she could do the same to 'fat' clothes seemed like a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll too soon, though, the food was depleted, and the Doctor offered to help Sylvia tidy it away. Good thing, too, because Donna simply could not move. She quietly tried to rub her stomach, which felt rock hard from all the food inside it. She chatted with Wilf a bit, catching up on his latest misadventures, grateful for a chance to sit and relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to her astonishment, dessert was served. Her mother put a chocolate pie in the middle of the table and cut slices for everyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Blimey</i>, thought Donna. <i>She really</i> isn't <i>all that concerned with my weight right now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly wasn't sure she could do it, but then, she remembered the doughnuts and knew she could. She started eating up the delectable slice with relish. The thick chocolatey-ness of it -- it made her swoon. She continued eating it, and all too soon, it was gone. Her chocolate craving was nowhere near satisfied. She licked her lips at the remaining pie. More than half. She wondered if she could do it. Then, she decided that she didn't care. She was going to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna subtly hooked the pie tin with her fork and edged it closer to her plate. She quietly started cutting into the pie. The Doctor was telling a story about Sontarans and medieval knights and disappearing scientists, and it provided just enough cover for her to finish the pie without attracting too much attention. She ate her first piece, and then that segued into the second, and then that headed into the third. Her stomach felt utterly miserable as it swelled inside those trousers, and she didn't care a jot. She could do it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she was down to the final piece. She took a sip of water before taking her fork and simply eating it out of the tin. The Doctor was wrapping up his story, talking about how there'd been dinosaurs in 1970s London -- or was it the 80s? -- and how he talked Sarah Jane into traveling with him. She managed to get the last bit of crust into her mouth and smiled as the others laughed at the end of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" said Sylvia, \"I don't know about the rest of you, but I could do with a rest after today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hear hear,\" agreed Wilf. \"I need a sit down and possibly a nap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded. \"Could do with a bit of rest myself,\" he said. \"Maybe work on my new screwdriver. Been meaning to make a new one.\" He looked over at Donna, who tried not to look too stuffed and bloated. \"Donna? How about you? Back to the TARDIS? Or do you want to stay here for the night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna stifled and belch and considered.</span></div></div>",

She gratefully waddled her way up the steps and into her bedroom. Queen-sized bed, closet, lamp, dresser -- just as she'd left it. She closed the door and began the laborious process of removing her clothes. She undid the button on her plus-size jeans and let her stomach sag with a lovely gurgle. She turned to look at her profile in the mirror and bit back a smile. She shouldn't be nearly as excited by this, but she was. The way it ballooned out in front of her like a mighty wrecking ball -- it jiggled gloriously. She held it in her hands. She'd been so thoroughly stuffed, it felt as hard as a wrecking ball, too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly slid out of the jeans and her top, kicking off her shoes and slumping down on her bed. She wondered if the Doctor could take her to a futuristic shopping center where the clothes adjusted according to weight gain. After all, there must be loads of fat people in the future. They must've prepared for it somehow. Clothes that could adjust according to your waistline, or, as Donna needed right now, cup size. Her breasts had always been a bit large before, but now they were downright impressive. She'd have to start looking into some new bras as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts briefly turned to her mother. She couldn't believe she'd gone through all of dinner without a single remark on her current size. She definitely had grown in a more-than-noticeable way. How could she not have noticed? Her mother wasn't exactly known for her tact, let alone keeping her thoughts to herself. Maybe the relief of the universe not ending had taken some of the starch out of her. Maybe that would continue. Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna ran her hands up and down her body, appreciating the curves, but also appreciating how comfy her bed felt. Just being at home and surrounded by her belongings. She slid deeper under the covers and appreciated the coolness of the sheets. Her bed on the TARDIS was comfy and everything, but this had the homey feel to it. That feeling that she could sleep deeply and the universe wouldn't come to some sort of cataclysmic end. She snuggled deeper and felt her eyelids get heavier. She closed them and listened to the sounds of digestion as she fell asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Donna's eyes popped open, the sun had gone down and ensconced her bedroom in total darkness. She panicked briefly, but then, she remembered the day's previous events. Her mother's cooking, eating so much she needed to lie down, passing out naked in her own bed. Her eyes darted around until she spotted the digital alarm clock on her bedside table. Not long after midnight now. Nearly one in the morning. She rolled over in bed to reach the lamp, and as she switched it on, she felt the contents in her belly shift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the light on, she peered under the sheets and found her big round belly peering back at her. She ran her free hand along it, enjoying the curves and bulges. It still amazed her that she felt such pride and joy in her growing size. In fact, it thrilled her. It felt like she'd finally shaken off the restrictive shackles of shallowness enforced on her since a young age. She could finally be herself. She could finally eat what she wanted without worrying what others thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, her stomach gurgled, and she felt a stab of hunger. She winced slightly -- it had been a few hours since dinner, and she'd slept off most of her gorge. She thought maybe she could do with a snack. Just pop down real quick and enjoy a few nibbles of whatever her mother had in the fridge. Enough to hold her over 'til breakfast. Surely there would be enough to keep her stomach calm until then. Her stomach gurgled again. She <i>hoped </i>it wouldn't take much to satisfy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung her meaty thighs out of bed and waddled over to her dresser. She slipped into a pair of old sweats -- which were just a tad too small but whatever -- and put on her biggest t-shirt -- which allowed her gut to hang out by two clear inches -- and got on her slippers before peeking her head out the door and making sure the coast was clear. She didn't know why she felt the need to snack in secret, but she had to admit it was more exciting this way. She tiptoed into the hall and headed downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, she padded softly into the kitchen and turned on the under-cabinet lights. She'd have to be quiet, lest her mother wake up and hear the noise. She made a beeline for the fridge and pulled it open, bathing herself in the white light. Her eyes lit up at the full fridge. So much to choose from. Her mother must've gone shopping just before the Earth got taken. Fruit and veg, meat, dairy, grain, sweets -- all the food groups amply represented within the cool chamber. She licked her lips and started digging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe told herself she needed something healthy in her diet. Couldn't just live off doughnuts and pasta, after all. She grabbed a stick of celery and chomped down on it hungrily, and once that proved not even remotely filling, she grabbed a bag of baby carrots and gobbled several of those down as well. Still not satisfied, she looked around and spotted some apples on the counter. She ate three in less than ten minutes and tossed the cores, but health foods weren't doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she saw the sliced turkey and a loaf of bread and thought maybe that would prove more filling. She grabbed the turkey, the cheese, the mustard and the mayo and proceeded to make herself a sandwich. She enjoyed it much more than the vegetables, but she finished it far too quickly, so she made another one. That gave way to a third one, and then a fourth before she finally got bored with the taste. She patted her stomach as she tidied away the knife she'd used, but it still wasn't enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went through the pantry and found a box of her favorite cereal. Maybe that would help. She got down a bowl and poured it into the bowl. She poured the milk as well and got going. Wonderfully cool and crunchy. She hadn't had since before she left with the Doctor. She had two bowls and a few slugs of milk straight from the gallon, but even as her belly protruded further, that need to eat persisted. She didn't know why she felt such a strong need to keep eating, but it felt too powerful to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the pantry, she went through a few other snacks. Some crackers, some chocolate covered biscuits, some bananas... Nothing seemed to calm her hunger. She wondered what could possibly satisfy her at this point. Could she really be so mindlessly gluttonous that nothing would satisfy her? How much more could she eat before she ended up eating her mother and granddad out of house and home? She worried about this as she microwaved herself some fish fingers and chomped through them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, her eyes fell on the fridge again. She hadn't exactly given it a thorough inspection. She pulled it open again and peered inside. Must be something she'd missed. She took a few swigs of apple juice while she looked, and then, her eyes fell on what she'd missed -- the remains of the second chocolate pie her mother had made. She bit her lip. If she ate it, no doubt her mother would know who took it. She looked at it with longing and glanced at her stomach -- already so swollen. She shouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she did. She took the pie and began to eat it, right there in the open fridge. She whimpered with desire as she chewed, eating face down in the tin like a pig. She greedily at the whole thing, slurping and munching, before finally finishing it all off. She gently placed the empty tin on the counter before taking a few chugs of milk. She felt her sweats get a bit tighter around her middle. She put the milk back and began to tidy things away. Her stomach gave a gurgle, this time from being full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she threw the tin in the recycling, she began to feel full. Re-e-e-e-e-eally full. So full it hurt. The pie had satisfied the hunger, but now her poor tummy felt far too full after being so utterly jam packed with food. She moaned sadly and stifled a belch as she turned off the lights and waddled slowly and miserably back to the stairs. She gripped the railing tightly and practically dragged herself up to the hallway. She winced as her new weight made everything creak, but she found her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside her room, she shut the door and made for the bed, already pulling off the shirt and lowering the now far-too-tight stretch pants. She turned and looked at her profile in the mirror, and the difference was staggering. She'd gone from a bit plump to six months pregnant in less than an hour. She ran her hands up and down the magnificent curve and marveled for a minute. Then, her stomach gurgled, making her moaned and stifle another belch. She kicked off her sweats and turned to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEasing herself between the cool sheets, she took her time positioning herself. She didn't want to move too suddenly for fear of losing all that gorging. She settled down and slowly rolled over to turn her lamp off. Her stomach got in the way for a time, but she managed to reach it and turn it off, plunging her room back into darkness. Sighing with relief, full of food and hands atop her big belly, she settled back into the covers and went back to sleep. She just hoped her mother didn't raise hell over he pie.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next time Donna awoke, she saw the sun peeking in through the curtains. She glanced at the clock and saw it to be just after eight. Sighing heavily and stretching her aching muscles, she turned and swung her legs out over the edge of the bed and heaved herself upright. She rubbed her eyes and lightly slapped her belly, taking note of just how much of her lap it took up. Halfway to her knees. She shook her head. She could only imagine what her mother would make of the eaten food from her late night gorge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through her clothes, she found that absolutely nothing could possibly contain her newfound girth, so she went for the sweats again and put on a nice sweater with an light overcoat, in the hopes that it would deflect attention from her belly. They weren't perfect, but they made her curves less noticeable. She'd worry about a new bra when she got to the TARDIS. She knew she had to at least have breakfast with her family before she took off for the deepest reaches of time and space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce fully dressed, she opened the door and made her way towards the stairs. Before she'd even descended the first step, she could smell something heavenly. Smelled like... eggs and bacon and... pancakes? Seriously? Her mother cooking pancakes? She couldn't even remember the last time she'd had pancakes in this house. She could hear voices as well. Her gramps, her mother and... the Doctor?! She still couldn't get used to that nasally American accent of his. But what was he doing here so early?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she made it to the kitchen, she came up short. Her mother and grandfather sat around the table, and the Doctor stood over the stove, making what appeared to be the world's most elaborate omelette with bacon and pancakes brewing as well. He seemed to be in the midst of some story, regaling her family with a tale from long before he knew her. Something involving someone named 'Jo' and a bunch of shop window dummies and plastic flowers and some bloke called 'the Master'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned and saw her entering. \"Donna!\" he said cheerily. \"Just in time! Almost done! Have a seat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna knew she was gawping, but she couldn't help it. \"You're here early,\" she remarked with a startled laugh. \"Didn't know you could cook.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither!\" he replied, before briefly experimenting with the different pronunciations of the word 'neither'. \"Still not used to the voice! Here! Sit down! Breakfast time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and sat between her mother and gramps. The Doctor hummed a little ditty and began serving. Omelettes, bacon and pancakes all around. Donna couldn't help but notice how he put a few extra pancakes on her plate, but she couldn't tell if he'd done it for some underhanded reason or simply because he liked her best. In any case, he sat down and continued his story, getting to the part where a giant plastic chair had tried to eat him alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna cut a small piece and took a bite of the omelette. To her relief, it tasted amazing. Must be some alien recipe because she didn't recognize it at all. She began eating more and more of it with joy, reveling in the unique spices and delightful flavor. Her family clearly enjoyed it as well, eating up every last bite while he finished his story and babbled on aimlessly into the next one. She ate up her bacon and started in on the pancakes. Five, he'd given her, while everyone else got two. She sneaked a glance at her mother for any signs of judgement, but she seemed more concerned with asking the Doctor questions as he described his metal dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the coast was clear, Donna surreptitiously hooked the small syrup container with her pinky and began to smother her pancakes in maple goodness, followed by a few slices of butter. She still managed to listen to the story and chime in at the appropriate times. After all, he'd been so damn quiet before the change. Talked a lot, but never really said anything. She liked this storyteller side of him -- so much history to be found in him. Good to know there were good memories as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she kept at the pancakes. She got the first one down with little effort, but the second one proved a tad more taxing. Such a big breakfast, and such big portions. Appropriate, really, seeing as how she'd become such a big girl lately. Had she always been like this, deep down? A closet glutton? Was this her finding the nerve to \"come out\", as it were? All these years of watching her waist, and she'd been suppressing the real her all along. She wanted food -- the waistline be damned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna continued into the breakfast feast. The second one finished down her gullet, and the third made its way as well. She set to work on the fourth and silently thanked whatever higher deities existed that she'd worn the sweats. But even those had limits, and she could feel her stomach swelling behind the waistband. She took a swig of orange juice and continued. She noticed her breathing becoming a tad more labored and tried to keep it even. No need to draw attention to herself. Just keep chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final pancake stared her down. She cut it up and started eating it. God, she felt full, but she didn't want to show it. And she didn't want to not finish these amazing pancakes. She wondered if she could convince the Doctor to cook like this all the time. She wondered if the regeneration had tuned his personality to suit hers more. A bit more snark, a bit more candid, and a half-decent cook to boot. She continued munching away, the American nasal beginning to grow on her just a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she'd finished her breakfast, and after a few more hearty sips of orange juice, she slumped back in the chair and resisted the urge to rub her stomach. It bulged so enormously, she looked like she'd swallowed a basketball. Probably had her own gravitational pull. The TARDIS could go into orbit around her. She smiled slightly at the thought of being the size of a planet and the little blue police box circling her once a year. She pulled down her sweater and stifled a belch as everyone finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that, the Doctor helped tidy everything away and do the dishes while she chatted with her family. They came to some agreements -- call at least twice a week, send pictures, visit more often and give them a heads up if the world started ending again. She agreed to those terms and gave them both the longest hugs. She liked it when home felt like home. Somewhere she could rely on and feel safe from outside annoyances. She hoped her mother's good mood continued into the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fifteen minutes of hugging, she finally made her way out the door, and she followed the Doctor up the sidewalk towards the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" she drawled, \"... what'd you get up to while I was away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor looked mildly startled. \"What makes you think I got up to anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave him a knowing look, and he grinned sheepishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I rewrote my symposium on the lifespan of the universe -- all in jokes -- before helping out with a small county hospital in the Beleros Sphere and saved a planet from a horde of Demon Spider Monkeys.\" He reached into his pocket and pulled out a cylindrical device that made a familiar whirring noise. \"Oh! And I got a new sonic screwdriver! Look, the light's purple now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna laughed. \"God, you just can't sit still for a minute, can you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, it was a relief to just sit back and have breakfast after all that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long were you gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just a few days from my point of view. Couldn't stay away that long. Too damn quiet in that TARDIS without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, I'm touched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it back, but rather than open the door with his key, he snapped his fingers, and they swung open. She smiled slightly and followed him inside. He made the walk up to the console and began pressing a few buttons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where to next?\" she asked, lazily thumping down in his easy chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dunno,\" he replied, fiddling with the controls. He pulled the main lever, and that funny wheezing noise sounded as they entered the time vortex. \"Let's fly about a bit and see if anything comes our way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded as she absently lowered her stretch pants, allowing her (once again) overstuffed belly to spill out into her lap. More like three quarters to her knees now. She sat contentedly, hands atop her stomach and listening to the lovely sounds of the TARDIS as she nodded off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna awoke to a rather sudden bump as the TARDIS landed. She'd nodded off in the chair, and she gripped both arm rests in alarm, nearly ruining the fake-leather with her nails. She sat upright and looked around, noticing straight away that her stomach still stuck out from her too-tight stretch pants and her rolled-up sweater. Panicking, she pulled her sweater down again and tried to get herself looking decent. She managed to heave the suck in her gut long enough to get the elastic up and over it, but when she exhaled, she seemed to have two rather large bulges across her middle as they creased the middle of her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that would have to do, she got to her feet and waddled awkwardly up from the reading area to the console platform. The Doctor popped up from behind the wood-paneled console and checked the monitor. \"Here we are!\" he said, flipping some switches. \"Victorian London -- for your viewing pleasure!\" He turned the monitor so she could have a look as well. She saw a very white screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a gust of wind revealed the white to be snow. They'd landed under a bridge, but she could see the activity taking place. People laughing, singing, shopping, with lots of top hats and skirts and chickens. She quietly marveled for a few moments before she began to register just how many corsets the women wore. All of them walking about like having their innards squeezed stupid wasn't the debilitating business it really was. She glanced down at her plumpness and squirmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do I have to dress up?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blinked. \"Do you want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then!\" He grabbed his fedora and plaid black-and-white scarf and slipped on his black sport coat. \"Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt a small smile. \"I don't have to dress up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, not to worry. Just walk around like you own the place. It's always worked for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna nodded, but then she remembered what she had on. \"Er... just let me get some neater clothes on. I slept in these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" he shrugged. \"I'll get some info on the area.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna hurried off to the wardrobe room. To her immense relief, the TARDIS seemed to have moved it much closer than normal, and she darted inside, already pulling her sweater off. She hoped against hope that maybe she'd be provided with some clothes in her size for a change. To her relief, she found a thicker sweater that covered her properly, and a pair of plus size jeans that actually seemed capable of holding together when she squatted. Finishing it off with a thick jacket, she hurried back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she'd made it outside, she tried to find him, and immediately found him having some sort of spirited discussion with a chicken. Honest to god clucking with a chicken, like a bloody Muppet. She slowly approached, half out of shock and half out of decency. After a few moments, he tipped his hat to the chicken, looked around briefly, and then lit up when he saw her and approached. She briefly considered pretending she'd never seen him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just getting the details on where we are,\" he replied with a shrug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From a chicken?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always get to know the local color when you're time traveling, Donna. Wealth of information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a <i>chicken</i>?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with chickens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, you just 'speak chicken'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I speak everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna rolled her eyes. \"And what did the chicken say?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That it's 1851, it's Christmas Eve and to stop blocking her view of the cockerel in the cage across from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a cheeky chicken, eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, they heard a woman's voice cut across the marketplace. \"DOCTOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both looked around at the voice. It seemed to be coming from up an alleyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Who, me?\" the Doctor asked, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice shouted again. \"DOCTOR!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shrug, he turned and ran towards the voice. Donna groaned. She really didn't want to run right now. Clasping her stomach in both hands to prevent it from jiggling too much, she tore after him up the alley. When they arrived, they found a young dark-skinned woman doing all the shouting while she stood before a door that rattled and shook madly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DOCT-<i>AHHHHHH</i>!!\" the woman kept screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sorry, I'm here!\" the Doctor said, trying to shield her from the door. \"What've we got here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm the Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor who?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just the Doctor. Donna -- maybe you should take her away from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's behind the door?\" Donna demanded, trying to get her breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, another man in a frock coat and waistcoat came running up, looking quite exhilarated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where've you been?!\" the woman demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, don't worry, stand back, what have we got here then...?\" he asked in a great booming voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell are you?!\" Donna asked incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other man grinned at her. \"I'm the Doctor! Simply the Doctor! The one, the only, and the best!\" he said with a wink. The door boomed again, and he held out a hand to the woman. \"Rosita! Pass me the sonic screwdriver!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor continued to reel in shock. \"Who? The what??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now quickly! Get back to the TARDIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Back to the what?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you would stand back, sir! This is a job for a Time Lord!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Job for a what Lord?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud bang, the doors burst open, and Donna jumped back as a strange black-furred creature with a metallic face burst out, growling furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's new!\" both Doctors said at once. Both pulled out their screwdrivers and aimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Allons-y!\" said the other Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's mouth fell open, as did the Doctor's. The snarling thrashing creature got their attention, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Donna demanded. \"What's it doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fallen right into my trap!\" the other Doctor said with great bravado. \"Oh, I've been hunting this beast for a good fortnight, now step back, sir -\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature responded by leaping over them and clinging to the wall, not unlike Spiderman. The other Doctor tried lassoing it with a rope, but it simply lifted him up, and then it proceeded to list up the Doctor when he tried to grab it. The rope continued to climb when Donna had a frankly brilliant idea. Acting quickly, she waddled over and grabbed the rope, wrapping her wrists around it. With her added poundage weighting it down, the creature began sliding down the wall, scrabbling furiously to continue climbing. Taking advantage of the distraction, the Doctor managed to reach into his coat pocket and pull out his screwdriver and gave the creature a quick <i>whirrr</i>! It briefly shuddered before the metal face sparked, and it slid the rest of the way down, allowing them all to land in a big heap at the bottom of the building, the creature having gone limp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRosita helped them all get up. \"Are you okay?\" she asked the other Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Doctor simply laughed heartily. \"All the better for finally having this beastie under control at last, and all thanks to our new friends here!\" He turned and helped the Doctor and Donna to their feet. \"Well done, both of you! Very brave!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, cheers,\" grunted Donna, rubbing her considerable rump. \"So, back up -- you're the Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, madam!\" he said. \"And you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked and slowly replied, \"Donna Noble. Do you not know me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked to her Doctor, who raised a fascinated eyebrow. \"Well, frankly, yes,\" he said. \"You don't recognize either of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never seen you before in my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna could already tell they would be here a while.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>To cut a long story short, the \"Doctor\" turned out to be a man named Jackson Lake, who'd had his mind scrambled due to a combination of a backfiring infostamp full of Doctor data backfired into his head and the trauma of his wife's death both happening at roughly the same time. They'd managed to find the Cybermen, who'd been working with a woman named Miss Hartigan to kidnap all the children in town to use them as a workforce to power up a huge steampunk Cyberman. Fortunately, the real Doctor saved the town using a gas balloon and thing that made a bunch of swirly wibbly things around the giant Cyberman and transported it... somewhere. But London was saved (again) and everyone celebrated in the streets amidst the destruction, already starting to rebuild. Jackson had his son back at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna walked with the Doctor and Jackson through the crowds, taking in the sights. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The City will recover. As London always does. Though today's events will be history! Spoken of for centuries to come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...,\" murmured the Doctor, looking at something. \"Funny, that.\" Donna followed his eyeline and saw he was looking at a great big crack in a wall, and was it her imagination or was it actually glowing...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJackson continued. \"And a new history begins for me. I find myself a widower. But with my son, and with good friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey glanced back at Rosita, who stood with young Frederick and waved at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're welcome to join us. We thought we might all dine together, at the Traveller's Halt, a Christmas feast, in celebration, and in memory of those we have lost...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor's expression turn wistful. \"Those we've lost,\" he repeated. Then, he shrugged. \"Oh, why not? What do you think, Donna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna blinked, not used to the Doctor agreeing to stay for once. She found her voice. \"Yeah, might be fun,\" she said at last. After all, she hadn't eaten in hours, and she could do with some food, even if it was Victorian era food, and she agreed she wasn't ready to leave their new friends just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing Jackson to the Traveller's Halt, Donna found it to be a bustling hub of people, taking food from a buffet line and talking excitedly about the earlier activity. She got a plate and got a grilled turkey leg with some sprouts and potatoes. Pretty decent, really. She noticed, however, that folks were getting mugs of ale from a nearby giant barrel. Realizing she needed a decent drink after the last few days, she took a chance on it. She took a mug and got herself a drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a sip and right away felt herself loosen up. This stuff tasted amazing. She ate her dinner in utter contentment, listening as the Doctor chatted with Jackson and all the other people at the table, talking about the Cybermen, not to mention some of the other adventures he'd had while Jackson talked about the other things he'd done as \"the Doctor\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna, however, could barely listen. The ale tasted incredible and gave her such a warm feeling. Like, all the stress she'd built up traveling melted away like ice in global warming. She finished her mug and immediately went for a refill. No one seemed to be manning the tap, so she immediately helped herself. It tasted just as warm and delicious as the first one. Excellent protection against the cold. She smiled politely as a few other patrons got themselves a glass or two, making a point not to look at them too closely, before getting herself a third. She gulped it down in nothing flat, feeling more and more loose with each drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night wore on, and people came and went, but Donna remained where she was, constantly refilling her mug. She kept a low profile, not wanting to draw too much attention to herself, but as she continued to drink, she felt her inhibitions lowering considerably. Then, to her disappointment, she put her mug under the tap for another glass and found it empty. She couldn't have had that much, could she? She usually knew how to not overdo it, and that hadn't felt like that much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer drink-addled brain thought it over. Must be more somewhere, right? A tavern would definitely have more. She felt like looking for more would be stupid, but with so much ale sloshing around inside her, she found she didn't care. She peeked around to make sure no one saw her before slipping behind the barrel and spying an open door with no one standing around. She spotted the Doctor still chatting with the townspeople and took her chance for queen and country. She slid through and surreptitiously slipped inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening to her belly slosh with what she'd already consumed, Donna waddled into the darkened cellar. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness before she found a candle and lit it with her lighter. She found what she sought. Enormous barrels of beer, wine and all things good and alcoholic. The logical part of her brain told her this was stupid and she should just leave. The reasonable part told her that a few drinks wouldn't kill her. The hedonist part of brain told her to drink merrily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna smiled up at the giant barrel in front of her, placed on a rack with all the others. She found the one labelled 'ale' and found it had a spigot on the front, all set for pouring its contents into her mug. She double-checked that she was alone, with no one about to come down the stairs, and once content, she took her mug and put it under the spigot, turned the handle and let it fill up. Once her mug had all it could hold, she twisted the knob back and took a nice long drink. She let out a contented sigh after the first sip before returning to chugging it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned herself against the barrels and continued on the one she'd found. It had been far too long since the last time she'd had a proper drinking session like this. She could dimly recall a pub crawl with some friends on a hen night, but that had been a long time ago. She looked around in the darkness and felt a stab of alcohol enhanced sadness. Drinking alone. Sad, really. Pity the Doctor didn't seem to drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made her giggle in a silly way. She tried to imagine the Doctor getting drunk. She remembered the man he'd been before only had the odd ginger beer or banana daiquiri, but he only occasionally. The new Doctor didn't seem to drink a drop of alcohol at all. In fact, the most exciting thing he drank in her presence was ice water with some lemon squeezed in it. Disappointing, really. Sure, she didn't really miss hangovers, but she missed going out with her mates and guzzling herself into a stupor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering why she was here, she poured herself another glass. Her stomach sloshed like a waterbed from all she'd consumed recently. She rubbed her gut and giggled stupidly at the contents gurgling away. She finished the second glass and started in on the third. She sipped it down and felt something deep inside of her go a little mad. She'd gone without for so long that she needed more. With no Doctor to be a buzzkill and no mother to struggle to avoid at home, she saw no reason not to go mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe set the mug down on the floor along side the candle. Her heart pounded with excitement as she considered what she was about to do. She knew she had to be careful, even if she was blitzed out of her mind. She licked her lips and eased herself down, already too full to risk doing anything too acrobatic like bending over. She eased herself onto her rump and reached up for the spigot. She wrapped her fingers around the handle and gave it the gentlest of twists. Too much, and she'd drown. Easy does it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gentle stream of ale poured into her mouth. She let out a gargled groan of joy and drank it down, leaning back and relaxing every muscle. She gulped down the steady stream of warm liquid and rubbed her swelling belly. She could feel how hard it already was, so utterly packed like a giant water balloon. She reached down and unbuttoned her trousers, too drunk off her ass to even think about the consequences to her actions anymore. She moaned softly as it continued, her belly stretching outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel herself getting bigger, and that caused a great deal of nonsense from downstairs. She fought back another groaned as she slipped one hand down into her unbuttoned trousers and felt around, trying to assuage that strange tingle that came from within. The 'thunder from down under', as it were. She felt so utterly full, but she didn't care -- she <i>wanted </i>this. She <i>needed </i>this. She wanted to be as big around as this bloody barrel she guzzled from. Must have more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now she felt <i>too </i>full. Past the enjoyable part and into the utterly miserable part. She let out one last sad moan and reached up, turning the spigot once again. The flow ceased, and she sat in a pathetic puddle on the floor, still fiddling around her undercarriage and biting her lip to keep from moaning. Her stomach didn't even jiggle. Hard as a rock. She couldn't budge an inch. She didn't care. She just needed to feel... just... a little... <i>longer</i>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, got that done</i>, she thought with immense relief, wiping her hand off in the puddle she sat in. Her front soaked and her belly protruding like a globe, not to mention the pleasant throbbing down below, she struggled to realize just how sloshed she was. Her head swam groggily and her body felt like lead. Still, the one thing she managed to remember -- she couldn't stay down here indefinitely. Someone would find her and start to ask a lot of awkward questions. She had to find her way out of here soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rocked herself back and forth a little to get some movement -- and also, to listen to that wonderful sloshing sound her belly made -- she got herself moving forward and onto her hands and knees. Good enough, she decided. She got hold of the still-lit candle, deciding to just abandon the mug, and awkwardly dragged herself along the cold hard floor for the steps she'd found earlier. She couldn't hear much activity upstairs. Maybe the party had ended and everyone had gone home. Fine with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcept... the Doctor wouldn't leave without her, would he? Wouldn't just assume she'd gone back to the TARDIS to sleep it off? No, of course not. He wouldn't assume anything. He'd think to go looking for her. She focused on getting out of the cellar first. Get upstairs, sneak out and get into the open. Maybe the cold air would help her think clearly. Just had to finish crawling down this absurdly long corridor. Would it ever end? It must've been hours. Or maybe minutes. Hell, maybe seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach sloshed and gurgled beneath her, trying to contain the massive binge she'd just guzzled. A few cobblestones were uneven, and her gut hung so low that it gently brushed against their cool surface. She tried to ignore how nice it felt. She needed to get up those stairs. Not focus on how swollen she was. How big and round and <i>fat </i>she was. What a big fat greedy <i>piggy </i>she was. Whatever would the Doctor say when he saw the state she'd gotten herself in. He'd be ever so disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the bottom stair and gripped it with relief. She blew out the candle. She probably wouldn't need it now. Besides, she'd probably light the way with the blush she sported. Did she really just think of the Doctor like that? She'd had a hard enough thinking of him as a sexual being when he looked what some might call 'stereotypically handsome'. Now he looked dorky and awkward and too tall and funny hair and foreboding-yet-adorable brow and kinda grumpy, which only made those genuine smiles of his even cuter and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMust be the alcohol, she decided. Only explanation. Why else would she suddenly start having sexual thoughts about the <i>Doctor</i>. He wasn't her type at all. Best friends. Nothing more. No interest in a long term relationship. Neither of them. Still... sometimes best mates got together. Despite what half a dozen rom coms might tell society, it was in fact possible to have sex with friends and not feel anything. She didn't make a habit of it, but the possibility was there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe realized she'd made it to the top of the stairs, and she found herself in the darkened tavern. Not a soul in sight. She was totally alone. No one at all. She felt sad. He'd left without saying goodbye. She heaved herself forwards towards the bar and used a few discarded chairs to force herself to stand. She didn't quite make it and began to stumble back down again until...</span></div></div>",

She gazed up the length of the arm and saw the Doctor smiling down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're still 'ere,\" she slurred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I am,\" he replied. \"I wouldn't leave without you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stared at him in silent wonder until she realized her dangerously overfull belly was in danger of dragging her back down to the floor. She reached up and took his hand, allowing her to stand more easily. He slipped her arm over his shoulder and supported her as they walked awkwardly out of the tavern. Pausing to sonic the door locked behind them, they made the long trek to the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha' time issit?\" Donna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three in the morning,\" he replied. \"Everyone's gone home for Christmas morning. Jackson sends his love, by the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned. \"Oh gawd, I didn't even say goo'bye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right. He wanted to get Fredrick home. It's good to have someone to care for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at him for a moment before resting her head on his shoulder. \"You always care f' me,\" she mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's what best friends do,\" he smiled, half-dragging her to the TARDIS. He snapped his fingers, and the doors swung open, allowing them entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know wha' I wishhh?\" she continued drunkenly. \"I reeeeeeally wish y'were husband material.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor chuckled as they continued through the ship and into the corridor. \"Do you, indeed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeahhhh, I really do. Ye're sho shweeet and caring and ye get on with m' gramps and... ye know wha'? Ye're bloody cute, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't say anything, so she continued as they entered her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean it. Ye're right handsome in th' right light an' I wish we could be more than friendsh sometimesh. I just really... gawd, ye're gorgeoush sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned forward, thinking she might kiss him, but she missed an instead landed flat on her back in her bed. She clutched her stomach as it swayed and wobbled, so utterly full of drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled, but it looked sad. \"You'll feel better in the morning,\" he said, pulling a blanket over her. He then pulled a glass of water out of his jacket pocket, followed by a small red pill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha's tha'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the hangover. Drink the whole glass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna groaned, not wanting to consume anything else, but she liked the idea of an alien pill that took care of hangovers, so she took it and drank the water before setting the empty glass on the nightstand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor patted her head and turned the light out. \"Merry Christmas, Donna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe belched in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last thing she saw before passing out was his silhouette in the doorway, disappearing into the ship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The first thing Donna noticed when she woke up was that she had to pee reeeeeeeally badly. The second thing she noticed while she was on the toilet was that she'd drank half a vat of ale and suffered no hangover. The third thing she noticed just after she flushed was that she'd said a lot of really dumb things that she would have to iron out with the Doctor. She didn't want him getting the wrong idea after she'd drunkenly admitted she found him attractive. The fourth thing she noticed was her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly bulged like a great big balloon out of her open trousers, sagging heavily. How had she managed to consume all that ale in one sitting? Surely that wasn't physically possible. How had she managed to consume all that alcohol? She jiggled it up and down slightly, noting how empty it felt. She fingered her navel briefly, appreciating how deep it went. She turned to examine her profile, and she saw just how thick the rest of her had become. Her rump looked like two badly parked volkswagons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't bring herself to revel in her fatness. The walk home from the previous night filled her with dread. The things she'd said to the Doctor, the way she'd acted... She'd tried to kiss him, for crying out loud! That wasn't her. Even if he was attractive, they'd agreed a long time ago that their relationship would be nothing but friends. Best mates. Amigos. Chums. Pals. That's it. She took a shower to brace herself, then got dressed in some sensible clothes and walked towards the control room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived, she scanned the room. At first, it looked empty, but then, she heard work being done under the console, and she saw those familiar huge feet sticking out. Steeling her resolve, she walked over and, upon not being noticed, cleared her throat. \"Ahem.\" The work stopped, and he slid out, peering up at her. He didn't say anything, nor did his expression yield any inner thoughts. She bit her lip awkwardly and wrapped her arms around herself, ready to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we talk?\" she asked quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" he replied, sliding all the way out and getting to his feet. He leaned against the console and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...,\" Donna said slowly. \"Last night... wasn't great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor shrugged but didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what happened, really. I just... Once I got a taste for it, I couldn't stop, and I know I should've shown more self-control and been more careful, especially in another bloody century, but I... It felt so good to just cut loose for a night. Like, I could finally just be free after all those years under my mum's thumb and society judging me and trying to keep myself up to everybody else's standards and I... I just wanted to be free, and I felt free, and I didn't want it to end...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded, hopefully with understanding, so she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in the process, I said a bunch of things I shouldn't have. You are my best friend in all of time and space, and I don't want to ruin what we have. I know you're not like that. You're not that kind of bloke. You're like a sort of... outer space Gandalf or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got a smile out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what I'm trying to say is that I'm sorry I came onto you last night, I'm sorry I drank so much and was an ordeal for you, because that wasn't fair to you, and... well, now I'm just rambling, going all stream of thought and you have never been so quiet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded. \"Yes, well, I appreciate you saying all that. For the record, I wasn't angry at having to wait on you last night, nor having to drag you back to the TARDIS. I'm glad you got to achieve that feeling, although, I'm sure there are other ways to achieve it,\" he said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"Yeah, I know. Just got carried away.\" She patted her stomach. \"Seem to be doing that a lot lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor smiled. \"Yeah, that seems to happen to some people on the TARDIS...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's eyes widened. \"You wha?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, occasionally, I've noticed the odd companion get a tad... shall we say... 'podgy'...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your previous companions got fat as well?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them. Just a few here and there. I remember Dodo indulging a bit more frequently over time... Zoe -- poor girl couldn't fit into her catsuit for a while there. And Liz -- granted, we didn't do much traveling together, but I think that's one of the reasons she left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kidding me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't seem to have heard her. \"And Romana -- good grief, she could put away a bucket of chicken. I sometimes wonder if that's why she regenerated...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna put a finger to his lips. \"Time out! You're telling me I'm not the first to gain weight on the TARDIS?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor shrugged helplessly. \"It's not my fault! I don't do anything to make it happen! The TARDIS just seems to... do that sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of Donna's concerns and suspicions became confirmed at once. \"The TARDIS fattens your companions up?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't happen all the time. Never happened with Rose or Martha. Sarah Jane -- we traveled together for ages -- she ballooned a bit, but she decided to get back in shape afterwards...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna swallowed. \"Did they... get as big as me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor shrugged again. \"Never really paid attention. Not the sort of thing I'd notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a 'no, they didn't'.\" Donna ran her hands through her hair. \"It's all beginning to make sense now... But why me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the TARDIS likes you. Maybe it's... how she shows affection?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna thought about that. All those times the TARDIS straight up gave her food, almost force feeding her. All the times they landed in relaxing places so she didn't have to run too much and burn too many calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then,\" she said at last, making up her mind. \"Excuse me. I need to have a word with your ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could do that right here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Privately</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded and let her leave, returning to his work. She heard him muttering something about rewiring but kept walking. She went as far down the corridor as she could, hoping to be as far away from her friend's ears as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, she stood in the middle of a long corridor. She looked up at the ceiling and got ready to speak.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Organizing her thoughts, Donna began speaking to the TARDIS. \"So...,\" she drawled. \"You thought I wouldn't realize what was going on, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship said nothing, of course, so she continued raving. She knew that to anyone passing, she'd look ridiculous just rambling on, but she was alone, so she felt safe enough to finally let everything out to the chubby chasing time ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't understand why! Why do you feel this need to fatten up the women on this ship? What do you get out of it?! What, you just like having fat women walking about your corridors?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the ancient ship offered nothing in response. Just continued to hum quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna felt her frustration building. \"Well, let me tell you something right now, missy! It ends now! From now on, I eat when I want and where I want -- not because you tempt me or feed me! Understood! It's over! Finished! Kaput!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed slightly, making her feel momentarily nervous. What did that mean?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed and continued. \"Yeah, well... Tough, 'cuz you're not tempting me anymore. I'm nobody's pig. I have restraint. Self control. I have...\" She sniffed briefly as a new odor entered her nostrils. \"What's that smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights at the end of the corridor lit up, indicating she should look over there. Walking very cautiously down, she arrived in the light, face to face with a vending machine. The odor came from a well done steak with string beans and mushrooms just for her. The smell was intoxicating and so very inviting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head and backed away. \"No!\" she said. \"Uh-uh! You'll have to do better than that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard a soft 'beep!' behind her and turned to find another vending machine, this time presenting her with a bucket of fried chicken. The smell wafted into her nostrils. They looked delicious. Deep fried and lovely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna knew she had to stay strong. \"What, is that it?! Best you can do? Ha! I can control myself!\" She turned to leave up the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her horror, the corridor had sprouted several vending machines, and each one had a new food inside -- hot dogs, cheeseburgers, prime rib, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, devilled eggs, buttered waffles -- and they all called out to her with their delicious smells!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to turn down the other corridor, but they all had fresh food as well -- pancakes coated in syrup, fried eggs, banana splits, bowls of salad, fresh pineapple...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna cowered in the corner. Nowhere to run. She knew she wasn't that strong. She'd try something, and then that'd set off a chain reaction leading to her eating until she couldn't anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... you witch!\" she snapped. \"Fattening me up like Hansel and Gretal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship said nothing, of course. Just kept the food in suspended animation until someone came along and ate it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna's heart pounded from fear, but also excitement. All this food, and it was all hers. She could gorge herself right now. No money. No prying eyes. Just eating until she blew up. Worse ways to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking her lips unconsciously, she tried closing her eyes and walking past them, but the smell still wafted through her nostrils. She tried pinching her nose and breathing through her mouth, but she could actually taste the food's odor. So much of it. So many different flavors -- all calling to her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna whimpered. What could she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donna tried running up the corridor, but more and more food appeared in the rows of vending machines, and they seemed to stretch on for miles down the corridors. The TARDIS just wouldn't give up on its mad mission to fatten her up. No matter which way she went, food waited for her, looking ever delectable and smelling one hundred percent delicious. She saw pizzas, ice cream, sandwiches, subs, salads, baked goods and so much more, and her mouth watered with longing for them. She licked her lips and realized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sod it,\" she grunted, running for a nearby dispenser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vat of mashed potatoes sat in the serving hatch. Donna took the entire container and started shoveling it in with the huge metal spoon. She slurped and swallowed, barely chewing any of it, gobbling down the thick buttery cream goodness. She ate and ate until she simply got bored with the flavor, prompting her to swallow down one last mouthful before looking to the hundreds of other vending machines awaiting her desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to another one that had a big bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge. She didn't even bother with a spoon. She started chowing down straight from the bowl like an overeager pig, staining her face and clothes, but her desire overpowered any need for decorum. She ate until she got bored with that, too, and went for a warm pepperoni pizza that awaited her. She ate four slices before deciding to move on to something else. She ate three cheese sandwiches in rapid succession with a mug of tea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her stomach getting bigger, but with everything laid out before her, she couldn't be bothered to worry about how full she got. Her stomach became full very quickly, but she didn't really notice. Not even as she ate a heaping great stack of syrup-soaked pancakes and moved on to an ice-cold bottle of soda. It swelled and swayed and gurgled fiercely, but her gluttony put any pain she might be feeling out of her head. Gotta have more. Gotta eat more. So much food, so little time. Eat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gorged her way through a jumbo basket of chips, and she chomped her way through a plate of home baked chocolate chip cookies. She slurped up a vat of cotton candy and virtually inhaled a bucket of fried chicken legs. She guzzled down a pitcher of lemonade and gobbled up an entire meatball sub. So much to cram in her stomach -- how the hell could she consume all this?! A small voice in the back of her mind told her this couldn't be physically possible! She shouldn't be able to eat all this food!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she'd remember the food in front of her and move on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the motherload at last. A soft serve ice cream dispenser. Her stomach groaned at the thought, but she didn't care. She went for the chocolate section and pulled the lever, slurping down every last drop she could possibly hold. Her belly inflated like a heavily-pregnant beachball, sloshing with the intake. She unbuttoned the trousers and let them fall, already feeling around under stomach and her aching crotch, moaning softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, covered in crumbs and food stains, Donna slid down the side of the dispenser and hit the floor with her bare bottom, sending ripples down her enormous thick thighs. Her belly stretched so far in front of her that she could barely reach. She lifted it up with her free hand and rubbed her swollen abdomen, the effects of her gorge catching up with her. She continued masturbating with the other hand, her eyes rolling up in her head and biting her lip with anticipation until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slumped with relief. Finally spent, she sat there, pants down, covered in stains, her stomach protruding so far in front that she looked nine months pregnant, with her already obese frame. She steadied her breathing and sat there, a dopey smile on her face, pleased with herself as she rubbed her stomach up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ughhhh,\" she moaned. \"You... bloody great fat... you whopping huge... gluttonous... PIG!\" she yelled at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, she saw that the vending machines had all somehow disappeared. Just bare walls around her, and she herself leaned against the wall -- not a soft-serve dispenser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Donna said at last. \"I can't just sit around eating <i>all </i>the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dimmed slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But!\" she continued. \"I wouldn't mind doing this again sometime. This has been fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights came back on again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonna smiled and patted her stomach. It didn't even jiggle. Too jammed pack full of food for that. She felt ill and sore, but also contented and... proud? She simply sat there and cradled the enormous food baby in her lap, rubbing it and breathing heavily. </span></div></div>",

Specifically it was her engagement ring, the only reminder in the universe of Rory Williams' existence. \"Still obsessing over that ring?\" the Doctor asked, trying to sound natural. Amy kept looking at it in wonder, practically not hearing the Doctor. After another 5 minutes of ring-staring, Amy went to her room, when the Doctor got a rather full observation of what Rory's erasure had done to poor Amy. Feeling depressed yet not really knowing it or understanding why, Amy had resorted to comfort eating to fill the void left to by Rory's abscence. Given this was going on a good few weeks, they had a fair stockpile of not-intended-for-human-consumption foods, and the compulsive eating, you can probably tell what's happening to the redhead's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, as many could testify, was a very thin girl. Not the case now. You can't call a girl thin if she had a muffin top that Amy had, nor if she had the badonkadonk that Amy also sported, one that wasn't well hidden by Amy's ever-so-shrinking jeans. Her once fairly flat chest was now a high-C cup nearly on full display despite Amy usually wearing a sweater.

Otherwise, her now wide hips and chunky lovehandles stretching her jeans and sweater to near ripping point made her complete unrecognizable from the front.  The Doctor peered in on Amy, somewhat dreading the confrontation he was about to have.  It wasn't so much that telling her she should lose weight would be awkward.  The Doctor was fully aware this was frowned upon in many cultures.  Mostly, it was that this weight gain was obviously just a symptom of her greater depression, and that he could do nothing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was standing in front of an antique food dispenser in one of the TARDIS' many storage rooms.  It had been from some alien encounter or other and the Doctor had accepted it as a gift, although never used it.  Now Amy appeared so desperate for consolation she was searching the whole ship to new things to eat.

Got this from the Vorgolon lobster people-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" Amy said, taking another bite, \"Just tell me what you want to tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" he toughened his voice a little, but tried not to sound too serious, \"Pond, you've been putting on a lot of weight lately and, while I do understand it's from feeling depressed, I also understand it's not a healthy thing and you will probably regret if you continue to get all . . . \" he motioned his hands in a vague circle, trying to come up with a word, \". . . blobby.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's expression barely changed on her almost-but-not-quite-yet chubby face.</span></div></div>",

She wasn't at waddling size yet, although her hips were getting there even if her more ample ass and bloated belly were behind.  Her aimed his sonic screwdriver at her and took some readings.  They showed something, but not something he immediately recognized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, Amy,\" the Doctor said.  Amy turned around, annoyance plastered all over her tired face as she swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Amy said as the Doctor approached waving his screwdriver at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, yes, yes, definitely something, somebody's put something in you, or something's put something in you, hard to tell right now,\" the sonic screwdriver gave off some whirring sounds which the Doctor seemed to partially recognize.  \"They're emitting waves, yes, waves attuned to your own human brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy spread her arms, \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't tell what they are yet, but maybe if I send out a counterwave we can at least see what happens when we cancel them out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked more confused than ever.  The Doctor adjusted something on his sonic screwdriver.  He waved it over Amy.  In seconds, he saw the dull, tired expression drop from her face.  Her feet shifted, spreading apart a little.  Her hands went to her belly, squeezing it in her sweater, then letting it go, hovering over it.  She squinted, pursing her lips, then her mouth and eyes opened as wide as possible.  She was on decibel from shouting, and the Doctor couldn't tell whether her primary emotion was anger, fear, or equal combination of both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" she said, trying to keep her cool.  Her eyes looked down at her stomach, having to pass her swollen breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Amy, clearly something's been done to you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a blimp!\" Amy suddenly shouted, once again grabbing her stomach, gripping it through her tight sweater.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that bad yet-\" the Doctor said, contemplating that maybe he should have done a little research into this first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell has happened to me?\" she was yelling now.  Thoughts of all the eating she had done lately drifted through her mind, and she in part realized that she had done this to herself, even if something forced her to do it.  That actually made it even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you worry, we'll sort this out,\" the Doctor said authoritatively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's face crinkled as if she were holding back tears, at which point she reached up to feel her bloated cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, Doctor, I'm a whale, a pig!  What the hell did you let happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't let it happen, it seemed natural-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is <i>this</i> natural?\" she shook her belly at it, apparently at this point she noticed her wide hips for the first time and moaned in frustration, and rolled her eyes as she craned her neck to see her ass sticking out behind her.  \"Oh, it just keeps getting better, doesn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor's next words of encouragement and a plan were interrupted as Amy's stomach rumbled, gurgled, and jiggled in unison.  Amy blushed and gulped at the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm hungry, Doctor,\" she said, the anger clearly overtaking any other emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we're going to figure this out and find out what's inside you.  I think you're only thirty pounds up so far, that's not so bad, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy growled and clutched her hands at the sounds her stomach was making.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor,\" she said, stepping close to the Doctor and speaking in a clear, firm tone.  \"Fix.

The larger Amy got, the harder it would be to fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about a trip to Arcateen III, Amy?\" the Doctor said, sidling up to Amy, almost bumping into one of her wider hips. She popped open the can and took a sip, holding the weird, jiggly snack in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds familiar, doesn't it?\" Amy said, still annoyed, still with that dull, tired look on her face. \"Weren't you just talking about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was!\" the Doctor said, excited Amy remembered something. She seemed momentarily confused, but then simply rubbed her tummy, took a large swig of alien soda, and belched loudly.  The Doctor rushed to the control room and set the TARDIS to go right to the Arcateen system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy followed behind. She tugged on her sweater. It was long enough to cover her swollen middle, but tight enough that it still showed off how soft she was getting. The only thing it hid was how close her jeans button was to popping off for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaned on a railing, still tugging at her sweater with a vaguely confused look on her face like she couldn't understand why it didn't feel right. The TARDIS was already materializing on the Arcateen III surface. He checked a receiver to see what signals were coming through. Very little, it turned out, as predicted. The Arcateen atmosphere might not block out all electromagnetic waves, but it got the bulk of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't eat that,\" the Doctor said, but too late. Amy had popped the strange jello-like thing into her mouth and swallowed. The Doctor cringed. He wasn't entirely sure what it was but thought he should have remembered something about that particular item of food. Amy patted her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp, excuse me,\" she covered her mouth while still holding her stomach. The Doctor stared at her until it made her uncomfortable. \"What?\" she said, annoyed, still holding onto her stomach which was now making some rather strange noises that she seemed to not notice at all. Then the Doctor remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right, that was human food all right. Very high calorie, very dense, meant to pack a lot of energy into a small space. Not really supposed to be eaten like a snack. How do you feel?\" the Doctor went right from exposition mode to concern mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Why are we here, Doctor?\" Amy said. She was leaning against the railing near the TARDIS console, holding her growling, churning stomach in both hands. It bubbled a little forward. Amy lurched, but her expression of shock was short lived. Whatever waves were going into her brain were taking a while to wear off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably good for another five pounds . . .\" the Doctor said cautions. Amy's eyes widened slowly as he mouth dropped open. With a loud gurgle and a resounding ping, her jeans popped open under her sweater. She grabbed her puffy tummy in both hands just in time for it to round out further, her sides stretching both her jeans and sweater as her lovehandles took another hit. Amy screamed, looked at the Doctor, then back to her stomach, and screamed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Amy, now that we're here we are blocking the signals to your brain-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smacked the Doctor upside the head, causing him to reel away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You let me <i>eat</i> that knowing it'd make me even <i>fatter</i>?\" she yelled, hitting him in the shoulder this time. She had awakened just in time to feel new fat forming under her skin, and it was not pleasant<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I forgot and I didn't think you'd eat anything in sight,\" the Doctor said, backing off. \"Look, whatever was making you eat and, ah, grow yourself, it's being blocked while we're here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief,\" Amy said angrily. She yanked at her jeans. They were far too tight. Her thighs and ass felt crammed in them. Even her increasingly tight sweater was comfortably loose in comparison. \"What's doing this to me, Doctor?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a question-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why? Why would anybody want . . . this?\" she spread her arms to indicate her fattened figure. She didn't need to look in a mirror to know that she was a few pounds from chubby, if not there already. And if chubby felt like this, she really didn't want to know what fat felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, Amy, you have the best minds at work on this,\" the Doctor said, strutting around her, glancing with an amused look at Amy's widened backside, \"While in the Arcateen atmosphere no signals from space can get through without heavy distortion. If something is doing this on purpose, it's going to have to come right to us.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm still hungry!\" Her love handles bad started to peek over the waistband of her way-too-small jeans, giving her a, rather cute, muffintop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arcateen III? Well, yes and no. Yes, in that you're PROBABLY not being forced to shove confections down your gullet at a constant rate. No, in that the atmosphere of Arcateen can't stop you from ACTUALLY being hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, what CAN stop me from actually being hungry?\" she inquired, angrily taking another swig of her soda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't really stop that\" the good Doctor started, \"but I can try to keep your mind off it.\" He started walking to the doors of the TARDIS. Amy followed. \"How about a look at some Arcatinian culture?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded begrudgingly. \"Alright.\" She tossed her now empty can on the floor. \"I'll, uh, pick that up later...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two opened up the doors, and were immediately greeted by loud jazzy music. They stepped out into the nosy streets of Arcatavia, the largest city on their planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS PLACE IS REALLY LOUD!\" Amy yelled, her voice muted by the music and chatter of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, NO LOST AND FOUND! NOT ON THIS PLANET!\" The Doctor obviously didn't hear her right, and Amy didn't hear him. \"ARCATEEN III IS A PLANET OF MUSICIANS, IN COMPARISON TO IV, WHICH HAS ARTISTS, AND II, WHICH IS FULL OF YOUTUBERS! ARCATEEN V IS UNINHABITED, AND I DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT ARCATEEN I!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, THE MUSIC IS GREAT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor realized talking just wouldn't work so he just started walking, and Amy was following closely. The people all looked like they were made of water, they're interior systems being completely visible. Nonetheless, Amy found a way to bump into every single one she passed, no doubt because of her significantly wider hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to a clearing, she was able to see the phenomenon that was the sky on their planet: completely black, but with three suns. If the music wasn't as deafening as it was, The Doctor would have told her about how the sky is black because of the extremely dense stratosphere, and that she'd be safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping into the clearing, a throbbing pain entered Amy's head. \"DOCTOR!\" He didn't hear, as he just kept walking. \"DOCTOR!!!\" Again, no response. Before she could get a third 'Doctor' out, she stopped in her tracks. A glossy look covered her eyes, as before, and one thought rushed through her head: food. She split off from The Doctor's trail and started heading for the smell of food. The Doctor, oblivious to his companion's detour, continued on, stupidly pointing out attractions to no one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking her own way through the crowd, her sense of smell finally brought her to a building with odd characters on their sign. '\u00b6&lt;\u00b5~\u00b0\u00f0\u00df' \"Must be French or something\" she thought. She opened the doors and the smell of food blasted her in the face as much as the music from earlier. It smelled like heaven. She walked inside and let the doors swing shut. The quaint little restaurant was significantly quieter, and Amy could finally hear herself think. Granted all she was thinking, really, was 'food' but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the water people greeted her. \"Junbaar colinkwa ecurecu quidasta te! Homarshta enslabadabass yum'po!\" is what he would have said if the TARDIS translator wasn't working. \"Ah, a new face! Welcome friend. We love having off-worlders come in to try our cuisine.\" The Arcatanian led Amy to an alien looking table. \"Come, sit, and I will bring you one of our finest meals, free of charge!\" Amy sat her plush rear down in the chair, a few inches of flab hanging off each edge. A few moments later, the friendly Arcatanian returned with an excellent cut of Arcatese sky rhino prime rib. It was bright blue. \"Enjoy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd enjoy she would, as she dug right into the blue meat. It cut like a not knife through butter, and it melted in her mouth. It was EASILY the best meat she'd ever tasted, second only to the giant salmon of New New New New New York. Bite after bite of the bright meat entered her gullet, and soon enough, she'd finished the whole thing. 24 oz. of prime rib had made their way to her stomach, and it'd find its way elsewhere on her body as well. Moments after finishing, her body started absorbing the meat into her OWN meat. Her already huge gut started to recede, only to be replaced with jiggly blubber. Finally done putting up with Amy's tummy, her sweater rode all the way up the pale globe, and with the way it was filling out, she'd never be able to tug it down again. Resting on her belly was her mammaries, and the mammaries they were. Her boobs had quickly risen through the ranks of bra size, quickly passing B, C, D, making it up to DD size. Her bra was cutting into her back fat badly, and threatened to snap if her breasts grew any more. Down south, though, was where most of the prime rib went. Her hips had flared outwards even more, letting more than a few inches peer over the edge of her seat. Her booty had grown into a full fledged badonkadonk. Each cheek was well past basketball size, and a gaping hole had ripped down the middle. Her thighs matched up with her ass, the cellulite coated pillars wide enough to rival tree trunks. She'd finally passed chubby and made it to fat. And her fattening wouldn't stop there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your prime rib, ma'am? Would you like some desert?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have desert?\" the fatter girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid! Tonight, we have an Apalapucian Cheesecake, drizzled with light chocolate, and Desperusian Sundae with a side of Kinjanan Graham Crackers. Which will it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, could I get both?\" Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, yes! In fact, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'll be right back.\" He left to retrieve her desert, and an evil smirk spread across her face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor, still prowling the streets of Arcatavia, was getting further and further away from the restaurant Amy was currently feasting in, and completely unaware of what lie ahead for her. After some time though...</span></div></div>",

He was distracted by the loud, vibrant city and let his natural enthusiasm get the better of him. Fortunately, Amy couldn't have gotten far, not in her fattened state. He looked around where he had last been certain she was there. Left, nothing, right, nothing. He grabbed a local. He spoke slowly and carefully, known that even the TARDIS' powerful translator would only be working minimally in the Arcateen atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see an alien woman around here? Pale, red hair, a little on the plump side?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody like that went into Hormahsta's,\" he said, pointing, and he Doctor ran through the nearby door of a small, cozy restaurant. He first noticed a pleasant, smiling hostess, then noticed she was only mirroring the glee of her boss who was virtually clapping his hands in excitement as he placed a giant, ice-creamed covered cake in front of Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, poor Amy,\" the Doctor said. In that short time Amy had already grown. She had now completely outgrown her clothing. Her legs, once long and slender, were now at least three times their original width and looked stubby attached to her wide, plush hips. Her belly was round, globular even, and only look smaller next to her oddly bloated breasts crammed into her sweater. The weight was mostly going to her lower half, tapering off so that her face, while softer, was not nearly as fat as the rest of her. She had the dull, tired look from before, but a faint smile was on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you very much,\" she said taking a fork to the desert. She moaned, her eyes fluttering, as she ate. This was clearly having a stronger effect on her dulled mind than the mass produced junk food from the vending machines on the TARDIS. She let on hand rub her engorged tummy as she gave a thumbs up to the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have never been so honored!\" the alien said. The Doctor could only see that they were simply so flattered by Amy's love of their food that they had no idea how much it was harming her. He rushed forward, holding out his psychic paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Health inspector!\" he said, waving it around. \"Here to inspect the health! What do we have here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy rolled her eyes, then took another large bite, her eyes continued to roll further back as an orgasmic look crossed her face. \"D-Doctor, this is so good. Why are you even here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M'am, we need to test this-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" the owner yanked the Doctor's paper away, then threw it back at him. The Doctor frowned. Of course the psychic paper, relying on subtle, close-range psychic waves, would be useless on Arcateen. \"You can't come in here bothering my customers! The lady is simply enjoying her meal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm-mmmm!\" Amy said, her cheeks puffed up with food. She nodded vigorously, parts of her body shaking that had never shaken before, then patted her belly to release a little belch. \"Just let me finish then we can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she enjoying it?\" the Doctor said sternly. He aimed his sonic screwdriver at Amy, concentrating hard to get the setting just right. He only needed to break this mental hold on her long enough to get her back to the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kept stuffing her face, but the Doctor saw the change. He saw her dull eyes grow alert, that slightly smile drop, her limp hand resting on her belly suddenly grab the rolls suddenly there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Schmoctor!\" she said, her mouth full, but still eating. Then, after swallowing, belched strongly enough that her she was surprised by how much her breasts jiggled. She gaped wide-eyed at them, then gasped at her exposed belly. \"DOCTOR!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come Amy, let's pay the man-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAH!\" Amy screamed, grabbing the sides of her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, Amy, you had a nice meal-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the owner, trying to stand but falling out of her chair on her soft, enormous ass. Her jeans shredded further, leaving her pale, cellulate-ridden legs bare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me?\" she yelled at him. She stood up, almost knocking the table over as she seemed incapable of taking in her new weight. Had she not been half naked, the Doctor thought she would have looked even more imposing than a normal, thin Amy ever would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cook you a nice meal, why so angry?\" the owner looked from Amy to the Doctor, confused, defiant. \"You don't want to finish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor saw it before Amy felt it. Her belly growled, her eyes darted to the unfinished desert. She looked helplessly at the Doctor who still aimed the sonic screwdriver at her, fending off whatever mental control was coming over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, more than anything,\" Amy said with a whimper as she grasped at her roaring belly.</span></div></div>",

Her jeans tore a little more down the sides. The Doctor, his sonic screwdriver aimed at her, was estimating her weight at around 180. The thin young woman he knew was no a chubby, pear-shaped eating machine. She gritted her teeth and pushed herself away from the table, heading to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hurry!\" she said, to the shocked faces of the restaurateurs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, our foods not good enough for you?\" but their voices were drowned out by the deafening music outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor latched onto Amy's softer hand as he pulled her through the streets. This had been a disaster. He felt her stop at one point, and turned to see her, glassy eyed, stuffing a approximation of a chicken leg into her mouth. She moaned, not that you could hear it, and her belly quivered, expending sides with her hips every so slightly. This, as Amy's wide eyes indicated, woke her up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET ME OUT OF HERE!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M TRYING BUT YOU TO STOP EATING!\" the Doctor yelled, dragging her along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's mind kept going in and out of awareness. Whatever was being transmitted into her brain was fighting hard to keep control. Amy found the best way to fight it, and ignore the gnawing hunger it brought, was to focus her how her belly and breasts jumped up and down each step, how running was so much harder than it used to be suddenly, and her hips were swaying her back and forth more than she was used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pointed to an alley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THE TARDIS IS THERE! WE'RE ALMOST HOME FREE!\" he knew it was half true. Once on the TARDIS they would still have Amy's growing problem to deal with. \"AND WE SHOULD HURRY! I THINK WE JUST RAN OUT ON YOUR TAB!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snorted as the sounded lessened in the alley as they approached the TARDIS. \"I'm positive I don't have the cash on me to pay for whatever I just ate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor snickered, \"Nobody carries that much money on them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy threatened to smack him again. \"Do <i>not</i> make fun of me right now, Doctor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey closed the door behind them and the sound died away. Amy held her head in her hands. She slowly walked to a bench near the center of the control room and sat down. Her ass spread out under her, tearing her jeans completely off finally. Her belly squished out in front of her, as did her breasts. With her puffy cheeks and double chin forming, she looked almost nothing like her old self. She growled loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do? I can feel it in my head and I'm doing all I can to fight it,\" she said. \"What if it never stops? I'm already a whale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor put on his comforting, take charge tone as he knelt next to her. \"I'm sorry, Amy, this was a bad idea. Horrible idea. I knew Arcateen food had undesirable effects on humans from past experiences, but I thought if we could stop whatever is being transmitted into you it wouldn't matter. Even without this . . . brain . . . transmitting thing I shouldn't have brought you here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sat straight up and patted her bulbous belly. \"This is a little more than undesirable, Doctor. I think I almost got stuck walking through the door. Why would someone want to do this to me? To anyone!\" Amy felt a stabbing pain in her head grow. She grunted and held it tight, \"D-doctor, I can't fight it much longer . . . aaaaaaaah . . .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot deaf to her pleas, the Doctor was still engrossed in his own thoughts. He had no idea why someone would want to fatten up his companion. If they wanted to, they certainly arranged for quite a clever trap. Fattening her in such a way that the first thought would be to block out the waves, and that the Doctor's first idea on how to do that would be to come to this particular planet with food that had an almost instantly fattening effect on humans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr that could be one big coincidence, and that whatever was going after Amy might be doing so with no consideration for the Doctor's presense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, even if he could find someone who was actually fattening people to this extent, Amy would already be too fat. And he could already tell that once that happened, there would be nothing that could protect him from Amy's wrath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Doctor,\" Amy said, still clutching her head. \"I n-need something to eat...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's stomach wouldn't stop growling with hunger. It was rumbling, gurgling, and jiggling all at once. She looked down at her stomach, craning her neck to see past her swollen breasts, and couldn't help but be shocked at the size of it. Amy's stomach was the size of a globe and wouldn't quiet down it's needs for something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy hauled herself to her feet, and moaned as she could feel her fatter butt cheeks wouldn't stop jiggling for a solid five seconds after she got up. She walked over to the Doctor, fought very hard to ignore the fact she was almost waddling, and faced the Doctor. The Doctor, however was fighting really hard to ignore the fact that Amy's swollen stomach and fat butt were completely on display in her ruined outfit. While Amy tried not to cry when she finally noticed that even her hands had a bit of fat on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has to be something we can do.\" Amy said. \"We can find out who is doing this to me before i get too big, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, probably,\" The Doctor nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good enough for me,\" Amy said. \"What we should probably do is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's next words were cut off by herself this time as whatever was making her so hungry then added something else to her besides brainwaves.

She jumped and stared at the Time Lord, shock written on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" the Doctor asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was about to say yes, but she didn't know that herself. The hunger had decreased a little bit, but she could feel something else growing in her mind. It took her a while to figure out what that thing was, but once she did, she couldn't deny it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Amy realized she had gone silent again. She looked at the Doctor again, but a question had formed in the back of her mind. One she couldn't ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much to i weigh now?\" Amy asked the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pulled out his sonic screwdriver and started scanning her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When we were in that diner,\" The Doctor said as he worked. \"I estimated your weight at 180 pounds. Then you had that chicken leg.\" He said nervously as he finished scanning her. He checked the results. \"You are now... 181 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor went silent as Amy took in the news. After a few seconds, she realized that the Doctor was expecting her to yell at him or something. Although, for the first time all day, she didn't want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a mirror?\" Amy asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was surprised by the unexpectedness of the question. Nevertheless, he pressed a few buttons on the console, and a full length mirror sprouted from the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took one look in the mirror at her new body and her jaw dropped. The young, modelesque kissogram she classified herself as was long gone, and in its place was a fat, redheaded pear. Her cheeks were noticeably fatter and she was close to having a permanent double chin. However, Amy's face wasn't the problem. Everything below it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor one thing, her breasts had engorged themselves, straining her A cup bra within an inch of its life with her new double Ds. Admittedly, though, when she had first woken up from having her mind dulled, she was a little excited that she could now classify her breasts as tits. Her arms seemed to have grown as well as the sleeved of her extra tight sweater made her arms uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good amount of weight, though, had gone to her bulbous middle. Her stomach swelled outwards so that she looked several months pregnant. Although, Amy figured the only thing she would be pregnant with would be a food baby. Her belly jiggled every time one of her feet while she was walking, and her love handles personally made sure her sweater couldn't fit over it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majority of her weight, though, went to Amy's lower half. What was the name of those horrible reality show people from America? The Kardashians? Well, whoever they were, Amy's fat ass out shined the size any of theirs. Her butt cheeks were each the size of a soccer ball and made her ass more classified as a full fledged badonkadonk, something that excited Amy. Her legs, once long and slender, were barely recognizable anymore as her thighs touched no matter how much of her stance she widened, even to the point where fat spread down to her ankles. Amy's hips were noticeable wider as now, she had the movie trope \"Hartman's Hips,\" something mostly seen in cartoons where a female character had hips wider than their shoulders. She knew it wouldn't be long before her hips gave her trouble fitting in doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stared at her new adipose in awe, not believing she had gotten this fat so fast.The feeling she had in the back of her head eventually showed itself once she turned her back towards the mirror, looked behind her and got a good look at her ass. This time, she was able to classify the feeling. It was a mixture of joy and excitement out of seeing her fat body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy stood there for so long staring at her new form that she completely forgot about the Doctor. At least until he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pond, don't you think we should do something so we can stop you from gaining weight?\" The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" Amy said, now looking at the Doctor. \"We're not doing anything to get rid of any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy then dragged her hands up her swollen stomach to show what she was talking about. She only confused the Doctor, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Amy...\" The Doctor said. \"May i ask, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might as well come clean,\" Amy said, shrugging her shoulders (which made her new cleavage jiggle for a solid few seconds). \"I am a new FA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor still looked confused at her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FA stands for Fat Admirer,\" Amy translated. \"It basically means that while most women find being skinny being attractive, I find being fat attractive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor slowly took in her words. What is the Doctor's reaction?</span></div></div>",

She was no longer holding her head down, clutching at her fat, and her expression was not one of pain and distress but instead joy, even excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me,\" The Doctor said slowly, \"That you're suddenly, for no reason at all, okay with being fat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded. \"Not for no reason, Doctor. The reason is that it's amazing, I feel so incredible and gorgeous and sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy, her legs bare and her sweater doing nothing to hide her growth, did a little spin to show off her body. She wobbled, and jiggled, and hadn't quite gotten the hang of her new center of gravity. She giggled as she almost fell, a sound that sounded very alien coming out of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoops! I guess I'll have to get use to my new figure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" the Doctor looked at her closely. She was more animated, more responsive, but that look in her eyes was too close to look she had when she stuffed her face in the restaurant. It had to be the influence of this feeder entity. That made the Doctor more concerned for Amy than ever. This thing was able to control Amy's actions to alter her body drastically, and then control her reaction to those changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForget fattening beautiful thin humans. That kind of power could be used to wreak havoc on a galactic scale, should the entity be powerful enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then!\" the Doctor clapped his hands together. \"I suppose that's all sorted out then, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy nodded, the subtle smile not leaving her face. She tried to clasp her hands in front of her and found her breasts and belly in the way, giggled in that unnerving way, and then placed them on her far too wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got to take care of something to, er, get us off this planet, you know. Why don't you . . . maybe get some new clothes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's face lit up, but there was still something strange, dull about her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Doctor,\" she said, \"I should have known you wouldn't appreciate this kind of naked beauty. You're right, though. Oh this is going to be fun! I've never had curves when I tried clothes on before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Amy went to gleefully dress herself, the Doctor went to work. His screwdriver barely worked to interrupt the psychic feed going into Amy. If that feed was strong enough to make her ignore what was happening to her, to even enjoy it, then he was going to need something more powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_____________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy must have spent an hour going down the seemingly endless rows of clothing in the TARDIS's wardrobe room. The whole time her thoughts kept cycling through the same themes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm so huge and I love it.</i><br>\r\n<i>The way my hips sway, almost taking me with them when I walk, oh, heavenly!</i><br>\r\n<i>Oh my gorgeous, swollen tits, the compliment my belly beautifully!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on. They were thoughts that Amy in the right mind never would have had. Even when she was thin and she knew she was beautiful, she didn't really think about it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried on clothes at random, often being delighted that she didn't know her size and wound up ripping them dressing herself. An hour ago that would have sent her into shock, but now it pleased her. Even fat, she was no more a fashion hound than when she was thin, though, and gravitated towards simple, albeit much more form fitting, outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant pair of jeans looked amazing on her, she thought. Now that she had those wide hips, probably twice as wide or more than the old her, and bulbous ass, she filled them out. Up front they were tight enough to squeeze her round belly a little, and that excited her greatly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It feels like it could pop at any time, like I'm one gluttonous meal away from getting even fatter,</i> she thought. But these were not her thoughts. Her mood was being strongly influenced, her attitudes altered, but deep down, a part of her kept repeating, <i>This is wrong, this is wrong, why am I doing this?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe donned a tight sweater that just barely covered her pale, pudgy belly but showed off a little cleavage between her mellon-like breasts. Amy had never had cleavage before. She looked in a mirror, cupped them, cooed at her her breasts were too big to fully fit in her hands. She took in her pear shape, so different from her old body, with a dull smile plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor found her turned around, admiring her wide ass, and even giving her lovehandles squeezed into her sweater a jiggle. He rolled a device behind him, with a screen and bulbs and what looked like a directional microphone. It was designed to disrupt electrical fields, and this was fine tuned to do that intelligent brain waves. He hoped the entity couldn't change fast enough. He pointed it at Amy and turned it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are just one beautiful, fat cow,\" Amy said to herself. It was her voice all right, but the Doctor could not reconcile her behavior with the Amy Pond her knew. She saw him, and looked over. \"Oh, hi Doctor. What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy blinked and shook her head. Something was buzzing in her head. She looked back at the mirror and forced another smile. She felt her rounder cheeks. Her lovely face had taken the least gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, I look like a big chubby pear, don't I?\" she said, glancing between the mirror and the Doctor, but she sounded less sure now. Her head began to ache, the buzzing sound growing almost as prominent as the powerful joy she had felt. \"I-I wonder if my face will get fatter. I-I-I hope so, some plump cheeks and a double-double chin...\" The Doctor saw it in her eyes the moment Amy got herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I saying?\" she said, her voice trembling, one hand rubbing her temple, the other still holding her soft cheek. \"I can't get fatter, no way, I'm already a whale. I'm disgusting!\" She turned to the doctor, her eyes twitching, her mouth trying to frown while fighting to smile. \"Oh god, it's changing me, isn't it? Not just my body but my mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor nodded, stepping forward. Sure, there was fear and uncertainty in her voice, but also that old fighting spirit she always had. But there was something else, too, and even the Doctor couldn't ignore how even her frightened declarations were tinged with the sensuality that the feeder entity had forced on her to make her love her new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay with me, Amy,\" the Doctor said. \"Let's fix this.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The Doctor entered the kitchen, seeing Amy already in there, going through the fridge (admittedly, this had been the norm for the past few months now). The sight of Amy frankly gobsmacked the Doctor. The thin young woman he once knew had been replaced by a chubby, pear shaped, eating machine. Her face had gained a noticeable amount of weight, telling by her double chin and round cheeks. However, Amy's face wasn't the problem, everything below it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts had swelled to the extent of her increasing two whole bra sizes, and shook and wobbled as she walked, which excited Amy. Admittedly, she did have a good amount of back fat to go with her chest, but she accepted it. Her stomach had swelled out, eclipsing her feet in a big jiggly mess. When she was full, it made her look six months pregnant. Her stomach had given her a nice set of love handles that could be seen even in the loosest of clothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, none of this held a candle to Amy's lower half. It seems like at least half of the weight Amy gains goes to her hips, butt, and thighs. Her butt was the biggest out of all her proportions. It was a big jiggly mess that stretched out all her jeans, leaving her in a pair of yoga pants, which were clearly short termed as the seams were stretched and her underwear was outlined across the back. Amy's thighs had grown thick but jiggly, to the point where they resembled tree trunks and rubbed together as she walked. Her hips had expanded to the point where they were as wide as her shoulders, and caused her to have trouble fitting in seats, going through doors, and pulling her pants up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, from the Doctor's perspective, she was oblivious to all of this, as she never could stop eating the delicious alien food he had in the TARDIS kitchen. Last week, she was accidentally given some food from a race that had an instantly fattening affect on humans. That really helped her grow into how she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor figured that Amy had been living in depression without knowing why for far too long, and it was time for her to go back to normal. He approached Amy, having practiced how the conversation might go down in his head twelve times now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Amy was too concerned with deciding from the contents of the fridge to notice the Doctor. At least, until he cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Doctor,\" Amy said, looking into the fridge again for something to eat. \"How are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, fine..\" the Doctor said, preparing his words. \"... See, we need to talk about something, Pond.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right,\" Amy nodded, not really paying attention, too busy staring inside the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See, i think you've been depressed for a little too long,\" the Doctor said. \"It might be time for us to start adventuring again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight, okay,\" Amy said, subconsciously rubbing her swollen stomach, looking through the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right!\" the Doctor said. \"So shall we just...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitement quickly dismissed as he saw Amy had barely even moved a muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, are you listening to me?\" The Doctor asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Amy mumbled. \"Do i want the ice cream or the frozen yogurt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis annoyed the Doctor. Random people he could deal with ignoring him, as they usually did. But his friends never ignored him when he was trying to talk. It always made him angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy!\" the Doctor snapped. \"Can you stop looking through the fridge for a moment so i can tell you you've gotten fat and you need to lose the weight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor blurted it all out before he had a chance to realized what he was saying. He then quickly covered his mouth, hardly believing he had just said that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, it was that that got Amy's attention. She closed the door to the fridge and looked at the Doctor, her eyes wide, and her jaw dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Amy do next?</span></div></div>",

After all, in the past, Amy had done some pretty bad things to people who so much as insulted the Scottish, but they never said that she was fat. This might have been the Doctor's imagination, though, but he thought Amy looked even more intimidating now than she ever did skinny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the Doctor waited for Amy to explode at him, Amy rubbed her swollen stomach and closed her mouth. Then, her face formed into the biggest smile he had ever seen on her in his life. She rubbed her belly even more as she prepared to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Doctor!\" Amy said, her hands running up and down her body. She looked down at her stomach, which made her cran her neck to see past her swollen breasts. \"I've been hoping you would say something about it for the last month now. Looks like i finally got fat enough to break down your rational side that didn't want to insult people. Nice job, though, not saying anything for so long. Most blokes don't last a week before saying something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy talked, the Doctor grew more and more confused by her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure i understand,\"the Doctor said. \"Haven't you been gaining weight because of the depression?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Amy laugh so hard most of her body jiggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Amy laughed. \"The depression didn't make me fat. I did this to myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she could tell that the Doctor was more confused than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought this was happening to me without me noticing?\" Amy asked. \"Very unlikely. I'm up to 180 pounds. Well, that's what it said last week. I uh, can't exactly see the scale anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor could hear actual pride in her voice now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean,\" the Doctor began. \"That you've been doing this to yourself on purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get it,\" Amy said. She smacked her ass, and laughed as it took a really long time to stop jiggling. \"It's a fetish that I've had for a couple of years now, but never gave in to because of society's definition of beautiful. Cause, see, in my mind...\" She grabbed her swollen stomach and shook it, causing a jiggling mess. \"...This is beautiful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh,\" the Doctor said. \"Admittedly, when i imagined this conversation in my head, you were having a completely different reaction to being called fat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what happens when you call a willing fat girl fat,\" Amy said. \"She likes it and thanks you for finally using that word. Still, though, nice job waiting so long finally using it. You would be liked by the fat women of Britain. But as you actually did use the word, you're all right with me, too. I mean, i have a really nice pear shape.\" Her hand went to her butt. \"Just look at the size of my bum!\" Amy said excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor was getting a bit of an understanding of what Amy was talking about, but his mind was still plagued with questions; How long had she felt like this? When did she decide it was time to get fat? How big did she plan to get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one thing, though, Doctor,\" Amy said, rubbing her belly and slapping her fat ass at the same time.</span></div></div>",

Her belly bulged out from the incredibly tight jeans and love handles popped out of the sides. Her breast and upper belly strained the white t-shirt and River knew that she would never be able to button the denim jacket again, not without putting up a terrible struggle and ending up with a jacket that has lost at least one of its buttons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, all of this was the fault of...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It doesn't affect anything outside of the Vortex, but people inside could be stuck for years.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we are stuck for god knows how long in the vortex?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. But don't worry! The TARDIS has so many things to do that if you took every living thing in the universe, stuck them into the TARDIS and had them do everything, it would take 20,000,000 years for them to see it all. And as for food and water, the TARDIS never runs out as it produces it's own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that makes me feel better, but what if I got lost exploring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was what I was going to talk to you about next. Give me your wrist.\" Clara reached out and gave the Doctor her wrist. He put a watch on it. \"Now, this watch has a built in teleported that will automatically teleport you to the main console room. It also has a communicator built in so you and I can talk to each other. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure.\" Clara replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Now run along and have fun!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Clara replied as she walked towards the hallway. She was happy. She had the whole of the TARDIS to explore, she could talk to the Doctor whenever she wanted, she could...</span></div></div>",
