You then quickly rush to the bathroom mirror fearing the worst, fortunately your reflection put your fears to rest, it was just a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk back to your bed you laugh thinking what a bizarre dream you\u2019d had. You were at the club having a blast until you had a little too much to drink and slapped the ass of the wrong girl. Well apparently she wasn\u2019t having a good night because she quickly turned around and stared you down, and then the music stopped and everyone around you froze in place, except for her. Then she starts walking towards you yelling at the top of her lungs about how all men were sexist bastards that saw women as nothing more than sex objects and eye candy. And that you were going to have to pay for it. They she starts babbling something and next thing you know, everyone guy in the place is staring at you, and you can see your reflection in their eyes but it\u2019s not you, in one you\u2019re a busty blonde, then a red head in a micro miniskirt, then you\u2019re black with a huge ass, and then you\u2019re a petite Asian. Then your head starts spinning and you run out of the club and the next thing you knew, you\u2019re wakening up in your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock you see its lunch time, and after a night like that you could defiantly go for something to eat. So you leave your room and head for the kitchen, where you find your roommate Joey, \u201cMorning Man,\u201d you say, opening the fridge without looking at him. \u201cAh hey I\u2019m Joey, Will\u2019s roommate; I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve met.\u201d He says looking at you smiling, you laugh turning to him to say, \u201cHa ha very funny\u2026.\u201d Suddenly you look past him to the reflection in the sliding glass window, it wasn\u2019t yours!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you look like?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Keep in mind this is your roommates type of woman.)</span></div></div>",

You then quickly look down, to see that it wasn\u2019t just the mirror; you were slender and curvy with long brown hair, and wearing a black thong with a gray long sleeved shirt that barely covered your stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://galleries2.amakings.com/obsessedwithmyself/pictures/118-sizzling-hot-and-gorgeous-babe/pictures/3.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://galleries2.amakings.com/obsessedw...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand the squirming at the thought of your current form, you get the strange feeling that you\u2019re being watch. Turning around you find Joey staring at you practically drooling. You felt weird enough and didn\u2019t even know how to respond, all you could do was try to cover up as much as you could and rush back to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou burst through your door way closing the door behind you. You then close your eyes and sit on the floor with your back to the door trying to figure out how this could be possible. \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening. This can\u2019t be happening.\u201d You mutter to yourself, \u201cI mean one minute I\u2019m me and the next I\u2019m\u2026.\u201d Suddenly you open your eyes and look down. You were back to normal, confused you stand up and rush back to your bathroom mirror. You were back to normal, but what was that, are you still dreaming, but it felt so real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a knock on your door, you figured Joey was probably wondering what just happened. \u201cHey, is everything alright in there?\u201d Joey asks, \u201cYeah man all good.\u201d You respond, walking towards the door, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened man, I introduced myself and she freaked and ran away.\u201d Joey says, as you open the door, \u201cWait what you mean she?\u201d you quickly think to yourself. You then look at Joey but something was different, the two of you were suppose to be about the same height but you were looking up at him, and he was looking down at you smiling, \u201cAh hey I\u2019m sorry if I startled you back there\u2026\u201d he says, suddenly you look down to see that you were a girl again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell!!\u201d you exclaim rushing back to the bathroom, \u201cWait what did I do now?\u201d Joey says confused as he follows you, He stands there watching you panic in front of the mirror. \u201cHey calm down what\u2019s wrong, is there anything I can do, and where is Will? He asks, you then turn to him and say, \u201cWhat are you talking about, I am Will!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey is speechless, he has no idea how to respond, and I mean it\u2019s not every day a person tells you they are someone else, so he didn\u2019t know what but he assumed you had brought home a drug addict or something, \u201cAh hey, just calm down everything is going to be alright.\u201d He says slowly putting his arm around you and guiding you back to the bed and sits you down. \u201cDeep breaths, do you want some water, do u need me to call someone or take you home?\u201d he ask, \u201cI am home!\u201d you exclaim, \u201cI\u2019m Will, I mean I had a nightmare just like this, then I woke up and everything was fine, then I go to the kitchen and I look like THIS,\u201d you say gesturing to your body, \u201cthen I ran back here and I was me again, and then I open the door and I\u2019m this again!\u201d you exclaim laying back on the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then get that feeling again, you look up see Joey staring at you again. \u201cHey!\u201d you exclaim as you jump up. \u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, \u201cYou know what!\u201d you say pulling the covers off the bed and wrapping them around you. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I couldn\u2019t resist. But don\u2019t worry, Will is like a brother to me I wouldn\u2019t\u2026. \u201cHe says, \u201cWell I appreciate that man, especially since I AM WILL!\u201d you exclaim, you can tell he\u2019s still skeptical, \u201cOkay I hope id never have to say this again but two years again you\u2026\u201d you says whispering a deep dark secret about him that he knew you would never tell anyone. Suddenly his expression goes from confused to shocked, \u201cWill!?\u201d he says. \u201cYeah man it\u2019s me,\u201d you say reluctantly, \u201cBut how?\u201d he asks, \u201cI don\u2019t know man, I just had this weird dream last night\u201d You say, \u201cWell what happened?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Give your more detailed version of the dream)</span></div></div>",

Grabbed it\u2026\u201d you say, \u201cWait, you grabbed her ass?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell it was really more of a slap and grab but yea\u2026\u201d you say, Suddenly Joey busts out laughing, \u201cWow man, I know you\u2019re an ass man but I\u2019ve never seen you that drunk but let me guess, she turns around and slaps you?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell actually no, worst. She spins around and she\u2019s some kind of hard core gothic chick, you know lots of makeup, piercings, pentagram necklaces.\u201d You say, \u201cWow even in your dreams you have the worst luck.\u201d He says laughing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glare at him for a moment, \u201cWell point is then it gets weird, the music stops and everyone freezes in place, like time had stopped. But then she started yelling at me saying, \u2018That\u2019s it! I\u2019m tired of chauvinist pigs like you thinking that women are nothing more objects for your amusement! You think I like being objectified just because of my physical appearance? Let\u2019s see how you like it!\u2019 Then she started babbling something and next thing I knew every guy in the bar was staring at me. And I could see my reflection in their eyes, but it wasn\u2019t me, I was a girl but it was a different girl for every guy. Then I looked back at her and she was laughing, and I looked down and my body and clothes kept changing. So I ran out of the bar as fast as I could, next thing I knew I woke up in my bed back to normal.\u201d You say, \u201cWell that was one hell of a dream, and normally id tell you not to mix your alcohols but since in at least four inches taller than you and you\u2019re wearing a thong I\u2019m pretty sure there was a little more to it than that.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait didn\u2019t you say you were going downtown last night?\u201d Joey asks, \u201cWell yeah I think so.\u201d You say, \u201cAnd I think you did say something about Nick\u2019s birthday last week.\u201d he asks, \u201cYeah\u201d you say reluctantly dreading what you knew he was getting at. \u201cAnd isn\u2019t this the shirt you were wearing last night?\u201dHe says picking a shirt up off the floor, \u201cYes!\u201d you say finally realizing that it was no dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay now let\u2019s think about this, what does it all mean? Okay you pissed off a some girl, and time freezes.\u201d He says, \u201cYeah and then she yells at me about how men objectify women because of how they look.\u201d You say, \u201cAnd then she starts babbling something then you turn into a girl and all the guys are staring at you.\u201d He says, \u201cAnd then I wake up normal, but when I go to the kitchen I\u2019m a girl again.\u201d You say, \u201cSo what did happen because you left the room?\u201d he asks, \u201cWell I know I changed after I left, but then when I came back I changed again, but now I\u2019m in my room and a girl.\u201d You say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you pace for a moment to think about everything, \u201cWait, I\u2019ve got it!\u201d Joey says, \u201cWhat?\u201d you ask, \u201cLet me try something.\u201d He says as he walks out of the room and closes the door. Suddenly you look down and you are back to normal, \u201cDid it work?\u201d he asks from the other side of the door, \u201cYeah it did what did you do?\u201d you ask, \u201cI left the room.\u201d He says walking back in causing you to turn back into a girl. \u201cOh come on!\u201d you exclaim, \u201cSorry about that, but I think I figured out the problem here\u201d he says, \u201cSo what being around other people turns me into a girl?\u201d you say jokingly. \u201cWell not exactly, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s just men.\u201d He says. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d you ask, \u201cWell think about your dream... I mean memory I guess, you said every guy in the room was staring at you. So it looks like being around guys makes you turn.\u201d He says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pause for a moment to let it all sink in; whenever you\u2019re around a guy you\u2019re going to turn into something pretty for him to look at. You can\u2019t go out into public like this, and what about work, you can\u2019t even walk around your apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(What are you going to do now?)</span></div></div>",

But you didn\u2019t have time to worry about that, you had to get out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then leave the bathroom, and try to make your way to the door; you were still in your male form so Nick must not be around. \u201cHey is everything okay?\u201d you hear him say, as you feel your body and clothes change back. \u201cYeah yeah everything is fine.\u201d You say, apparently no one can see the transformation, you must turn instantly. \u201cWould you like some water?\u201d he asks, guiding you back to the patio.</span></div></div>",

You look at your reflection in the side-view mirror as it rapidly alters itself as the cars go by. Joey doesn't seem to notice. The parking lot seems half full as you drive up to the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you let me off here?\" you ask politely.

You must be about five feet tall, with raven dark hair falling all the way to your waste. The weight of the hair forces your head to tilt up and see a six foot tall man in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel him eying you, but surprisingly, his gaze stops at your finger. Your ring finger.<br>\r\nExcuse me miss, after you.\" he says in a gentlemanly voice as he holds the door open for you.<br>\r\nYou can feel the blood rush to your face. Your not sure if you're blushing, or it's just because of the transformation.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say meekly as you quickly walk inside and head towards the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel yourself altering again as the man shuts the door and walks outside. But you're not a man.<br>\r\nYou see your reflection in one of the store windows. You're about five and a half feet now, sporting short red hair and freckles. Your skin is almost snow white, and you're much curvier than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this to me?\" you think in both exhaustion and horror, and as if fate were reading your thoughts, a man walks up behind you.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, miss.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"\"Hi.\" you say nervously.<br>\r\n\"I couldn't help but see you there and think to myself what a pity it is for a woman such as you to be alone. Would you mind my company while we wait?\"<br>\r\n\"Who talks like that?\" you think to yourself. \"I'm already waiting for someone.\" you tell him firmly.<br>\r\n\"Ah, well, yes...okay, understandable.\" he says as he tries to maintain his composure.<br>\r\nHe starts licking his lips.<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're interested later, her is my number.\" he says pulling a card out of his pocket.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I don't really...\"<br>\r\n\"Please take it.\" he insists.

But you still can't figure out if they see you as a guy or a busty red-headed chick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou duck into a woman's clothing store, knowing that the guy will have no reason to follow you here.<br>\r\n\"Hi mam, how may I help you?\" the 20 year old sales lady asks you.<br>\r\n\"I'm just browsing.\" you say, touching the sleeve of some designer coat you never heard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She called me mam. She sees me as a woman\" you think. But this store has a glass front and an open door. You're pretty sure the creepy guy with the card is still peeping at you from somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a blouse. Is there a place I can try this? you ask, just trying to get out of the strangers line of sight.<br>\r\n\"We have a change area at the back.\" She answers.<br>\r\nYou quickly walk towards that back of the store and duck between some swinging doors.<br>\r\nFor a second, you are unseen by anyone, but suddenly there is another woman in there, who just walked out of one of the change booths.</span></div></div>",

Judging by the pictures on the page, this looks like it could be helpful. You see an illustrated picture of a girl playing the tambourine, and an arrow that points to a completely different looking girl in the same pose, also playing a tambourine. As you scroll down the page, there is a drawing of a guy in some traditional dancing uniform and a tambourine, with an arrow pointing to another picture of the girl from the first illustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately click the translate button. The text translates to English, and you are treated to this description:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrigin:<br>\r\nThe eye-candy enchantment has been traced back to the Menhitians tribes in Guatemala. It was cast on young women as a right of passage, so that they were better able to attain their desired husbands. The practice was started after refusal of one chief's ugliest daughters as a gift by the rival tribes son almost caused a war. Thinking that it was her looks that caused him to reject her, she ran to her local &lt;untranslatable&gt; to make her look more appealing. The spell succeeded, and the Prince immediately took her hand in union. It was said that the prince couldn't refuse her, and that her advise led to the golden age of her two tribes.<br>\r\nIt's original name long since forgotten, the description 'eye-candy enchantment' was associated with the spell after researchers started looking up information on the Menhitians in the late 70's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEffects:<br>\r\nThe enchantment instantly allowed the woman to look like the ideal mate to the eye of whoever gazed upon her. At first, it seemed as thought it was only an illusion, since the woman didn't seem to look at any different after the spell to any one man. It was only after their deaths that the women's daughters admitted that their mothers told them that they shifted into a new form whenever a different man looked their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End of the Practice:<br>\r\nA few problems arose with the curse, the women who had it would almost always produce daughters. There were rumors that once hitting puberty, their sons would occasionally switch gender. Some of the daughters would be altered to look like the ideal woman for the first male to have a crush on them, and stay that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe practice was finally ended by the Menhitians when a chief's &lt;untranslatable&gt; son cheated on his lovers, and they paid the &lt;untranslatable&gt; to put the enchantment on him. This caused the proud chief to now have a daughter, and in anger, he ordered all &lt;untranslatable&gt; executed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is some more trivial stuff put after that, but there is no source on the information, for all you know whoever posted this was just making it up. However, you can't help but feel that it's too similar to your situation to be fake. There is no mention of a cure. And nowhere is the word 'curse' mentioned. More importantly, you don't see the word 'cure' pop up at all either. There is a little link to the person's email at the bottom, but before you start to write it, you realize that you don't actually know if he/she can read English. If you send a letter in a foreign language, they might just block your account, thinking it's junk mail, and you'll lose the best lead you've gotten so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bookmark the page for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling pleased with yourself, you decide that it's time to get something to eat. You brace for the transformation to take effect as you open the door.</span></div></div>",

Janice the secretary arrives 30 minutes early. Most other people don't arrive until 10 minutes before the day officially starts. If you walk in now, you'd probably have 4 minutes to chat with her and go to your cubicle. But why did that door just close? Is someone else here early?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to pull off your plan, you need to pass through those doors in the next two minutes.<br>\r\nYou take a breath and are about to open the door.</span></div></div>",

A quick look at yourself confirms this and you head over to Janice's desk to make yourself as visible as possible.<br>\r\n\"Hello Janice.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Hi Will. My, you're early today.\" she responds in a somewhat nasally voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice has been here longer than the boss, and is in her late 40's. She knows how things get done around the place, and if she says she saw you, no one will question her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to get a head start on some work.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes. The three projects everyone is focusing on this week.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Oh Janice, I'm expecting a new intern today, if you see her, just send her to my cubicle, one of the guys can show her where it is.\"<br>\r\n\"A new intern, of this week of all weeks? Did the boss sign off on it?\"<br>\r\nYou want to have a more casual conversation, but through the door, you can hear footsteps coming down the hall. It's still a bit early, but you can't take the chance they'll open the door.<br>\r\n\"Yes, I told the boss this weekend, anyways, I've got a busy day, I'm going to start all my stuff.\" you say, rushing through the lobby doors and into the cubicle space, your heart rapidly beating.<br>\r\n\"Have a good day.\" Janice manages to say as you shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you enter the cubicle area, you notice that you're still a man. You look over some of the cubicles, and see the tops of some hair covered scalps popping out of them. But no one is looking in your direction. \"Maybe the curse isn't triggered unless they know I'm here.\" you think to yourself. You head towards your cubicle, figuring that it'll be better to walk there in your current shoes instead of the heels you'll be wearing if any guy sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you sit down, you look at the office across from you. Mr. Donald's office has its inside blinds down. So far, so good, you should be able to jump in and out of there with almost no one seeing you. You go to try and open the door...and it's locked.<br>\r\n\"Crap.\" you think. Only three people could possible have the key, Janice, the janitor, or your boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis day just got a little more complicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps coming and immediately duck into your cubicle and turn on the computer. Then it hits you that it doesn't matter what you do, the second someone passes you, they won't see Will, they'll see a gorgeous woman helping William set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe footsteps stop behind you and you try and prepare yourself for the change.<br>\r\n\"Hi Will.\" says a voice.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say in a high pitched voice. You cough again, and say it in a lower tone. \"Sorry, my voice just cracked.\" you say, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman in front of you is Beth. She was one on your rivals here about two years ago, but you've since outperformed her on every occasion. She's become more submissive in the workplace since. In fact, you're not entirely sure why the boss still keeps her around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Working on the the Denver Project?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"As much as I can.\" you reply, your voice hinting that she's interrupting you.<br>\r\n\"Alright, have fun.\" she says, taking the hint. You have a feeling she's been trying to angle a workplace fling with you or one of the other guys here, but the truth is, no one really finds her that attractive. And most workplace romances you've heard of end in disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes go by, and the workplace starts to fill up with staff, who fill up the office and surrounding cubicles. Oddly enough, you haven't transformed yet. Maybe if you keep your head down, you can get through this week without turning it into a convoluted mess.</span></div></div>",

I want to see you in my office.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Is this about the intern?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Of course it's about the intern.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Can I just send her over sir? I'm currently on the line with an important client.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"This regarding the Denver Project?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"<br>\r\nThere is a quick moment of silence.<br>\r\n\"Fine, send her over. I'll check on your work later.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir, she'll be down in a minute.\" you say.<br>\r\nYou hang up your phone, then pick it up again and leave it off the hook. This way the line from your cubicle will seem busy on the computers, and if anyone walks by, they'll think you've just left for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath, and pull a non-disclosure agreement out of the desk, you sign Clair's name and then sign your own as the witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up, and walk towards the other end of the office, once outside the cubicle, your body instantly changes. You're wearing inch-high heels, knee-high grey socks, a skirt that almost comes down to your knees, and a white blouse that it more than a little revealing. You weren't wearing these when you were at Nick's. But then again, maybe you accidentally grabbed a different pair of clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hair, skin color, and body size are all rapidly morphing, as the collective desires of every guy in the office are competing to be represented on you. The sizes changes almost cause you to trip once or twice over your heels. But you go right back to maintaining your composure as you walk towards the bosses office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door, and wait for a few seconds for him to respond. Those seconds feel like an eternity. You can feel the eyes of every male employee looking at your ass. \"Come in.\" your boss finally says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Mr. Gardner.\" you say sheepishly.<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Jerry. Oh, and shut the door.\" he tells you.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" you say as you quietly shut the door.<br>\r\nThe moment you do, you morph again. Your breasts inflate, your hair lengthens out to around your years, and you notice that you're about a foot and a half smaller than Jerry. You quickly look at your hair, it looks brown. Jerry likes Brunettes, that's useful to know in the future.<br>\r\n\"So you're Clair. The intern that William was talking about.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" you say in a soft voice. You're playing it passive, because you know that Jerry doesn't like any competition to his authority, and if you screw up here, you will be paying for it for a while, even after (and if) you get rid of this curse.<br>\r\n\"William wrote me last night saying that you attended the same classes he did in University.\"<br>\r\n\"That's correct sir.\"<br>\r\n\"So why haven't you applied for a job sooner?\" he asks.<br>\r\nA moment passes, and you try desperately to think of a lie that would justify your absents from this profession.<br>\r\n\"My father was ill for a long time, after my mother died, I had to take care of him until he passed away.\" you say, pretending to hold back from crying. You recompose yourself. \"After that, I did some sole searching, and traveled the world for a year.\"<br>\r\n\"So you no longer have family obligations?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I have some cousins, and a sister I never hear from.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"No boyfriend, or husband, or kids, that sort of thing.\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if you're allowed to ask those questions.\" you say, but at the same time, you lift your left hand so that he can clearly see there is nothing on your ring-finger.<br>\r\n\"Of course. It's going to be a busy week, we can't have people abandoning us now. There are a lot of presentations that we need finished.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir. Understandable, sir.\"<br>\r\n\"Call me Jerry. -- So William is showing you around?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir...uh...I mean Jerry. He was on a call when he sent me here. But he made me sign this before he came in today.\" you say, handing him the non-disclosure agreement.<br>\r\n\"Good, nice to see he knows the basics in covering his ass.\" Jerry says, taking the paper. \"So how long are you planning to stay here?\"<br>\r\n\"I was thinking we'd try for a week, then if you guys liked me...I mean, like my work, I could try for longer.\"<br>\r\nThe boss thinks about it for a second.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" he says with a smile. You can tell he was jokingly trying to make you think he might say no. But you knew better.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jerry.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"So you know William, he'll get you caught up on what he's doing. Prove you're an asset, and maybe you can intern for one of the bigger boys.\" he says in a voice that comes off with just a hint of lust.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jerry.\" you say as you leave the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh again. So far your plan is working out alright, but you can't shake the feeling that something is going to blow up in your face. As you close the boss' door, you sense the eyes of all your co-workers staring at you. You try and brush it off as your imagination, but you can't as their competing desires cause you to change shape and color, over an over, until you manage to quickly duck into an unoccupied office and shut the door. You shut it and quickly convert to male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait a minute, silently open the door, then crouch beside the cubicle walls as you make your way back to the cubicle. You take one last look at the locked office across from you. \"This is going to be a long week.\" you tell yourself.</span></div></div>",

You look in your desk, and realize that you didn't pack a lunch today. With another defeated sigh, you get up and walk towards the restaurant as your wallet instantly becomes a purse. (And you hate the feeling of carrying a purse around, it just feels wrong.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe restaurant is on the main floor of the building, and a trio of men are kind enough to hold the elevator door open as you walk towards it. Funny how they never did that when you were a guy. You ask them to press the button for the main floor and they instantly obey.<br>\r\nThe elevator is hot, and you feel like a lamb surrounded by wolves. Although you try not to make any eye contact with them, you can just feel them scanning every inch of you over, although you're not even sure that they're aware they're doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get out, and your heels click across the marble lobby until you reach the restaurant. \"Egg salad sandwich.\" you say to the guy at the counter. Three minutes later, he brings it to you on a cool plate. \"Enjoy.\" he winks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock, you realize you still have 20 minutes left, so you sit down to better hide your frame as you eat. Picking a corner of the place were it'll be harder to see you, and sit down at a table for two.<br>\r\nYou're eating your sandwich slower than usual. Your note sure if it's because you're female, or if you've got more on your mind to ponder about than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I sit here?\" some guy you've never seen before says.<br>\r\nYou look in the window's reflection, you look the same as you did when you entered the lobby, there must be no new eyes on you. You then look around the restaurant and see that all the other seats are taken. It's probably a legitimate request to sit down.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, trying to sound like you brushed off the question.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. My name is Darrel.\" says the guy as he sits down across from you.<br>\r\n\"Clair.\" you say after finishing a bite of your sandwich.<br>\r\n\"You're new here.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"First day.\" you tell him, trying to focus on eating your sandwich.<br>\r\n\"I've only been here a month myself.\" Darrel says.<br>\r\nFor some reason, this causes you to stop and examine Darrel. He looks like he's 20. You probably look like you're a teenage to him.<br>\r\n\"I can give you some tips on working here.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I think I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, sure.\" Darrel says, as he finally starts to eat from his tiny bowl of soup.<br>\r\nYou feel Darrel's feet start to rub against yours, but as soon as they start, they stop.<br>\r\n\"It was probably an accident. This is a small table. There's not much room under here.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"So what department are you working in?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm interning. I'm not going to be here long. I'm interning in Promotions.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I wanted to do Promotions, but my uncle made me go into accounting.\" Darrel says.<br>\r\n\"Your uncle got you this job?\"<br>\r\n\"My Uncle Thomas.\"<br>\r\nYou rack your head for a bit, thinking where you've heard the name Thomas before...then it hits you, Thomas is Nick's boss.<br>\r\n\"Well, they seem a bit short staffed in Promotions. Maybe after I leave, you can join there.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" Darrel says as he finishes up his soup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both silently end your lunch and walk your separate ways.</span></div></div>",

This, along with the change of muscle mass on your arm causes you to drop the book in the hallway.<br>\r\nBen is greeted by your ass staring up at him as you're bending over trying to pick up book, while being weighed down even more by your expanded breasts.<br>\r\n\"Here, let me get that for you.\" Ben says as he leans down and picks up the book.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, I can be such a klutz.\" you say trying to laugh off what just happened.<br>\r\nBen takes a second to respond, hes obviously looking at your rack. \"Oh, hey, totally.\" Ben says snapping out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking to Joey, and he told me you could help me read this book.\" you say innocently.<br>\r\n\"The Equantrian book, ya. Is there a passage you want me to read?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I need you to look at a chapter for spells and blessings.\" you tell him.<br>\r\nBen opens the book, and looks at the first few pages. \"According to the index, the whole book is about spells.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I kind of need you to focus on one spell.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And that is?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"The eye candy enchantment.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"The Eye--Candy--Enchantment.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"That's not a real name, that's a slang name university professors gave it. Basically, it's a spell that causes a woman to look perfect for any man.\" you say, forcing a smile.<br>\r\n\"And someone cast it on you.\" Ben says.<br>\r\n\"What, how did you figure it out.\" you think. But then you notice that Ben is smiling with welcoming eyes, the line is just a flirtation.<br>\r\n\"Oh stop that.\" you say playfully. You feel like your stomach is full of butterflies. You're so nervous to where this is going.<br>\r\n\"Tell you what, I'll browse over the book for you, and let you know in a few days if I've found something.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Not tonight?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Clair, I'm up to my neck in reports and papers tonight. I'll do it when I get a chance.\" he says.</span></div></div>",

Don't I at least get a hug?\" he asks. His arms open, waiting for someone to embrace them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it, immediately weigh all the prose and cons in your head, and figure that a hug is a fair price to pay for him helping you out.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you say, as you loosely wrap your arms around his ribs. It feels so weird hugging as a girl. But Ben isn't having that. He puts you in a firm lock and pulls you closer so that your breasts are pushing against him. You then feel something in his pants push against your stomach, and he sways back and forth twice. You try not to look him in the eye, as he finally lets go and you slowly push yourselves away from each other. The hug seemed to last an eternity, but in reality was only about 15 to 20 seconds long.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for stopping by.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for promising to look at the book.\" you say back as you start to walk down the hall.<br>\r\nHe closes he door right before you get to the stairs, and you revert back to being male.<br>\r\nYou head up to your apartment, and plan to have dinner and a shower before locking yourself in your room until the morning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You twist and you turn, as the sun comes up to through the window and shines on your face.<br>\r\nYou toss off the covers, feeling as if you've had another bad dream. Or maybe it was the same dream you had a few nights before. Maybe it was the dream that doubled as a memory. Or maybe it was nothing. You don't remember it now.<br>\r\nYou stretch, walk over to the mirror, and see your reflection. \"Male.\" you think as you flex your muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your casual business clothes on the floor. \"Not today.\" you proudly say to yourself.<br>\r\nYou grab a pair of dress pants, a shirt and blazer, and a top it all off with a tie. You straighten the tie in front of the mirror, and walk out the bedroom door. There is a meeting scheduled for today, and you're going to impress them.<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" Joey says as you immediately feel a change.<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" you think. You're still tired enough that when you woke up and put all this effort into looking good, you forgot that all you had to do was stand in front of a guy, and all the work would have been magically done for you.<br>\r\n\"Crap, crap, crap.\" you think trying hard too find a reflection of yourself in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have trouble moving around though, because your pants have formed into a tight knee-length skirt. You're afraid it'll rip if you bend over. Come to think of it, the skirt was still pretty tight on you when it was a pair of pants. The tie has morphed into a necklace, your shirt into a low rising blouse. The blazer remains a similar design, but now it's shorter, and doesn't show off your shoulders. You look at your watch. The clock face is five times smaller, it looks more like a bracelet, and it went from being digital to analogue. \"That didn't happen yesterday.\" you think. You can already feel the soft fabric wrapped around your legs, you don't even have to look down to know your socks have turned into nylon leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you look great. How did you get your hair like that?\" asks Joey.<br>\r\n\"Hair like that? What's he mean?\" you think. Then you touch your shoulders and realize that the hair is no longer falling past them.<br>\r\nYou quickly shuffle over to the reflection in the toaster. \"My hair is up in a bun.\" you say in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you knew how to do that.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"I don't!\" you snap back, worried.<br>\r\nWhile you lean over again towards your reflection in the toaster, you use the moment to sniff at your armpits. You cologne, has become a lady's perfume. You have no idea what type, but it's defiantly there. You don't recall that happening yesterday. Although maybe you forgot the cologne yesterday, you can't really remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your ex-wallet, which is now hanging off of your shoulder as a stylish purse. You unzip it to find your driver's license is unchanged. It's still a picture of the male you, and has the name 'William' on it. \"I guess that's good.\" you think. The next thing you take out is your phone. It looks similar enough to yesterday, but you could swear the buttons look smaller, and the phone itself is slimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to ignore the observation. You're probably reading too much into things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to eat breakfast?\" Joey asks as you walk towards the door.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to be late.\" you say as you grab your shoes and waddle out the door.<br>\r\nAs the door closes behind you, you regain your male physique and clothes. You quickly put on your shoes and walk down the stairs towards your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you open your vehicle's door, you suddenly morph, and almost lose you balance for ten seconds. Someone must be looking at you. You look to your side and see a guy on the sidewalk with his dog, just standing there, staring at you. But that doesn't concern you as much as your footwear. As you get into the car, you notice that your heels are twice as long as they were yesterday, measuring in just under two inches. But these were the same shoes you had on yesterday. They never morphed to look like this. \"They're probably just being altered to match my outfit.\" you think. Trying to calm yourself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a few deep breaths, and begin to merge into the traffic. \"Today will be fine.\" you tell yourself.</span></div></div>",

Driving in heels isn't as bad as you first feared it would be, but you are driving a bit slower than usual, and taking an extra half-second to hit the brakes. After about the first inner city block takes you an extra five minutes to get around, you make a game out of how long it takes before you morph into another shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou average about 30 seconds per form, and are disturbed that you only transformed into a male once during the whole trip. It wasn't so much the amount of the changes that disturbed you, but that it felt like drivers were paying more attention to you than the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get into your building's parking area, and drive to your parking spot, once more leaving your car as a man.<br>\r\nThere are a few more cars already parked though. This doesn't bode well for you making a simple entrance past the secretary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up the slope, you move towards the elevator. As you pass a van parked about five spaces away, you notice a car double parked right beside it. In under a second you feel your whole body and outfit shifts, until you're wearing what you were this morning in Joey's company.<br>\r\nYour higher-than-normal heels and tight skirt are not an ideal combination, as the height difference causes you to fall forward, dropping your purse and other office supplies on the ground around you.<br>\r\n\"Ouch.\" you say, trying to get up off of the pavement. Then you realize that getting up isn't so simple in this outfit. You use your time on the ground to try and reach the fallen objects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut like prince charming dismounting his horse, Greg opens his car, and comes to your aid. Was he waiting for you?<br>\r\n\"Hey, let me help.\" he says as we trots towards you.<br>\r\nHe reaches for you with both hands, and pulls you up. He probably thinks you're two weak to help pull yourself up with only one. Of course the way you look at the moment, he might be right about that.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say, as he helps pick up the papers, and hands over your purse.<br>\r\n\"No problem miss...I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name yesterday.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I gave it.\" You reply.<br>\r\nHe gives you a look, like he's expecting more for helping you out.<br>\r\n\"It's Clair.\" you finally say to him.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Clair?\" he asks. Emphasizing your name.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine you say, as you try and brush of the dust on you, even though you have your hands full.<br>\r\n\"Here let me help.\" Greg says, as he immediately brushes off the dirt on the back of your skirt. You're face turns red with shame. That's the most private place any guy has ever got close to touching you.<br>\r\n\"Can't have people see you with a dirty back, they might get the wrong ideas.\" he says with a wink.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say both quickly and nervously, as you walk closer towards the elevator.<br>\r\n\"I'm Greg.\" he says as the elevator doors close.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you...again.\" you say in an uninterested tone.<br>\r\nThe doors open and Greg says goodbye as he exits on his floor.<br>\r\nYou're barely male for twenty seconds as the elevator doors open on your floor and you see a guy staring at you from the other end of the hallway.<br>\r\nHe slows his walk, in order to make sure he enters the lobby at the same time you do.<br>\r\nYou enter as he holds the door open for you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as you slowly make your way in through the doors.<br>\r\n\"Good morning Clair.\" Janice says.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say in a high pitched innocent voice.<br>\r\nJanice shakes her head, like she knows this world will chew you up and spit you out.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Will should be right behind me.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That's nice dear.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Does Janice not like me...er...Clair\" you ponder.<br>\r\nYou're about to get to the other door, when the guy who followed you in opens it for you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say again. You want to tell him he doesn't need to keep doing that, but you just remembered that your hands are still full trying to hold the stuff you dropped in the garage.<br>\r\n\"Name's Robert.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Clair.\" you say trying to ignore him. You honestly want to stop giving people your alias, but for some reason, you're afraid that giving them the cold shoulder will make you seem too much like a bitch.<br>\r\nYou walk down the side of the cubicle wall. Despite it being empty, you don't change back until you turn the corner. You can't help but get the feeling Robert was looking at your ass.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm just being paranoid.\" you think, remembering that Joey only had to look at you once for the transformation to stay in effect, then you needed to get a certain distance from him, or find an enclosed space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk into your cubicle, you're greeted by another employee.</span></div></div>",

How are things going with Will?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"He's great. I can learn a lot from him.\"<br>\r\n\"I bet you can.\" he says in a bit of a condescending voice.<br>\r\n\"We spent most of yesterday going over the details of the Denver project.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"How caught up are you on it?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Enough to start to brainstorm some ideas for the presentation tomorrow.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"But we're past brainstorming, we've already prepared slides and a video for the clients.\" he explains.<br>\r\n\"Yes, Will told me.

You notice that his eyes are spending more than a liberal amount of time looking at your cleavage.<br>\r\n\"Jerry, William said it was important to look over those before the meeting today.\" you say with a hint of urgency in your voice.<br>\r\n\"Clair, you sound like you know what you're doing.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I want you to come to my office, and explain this stuff to me.\" he tells you.<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's nesse...\" you say before he cuts you off.<br>\r\n\"No, I insist, think of it as a test.\" he says as he walks towards you.<br>\r\nYou shuffle your way into the cubicle, struggling to move because of your damned skirt and heels, then finally drop the stuff you were carrying from the car onto your desk.<br>\r\nJerry Gardner is now looking at everything below your waste as you lean over to tidy the papers you dropped. You're not sure, but you think your petite steps are having some effect on him.<br>\r\n\"Do you need help getting around today?\" he asks, bringing attention to how tight your skirt is.<br>\r\n\"No, I'll manage.\" you say as you turn to face him. You know the tight skirt is showing off your ass, and you don't want to give him a clear view of it.<br>\r\n\"Let me at least walk you to my office.\" he says putting his hand on your lower back.<br>\r\nYou really feel uncomfortable being touched there, but then again, you'd feel uncomfortable being touched anywhere. You've seen guys and girls with no clear feeling for each other walk like this before. It's an accepted practice as far as you know.<br>\r\nMr. Gardner walks you down the cubicle wall, and with every step, you feel his hand becoming less firmly pressed against your back. You fear it might 'slip' and touch your rear end. This fear haunts you until you reach his office.<br>\r\nHe leads you to a seat in front of his desk, where he gets you to sit. He then walks behind his desk and pulls out the file you gave him last Friday. It looks unread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opens it and turns it so that it is facing towards you. \"So what am I looking at?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot missing a beat, you explain everything that is shown in front of him. All the values of the charts, graphs, the statistics, variables, strategy, and every other factor to do with the project. You go over with the expertise of someone who has written the entire thing, which not so coincidentally, you actually did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boss sits back, a look of surprise crosses his face as he takes a deep breath. You can tell his heart is beating faster than before.<br>\r\n\"You haven't work in this field before?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"No sir.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And Alex was able to explain all of this to you yesterday?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, he's an amazing man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boss looks over the pages again as he sits there, silently.<br>\r\nHe then looks at you.<br>\r\nYou can almost swear you head him whisper: \"All this and a fine piece of ass too.\"<br>\r\nHe stops looking at the papers and looks at you once more.<br>\r\n\"How would you like to sit in at our meeting?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I...\" you say before he stops you, he doesn't even care that you called him 'sir', he's too distracted by his thoughts.<br>\r\n\"On second thought, it's not a request. I want you at the meeting this morning. You don't even need to say anything, I just want you to observe.\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you for this opportunity.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"The pleasure is all mine.\" he says with a greedy smile.</span></div></div>",

You haven't had time to change into Will since you got here. He's going to miss the meeting completely, and that's going to look really bad on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantically, you think of something to do. You look at Mr. Donald's office. Maybe if it is still unlocked, you can sneak in and make a phone call from it. You have no idea what you'll say, but maybe you can improvise something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sneak towards the door, being as stealthy as you can in your stupid outfit. Thankfully, no one sees you get inside, reverting back to a male as you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I've got one shot at this.\" you think as you open your cell phone and make a call.<br>\r\nJanice answers with her nasally voice. \"Hi, can I help you she asks.\"<br>\r\n\"Janice, it's me Will.\"you say, artificially making yourself breathe heavier than usual.<br>\r\n\"Will, the boss wants you in on a meeting right away.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I can't, there's been an accident.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" Janice says in surprise. You don't know if the reaction is genuine or not.<br>\r\n\"Some guy hit the side of my car, but he claims that I'm responsible for it. The whole thing is B.S. but he's making me wait until the cops show.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to make it.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Afraid not.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I'll let Jerry know.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say, hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down in the big chair in the room and look up at the ceiling. Immediately regretting your improvisation. Your car is in your parking spot, if the boss or Janice tells anyone and they see it, you're screwed. You take three deep breaths, filling your lungs up with air.<br>\r\n\"At least no one will have to brief me on the meeting later.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a file you prepared last week, you walk into the meeting and sit by the far corner near the coffee table. Your location was a mistake, a line up forms immediately behind you, as the men pour their coffee at an abysmally slow rate. You can tell they're scoping out your breast size as they walk by you. You just sit back and try and maintain good posture until the meeting starts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Nick walks into the meeting, and you can see your hair becoming a bit blonder as a few stray strands fall in front of your face. You quickly brush them aside, but this action might have been a bit premature. All Nick sees is Clair the intern trying to fix her hair the second she seems him. He probably reads it as a sign that you're self conscious around him. In his mind that means you like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second the boss comes in, you stand up and move your way over too him.<br>\r\n\"I just got a call from Will.\" you whisper in his ear. \"He's been in a car accident.\"<br>\r\n\"Is he alright?\" Jerry asks.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, but he's being held up and won't make it to this meeting.\" you finish.<br>\r\n\"Thanks babe.\" he whispers back.<br>\r\nYou want to respond, but see the other people waiting, and think better of it.<br>\r\nYou do your little feminine shuffle back to your seat, and aren't too surprised to see that Nick has chosen the chair next to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks as though William won't be joining us today. But I don't think we should be too concerned. His assistant Clair will be sitting in for him.\" the boss says, pointing towards you. \"Now I don't want to waste too much of your time, so lets get down to business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next 20 minutes are him reintegrating everything that you went over at his desk earlier this morning. About twice during the presentation he makes eye contact with you, as a way of saying thanks.<br>\r\nYou're briefly distracted for a moment when you swear that Nick's hand had touched your leg. You look over at him, and he's making eye contact at the boss. You notice that his hand closest to you is defiantly under the table. But when you look at it, it's resting on his lap. You quickly feel more eyes on you and you return your focus to the other guys at the table. You realize that a third of them have just noticed you staring at Nick's crotch-area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmazingly enough, you're starting to be able to take notes on your surroundings without missing anything important from the Jerry's speech. Is this what multitasking is like for the fairer sex?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get to think about it too much because though, be cause the boss immediately stops and asks for suggestions and ideas.<br>\r\nA few people raise their hands, and the meeting becomes quite mundane after that.<br>\r\nFinally the boss wraps it up and almost EVERYONE at the table comes over to introduce themselves to you. You look at the far side and notice that Beth storms off after seeing all the attention that you're getting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs people leave one by one, you notice Nick whispering something in Jerry's ear. Jerry seems to nod in agreement, as they look at you and position themselves near the door.<br>\r\nFinally, you've shake hands with a dozen people, not one of them giving you a firm grip. One old guy even kisses your wrist. As you walk towards the door, Jerry and Nick pull you over for a second, as everyone else starts to leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clair, I've heard you've met Nick before.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"Yes, briefly.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"He's requested that you help him with his presentation for tomorrow.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"But isn't Will supposed to help with that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes, but Will is not here. You are. This presentation needs to be done by tomorrow, and you seem to know just as much about this project as he does. If he shows up, you can brief him on it, but if not, Nick requested that you work with him.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou look over at Will for a second, you can see a bit of lust in his smile, no matter how hard he tries to hide it.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I really think I should stay with Will.\" you insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJerry puts his arm around you, and walks you a few steps away from Nick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you might feel more comfortable around Will, but I don't think there is too much more you can learn from him. You've been here a day, and are already better at explaining this shit than he is.\" the boss whispers.<br>\r\n\"Sir, I...\"<br>\r\n\"Nick is one of our smartest and most aggressive workers. Trust me, he's twice the man Will could ever be. You'll learn more from him in a day than you will from William in a month.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your heart break, just a bit. Is this what your Boss really thinks of you? For a second, you feel like you're going to cry, but then you quickly shake off the emotion. You look over at Nick. Despite some of his eccentricities, he is really good at his job. He's been more successful than you in it, at least that's what your boss thinks. Maybe you'll actually learn something from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"William would understand.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he would.\" you reply in an ironic manner.<br>\r\nJerry gives some sort of hand signal to Nick to show him that you accepted.<br>\r\n\"I'll see you in my office in ten minutes.\" Nick says walking by you.</span></div></div>",

Since the last time you were alone, he left to get water and came back wearing nothing but a towel. But after all the trouble you\u2019ve been through to keep this job, you really had no choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding there in front of his door you pause for a moment to take a deep breath. You then gently knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s open.\u201d Nick says, you walk inside and close the door behind you, a strand of blonde hair then falls in your face and you feel your butt become tight and perky as you revert to Nick\u2019s ideal woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey just who I wanted to see.\u201d He says smiling as he walks around his desk to greet you, \u201cYou did a spectacular job in the meeting today.\u201d He says as he quickly gives you a hug before you can get out of the way, but as he backs off as though to let go his hands slide down to the small of your back, as though he was about to pull your waists together, but you manage to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh... Yeah thanks... But you know Will really deserves all the credit. He taught me everything I know.\u201d You say taking a few steps toward his desk to put distance between the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour just modest, Will is a good friend of mine, but between you and me he could of never given a presentation like that.\u201d He says laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then jump forward, \u201cYes he could!\u201d you exclaim, but Nick just smiles, \u201cWell maybe one day, but you can now, and I know you must think a lot of him but you need to think about your own career, stick with me and he could be your assistant.\u201d<br>\r\nHe says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I didn't even give the speech, Mr. Gardner did.\" you correct him.<br>\r\n\"Technically, but Jerry told me that you went over it with him, step by step, just before the meeting started. The other guys might not know the difference, but we know that was all you.\" he says in his smooth voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were speechless, you miss a few days of work and one of your best friends is trying to give your job away. \u201cWait! Your one of my closest friends... ah I mean you\u2019re one of his closest friends!?\u201d you say,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 yeah but this isn\u2019t personal it\u2019s just business. And it wouldn\u2019t be fair to your hard work go unrewarded, and I haven\u2019t seen Will around here making things happen like you are.\u201d he says. \u201cNo, I\u2026 I mean he has been working his ass off.\u201d You exclaim. \u201cWell I\u2019ll have to take your word for it, personally I haven\u2019t seen him at all this week.\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut\u2026 ah he\u2026\u201d you stutter, \u201cHey you don\u2019t have to cover for him, he may have opened the door for you but you walked through it yourself.\u201d He says slowly working himself closer to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in frustration you pace back and forth to the other side of the room, you didn\u2019t know what to tell him, you had been working your ass off and still your job is in danger, who would of thought that you would be making yourself look bad. And Nick was actually in a position, to make things difficult for your male self at work. What are you suppose to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tell Nick the truth and hope that he will help cover for you at work or Get away and call will with your male voice and convince him that you\u2019re actually working)<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You contemplate telling him the truth for a few seconds. But then look down at yourself and become convinced that he'll never believe you. Realistically, Nick is only listening to every third word you're saying. Plus you look nothing like Will at the moment, common sense would tell him not to believe it. He'd might even think you're a bit crazy, and not let you near any more confidential information. Plus introducing everyone to a crazy intern would look incredibly bad on Will's part. You decide that when you get a chance, you'll call from an empty office or closet somewhere and make up some excuse as to why you, as Will, couldn't make it into work today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come over here, I want to show you something.\" Nick says as he sits at the computer in front of his desk.<br>\r\nYou shuffle over and stand beside him. The jerk doesn't even offer you his seat.<br>\r\n\"It's a video of what will be playing behind us at the presentation.\" he says, as he clicks play.<br>\r\nThe video itself is ten minutes long, and is set to go on a loop.<br>\r\nThe way Nick has angled the computer screen, forces you to lean forward against the desk and bend over in order to get a good look at it.<br>\r\nAs you watch the video, you can feel gravity pulling your breasts forward a bit. Nick knew exactly what he was doing, as occasionally, out of the corner of your eye, you can see him making taking quick glaces at your Tits and ass. Another chill runs down your spine, as you realize he's probably making mental images for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlus your back is starting to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe video itself is nothing special either. It shows a lot of sky, sun, nature, and scenes from the last few projects that your company has promoted. There are also the occasional time lapsed picture of monuments from around the world. The whole thing is made to subconsciously associate your workplace with success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" asks Nick.<br>\r\nYou tell him all the observations that you made while watching the video. Nick looks up at you in surprise.<br>\r\n\"You are good.\" he says. \"Why have none of our competitors hired you yet?\" he continues. It's his way of complimenting you, or hitting on you, you're not really sure there is a difference at the moment.<br>\r\nNick then stands up. \"I'm sorry, where are my manners?\" he asks as he gets out of the seat. \"Please, sit down.\"<br>\r\nYou're expecting some kind of trap, but your ankles are getting sore from your damn heels, and you do need relief from that, even if it's just for a minute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down, you attempt to fold one let on top of the other. You really don't want too, as most guys can't comfortably maintain that position, and you hate doing anything that brings to the attention the fact you're no longer male. Still, from your understanding, crossed legs are a woman's way of telling men she's not easy. It's a mute point though, as your skirt is so tight that you can't even fold one simple leg over the other. You give up, and sit in the chair, with both heels planted firmly on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick picks up on this signal immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabs a little fold out chair that has been hidden behind one of his filing cabinets, and sits down in front of you. His chair is much closer to the ground than yours is, and he'd probably use it for letting guests sit in, for no other reason than it'd make him seem taller in most meetings. The only reason you can think of him using it now is that if he starts to lean forward a bit he could probably get a good look up your skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that you don't even know what type of undergarments you're currently sporting, you quickly move your knees together. The conversation is a strange one, as the words of it take a backseat to you trying to cover yourself up, and Nick trying to take a peak at you. At one point your knees get tired, and you try and use your hands to push down the skirt to obstruct his view. It works, but not in the way you intended, pushing two hands down on your skirt your skirt causes your arms to squeeze your breasts together, making them look larger than they really were. Nicks attention shifts accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout half an hour later, you're both mentally and physically exhausted. You suck at being a woman, and are terrified that you're giving all the wrong signals to Nick. After the third time of asking for a break, Nick takes pity on you and finally lets you have a ten minute one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving his office, you can feel the slight changes happen to you as you walk towards an empty supply room. You don't even bother trying to figure out what you look like. Right now, keeping Nick off of you is the main priority. Thinking back to your interactions with him at the office, you wonder if your mannerisms told him little more than that you were playing hard to get. Your stupid shuffle defiantly wasn't helping matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough you can feel that at least one guy is still watching you, you bend over and rip the seam in the side of your skirt. Tearing it a few inches. It shows a little more of your right leg, but at this point you don't care, you can move with a bit more freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head over to the supply closet and quickly open and shut the door as you open your phone. You look down, you're male again, and there is also a slight rip going three inches up the side of your pants. \"Whatever,\" you think, \"The pants were getting too small for me anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call Janice and ask her to connect you to the boss. She does so.<br>\r\n\"Will?! Where the hell are you?\" the boss shouts as he picks up the phone.<br>\r\n\"I just came back from the doctor's.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Why, what happened?\" Jerry asks.<br>\r\n\"I was having pains after the car accident. At first I thought I was fine, but the more I walked, the more it hurt.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" asks the Boss.<br>\r\n\"I should be in a couple of days. Level two whiplash. The doctor said I can't lean forward for a while, and I'll be walking funny for a bit.<br>\r\n\"Will, you should rest.\"<br>\r\n\"No, I can't, the presentation is too important.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Too important? Will, it's your health. Stay home, we won't hold it against you.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? What about Clair, I'm the only one who knows about her...I mean knows her. I have to teach her so much about how this place works.\" you insist.<br>\r\n\"Clair is doing fine. You've got nothing to worry about. Trust me, you picked a winner with her.\" Jerry answers.<br>\r\n\"But sir, I...\"<br>\r\n\"I'll have non of it, if the doctor says rest, you rest. I have total confidence that the presentation tomorrow will go as planned.\"<br>\r\n\"Sir...I...\" you try and respond.<br>\r\n\"Nick, we can have to struggling to walk up to a podium and rubbing your neck all through the presentation. It sends a signal that we're weak. Stay home, that's an order.\" Jerry says as he hangs up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, your plan worked, kind of. Except now you are expected to be here for the rest of the week as Clair, and not get paid for it. Plus if anyone sees Nick walking around the office, you'll be in huge trouble.<br>\r\nAs you turn to leave the supply closet, you see that the door had been reopened. Possibly while you were on the phone. You realize you haven't changed to Clair either.<br>\r\nLooking up, you see why. Beth is there looking at you.</span></div></div>",

She was probably wondering why the new intern was walking towards a supply closet, and investigated to find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou don't even respond. If she tells the boss you were here, it would be a disaster. Panicking, you grab her, pull her into the closet as you escape it, shutting the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly bounce a few steps away from the door as you feel the transformation come over you once more. You look up, and see Nick walking your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's about to say something, when Beth opens the door, looking incredibly upset.<br>\r\n\"Where is he?\" she says, looking at you and Nick.<br>\r\n\"He?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Where is Will?!\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I didn't see him.\" you say,<br>\r\n\"The boss said William isn't here today. Don't you remember the meeting?\" Nick asks her.<br>\r\n\"But he was just here, in the supply closet.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I just walked by the supply closet, I only saw you go in there.\" you mention.<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's still in the supply closet.\" Nick says, as he opens up the door.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Nick? Are you in here?\" he says at the empty space.<br>\r\n\"But I swear I saw him.\" she pleads, hoping you or Nick will believe her.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you were daydreaming.\" you say. \"Nothing wrong with daydreaming about Will in a closet.\"<br>\r\n\"You ever daydream of anyone is a closet?\" Nick asks you in a flirtatious manner.<br>\r\nYou smile politely, knowing you screwed up again. You tried to make Will look good, and instead have convinced Nick you daydream about guys.<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" you say, in a nervous but playful response. You're not really sure why you said that, but it seems to work. Beth shuts up, seeing that she is just looking hysterical, and that both you can Nick have lost interest into what she is saying, but you also notice her eying you. She knows somethings up. She probably doesn't know what is up, but she knows it involves you and William.<br>\r\n\"Does she like Will...I mean me?\" you think to yourself. \"Is this some sort of territorial female thing?\"<br>\r\nYou think about it for a second. You never noticed too many signals from Beth that she was into you, but then again, you mainly focused on hotter women than her, and didn't give her too much attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk back to the office with Nick, as he puts his arm around your shoulder. You let him. Not because you like it, (because you obviously don't,) but because you don't want to make any kind of scene that will give Beth a reason to follow you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, that was close.\" you think as Nick ushers you to his big chair. Thanks to the tear in the seams, you're finally able to cross your legs when you sit down. The tear widens as you do this, and shows off more of your thigh. \"Whatever.\" you think, and you and Nick go over the presentation and start practicing your lines on it. Nick tries to hit on you every chance he gets, but you have to hand it to the guy. Despite all his advances, he manages to get work done.</span></div></div>",

You leave with a celebratory hug, in which Nick's left hand was way to far south, down your back for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to leave early with the crowd today, you manage to avoid Beth and get your car out of the parking area without anyone noticing.<br>\r\nAs you drive home, you realize that Joey is going to have to start driving you to work. Your car doesn't look damaged in anyway, and that contradicts the story you called your boss with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out another sigh, as you realize that your week is getting even more complicated because of the damned curse. You're getting angry at the slow traffic, and red lights that halt any speedy route towards your place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you park in the lot beside your building, and walk up to your room. You're too tired to even notice the change back and forth on the way there. Keeping Nick away took too much energy out of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey is there, watching some crappy comedy film you've never seen before.<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you haven't been doing this all day.\" you ask.<br>\r\nJoey looks up at you. \"It's research!\"<br>\r\nYou watch the movie for a minute, and are able to piece together the plot. It's about a guy who magically turned into a girl and has to deal with the chaos that ensues.<br>\r\nThe woman in the title role looks like some sort of porn star, as she keeps getting in situations were she has to wear skimpier and more revealing dresses. \"Too close for comfort.\" you think as some guy slaps her ass.<br>\r\nYou don't even remember doing it, but you're now sitting on the couch, watching the crapfest, and laughing at a few parts. The movie then shortly ends like they all do, with the guy returning to normal, and learning a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They all end that way.\" Joey says. \"They guy learns that women are people and gets transformed back, and gets together with the girl next door.<br>\r\n\"We don't have a girl next door.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, it's just a bad movie. Women are supposed to laugh at how a guy reacts to the stuff they do, and guys are supposed to get erections watching the hot actress look really nervous in revealing outfits.\"<br>\r\n\"That's so...\"<br>\r\n\"Sexist, I know, but it makes money, and damn it, it works. Body switching is not considered a genre and not just a plot device.\" Joey explains, cutting you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please tell me you learned something of value today.\" you say.<br>\r\nJoey looks at you, and the pile of books beside him. \"These are useless.\" he says pointing at them.<br>\r\n\"Joey, you need to try harder!\" you plead. \"I don't want to be stuck like this.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know, it could be worse.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"How?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It could have been me instead of you.\"<br>\r\nYou're mad at yourself for walking into that joke. You should have seen it coming a mile away. Is your brain starting to act differently? \"I'm just exhausted.\" you tell yourself.<br>\r\n\"Fix this!\" you say to Joey.<br>\r\n\"I might not need to.\"<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n\"Ben came by today, said he did some readings and wanted to go over them with you tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n\"Ben found something?!\" you say as hope returns to your voice.<br>\r\n\"Mentioned something about telling you over dinner.\" Joey says, looking at the back of a DVD case.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, hoping he'll clarify what was clearly a sentence you misunderstood.<br>\r\n\"Like either of us is in a position to say no.\"<br>\r\n\"But...I...\" you're trying to think of a way out of this, but right now, but can't. Ben is holding the cards. At least you'll have until tomorrow to think of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up, you go over to the fridge, and find a piece of leftover pizza in the vegetable area.<br>\r\nYou take a quick look at it. It doesn't look moldy. You put it on a plate and heat it on the microwave.<br>\r\n\"We had pizza?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Apparently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pizza finishes, you try and take a bite out of it as you're walking towards your room.<br>\r\nThat was a mistake. a clump of sauce falls right on your blouse. \"Ew, that was one of my best shirts.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into your room and undress, running to your personal bathroom to rinse it with soap and water until the stuff washes out.<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of scrubbing, the mess, you're left with just a hint of a stain in the dress shirts top-right corner.<br>\r\nYou look at it, and back at the clothes covering the floor of your room.<br>\r\nYou need to do some laundry, and now seems like just as good a time as any, maybe if you're quick enough the tomato sauce won't stain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take an empty basket and fill it up with your clothes.<br>\r\nYou quickly throw on something more comfortable, and walk past Joey towards the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing a load? Here babe, take this.\" Joey says as he dumps a handful of his clothes on top of yours.<br>\r\n\"What a gentleman.\" you say sarcastically, rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n\"What a woman!\" Joey says with enthusiasm as he opens the door for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk downstairs with no shoes on. It's not that the floor isn't dirty, or surprisingly cold, but it's that you don't want to carry a basket downstairs in heels is anyone sees you.<br>\r\nEventually you make it to the basement, where six washers and dryers are there for any of the tenants use.<br>\r\nThe washer and drier should take 45 minutes each to clean your clothes. It looks like you'll be having some time to sit and think.<br>\r\nThe washers and dryers are supposed to automatically lock once started, but the locks are so weak that any random guy could break them and leave with your stuff.<br>\r\nAs you start to put away your clothes, you see a paperback novel on top of the machine next to you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the latest in the series of 'Dirk Cutling: Fugitive Lawyer', this could be fun.\" you think, dropping it in your basket, so if anyone else comes in to see it, they'll think it's yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, as if on cue, the door opens, and a man walks in.</span></div></div>",

I can come back later.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Don't bother, I'm going to be a while.\" you say as you look in the basket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen a bit in surprise. Most the clothes there are female's clothes. But you weren't wearing them. You think about it for a second. You were holding up a pair of pants when the guy came in, those turned into a females' pair of the same pants. Maybe the pant leg was touching the other clothes and passed on the curse. Maybe your leg was touching the basket. You look at the basket, it's still the same color, it hasn't turned into a bright pink or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a minute, you go through the pile, of laundry in front of you.

More amazingly, most of Joey's clothes in the pile didn't change. The one exception you find is Joey's I LOVE PUSSY T-Shirt has had the last word changed to 'cock.' You quickly hide it in with the other clothes before the man sees it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you start the wash, and sit back to read the Fugitive Lawyer novel. Unfortunately, as you pick up the book, it no longer looks like a courtroom paperback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA novella is being held in your hand with a cover of what looks like a woman about to faint in bed, as she is being wooed over by a dark stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Erotic Adventures of Emily Skythims\" the title proudly displays. You look at the back and there is a picture of a woman you never heard of. The description on the back reads: Emily wakes up one morning to find her mansion gone, her husband disappeared from history, and herself ten years younger. With no money, and no experience, Emily is forced to work as a sleazy law-firm, where she learns to court clientele. Meanwhile her co-worker, the handsome Mr. Graves, lets on there might be more than she thinks. Perhaps she could get to the bottom of this mystery of what's happened, if she can just stop herself for falling for him. A tale of pride, romance, mystery, and danger; will Emily ever learn how to be a working woman in a man's world?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe description ends there.<br>\r\n\"Yuck, do women actually read this stuff?\" you ponder in your mind.<br>\r\nYou look over at the man, who has just finished putting away his laundry. Your option is to either read the book, talk to him, or leave and pry he doesn't see doesn't look at your spinning load and see the word 'cock' on one of your shirts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the first chapter. \"This is going to be a long hour and a half.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of Chapter 3, you start to actually get into the book. The mystery was well written, some clues were sprinkled around so you could guess what's coming next if you looked hard enough. And despite the title, it wasn't that smutty yet. Maybe the author was just building up to it. You keep reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd no sooner had you started a chapter when you hear what sounds like a sniffle beside you.<br>\r\nYou want to ignore it, leave the old man with his pride and resume the book, but you hear it again and turn to see tears coming from his eyes.<br>\r\nPart of you is freaked out, men don't cry like this. He's probably unstable. But there's this growing desire in the pit of your chest to see what's wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\"<br>\r\nThe man sniffs as he wipes the tear from his face. \"I'm sorry, you look just like her.\" he sniffs.<br>\r\n\"Just like who?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Like my daughter. And she looked like my wife.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, this might get creepy.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"I lost them both. I'm sorry.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, you can cry. They won't mind.\" you say, putting the book down and grabbing some old Kleenex from a box on a shelf. You give it to him and he dabs his face.<br>\r\n\"I'm Mitch, I live on the second floor.\" he says. No wonder you haven't seen him before, you've never gone to the second floor.<br>\r\n\"Clair.\" you say, almost by habit at this point, as you reach out your hand to shake his.<br>\r\nThe man grins as he shakes yours back. \"So Clair, can I ask you what you do?\"<br>\r\n\"You tell him about the job you had as Will, (leaving out that part that you're actually a man,) and all successes you've gotten from it. Ending with the presentation which you're doing tomorrow.<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" he says with a look of pride on his face. \"My daughter wanted to work in your field, but I told her that the system was designed only so men could advance in it. -- I'm so happy you proved me wrong.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks?\" you say, not knowing how to react.<br>\r\n\"I hope, that if my daughter had lived, she'd grow up to be like you.\" he says, as a sadness creeps back over his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the washer dings, and you put all your clothes in the dryer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back down and talk to the guy as the machine does its work. The next forty-five minutes fly by.</span></div></div>",

It was so refreshing to speak to someone who didn't want to hit on you, that you choose to ignore how potentially creepy the situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knock on the door, expecting Joey to open it for you, but as you hear no response, you enter on your own, and remain untransformed.<br>\r\nYou then realize that Joey is probably in his own little private bathroom, and that you've got a few minutes before you're forced back to looking like his dream girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the laundry into your room and sit on the side of your bed as you start to fold it, until you realize that Joey's mess is in there too. You grab the offending T-Shirt and place it next to a pile. You are going to show Joey what it says and get him to burn it, or maybe humiliate him by letting him know it's his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut suddenly Joey walks past your bedroom open door. \"Hey man.\" he says, as you instantly go from a man folding laundry into a woman folding it.<br>\r\n\"Your laundry is in the basket.\" you tell him. Picking up the shirt next to you, putting it in the basket, and kicking it across the floor to him.<br>\r\n\"It's weird.\" you say, \"Most of my laundry changed when a guy walked in on me.\"<br>\r\n\"Like you just touched it and it transformed when you did?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, pretty much.\"<br>\r\n\"And did my laundry...you know?\"<br>\r\n\"No, that's the weird part, only mine, and your stupid Spring Break souvenir.\" you say pointing towards the top of the basket.<br>\r\n\"Dude, this isn't mine, it's yours.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"What?!\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, I bought it for you. You just never wear it, and it was clean, so I figured I'd use it last week.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't remember this at all!\"<br>\r\n\"I might have been drunk when I gave it to you.\" he says. \"Why? What did it change into?\"<br>\r\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\" you say, as you continue to fold your socks. You just realized you've been multitasking this entire conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whenever you've changed before, only the stuff you wore or had in your pockets changed with you. Now the stuff you touched changed too.\" Joey says after a long period of silence.<br>\r\n\"Only the stuff that was mine.\" you correct him.<br>\r\n\"But your bed didn't change, when I walked by, and you own that.\" he tells you. \"Maybe it's only clothes or small stuff.\" Joey thinks out loud.<br>\r\n\"Maybe you're right, but it's still creepy.\" you say worried, about what this might mean for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey thinks for a second and sees this is bugging you. He then picks up the shirt, which he claims is yours, and walks away.<br>\r\nHe comes back a moment later.<br>\r\n\"Don't think about it too hard, you're tired, I can see it in your face.\" he says. \"Here, this should cheer you up.\" he adds, tossing the shirt at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unfold it. It's still a man's shirt, but the wording has been altered by permanent marker.<br>\r\nAbove the words 'LOVE' and 'PUSSY' is the word 'MY' written in marker with an arrow pointing down between the two other words. 'I LOVE MY PUSSY.\" it reads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey snickers, and you can't help by smile too. \"Go away.\" you tell him in a voice both defiant and defeated.<br>\r\nYou close your bedroom door and revert back to male. You throw on the shirt and look at it on you in the mirror. It'll totally work as an inside joke if you ever get this curse lifted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a twisted smile crossing your face, you decide in a second of weakness to open the door and surprise Joey by wearing a shirt that will read \"I LOVE MY COCK.\" Maybe he'll recall that you possess one when he's not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joey!\" you say as you open the door. You immediately feel the shirt shrink as your midriff becomes exposed.<br>\r\nJoey looks at you for a second, he mouth makes an 'O' shape and another second later, he falls on the floor laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at your chest. The words had altered as they originally did in the laundry room, except now, Joey's writing on the shirt changed from the word 'MY' to 'YOUR'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTerrified, and embarrassed beyond belief, you shut the door. Leaving Joey hollering in laughter as he tries to get up.<br>\r\n\"That was too much.\" he seems to repeat over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the door, take off your shirt, and wear three layers of clothes in case Joey wants to come into talk to you. You look down at the discarded shirt which caused this scene. \"That is SO going in the trash tomorrow.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the night consists of Joey knocking on your door, insisting that the incident wasn't that bad, before he starts breaking out into giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refuse to talk for the rest of the night.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's another sunny weekday for you. You open your eyes and lift the covers. The morning is good to you. You get up, stretch and walk around the room, farting, stinking, burping and saluting yourself in the mirror as a man should. It saddens you to know that you've been spending more time this week pretending to be someone named Clair than yourself. You try and be honest with yourself about this, most the day, you really just miss the power you possess as a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw on your casual business attire. You at least knew what it would look like transformed, so you shouldn't get any surprises with your wardrobe today. You slip on the socks you usually wear with it, and immediately see two holes in them. Your mind thinks about how those holes might transform the socks into torn nylons, and you figure it's better not to wear them at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yawn and walk into the living room. Your bare feet stick to the floor as you put on some coffee. Looking at your digital watch, you remember that Joey is supposed to drop you off and pick you up today.<br>\r\n\"Joey.\" you say as you knock on his door. \"Joey.\"<br>\r\n\"In a minute Joey.\" yells as you hear a thud on the ground. Joey must have fallen out of bed again.<br>\r\nYou look at your watch once more. You still have a good ten minutes before you really need to rush things. You pour yourself a pot of coffee, drinking out of one of your many white wholesale coffee mugs, as you lean against the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second your lips taste the drink, Joey opens his door, groggy and barely dressed. He's wearing a shirt that's at least a size too small for him, and wearing nothing below his waste except a pair of tight boxer shorts.<br>\r\nJoey isn't even looking at you, and already his pants are bulging straight out. \"Whatever, it's the morning, he's entitled.\" you think, not wanting to actually thing about it.<br>\r\nJoey then looks at you and his boxers point higher.<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's uncalled for.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Joey, I'm setting a new rule if you want to still live here. Whenever a lady is present, you wear pants.\"<br>\r\nJoey raises he hand and opens his mouth like he's going to give some smart ass remark, and you immediately realize that you just referred to yourself as a lady. You can put two and two together here, and decide to cut him off before he can say anything.<br>\r\n\"If someone looks like they could possibly pass as a woman enters this place, you wear pants.\" you continue to say as you calmly take another drink.<br>\r\nYou think Joey is going to have a snappy remark planned, but he just stops and examines your face.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you think.<br>\r\nJoey still just looks at your face. Something is off to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you finally say, as you're about to put your cup down. Then your eyes dart to something on your cup, a red smudge on the rim.<br>\r\n\"Yuck.\" you think as you're about to pour out the coffee and get a new cup.<br>\r\nThen it hits you, this cup was clean just a moment before. You notice your fingers wrapped around the handle have their nails painted a dark ruby red. You drop the cup as you quickly look for a reflection. You look in the toaster, but the warped reflection of your face doesn't tell you what you need to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't recall having red nails earlier this week. Your tiny feet seem to skip across the floor, until you get to your bathroom, leaving both doors open as you rush through them. Joey walks at a distance and leans against your bedroom door, as you gaze at the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make up. I'm wearing make up.\" you think in semi-horror.<br>\r\nYour seems slack jawed as you look in the mirror. Covering your lips is a crimson coat of lipstick, and a touch of rouge blush compliments the color. Your eyelashes are more curled than you ever recall them being, making your eyes look twice as big as before. Above them is some eyeshadow that gets lighter the higher it goes up. Until is gives a silver gloss just below your eyebrows. Your brows also look like they've been plucked. Trying desperately to look away from the attention whore you see in the mirror, your eyes focus back to your fingernails. Sure they looked like they were manicured the first day you woke up, but if their was any paint or coating on them at all, it was a clear one. These nails bring attention towards themselves, and it's the type of attention you don't want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the mirror, hoping that this is some bad dream. Then through your hair you notice it, a metal gleam hanging from off your ear. A bright pair of earring to give people another reason to focus on your face longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, what happened?\" you try and say. But all you can manage is surprised feminine grunts, coming off in an incoherent way. Fortunately Joey seems to get the gist of what you're getting at.<br>\r\n\"Babe, it's okay. That look you're sporting is probably part of the package with your knew outfit.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"New outfit? But Joey's seen this one me before.\" you think as you look down. Then you notice something. This skirt is four inches shorter than the last time you had it. Your top now provides little use other than focusing attention to your breasts and showing off your curvy sides. Your legs are bare today too. They look clean shaven and smooth as a baby's cheeks, but the cover than even the nylon gave you has now disappeared. You look at your toes. Not surprisingly, the nail polish on them match the color on your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was the outfit I wore Sunday!\" you scream.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n\"YES!\"<br>\r\n\"Did it shrink in the wash?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"NO!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe we just didn't notice the make up yesterday. My sister says it can be so subtle no one can know you're wearing it.\" Joey says trying to calm you down.<br>\r\n\"I was as dressed up as a guy could be yesterday! You really think that if I had make up on when I transformed, you wouldn't notice?\" you say, a but pissed at his arrogance.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look at bad.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror one more time. He's right, once you get past the shock that you're actually wearing it, it at least looks tasteful and like something that's appropriate for the office. All things considered, you should probably be grateful for that. Still you're pissed at Joey for probably getting an erection looking at it. In fact, you're probably just made that he can still have erections. You give him a nasty frown for trying to defend the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, calm down, babe. You don't look that good when you're mad.\" Joey says, trying to lighten the situation.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" you say defiantly.<br>\r\n\"So what's you're explanation of all this than?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou piece together the clues in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The curse is getting more powerful.\" you conclude. \"My clothes are getting more provocative, it's starting to change what I hold onto, not just what I wear. I look more like I'm trying to be someone's eye candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey is about to make a response, but stops, thinking better on it.<br>\r\n\"Go get your shoes on.\" he says. \"I'll get some pants on and drive you to work.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were silent for most of the car ride. Pondering what could possibly happen to you if the curse became even more powerful. You don't like any of the possibilities that pop up in your head. \"Did the Goth Chick mean for this to happen? Did she understand what she was doing?\" you think. Ruining someone's life was a bit extreme for a simple act like slapping her ass.<br>\r\nYou don't even bother looking in the mirror of the car as you shift forms. You just keep gazing at your nails. The damn things don't seem to change, even when you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey pulls over in front of your building, you step out of the car, showing more leg than you're comfortable with as you leave the vehicle.<br>\r\n\"Be here at 5:30.\" you tell him.<br>\r\nJoey gives you a salute and prepares to drive away.<br>\r\n\"And try and be productive today.\" you add as you shut the door.<br>\r\n\"I think Ben's got it covered.\" Joey seems to mumble behind the door window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen. You almost forgot Joey mention that Ben wanted to see you tonight. Just another reason why you regret waking up this morning.<br>\r\nYou walk towards the building. Heel-toe. Heel-toe. You hate heels, they're probably one of the worst trends that ever stayed in ladies fashion. The shoes just make your feet look smaller, as the movements you're forced to do to keep balance in them seem designed to show off your legs and your ass. Plus it might just be you becoming paranoid, but you're pretty sure the heels themselves are even higher than they were yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down beyond the folder you're carrying in your hand, you notice something different about your steps. They're straighter, and there's more of a sway coming from your hips. You're walking different today than you were on Monday. \"Is this the curse's doing to?\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Yes and no.\" you realize. Guys walk the way they do because they're protecting their genitals, it's why there feet point on outward angles. Woman don't need to worry about protecting anything hanging down there. It's why you're walking straight. You cross one foot in front of the other as you keep walking towards the elevator. You're not even sure why you did it. Probably just to see if you could while keeping balance in the stupid heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator closes and you ride up it as a man. You look down to see that your feet have altered themselves accordingly.<br>\r\nAs the contraption goes up, you realize that one of the benefits of getting Joey to drop you off is that you won't have to cross paths with Greg in the parking garage today. Maybe you might be able to catch another break somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens on Nick's floor and you realize you're still a man. Then fear strikes you as you see someone at the other end of the hall. It's Beth. And her eyes widen as she spots the guy who pushed her the other day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit. Shit. Shit.\" you think as you rapidly push the button for the 15th floor.<br>\r\nBeth sees your panic, and her walk towards you quickly evolves into an all out dash towards your position.<br>\r\n\"Hold the Door!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors close and the elevator starts to head upward as you hear her bang on the safety doors moving below you.<br>\r\nAs you reach the button's destination, the door opens to reveal Robert standing there. He stands in the doorway's threshold, freezing the elevator in place as his eyes glance you over.<br>\r\nHe, of course, sees Clair, who is holding a folder and looking particularly attractive today with all her make up on. Making her stand out even more than she did earlier this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing on this floor?\" he asks in seductive tone.<br>\r\n\"I'm, trying to find Nick's office.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, it's a few floors down. I think you might have passed it.\" he says, trying to sound smooth.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can be such a ditz sometimes.\" you say trying to laugh it off. Really you're just killing time, hoping Beth will lose interest in waiting for you to come back down.<br>\r\n\"Ditz? No! I heard you're going to give a speech with Nick today for the Denver project. The boss wouldn't let a ditz do that.\"<br>\r\nThe elevator lets out a ding as the doors try and close on Robert. The sensors quickly sense his presence and slide back, all the way open.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't want this floor?\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Why, what's up here?\" you ask playing dumb. Realizing that Clair would have had no reason to visit this floor.<br>\r\n\"It's the filing area. It's pretty quiet up here most that day. Between you and me, you can get away with having a quick nap in a few of the corners.\"<br>\r\nYou snicker politely.<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you ever want to let off some steam, I can show you little corner where I practice my techniques.\"<br>\r\nYou laugh politely again. You have no clue what he is saying, but he's clearly hitting on you. \"It's never going to happen.\" your mind assures you. You quickly sneak a peak at your analogue watch and realize that you've been semi-flirting with Robert for a full 45 seconds. There's no way Beth's lost interest in you yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you show me where Nick's office is?\" you ask in an innocent manner. You notice that Robert's been looking more are your face today than your breasts and legs, maybe he'll actually hear what you're saying.<br>\r\n\"Sure, I've been there plenty of times. I usually drop by his place before we head out on our weekly lunches.\" he brags.<br>\r\nWeekly lunches?! Nick never invited you as Will to a weekly lunch. You feel more like you're out of the loop now than ever.<br>\r\n\"That's so-- interesting.\" you manage to say as Robert steps beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors open on Nick's floor, and Beth is there looking at you.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay, you look upset.\" you say to her in a sweet but concerned voice that reeks on inauthentic concern.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" she says angrily, looking directly at you.<br>\r\nYou try and look oblivious as you stand in front of her. You almost want to get into a staring contest, but realize it's more effort than it's worth. Plus you're blinking a lot today, and it's throwing you off. You've read that women blink more than men. Maybe you're just noticing it now, or maybe it's all the crap on your eyelids that's making them subtly heavier. Either way, you decide to turn and look up at Robert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobert takes your blinking as a sign that you're concerned about Beth and want him to step in. Either that or he's thinking that you're batting your eyelashes at him. It doesn't matter what he reads into it, his response is the same. He looks at Beth and begins to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beth, if something is bothering you, you should tell us.\" he says, trying to look authoritative in front of you.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" Beth says, and her eyes move from his right back to yours.<br>\r\n\"Fine, if you say nothing's wrong, I believe you.\" he says.<br>\r\nBeth looks at you and Robert, and realizes that it's not worth her energy to confront you both at once.<br>\r\n\"Ugg.\" she grunts in frustration as she walks through a door on the far side of the hall.<br>\r\n\"Nick's office is just through those doors.\" Rob says pointing to the main ones in the center of the hall.<br>\r\n\"Thank you SO much.\" you say to him, as you walk out of the elevator, turning just slightly to your side to wave goodbye.<br>\r\n\"Anytime.\" Robert says as the doors close on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a second you're a man again, and can tell immediately by the feel between your legs as you walked like you did in the lobby. You stop, readjust your stance, then continue to Nick's office before Beth has another chance to spot you.</span></div></div>",

With her following you all day, you're forced to stay around guys to prevent her from seeing Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick is looking at his folders, drinking some coffee before he looks up at you.<br>\r\n\"You look--good.\" he says.<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you give a flattered little blush as you flip your wrist as to silently say, \"oh you.\" You immediately catch yourself and refine your poise. It's too late, Nick sees his opening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I see you spent all morning prepping for the meeting.\" he says as he edges closer to you.<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thrown into all of this, I kind of had to cram.\" you respond, trying to downplay his flattery.<br>\r\nNick's too quick for you. His right hand goes down. You freeze, thinking he's going for the folder. He doesn't. With his palm, he tucks a loose side of your top into your skirt. Immediately leaving his hand flat against your hip for a full five seconds.<br>\r\n\"You have to look your best for these guys.\" he says, as you slowly brush his hand away with the folder.<br>\r\n\"Trust me, that won't be hard.\" you reply.<br>\r\nYou know how Nick's mind works, in his head, he's probably making a joke about getting them hard. You pretend that he isn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clair, I'm going to be honest with you, and it might hurt.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you say nervously. You have no clue were this could lead.<br>\r\n\"You've spent all that time with me yesterday going over the facts, and preparing our speeches. Now you need to know that those don't matter.\"<br>\r\n\"Don't matter?!\"<br>\r\n\"Yup, you can just forget about them. Look relaxed, sound confident, and if you mess up, just ignore the mistake and keep going.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Is that what you do?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n\"It's why I am where I am today, and guys like Nick are stuck in a cubicle.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a corner cubicle. It's a tiny bit bigger than the others.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Still, it's not this.\" he says, spreading his arms to show the space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the open door behind you; you have a feeling that you don't need to be here right now. But as you look away, you see Beth doing some morning chores out there. Not a single other guy has entered the area yet. If you leave Nick's sites, she'll probably spot William...you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sees you're field of view, and moves around you to shut the door.<br>\r\n\"We'll, we don't need to go over the report again. I think it'd do more harm than good to practice presenting.\" he improvises.<br>\r\n\"We could help with one of the other projects.\" you say, trying to cover how nervous you are with fake enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\"We could relax.\" Nick says as he puts his hand on your lower back and walks you towards the chair.<br>\r\nYou're thinking he's going to sit you down in the chair, but instead he immediately swings you around and leans in for a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith almost lightning quick speed, you put your left hand up and block his face.<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Nick asks. \"You've been giving me signals since I first say you here Monday.\"<br>\r\nYou think about it. Have you been? You have no experience giving signals to men. Are you going to break Nick's ego right before he needs to sound confident and ace the presentation on the Denver project?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

You want to tell him that you're really his friend Will. But your mind instantly thinks of all the possibilities that could go wrong with that scenario, and how it could distract him from the presentation today. You really want this presentation to succeed. If it does, Mr. Gardner would probably not care as much at Will's missed work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and think of a way to let Nick down lightly, but what excuse could you think of after you asked if he was crazy for trying to kiss you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll smudge the make up.\" you blurt out.<br>\r\nNick sits back in surprise. Obviously he knows just about as little on the subject as you do. You decide to go with it.<br>\r\n\"If you touch my face, you'll ruin it.\" you say, continuing your line of reasoning. \"No woman can get up in front of a crowd with her lips all smeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick sees this as his way to back off while keeping his pride and takes it. The tone of your voice showed that you're not interested in his advances at the moment, but also nowhere did you outright say 'no' to them either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect Nick to question you about your actions and if you like him. But instead he moves around you and sits down at his desk. In his eyes, you can see the realization that he's moving too fast with you. He's probably coming to the conclusion that you don't find his position of power an aphrodisiac like other women would. As you stare at him, you seem to understand his frustration. The way you dress does seem to indicate that you like the attention of men. If you were still a guy, and saw a girl dressed in these clothes, you'd probably hit on her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brace yourself to what is sure to be an awkward half hour before you're supposed to set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the phone rings and Nick answers.<br>\r\n\"Hello...ya, of course we're ready...Yes she's here...YOU WHAT?!\"<br>\r\nNick breathes heavily for a second.<br>\r\n\"WHY THE HELL DID YOU AGREE TO THAT?!\" he shouts.<br>\r\nYou try and say something, but Nick just puts up his finger to shush you, he quickly writes something down on a piece of paper.<br>\r\n\"Yes, we can do that, but it's going to be tight. In 20 minutes? We'll try.\" he says hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looks up at you in concern. \"They moved the meeting.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Where?\"<br>\r\n\"The Central City Tower. At the heart of the city.\"<br>\r\n\"There is no parking there.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Well, we could walk down there in 40 minutes...but we're supposed to start in 20.\" Nick says, sounding a bit pissed.<br>\r\n\"A cab. We'll call a cab.\" you say, starting to panic too.<br>\r\n\"I'll get Janice to do it.\" Nick says buzzing the secretary and requesting she call a cab for you downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did it change?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"The companies CEO wanted to take a 1pm flight out today. He decided to stay at his building and finish some stuff up. Said he'd give us a half hour to give the presentation.\"<br>\r\nThis just gets worse and worse. You planned the presentation to take exactly 45 minutes.<br>\r\n\"Shit. Shit. SHIT!\" you repeat as you gather and drop some of the project papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're kind of cute when you say dirty words.\" Nick says.<br>\r\nYou turn and look at him, pointing like you're going to tear him apart. You probably are kind of cute when you swear, but that's not the point. Nick (and you) need to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both race for the elevator, only to see Jerry already in it.<br>\r\n\"I had Janice call us a cab.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou and Nick look at each other. Janice probably told him that she called a cab, and he decided to take credit for it.<br>\r\n\"Good thinking sir.\" Nick says sucking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few floors later, the elevator doors open and Greg and Darrel come on too.<br>\r\n\"We're joining you.\" Greg says.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Time restraints, while you and Nick pitch the idea, they're going to go over cost projections with there accountants.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"Brilliant.\" you say, sucking up too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens in the lobby, and you feel yourself shift as all the eyes are watching four businessmen and you race across it. As you get outside, you see a cab pull up. Nick quickly takes your papers and throws them in the trunk along with the accountants briefcase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all pile into the cab, except for you. You weren't quick enough because of your heels, and there are no seats left.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I can take another cab.\" you think, as you open your purse to an unexpected surprise. You have no cash. There is a credit card, but it belongs to some guy called William. Maybe you've heard of him. The cabby might not accept it.<br>\r\n\"Where did the money go?\" you think. Did Joey steal it? You don't want to believe he did, but you know he has been short on money lately.<br>\r\nWhatever, you'll figure it out later, right now you have more immediate problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up, horrified about what's going to happen.<br>\r\n\"What's the hold up?\" Jerry asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't have any money for a fair.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I've got it covered.\" he replies.<br>\r\n\"I think I'll go in a cab with someone else.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Damn it Clair, we don't have time for this...\" Jerry yells out the rolled down window.<br>\r\n\"Just sit on my lap.\" Nick replies, interrupting his boss. The door beside him still left open for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and shudder, thinking about all the mistakes that brought you to this part in your life.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the cab parks in front of the Central City Tower, you open the door and pull yourself off of Nick's lap. You're pretty sure that the trip here has surpassed last night's laundry incident as the most humiliating of your life. You've never wondered what it felt like for the woman giving the lap dance, and you never thought you'd ever be in a situation to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick's hands holding your knees, to keep you balanced wasn't enough, every time one of your butt cheeks slid just a little, you felt an immediate and expected action from him. The other guys in the cab, just looked at you, envious of Nick. The whole time, you were trying not to to let out surprised yelps, in the slim hopes that they wouldn't know what was going in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou also hate potholes even more now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Nick gets the papers out of the trunk, you and the boys make your way to the 35th floor of the building, where you are directly taken to a noticeably large presentation center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I thought our place was impressive.\" Darrel says to himself. Jerry shoots him a strict look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi everyone, welcome to the Central Tower Presentation area.\" a bubbly brunette says, as she shakes the four men's hands.<br>\r\nShe's attractive, and you could totally see yourself spending a night with her if it wasn't for your current condition, but as you put out your hand to shake hers, her eyes narrow, as she gives a cold and limp response.<br>\r\n\"Are you here to help with the refreshments?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm here to present.\" you tell her in a defensive tone.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you just look...never mind.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So were do I put this data-stick for the presentation?\" Nick asks.<br>\r\nThe brunette walks the both of you behind the podium, as she shows that there is a whole computer hidden inside of it. She explains the basics to the two of you, mostly focusing on Nick.<br>\r\n\"It has everything you need.\" she says breathing deeply, as her left hand twirls her hair.<br>\r\n\"Uh, gee...thanks.\" Nick says, clearly admiring the attention.<br>\r\n\"Big Mike will be here in five minutes.\" she says as her right hand slowly lands on his shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Big Mike?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Our C.E.O. You know, the guy you're here to impress.\" she says, turning only her head to look at you, and hardening her voice as she does so.<br>\r\n\"Five minutes is enough time.\" says Nick, as the brunette turns back towards him to meet his eyes.<br>\r\n\"Hmm, that's efficient of you. I can only imagine what you could accomplish if we had ten.\" she says as her index finger playfully touches the tip of his nose, and her left hand slips into his pocket, before she leaves the stage and starts chatting to your boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got her number.\" Nick says with a smooth smile.<br>\r\n\"Don't get cocky, I could probably get that slut's number if I asked.\" you say.<br>\r\nNick looks at you in mock surprise. \"Don't tell me your jealous.\" he says, trying to put you on the spot.<br>\r\n\"Don't flatter yourself.\" you reply, and you open the folder, and look at the papers you need to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised in how harsh you sounded; like a woman who had just been turned down for something. You don't know the brunette, you had no reason to call her a slut, or judge her for it if she was. The truth is you are jealous, but not of her, of Nick. You hate how most girls seem magnetically drawn to him, and how no girls you've seen so far this week seem more threatened or envious of you than in awe of your success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick takes the hint of you looking at your speech and starts reading over his paper one last time. You find yourself eying that brunette, as she flirts up the boss. You don't like her. Maybe it's because she doesn't like you. But you can't figure out why she'd be upset. You're not a threat to her, she don't know your relationship to anyone. It could be she's jealous of your success.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Greg in the back seats, as a ditzy looking secretary rubs her leg against his. Darrel seems to uncomfortable with the girl he's been put with to really go over the statistics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch, as see that there is two minutes before Big Mike will show. You should be focusing on what you're going to say, but the woman's actions are bothering you. Then, in an instant, you figure out what it is. She's a brunette. Jerry likes brunettes, you know this because of how you looked when you entered his office. Jerry has spent time with Big Mike before. Mike probably figured out Jerry has a bit of a weakness for them. He's setting up something, but you're not sure what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Big Mike enters the doors, with an entourage of 'yes men.'<br>\r\n\"Evening.\" he says, shaking Jerry's hand.<br>\r\n\"Ready for the presentation?\" your boss asks immediately.<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to be blown away.\" Mike says as he waddles towards the front row.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mike is called Big Mike for a reason, and it's not because of his height. A bot belly hangs down to cover most of his waste. He looks up, seeing you, and you immediately change. You skin changes complexion a bit, and you shrink an inch. It's not too noticeable, since having your coworkers in the room keeps the curse of any one guy from altering your too drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before you start, Greg and Darrel immediately leave with the women sent to distract them. Jerry sits a row behind Mike, as the brunette sits beside them. Nick doesn't seem to notice, but you can tell by Jerry's reaction that she is rubbing her leg against his. You can tell by her eyes that she knows you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights dim, and Nick starts the projector to create his background and begins to speak.<br>\r\n\"Here goes nothing.\" you think, realizing how cliche the line sounded in your head, and being thankful that you didn't say it out loud.</span></div></div>",

You just hoped that they listened to what you were saying, and were not too distracted by your looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe projector turns off, as the lights turn on, and there is a round of polite applause, before heavy whispering starts. Jerry leans over to Mike and the two exchange a back and forth that don't quite hear. At one point, both stop for a moment, to stare at you before they focus on each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick retrieves his data-stick, and politely escorts you off the stage. You're uncomfortable with his hand on your back, but say nothing in order to appear that you are a united front at your work. \"Is touching a women's back the best way to lead us around?\" you think. Yet another reason for you to hate your current body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Nick go over to talk to your boss and Big Mike, but the brunette gets up and completely blocks Nick, semi-flirting with him. You ignore her as you try and go towards big Mike, but one of the better looking 'yes men' stands up and walks over to you.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Harold.\" he says, towering over you.<br>\r\n\"Clair.\" you say shaking his hand. He has suck a caring grip.<br>\r\n\"I liked your presentation.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But I wanted to talk to Mr. Gardner and Big Mike about it.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I can speak for big Mike.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you...Do you have the authority to...make decisions.\" you finally say. Damn it, this guy is distracting you, and you don't know why.<br>\r\n\"Mike is a bit busy today. But I can answer all questions for him, if you're interested, we can get together over lunch.\"<br>\r\nYou're about to say \"I'd like that.\" before you snap out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really want to talk to Big Mike in person.\" you mention.<br>\r\nJust then Big Mike stands up, shakes Jerry's hand, and waddles away from you towards his office.<br>\r\n\"There is my cue to leave.\" Harold says as he kisses your hand. You're upset, but your body involuntarily blushes.<br>\r\nYour words come out inaudible as Harold and the other 'yes men' leave the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you, Nick and Jerry are alone near the podium as the brunette stands by the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think he's going to give us the project.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Nick asks, in a serious tone.<br>\r\n\"He seemed so dismissive. I think he has another partner in mind.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"The shortened presentation, the relocation to here. This was all just a formality.\" Nick realizes.<br>\r\n\"Sorry about putting you through all this for nothing Clair.\" Jerry says. \"I want you to know I don't blame either of you for this. Still, this was supposed to be a major catch for us. Word gets out, there is a good chance out shares could drop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clair, are you alright?\" Nick says, waving his head in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" you finally respond.<br>\r\n\"No?\"<br>\r\n\"No. I'm not okay.\" you say in a paced monotone voice.<br>\r\n\"Do you need to sit down?\" asks Jerry.<br>\r\n\"Yes, with Big Mike.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a good idea Clair, I know you put a lot of work into this, but he'll still work with us on future projects.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"I want to sit down with him.\"<br>\r\n\"No, it'll seem like we're desperate.\" Nick says.<br>\r\n\"I want to talk to Mike.\" you say, your heart beating faster as adrenaline pumps through your veins. You want to make a scene.<br>\r\nJerry and Nick try and talk you out of going to see him for the next three minutes.

Oh ya, and there is that cab ride you're trying to block from your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike isn't going anywhere until you get him to work with your company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Nick and Jerry, both seem to be trying to comfort you, and it looks as though the only reason that they could possibly let you talk to Mike at this moment is because they don't want to ruin any chance they might get to sleep with you. You know how the male mind works, but at this moment you don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, the slut by the door is probably going to keep us from Big Mike. I need you to distract her.\" you say.<br>\r\nNick gives you a sly look, he knows exactly what you have in mind. \"Fine, but you'll owe me.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never want to owe Nick a favor. No woman does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once Nick gets her out of the way, follow my lead.\" you tell Jerry.<br>\r\nJerry stays quiet. He looks like he's trying to distance himself if this goes bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jerry pretend to talk as Nick walks up to the brunette, and starts giving her some of the moves that he's been trying to practice on you all week. Thankfully, she seems much more confident in her sexuality than you are right now, and leaves the area, with Nick's hand on her ass. \"Seriously, why is is that if he does that he gets laid, but if I do that, I stop being male for most my waking hours.\" you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, you and Jerry walk down the hall, where Harold comes towards you.<br>\r\n\"Clair, I'm so glad we have this chance to talk.\" he says.<br>\r\nBig Mike must have put him there to distract you if you tried to follow him. It was a well placed move on his part, a lot of women would be flattered to be around a man like him and lose focus. Thankfully, you're not that type of woman. Or any type of woman, at least in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick your palm in his face, in an admittedly bitchy fashion as Jerry comes up from behind and forcibly shakes his hand, starting up a conversation with him. Harold is forced to take his attention off of you, and deal with the more powerful person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swing open the doors to Big Mike's office, and immediately shrink about six inches. Your hair turns black, falls down to your waste, and your skin color alters to a yellowish-tan. Your peripherals change too, as the type of eyes on your face alter to fit the facial features of a different race. You can't find your reflection, but your instincts tell you that look like you're from Singapore. You wobble in your heels a bit as you struggle to maintain your balance during the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mike?\" you say. Your voice is higher than before, because of how small you've become.<br>\r\nMike breathes heavily from behind his desk.<br>\r\n\"I'm Clair.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Mike says as he struggles to stand up and reach across his desk with both hands. The way he rubs them as he touches is a clear indication that he wants you. You really don't want to lead him on, but you've come this far, and your determination will not let you stop now.<br>\r\n\"Mind if I sit down?\" you ask, as you lean back in the chair in front of him, and fold your legs.<br>\r\nMike breathes heavily.<br>\r\n\"I was so happy to hear our companies were going to do this project together.\" you say, leaning forward a bit to let your top do the work for you.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I have the utmost respect for Mr. Gardner.\" he struggles to say.<br>\r\n\"I understand the presentation is over, and that you have a trip to go on today, so I'll make this quick.\" you say in a voice that is equal parts enthusiastic and sensual. \"I just wanted to meet you face to face and tell you what a big fan I am.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, thank you.\" Mike says, looking a bit shocked. He's obviously not used to woman who look like you talking to him like this.<br>\r\n\"I just wanted to tell you alone, in person, how much I look forward to working with you in the future.\" you say with a wink as you get up. \"I just wanted to tell you like this so that my boss doesn't get the wrong signals from me.\" you finish playfully.<br>\r\n\"Sure, anytime. We should meet later to discuss the project.\" he says as sweat starts to form on his forehead.<br>\r\n\"Totally.\" you say in a submissive voice as you turn around to walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts and you transform back into brunette version of Clair that the boss sees.<br>\r\n\"Clair, did you...\"<br>\r\n\"I talked to him. I told him how much this project means to us.\" you tell Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're looking more confident and recovered than ever. Feeling like you're just tapping into a new power that you have over guys. You should be feeling proud of yourself, but you can't, everything about this just feels wrong. You don't show it to the guys at work, but you're ashamed and just feel unclean that this is how you're getting things done.

But Beth seems to be never more than 10 years away from you at all times in the building. Between her, Nick, and the presentation looking like a failure, you wonder if you should even bother returning again tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey arrives ten minutes late to pick you up, and you sit in the car, wanting to pass out, as you turn towards him, your eyes begging him not to ask you how your day went. Joey was never the brightest guy, but maybe he'll pick up on this signal to ignore you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did your day go?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Horrible.\" you reply and you unload all of the problems on your mind to your roommate. Joey seems to be only paying half attention to you as you're talking, focusing mainly on watching the road, but taking occasional glances at your body.<br>\r\nAt one point you see if he's paying attention by mentioning the cab ride you took on Nick. \"Oh ya.\" he responds not looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, he's tuning me out.\" you realize, before you realize you don't want him to care. You're pulling the same garbage on him you hate when girls pull it on you. He doesn't want to hear about your problems, he knows your main one, and he's probably worried about problems of his own, like paying rent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I looked through some occult places today, some local goth hang outs.\" he says once you quiet down.<br>\r\n\"And?\" you say, your interest piqued.<br>\r\n\"One, those goth guys dress a lot like girls. Two, no one at any of those places wants to deal with outsiders.\"<br>\r\n\"So you found nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Pretty much. I also returned most the books to the library too.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" you tell him. You're feeling a bit moody right now, thinking about what happened with Mike.<br>\r\n\"I need you to get that book back from Ben tonight. Someone else put it on hold...\" Joey says as you stop listening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sinks. You forgot all about Ben asking you to his place for dinner tonight. You need to know what he found in the book, and find a way to stop this curse before it gets any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey holds the door open for you to enter the apartment, you head straight for your room, ready to close your door and revert back to being a guy. You stop just before entering as you see a pile of books beside the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" you ask Joey, letting a bit of anger seep into your voice.<br>\r\n\"Just some books I picked up to help you out until we solve this thing.\" Joey says with a wicked smile across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up the books, horrified at their titles:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Body and You: A Girl's Guide to Becoming a Woman<br>\r\nCross-dress For Success: How To Pass As the Opposite Sex in the Workplace<br>\r\nHow To Talk To Men (\"Wait, this one could prove useful.\" your mind tells you.)<br>\r\nBeauty Secrets: How To Get The World's Attention<br>\r\nYou're Not Gay, Really! Dealing with Attraction Of/From The Same Sex<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe list goes on.<br>\r\nYou laugh.<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm just imagining the librarian's face when you took these all out.\" you giggle.<br>\r\n\"I just told her they were for my gay roommate who is having trouble revealing his new lifestyle to everyone.\" he responds, with a face so cocky that you have an urge to punch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him with an angry pout, as you march in your room and slam the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts and you drop the books, spreading them at your feet, as you turn over and fall back onto your mattress.<br>\r\nYou want to sleep and get this day over with, but you look at your digital watch. You've got just under an hour to get ready to meet Ben.<br>\r\nYou don't panic, at this point the curse will make it look like you put some effort into your appearance. You just hope that it doesn't make you look too forthcoming for the evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the clothes hanging in your open drawers and closet. You should probably try some things on, and walk out in front of Joey to see what they turn into. On the other hand, it probably doesn't matter what you put on, any clothes you wear will give the wrong signals. You just need to get the information from him, and leave. Maybe you could bring your laptop and get him to write a quick email to that one site you found earlier this week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind starts to formulate a strategy to get through this. </span></div></div>",

At least then the curse will make you dress classy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold up different shirts to yourself, and feel incredibly gay for doing so. You're taking your time, trying to pick out something to get the right reaction from another man. It's totally not what you ever expected to do in life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after about twenty minutes, you settle on brown pants and a white shirt. There shouldn't be anything to provocative about that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTake a deep breath as you open the door and have Joey look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey stops whatever he was doing, and looks right at you, with his mouth hanging open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask, feeling a sense of deja vu.<br>\r\n\"I'm...your...\" Joey murmurs, trying to make a coherent sentence.<br>\r\nYou look down and see a white dress with tight straps that cling to your shoulders. You're wearing some sort of push-up bra, which make your breasts look much bigger and more noticeable than they were this morning.<br>\r\nYour pants have morphed into the one-piece dress, and you can feel a silky underwear ride up your crack.<br>\r\nYou shuffle your legs a bit to adjust. Joey just stands across from you. His pants much tighter now than before.<br>\r\nNoticing your nails are now subtle shade of creamy white, you decide to head back to your mirror and see what the curse has done to your face.<br>\r\nYour reflection is sporting different shades of cosmetics than when you were at work. Blue eyeshadow, a darker shade of red for your lips, and your face looks whiter than before.<br>\r\nYour hair is all dressed up in the front and fallen down in the back.<br>\r\nYou look like someone who just spent two hours to get ready for a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to open your eyes in surprise, but notice that they can't widen more than two thirds of what they used to. You blink a lot to compensate. You're not sure if you look tired, or if you look like you want to take someone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the clock, you realize you've got about twenty minutes before you're supposed to meet Ben.<br>\r\nYou feel like closing the door and trying on something else, but your instinct tells you whatever you try on next will be worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to close the door anyways. You don't have to be at Ben's for a bit, you might as well be a dude until then.<br>\r\nAs you step up to the door, Joey walks by and looks at you.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask him again.<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" he can't even think of an excuse, as he stares at your breasts.<br>\r\n\"Take a picture, it'll last longer.\" you say in frustration as you shut the door in his face.<br>\r\nThen you realize, he probably was taking a mental picture for later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remind yourself not to underestimate how much your life is sucking at this moment.</span></div></div>",

As you enter the main living area of your apartment, Joey is nowhere to be seen. You see his bedroom door is closed, and figure it's best not to think about what he's doing at the moment. You slip on some shoes and head down to Ben's apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there, you take a deep breath and knock on the door.<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" asks the voice from the other side.<br>\r\nYou remain quiet, you know it's just a matter of seconds before Ben looks through his peephole and sees you.<br>\r\nSure enough, you feel the instant shift of proportions as you stand out in the hall. Your breasts now look huge in the dress, and the shoes have once again become heels, causing you to momentarily lose your balance as you lean forward.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say in an artificially enthusiastic voice as he opens the door.<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Clair, come on in.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou look at your laptop bag, it's gotten smaller and is now colored a dull pink.<br>\r\nYou slowly walk in, trying to balance yourself, as shut the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe apartment looks like it's been recently cleaned. The table has a cover over it, and the curtains are closed. Ben is a bit dressed up too, he's gelled his hair, and is wearing a buttoned up shirt, with the top four buttons undone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have a very bad feeling about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hey, sit down, make yourself at home.\" Ben says, trying to be friendly.<br>\r\nYou notice his ass is stuck out a bit, and know from experience that he's trying to hide his erection.<br>\r\nYou calmly pull a chair out from the table, and sit down, to pull out your laptop.<br>\r\nThe laptop itself has changed since you last saw it. It's a hot pink, thinner than usual and has a sticker of a flower on it.<br>\r\nYou try not to think of what interior changes are on this laptop and just prey it still works. Maybe starting off with talking about the 'Eye Candy Enchantment' will let Ben know you're here for business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how was your day?\" asks Ben.<br>\r\n\"It was fine, nothing special, talked to some friends, did some research, you know, the usual.\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, totally.\" Ben says, half listening as he takes some lasagna out of the oven.<br>\r\n\"I hope you like lasagna.\" Ben says.<br>\r\n\"It's eatable.\" you say nervously. It smells great, and Ben is a better cook than you'll ever be, but you don't want him to think you're impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ben, I was thinking we could start out by you telling me what you found out in the book.\" you say in a tone that strongly hints you want to stay on this subject.<br>\r\n\"Well, you'll be pleased to know I read the whole thing.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"And...?\"<br>\r\n\"And there are some interesting facts in there.\"<br>\r\n\"Like?\"<br>\r\n\"The Menhitians banned all magic before they were destroyed. They though curses and spells were sentient.\"<br>\r\n\"Like self-aware?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, like they were kind of alive. And unseen entity that adapts to situations.\"<br>\r\n\"That's...um...neat.\" you say with a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach.<br>\r\n\"Ya, little tidbits of info like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Smells good.\" you say as he puts a slice of lasagna down in front of you. Causing you to move the laptop to the side.<br>\r\n\"Ya, my dad used to cook this all the time.\"<br>\r\n\"So what else did you find in that book? You know, about the enchantment.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh the eye candy enchantment thing. It's basic tribal superstition. The enchantment was created for the sole purpose of getting a women pregnant.\"<br>\r\nYou drop your fork, as that feeling in your stomach gets worse.<br>\r\n\"WHAT?\" you say, trying to temper yourself.<br>\r\n\"The Menhitians were pretty primitive. Men were hunters, women gatherers. Men built houses, women birthed and nursed babies. All other functions were based around those simple concepts. They wanted to give the ugly young girls hope, so they made up a story about an enchantment that would make anyone who saw them think they were the most beautiful girl ever.\"<br>\r\n\"That's so sexist.\"<br>\r\n\"Blame the Menhitians.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stop for a bit to eat the lasagna.<br>\r\n\"You're a very good cook.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he says between bites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops. Almost forgot the drinks.\" Ben says as he goes to get a giant bottle of red wine.<br>\r\n\"That's... big.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Normally, I wouldn't get this size, but since neither of us need to drive tonight, I figure we could go--a little nuts.\" he says as he pours you a glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does the book say anything about removing magic?\" you ask him, trying to stay on topic.</span></div></div>",

Like could an enchantment be taken away if the woman abused it?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing was mentioned about the beauty enchantment you wanted me to look at, but basically there were two ways to remove a spell. One, the spell is removed by the person who cast it. Because the person who cast the spell always had some connection to it in the Menhitian culture. Or two, a spell was cast so a a person would learn a moral. Once the person learned it, their lives would return to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly chew your food, trying to digest to this information, and the dinner. Could the answer be just as simple as learning a moral?<br>\r\n\"I'll never treat women as only sexual objects.\" you think. But you don't feel anything happen. \"I'll never slap strange goth chicks in the ass again.\" Still, you feel no different. Crap. The moral thing didn't work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Ben asks, as he scooches his chair closer to yours. \"You zoned out for a bit.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I was processing something.\" you say with a smile, trying to be polite. As weird as you feel in this situation, Ben's information is at least being helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay.\" Ben says as he leans forward a bit. He's probably checking out your rack. You're about to tell him that your eyes are up here, but you get a sudden shock of sensation on your leg. Your heart races as you realize that Ben is rubbing his sock up and down against it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\" you say, totally not used to people touching you in your current condition. You quickly take a sip of red wine to give yourself time to think. Ben did a lot of work for you, and it looks like he's expecting something for his efforts. Telling him to outright stop could jeopardize your chances of getting any more help from him. And you need him to write that email in that strange language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa.\" you squeep as Ben's foot goes dangerously high up your leg.<br>\r\n\"You think we can hold off until after dinner?\" you ask.<br>\r\nBen gives you a wink. \"Fine, I'll try, but no promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the remainder of the dinner, Ben always seems to direct the conversation away from the spells and magic. Forcing you to talk instead about food, and your fictional course at school. You try your best to seem interested in what he has to say. Thankfully, you don't have to try that hard, because it's clear Ben is into your looks more than your personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce dinner is done, Ben takes the plates away as you start up your laptop. That's strange, it's not connecting to the internet.<br>\r\n\"Ben, why isn't this connecting to the internet?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh, the connection sucks down here. The only place I can get a half decent signal is from my bedroom.\"<br>\r\n\"Really?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel in your gut that things might for south fast. Wait, you're entirely uncomfortable with that euphemism now. You feel like Ben will get the wrong idea if you willingly go into his bedroom. On the other hand, you'll have a hard time getting him to email the site if you can't get a connection. Is sending the email really worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBen walks over to his room and opens the doors.<br>\r\nThis is it, make your decision fast.</span></div></div>",

He needs a friend to talk to, and right now it looks like you're the only person who can comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back and forth in your mind if you should do anything tonight.<br>\r\nYou roll your eyes, sigh and quickly throw on some clothes.<br>\r\nJoey owes you for this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Joey, are you alright?\" you ask in a maternal voice as you step through the door.<br>\r\nJoey sits up from the couch and looks at you. His face is red from the running tears. He obviously doesn't want anyone seeing him right now, but he's not going to say no to a beautiful girl wanting to help him.<br>\r\n\"I tired so hard.\" he sobs as you walk closer to him.<br>\r\n\"I know, you've been a big help in all of this.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, I couldn't have been going to my job all those days and try and find a cure if you didn't go out and get those books.\" you answer as you sit down beside him.<br>\r\n\"It's not my fault I don't have a job. The economy is awful.\" he looks at you, wanting you to agree with him.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" you say in an understanding voice.<br>\r\n\"I might have to leave here as a failure.\" he says sobbing as he hugs you.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we won't let it come to that.\" you assure him, patting his back as you feel the salt tears drip onto your blouse.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to return to my parents.\" he cries. It's hard for you to listen. Joey is usually such an easy going guy, these insecurities must have been building up in him for a while.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, your parents will always accept you.\" you say as he drops his head on your lap.<br>\r\nIt seems to calm him a bit, and after a minute you realize you've been stroking his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder if your parents would accept you if they found out your condition. You also wonder what they'd think if they found out you were stroking a guy's hair as he rested his face in your lap. You stop trying to wonder about these things.<br>\r\nAgainst your better judgement, you both just sit there quietly not saying anything. Joey eventually tires himself out and falls asleep. You slowly remove his head from your lap and replace it with a pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a light blanket you both keep hidden under the couch, you toss it on him, and walk back to your room, shutting the door.<br>\r\nYou're both proud and ashamed of what you had just accomplished. Hopefully tomorrow will be more uneventful.</span></div></div>",

Your arm is asleep, and tingling immensely. You rapidly blink trying to open your eyes. You can tell something is off. Your back feels a bit sore, and you wonder if you fell asleep on something. You try and wiggle your toes to see if they respond. Something is off, and a second later, you find out what. You can't feel your morning erection. Not that it's the end of the world if you miss a day, but for what little time you have as a male, it's nice to know it's there. You clench you butt-cheeks and think of hot women. Your immediate response isn't arousal, but envy, and it hits you, something is very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you use your left hand to pull off the covers, you see a bright pink nail polish. \"No, no, no, no.\" you repeat over and over in your head. You toss away the covers and your fears are realized. Two mounds are attached to your chest, and as you lift your head to see beyond them, a large clump of hair falls and covers your eyes. You immediately wipe it to the side as you see a frilly set of pink panties wrapped around your vaginal area.<br>\r\nWithout thinking you let out a scream as you try and stand up but collapse to your side because of the sleeping limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember being a women as you went to sleep. You look up at the door, it's closed. You can't blame Joey for this. At least you're pretty confident he's not in the enclosed room with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter?\" Joey says as he opens the door in panic.<br>\r\nHe stops for an instant, seeing you almost naked, trying to sit up on the bed as your unconstrained breasts jiggle to the sides a bit. A second later, you realize that you are almost naked.<br>\r\n\"Leave.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you don't need some help?\" Joey asks, his pants barely containing his excitement.<br>\r\n\"Joey, leave or so help me...\"<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll be right outside.\" Joey says shutting the door.<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself. This is weird, you didn't change back. You look down at the floor and wonder if you'll have to dress yourself as a woman. So far you've been lucky enough to avoid that. You look down at the floor, even when you touch your clothes, they remain the same size and shape to fit you as a male. \"What's going on?\" you think.<br>\r\nIt doesn't matter now, your bladder feels like its in a different position than usual and feels like it's going to release its fluids.<br>\r\nYou limp towards the bathroom, waiting for your cognitive functions to return once you're awake enough.<br>\r\nYou look at your bathroom mirror on your way to the toilet. Your hair is a mess, but it looks like your make-up is all done.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you think, as more and more concerns pop into your brain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit on the toilet, you feel a sense of loss, this is the first time you'll actually have to piss as a female. As you prepare to unload the liquids, you look down and see that you're a man again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, you're officially confused. You look at your fingers before you stand up, the hands, hair and nails are all back to normal. You flush and wash your hands as you stare at the mirror. You're back to your masculine glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a knock coming from your bedroom door.<br>\r\n\"Will, are you okay?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\nYou look up at your reflection, the mostly naked woman is staring back at you. This time her hair seems to be done up.<br>\r\n\"Joey, sweety, could you do me a favor?\" you yell. It just hit you like a brick, you just called him 'sweety.' You make a mental note never to do that again.<br>\r\n\"What?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Walk to your bedroom door.\" you say in a voice making it sound like a request.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I want to try something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Joey's footsteps start to walk away from you, and your male form returns.<br>\r\nYou walk up to your bedroom door and peak your head through it.<br>\r\n\"Stay there for a few minutes.\" you manage to yell in a feminine voice. For a second, you forgot that opening the door would turn you into a female again, and one of your breasts fall down into Joey's line of site.<br>\r\nYou shut the door and become male once more. You throw on some clothes and wait six minutes until you hear Joey's footsteps walk towards you.<br>\r\nYou feel a sudden shift as your clothes morph with you. Your casual business attire doesn't look too casual, but like something out of a porn parody of an office environment.<br>\r\nJoey opens the door. \"Are you okay?\" he asks in a concerned voice before shutting up completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing you in a barley existent skirt, with a top that barely covers your breasts, allowing your nipples to be outlined has rendered him speechless. You look down too, surprised you're not wearing a bra. You think about it, and realize that this outfit might not meet your office dress codes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your nails, they're much darker than they were when you woke up.<br>\r\nSighing, you head towards the bathroom, your suit giving Joey a fine view of your ass wiggle as you walk. In front of the mirror, you stare at the woman looking back at you. You don't like her. The make up she's wearing is far too heavy and she comes across as more than a bit of a whore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroll out of the bathroom with a suggestive walk towards Joey, only to stop once you realize what you are doing.<br>\r\n\"Um, Joey.\" you say in a more seductive voice than you mean for it to be, \"Could you do me a BIG favor and walk back to your room again?\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay.\" Joey says in a dumbfounded manner.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say as you softly push him out. You're not sure but as you close the door, you think you might have given him a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again Joey's footsteps get farther away, and you revert to normal.<br>\r\nYou realize that enclosed places aren't enough to help anymore. You need to about twenty yards from the nearest guy in your area. Even if walls are between you and you're out of their line of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another deep breath. You realize that it's going to be a long day, and grab your wallet as you're about to get ready for work.</span></div></div>",

You don't think there will ever be a moment you're not embarrassed to be female, but at least you're walking better in your body.<br>\r\nThe elevator door shuts and you're a man again. But that only lasts for three floors. Before the elevator doors even open, you've already transformed into the perfect physical representation of whatever the guy in front of you wanted in a women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't even look down at yourself. You can't bring yourself to do it.<br>\r\nThe guy's raised eyebrows and slimy smile tell you everything you need to know about the situation. You give back a measured smile that strongly hints at your disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently to this guy, that's a come on, or a turn on, and most likely both.<br>\r\nHe presses the emergency stop and corners you, grabbing your ass pushing you against the wall.<br>\r\nYou want to yell 'stop.' but your damn throat won't let you. It's making minute 'ah' sounds for every movement he makes.<br>\r\nYou quickly stop trying to yell 'stop.' and just slap the guy as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps back and both of you just stare at each other for half a minute, not knowing what is going to happen next.<br>\r\nThe guy starts rubbing his cheek, and resumes the elevator's movement. Pressing a button to get off at the next floor.<br>\r\nThe door closes and you continue your ascension, trying to figure out what the hell just happened.<br>\r\nYou didn't know the guy you just ran into, but you could identify him if asked, why would he risk a sexual harassment claim, or even a charge of attempted rape for a girl he just met who works in the same building has him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy didn't you yell 'stop'? There's no way in hell you like this attention, despite what your clothes may signal to men. There is something bigger going on here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens on Nick's floor, and you walk off, you get about five yards away from the elevator doors before you start trying to balance in heels again.<br>\r\nYou make it to Nick's office, open the door and sit on the chair behind his desk. You know he's not going to complain about it, and the less time you spend walking in these shoes the better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're ten minutes early. You open your purse and look at your drivers license. It still has a picture of you as William. \"Why hasn't this changed?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a knock on the door and your hair changes to a brown color. Your boss, Jerry walks in.<br>\r\n\"Clair, just the woman I wanted to see.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say in a squeaky voice, surprised that Jerry is the person who entered.<br>\r\nJerry looks at you for a moment, and bites his lower lip. He's clearly going over something in his head.<br>\r\n\"Can I help you.\" you ask, trying to break the awkward tension.<br>\r\n\"I...I...You pulled out. I mean through, yesterday. You pulled through yesterday.\" Jerry says, struggling to maintain his thoughts.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\nJerry takes a few deep breathes before continuing. \"Big Mike accepted our contract.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"He, did that's great!\" you tell him, relieved that all the work you went through wasn't for nothing.<br>\r\n\"And I wanted to show you my appreciation.\" Jerry says as he sticks his hand down his pants.<br>\r\nYou instantly raise you hand in defense, but are relieved when he pulls out a thick drown paper-covered package.<br>\r\n\"Here he says throwing it on the desk.\"<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" you ask as you reach out to grab it.<br>\r\n\"Three thousand dollars.\"<br>\r\nYou almost gag on your own spit for a second, and look up at him like he's insane. This must be illegal or something.<br>\r\n\"It was you who got that deal through, not Nick, not your friend Will, you. I don't know what you said to Big Mike, and I don't want to know, but when he called me, he said that he was looking forward to working with 'Clair' in the future.\"<br>\r\nYou moist lips part as your jaw is about to drop, but you stop yourself. \"I can't accept this.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I know you're an intern and you shouldn't be paid, but there is legally nothing to keep you with us, but woman, say and I guarantee all your dreams will happen. I'll have you on full time by Monday.\"<br>\r\n\"But why?\" you ask.<br>\r\nJerry leans over the desk. \"Because you're going to be one of the hottest assets this business can have.\" he says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the money on this desk. This could solve Joey's rent problem, you could give him a loan. But at the same time, you're opening yourself to potential legal issues if you take it, and it's also unlikely that Jerry isn't going to ask for some 'special favors' if you do take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at Jerry again. He wants you to have the money, but you've got a not so subtle feeling he also wants you. But you're going to find that Goth Chick and make her cure you this weekend, right? You can handle this, maybe.</span></div></div>",

Sure, your feminine frame has certain powers, but they're not the kind you want to exorcize. Plus at this rate, you don't know when the next time you can come in as William will be. You need to make cash somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the package and stick it in your purse.<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" you say, looking up at Jerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, Clair.---Oh one last thing.

He insisted you show up.\"<br>\r\nYou don't like the way he waited until you took the money to tell you that.<br>\r\n\"Who else will be there?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know, me, Nick, the guys who went to the presentation with us yesterday. Even Beth somehow got invited.\"<br>\r\n\"Beth?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes, don't worry, she's been to these types of parties before. Heck, before you, she was the closest thing to a high closing woman we had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down, feeling a bit stumped. What the hell, you've helped with high closing deals before, why did no one ever tell you as Will that these existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will never mentioned these types of parties to me.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Well between us, we kept Will out of the loop. He's a good worker, but one on one, he can't make connections like we can. You can only bring so many associates to these parties while looking polite. We need to make who we bring count.\"<br>\r\n\"I...see.\" you say, thinking about what this means.<br>\r\nJerry starts to walk towards the door, before he turns and looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Oh, one last thing, bring a bathing suit.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"But I don't have a proper bathing suit.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the door closes shut and you see your brown hair start to lighten.<br>\r\nTwo minutes later Nick arrives and your hair returns to its pure blond color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did it.\" Nick says as he walks into the room, his arms open like they need a hug.<br>\r\nYou walk over to him, still thinking about the money you just earned.<br>\r\nAs Nick embraces you, you realize what a mistake hugging Nick was. He pulls you in until your breasts rub against his ribs, and his waste pokes against yours. He sways a bit, trying to judge your reaction.<br>\r\nYou tell your facial muscles to look like you want him to stop, but they don't seem to be conveying that message.<br>\r\n\"We did it.\" you respond back. Hoping the tone in your voice will make him stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should celebrate.\" Nick says.<br>\r\n\"We should work.\" you try to say, but all that comes out of your mouth is, \"okay.\"<br>\r\nYour heart is racing. Something is very wrong here. This whole day is giving you a very bad buzz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill unable to escape from his embrace, your movements to free yourself come across as little more than shimmying back against Nick.<br>\r\nNick takes it as a sign and takes the lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, I...\" you manage to say before both your lips lock.<br>\r\nFor a second you open your eyes and see that his are closed. You close yours once more.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" your brain tells your body.<br>\r\nYour heart is racing, your senses tell you that it's better kissing as a man, not actually kissing one. You don't like being the female in this situation. Something is flowing through your body like crazy, and your body is telling you that this is the best feeling you've ever had at work. Your mind is telling you that you should throw up right now and use some mouthwash. Even worse, you can feel Nick's male member pushing through his clothes and up against yours. It's quivering, and you're terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this happens within a span of seven seconds, and even Nick seems to instinctively know that something is very wrong.<br>\r\nHe slowly moves his lips away from yours, and with your eyes still closed, you feel a small sense of regret as they break contact.<br>\r\nYour eyes slowly open, knowing the moment has past. Nick tries to hide it, but he looks surprised. He was so used to chasing you, that you caught him off guard in your response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clair, are you feeling...\" he tires to say before another kiss in started. With your eyes closed, you mind realizes in absolute horror that you were the one that initiated this kiss.</span></div></div>",

I see no ring on your finger, and you're like what, 30? 35? your internal clock is ticking, and yet you can't even snag the single most pathetic guy here. Why, because no one likes you. Your ugly, your dumb, and you'd try to be a slut, but you can't even pull that off.\" you say.<br>\r\nBeth steps back, your verbal offensive has caught her off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't even catch Will's attention. And I know for a fact that Will is a nobody, he'll sleep with strange girls, he'll squeeze the ass of freaks, but he won't even touch you. And like I said, Will is a nothing, so what's that make you?\"<br>\r\nBeth squeezed her hand into a fist, like she's going to hit you. You suspected that she had a crush on you, and mentioning her failure to get you, as Will, hit her hard. You see in her eyes that she knows hitting you is not going to do her any favors. Tears start to swell within them.<br>\r\n\"Okay, you've won, tone this back.\" you tell yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BITCH!\" Beth yells, the tears in her eyes now start to run.<br>\r\n\"Will told me he hates you, he told me you disgust him, he told me how every guy in the office talks about you just being here instantly kills their erections.\" you lean over to tell her.<br>\r\nYour dominance is asserted, but you can feel that you're no longer in control again. You'd never say all those things to Beth. What you just said were lies, she's only 27, attractive, and tries to be nice, despite being a bit stuck up. As annoying as she was this week, you kind of appreciated her investigating Clair. She liked you, and you defiantly didn't want to see her hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slap me!\" you think as you lean over towards her, but Beth seems to shrink in your presence.<br>\r\n\"Maybe if you grew a cup size and lost twenty pounds guys would notice you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nFinally, Beth slaps you as hard as she can across the face. You feel a pain on your left cheek and jaw, but your body kind of likes it.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry!\" you try and say.<br>\r\n\"I'll see you at the party tomorrow.\" you sneer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth runs crying out of the washroom and as the door closes behind her, you revert to being male. You look in the window and see that your cheek is still red. \"What the hell was that?\" you ask yourself as you rub cold water on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's clear that Beth and Clair will be life long enemies after this. But you're not sure what caused it. It has to be the curse. You never thought you'd be cruel enough to treat Beth how you just did. Why the hell did the curse do that? Was the curse sentient? Did it use you to drive away the competition? Is that why you were so hostile to Beth? Your head floods with questions and you remember what Ben told you last night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and console yourself by saying that since this morning started, the one good thing that came out of it was that Nick probably thinks you're a bit psycho and will back off. Then it hits you that if Ben's findings are right, the curse will try and force you to win Nick back. The horror of what you might do causes you to nervously gulp. As you do, you feel your Adam's apple disappear as a pale white, raven-haired beauty stares at you from your reflection. Someone must be on the other side of the wall in the men's room. You check your lips in the mirror, you were right, they're no longer smudged.</span></div></div>",

Everyone involved in the Denver Project is attempting to get physical with you, and you're body isn't exactly pushing them away like it was earlier this week. You made out with at least two other guys you barely knew. One in the supply closet, and one in the stairwell. You're checking out your reflection whenever you can, and you can't blame the guys. No matter how hard you try and change your expression, it looks sex starved, but not quite desperate. It's a dangerous combination. Maybe the curse is messing with their heads too. Maybe they can't think straight around a women they think looks perfect. Your pheromones could be working overtime too. That's always a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sway towards your car as Joey picks you up.<br>\r\n\"Going my way?\" you ask him playfully.<br>\r\n\"Hop on in miss.\" he responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in the car, and prepare to morph into every shape, color, and body size as you pass through traffic on your way home. You don't change as much as you think though, but that's probably because Joey is right beside you, anchoring your variety with his presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou catch yourself examining Joey as he shifts between paying attention to traffic and trying to peek at you.<br>\r\nHis thoughts on you are fairly obvious, as the poor guy forgot to do up his fly, and his underwear is poking straight up like a tent. You never realized the size of Joey's penis before. It's a whole three inches longer than yours. And for a second, you feel like even less of a man, if that were possible. No wonder women put up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a reason you can't figure out, your mouth starts to dry, and you feel like you need a drink or something.<br>\r\nJoey is trying to mention something to you, but you're not paying attention. Joey notices your eyes glaring at his lap, and his face flushes bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Clair.\" he says, reaching down to try and zip up.<br>\r\n\"Don't.\" you tell him and place your hand on his.<br>\r\nHe looks up at you, wondering what is going on. Does he think you're aroused?<br>\r\n\"You're going to hurt yourself and maybe get us in an accident.\" you tell him. \"Wait until the next red light.\"<br>\r\n\"Kay.\" he replies meekly, awkwardly rearranging his underwear and zipping up his fly on the next light.<br>\r\nThe ride remains awkward until you park beside your building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey? How much do you owe Ben?\" you ask him before exiting the vehicle.<br>\r\n\"About $700.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I can give you the money.\"<br>\r\n\"I don't want your money.\"<br>\r\n\"I gave you money before, it's not different now is it.\"<br>\r\n\"You spotted me $50 before, I can't ask you to pay. You've got your own problems.\" he retorts.<br>\r\n\"I want you to have it. I want you as my roommate.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Why? I'm useless.\"<br>\r\n\"You're not useless. I trust you. And believe me, when I feel this vulnerable, I need someone I can trust.\" you say firmly grabbing his arm with your hand.<br>\r\nHe looks down at you for a moment, and you instinctively bat your eyelashes. You want him to stay, and not because you like him or anything, (you like him as a friend,) it's because Joey is preferable to whoever you'd have to get as your new roommate to pay the bills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you fade out and imagine having to move into Nick's place. That image sends a chill through your soul.<br>\r\nWhen you come to, the money is in Joey's hand and you're both getting out of the car. \"Make sure to get a receipt.\" you tell him in a businesslike manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up stairs as he walks down and as you enter your apartment, you become male again. Quickly hiding the money in your dresser, you go through the piles of clothes in your room, looking for a bathing suit you can use for tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

You make a flex and admire your reflection. You can't help but smile, knowing that some girls out there wouldn't be able to keep their hands off of you. Too bad, they'll have less and less of a chance to see your male body in all it's natural glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the main door shut as footsteps walk into your apartment. The change immediately comes over you as you see the women in the mirror trying to flex her muscles. She's less successful at it than the guy standing there seconds before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, you see your breasts are swinging a bit. You lean over and look down past them to see that your trunks have turned into the bottom half of a two piece bathing suit. Your nipples harden as you realize you're a lot colder now as a women. Stupid lack of muscle mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain starts to work on how tomorrow is going to play out. Although you're sure a lot of guys wouldn't mind if you appeared in this suit as is, it would still send the wrong impression. And you really don't want guys to get that impression of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think hard, and realize that these trunks are the only suit that you have at your place. You need something tasteful for the party tomorrow, you rack your brain in an attempt to think of anything that might save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you give up and realize that shopping is your best way out of this mess. You hate the idea of shopping, it's so damn stereotypical.<br>\r\n\"You have a problem? shopping will fix it!\" you mind torments you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, we're going shopping!\" you yell at him as you open the door.<br>\r\n\"Nice tits.\" Joey says, without thinking.<br>\r\nYou look down, your face flushed with embarrassment. You wanted to get this shopping thing down so quickly that you forgot the reason you wanted to go. Or maybe part of you no longer cared about your situation. You feel yourself getting increasingly numb when it comes to caring how guys act around you. Either way, you forgot to cover yourself up before stepping out of your bedroom.<br>\r\nAs you cover your nipples with your hands and escape back into your room, you notice that there has been a bit of a change in Joey over the last few days.<br>\r\nHe doesn't come over to the door and try and tell you it'll be okay, or that you shouldn't be embarrassed, he's not even really mocking you like he once was. He seems rather cool with the fact that his roommate has disappeared and replaced with a hot woman who he's not supposed to touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour not sure how you feel about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you step in front of your toilet, and revert to your male state. You quickly throw on some comfortable clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your bedroom door, and see Joey standing there, twirling the key's on his fingers.<br>\r\nYour clothing feels considerably less comfortable, as it tightens around you, exposing your midriff and two-thirds of your breasts. Your jeans turned into a bright blue skirt, which is about as short as any of the others you've worn today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you get ready so fast?\" Joey jokes. Or maybe it's a legitimate question. You don't really care. You just need to go shopping, because you've already tried just about every other gender-bender cliche out there. Despite this, you blush a bit at Joey's words. Not that he can see you do it because of all the make up you're wearing.<br>\r\n\"Just drive, stupid.\" you say in a neutral tone. You can't even tell if you're acting playful or upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you head down to the car, with Joey helping you with your balance, by holding you as you go down the stairs. You even manage to avoid Ben as you make it to the vehicle. Seeing Ben, Joey pulls out a receipt for his rent as if reading your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot a word is said, as he opens the car door for you.<br>\r\nAs he does this, some passers by get a good look at you, and you feel your body shift again. You look into the car mirror and see that you're incredibly chubby. You even have silver hair, \"What a couple of freaks.\" you mind says, blaming the men in the distance for your condition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Joey enters through his door, you return to looking like the woman you were Sunday morning. The guy freaks must have lost interest once you entered the car. You feel like a piece of meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to head to the mall?\" Joey asks with fake enthusiasm.<br>\r\nYou're beginning to think that he likes shopping more than you do.</span></div></div>",

This time you're not going to make the same mistake. You walk right beside Joey, making sure not to touch him and you travel through the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you feel the familiar changes as you morph into a mixture of men's fantasies. That sickening feeling in the pit of your stomach has returned. At one point you're sure your hair changed to red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk past the store where the cashier called the mall security on you. You stare her down as you walk by. Judging by her harsh stares back, you feel confident she remembers you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDragging Joey into another clothing store, not to far from the last one you visited. You see a number of two piece bathing suits on a bargain rack.<br>\r\n\"Oh, this one looks cute.\" you say before stopping yourself. You look around to see if Joey noticed that you said that. His face smirks, like he's trying not to burst out laughing. You give him a hard stare, implying you'll punish him if he does.<br>\r\nYou pick up the bathing suit and hold it up in front of your clothes. \"This should fit me.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, is there a place I could try this on?\" you ask the store clerk.<br>\r\n\"Back room, but once you try on a bathing suit, it's a sale.\" the women says.<br>\r\nYou look at the price tag, it's only $15, and you could probably guilt Joey into paying for you if it doesn't fit.<br>\r\n\"Joey, I need to try this on. It's important you don't go anywhere.\" you tell him. Reminded of all the running around that happened last time you went into the women's change room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" says Joey as he sits down in the corner and turns on a portable device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the doors, and and see about four small change rooms. Two are occupied. You take one of the unoccupied rooms and strip. There is a body length mirror beside you, placed so that you could judge yourself when trying on new fashions. You just stare at the naked women, realizing that you'll never get used to her actions mirroring yours. You want to make out with her so badly, but the best you can do in this situation is make out as her, a reality that you find less than enticing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait for a minute as you expect Joey to get bored and leave. But you don't change. Minutes pass, and you realize you're going to have to get dressed as you are.<br>\r\nThe bottom half is pretty easy, you just pull those up like they're a tight pair of briefs. It's the top part that you were never taught how to do. \"I think the top goes on, one leg at a time.\" you joke with yourself. Playing ignorant to how this is done almost gives you an artificial sense that you're not used to your situation. It's comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the second try, you manage to actually fit the top part on. You look at the girl in the mirror and do some sexy poses, trying desperately to save those images in your mind for when you're cured. You stop when you realize how weird you find the situation. Plus you can't get the smell of ceder and sun-lotion out of your head. You imagine someone rubbing it on your back and feel like you're going to snap. A quick daydream reveals you on the beach, reading some trashy harlequin novel as Joey slathers the white stuff all over your behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel a change come over you and you see your male self in the mirror, wearing a two piece suit that doesn't cover anything it's supposed to. You look like a real freak. One that sucks at cross-dressing. But just as soon as the change happens, it's undone and the familiar looking women is once again trying on swimwear in the mirror.</span></div></div>",

You haven't paid for it yet, but that's really just a technicality. It's your and it hasn't changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look behind you and see a pile of your clothes laying on the floor. They've reverted to the slut-wear that you had when you came here, even though you weren't touching them when you changed. Do you have some sort of magical aura around you that's growing and feminizing things you own, even if you're not touching them when you transform? It's something you'll have to get Joey to look into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awkwardly get undressed and fit back into the clothes you came in with when an idea hits you, maybe women's clothes aren't affected by the curse. That's probably why the bathing suit didn't get altered. You need to test this hypothesis out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your purse and look at Joey playing some game on his phone. You don't even really care which one, games seem more like a waste of time than anything else that you might be doing. You do need to find a cure after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Took you long enough.\" Joey says, looking at you annoyed.<br>\r\n\"It'll be worth it.\" you say with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go up to the counter and pay for the bathing suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go home now, right?\" Joey says as you both leave the store. He's obviously not having as good of a time as he thought he world. Probably you being less squeamish in your body has taken a lot of entertainment out of this for him.<br>\r\n\"Just one more stop.\" you tell him, eying a dress shop.<br>\r\n\"You were in that last store for 20 minutes.\" he complains.<br>\r\nYou look down at your watch and to your surprise, find that he's right, you were in there for 25 minutes. It defiantly didn't feel like it.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry. I'll be quick.\" you promise.<br>\r\n\"You'll be like guy quick, in and out.\"<br>\r\n\"It'll be quicker than sex.\" you promise. Realizing to your horror that you had no clue why you said those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your condition, you still try and be a man of your word, and grab the closest dress to your size, not really sure what size you are as a women, or if it really matters, since you change female forms so often anyways. Paying for the cute sundress, you head back to meet up with Joey, when suddenly you are cut off by another women, who blocks your path with a stroller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my, god, where did you get that dress?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Right over there.\" you say, pointing to the store with excitement.<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, it'll look great on you.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe women looks tired, she is about your age, but she's about half a foot smaller than you, maybe that's because of the difference your heels are making. But what you notice most are her eyes, beneath them are bags that come from having too much stress and too little rest. Instinctively, you know that she's fishing for a compliment. She want's someone to tell her she's pretty. You catch yourself and try and stop this conversation from starting, but you don't want to seem like a total bitch. You quickly try and change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your baby is so gorgeous.\" you tell her, looking at the infant swaddled in pink.<br>\r\n\"She's only 8 months.\" the mother proudly says, as the baby opens one of it's eyes about half-way, and with it's tiny hand rubs the closed one.<br>\r\n\"I want one.\" you say, before immediately shutting yourself up. Not only did you not mean to say it, but you've just entered a conversation that you never wanted to have, which could easily go on for an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, Joey seems to figure this out and starts to walk towards the video-game store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and act interested in the mother talking about all her feminine feelings and experiences, when suddenly you feel a shift. Your hair has changed length a bit, and is showing more than just a tint of red. You nervously look around, is that creep back? You can't spot him, but it doesn't mean he's not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mother looks at you, seeing something is wrong. But she also looks like she's in some sort of dream state. She probably hasn't slept a good long time. Does she even see the change?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I just remembered, I left the stove burning.\" you say as you rush past her to find Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tells you that you need to leave, now.</span></div></div>",

A little sanctuary from the leering eyes of your once fellow men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you wait to see if the plan works or not, you need Joey to get far enough to the other side of the apartment in order for you to turn back into a guy. After about five minutes of waiting, (with most of that time dedicated to examining your nails,) you hear Joey's bedroom door shut, and you revert back to your true form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into your mirror, you hold the dress in front of you. This is not how you want to spend your time as a man. But if it works, it could make your life so much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou squeeze into the dress, hoping the seams don't break because of your size, and look at the mirror, almost unable to move. You look like a guy who is very uncomfortable with his sexuality. You're almost afraid to open the door, fearing that someone else might actually see you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrew it, even if you didn't change back, it's no more humiliating than any number of things that you've done this week. You're already trying to block out what happened today at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou struggle to open the door, trying hard not to rip the dress when finally you get outside your room and into the main living area. In your awkward steps, you manage to trip on something. (You're pretty sure it's the edge of a rug.) Tripping yourself as you fall against the couch.<br>\r\n\"OUCH!\" you yell in a voice that's octave is too high to belong to a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou roll against the couch and find yourself looking up at the ceiling. The right side of your chest feeling extreme pain. You must have transformed into a woman when you fell. And your right breast hit itself on the couch as you did. You start rubbing it a bit. You need ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Joey says as he comes bursting from his bedroom door. His fly is undone, his belt unbuckled, and his palms sweaty. You don't really want him to touch you.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" you say trying to sit up. You stop rubbing your breast, but it just brings more attention to your pain.<br>\r\nMuch to your horror, Joey gets behind you and lifts you up onto the couch.<br>\r\n\"Take a seat, I'll get you some frozen peas.\" he says.<br>\r\nAs Joey walks to the fridge's freezer, you start rubbing yourself again. Feeling weird for doing so. \"The pain wasn't that bad, was it? Are you rubbing yourself just for the sake of it?\" a voice inside your head asks you. That voice has got to be self-doubt, you assure yourself. The last thing that you need if for the curse to start making you hear voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here.\" says Joey as he passes you the frozen bag of peas. You place it over your sundress, hoping the thin layer of clothing will stop your skin from feeling too much cold. The temperature difference across your skin is more noticeable than it would have been if you were male.<br>\r\n\"There, just lay back, and relax. I've got everything covered.\" Joey says.<br>\r\nYou look at Joey, you don't know if you're trying to look stressed, disgruntled, thankful, or something else. You just look at him for a moment, hoping he'll look back.<br>\r\n\"Does he even notice your new dress?\" the voice inside you asks.<br>\r\n\"Of course he does, now shut up!\" you mentally tell it.<br>\r\nYou look down and examine your dress. You notice that the size has altered to fit you a bit more, but it hasn't become sexualized like the rest of the clothes you wear when transformed. Maybe the solution to your wardrobe problem was just as simple as buying from the women's section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you feel better in the next half hour, there is still time for you to go to another store and buy some more clothes for work tomorrow.<br>\r\nOf course you can feel that plan completely fall apart a second later when the door bell to your apartment rings.</span></div></div>",

He hasn't seen you yet, but you've felt different after the door was opened. Your breasts are noticeably bigger, and your hips outline more of a curve.<br>\r\n\"This is Clair.\" he says pointing towards you.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say, in a manner that's trying to be friendly, even over the pain, and the fact you're resenting more people calling you Clair instead of William.

It's the least you could do after they brought you some food.<br>\r\nIt smells good now. You're not completely sure, but you think the food is smelling sharper now than when you were a guy. Two instincts tear at you, one to devour the meal, and the other to watch your figure. It's an annoying conflict. You know that the second a guy walks by, you're weight will change accordingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the table is set, Joey's parents sit down as you all serve the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It smells delicious.\" you tell his mom.<br>\r\n\"I'm starved.\" says Joey, as he takes a huge scoop of mashed potatoes, and piles it on his plate. You take a very small scoop. Although you're not sure why you don't get a bigger helping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChicken legs are being passed around the table, and you just take one. Even though your stomach is growling. The wings look bigger than you're used to, but you just tell yourself it's because you're smaller now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall talk between the family commences and you try and ignore them. You play around with your potatoes a bit, until you see the others starting to eat the chicken wings. The guys seem to be using their hands, so you figure you'll join in the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wing is difficult to chew while keeping your mouth clean. You can seem to widen your mouth as much as you thought you could. You try and bit down, and feel the skin around your mouth become greasy and hot and you sink into the tender meat. You feel humiliated, you probably look awful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the hell am I caring about this?\" your mind screams.<br>\r\nYou quickly look down and grab a napkin to clean the mess up. Looking down like that gives you a great view of your breasts. Damn they're big, Joey's father must have some crazy fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear someone say the word 'Clair.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry?\" you respond, dropping the napkin.<br>\r\n\"How did you meet Will?\" asks Joey's mom.<br>\r\n\"I've known Will all my life.

Something that almost never happened when you were male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour current body probably can't digest as much as quickly. That's probably why you weren't as hungry as when you had a Y-chromosome.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to finish that dear?\" Joey's mother asks.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm full.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you up and down for a second. \"I, see.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that about?\" you mind asks.<br>\r\nThe others have finished eating as well. Joey's father took the longest, but you're pretty sure that's because he kept trying to eye you down when eating the drumstick. You also could have sworn you felt his leg brush up against yours, but it only happened once, and might have been an accident. You didn't say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose someone should clean up this mess.\" Joey's mother says.<br>\r\n\"I'll do it.\" says Joey.<br>\r\n\"We'll do it.\" you add. \"You brought us dinner. We can clean up.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh how lovely.\" Joey's mom says as you all stand up.<br>\r\nHis dad goes to the couch and belches as he turns on to the television.<br>\r\nHis mom, gives a knowing shrug. You can tell she's embarrassed by his actions and this is her way of apologizing for him.<br>\r\nAs you and Joey put the dishes in the sink, Joey's dad yells something about the clicker, quickly starting to lose his temper.<br>\r\n\"I'd better go help him.\" Joey says as he takes off his rubber gloves and walks to the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'll never come back.\" his mom says, as you start to scrub the dishes.<br>\r\n\"I know.\" you say, trying hard to get all the food remains off the plates.<br>\r\n\"It's the nature of men, it will never change.\" she says as she starts to dry what you finish.<br>\r\n\"So how long have you really known Joey?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"I mean, most women are put off by him for the first month they know him. He seems lazy, arrogant, and sexist at first. It's only after they know him they realize what a sweet and dedicated guy he is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop for a moment. There is no way you can think of answering this that will make yourself seem uninterested in him, or seem like a lie to hide your 'true' relationship with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've known him as long as William has.\" you say, passing her another dish.<br>\r\n\"I see.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"We're just friends.\" you promise.<br>\r\n\"Dear, I may be getting older not stupid. I know you're into each other.\"<br>\r\n\"What?! NO!\" you say, as a dish slips out of your hand and into the sink.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing to be ashamed of dear. Liking him just means your a healthy young women. We can't all pretend to be little girls forever.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm a guy!\" your brain shouts at her. She doesn't seem to be able to read minds.<br>\r\n\"Really, I promise you. We're just friends. I'm more the type of girl William would hang around with.\" you tell her. Feeling almost sick as you do. You just insinuated you'd chase after yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's mom puts the plate down and looks at you, her face straightens out and looks uncharacteristically serious. \"Dear, I've known William for a long time. He and Joey used to play together in grade school. And at his heart, I know he's a good guy. But he will abuses whatever he can get his hands on and tosses it away. Toys, hobbies, jobs, occupations, and women are no exception. He lives life fast and fun and will leave you as little more than a broken husk.\"<br>\r\n\"Who does this bitch think she is?! What type of mother says this about her son's friends?\" you mind shouts.<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\" you say as you finish cleaning the dishes.<br>\r\n\"She's a looker.\" you hear Joey's dad says as he looks over his shoulder at you. Tom is peaking at you too. You can see looks of lust in their faces. Is the act of you doing the dishes turning them on? You decide not to dwell on that question.<br>\r\n\"See, she's totally into you.\" he says quietly to Joey, and he playfully shakes him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dad is a dick.\" you tell Joey later that night.</span></div></div>",

A miniature moan escapes from your plump lips, as you squeeze your thighs together.<br>\r\nYour eyes struggle to remain closed, as your silk sheets give you know reason to get up. They even feel great against your unprotected breasts.<br>\r\nYour eyes immediately widen; you don't have silk sheets!<br>\r\nYour hands frantically feel the fabric around you, grabbing your blanket and letting it's wrinkles squeeze between your fingers.<br>\r\nYour legs give another squeeze. As you struggle to sit up, you see that the covers are a hot flamingo pink.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" your mind races.<br>\r\nThere is another jolt between your legs.<br>\r\nYou throw off the covers to find a pink frilly pillow, also covered in silk, standing upright, located directly beneath your undergarments.<br>\r\nYou lean over to reach it as your breasts drop a bit, and your hair covers your view.<br>\r\nYou grab the pillow and toss it to corner of your room, then sit up on the side of your bed.<br>\r\nYour mind quickly processes all the new information provided since you awoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt comes to the conclusion that something is very off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and walk towards your bathroom. You catch yourself smelling your armpit, and recognize that for the first time since your transformation, you can smell your own body odor. Your nose pulls away sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour bladder feels like it needs to release again, and you walk towards the toilet, fully expecting to be male by the time you get there. So convinced are you or your correctness, that in this early morning daze, you merely pull the front of your panties down and release.<br>\r\nYou feel a wetness fall out from between your legs, and immediately realize that the change hasn't happened.<br>\r\nInstinctively, you try and hold the urine is as if you were a guy, and turn around to sit on the toilet.<br>\r\nAs your ass hits the porcelain, you realize to your horror that you had left the seat up. As the toilet water splashes on your butt-cheeks, you finally release what's left in your system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour forehead starts to ache, and you feel the salty tears about to swell beneath your eyes. You instinctively want to call out for Joey to save you, but catch yourself. There is no way in hell that you're letting Joey catch you in this position. Looking around, you realize that the counter is close enough to grab and you pull yourself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your face in the mirror, your intuition tells you that you are going to hate today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk over to the shower and start it. Getting in only after you cool down the taker enough for your skin to tolerate it. The bottles by your feet seem to have changed last night to. You pick them up and read them as you let the shower wash the soap from your body. Your shampoo and conditioner bottles now both say 'for her' on their labels. You even see a little pink razor right next to the soap. You pick it up and find it's the type women use for shaving unwanted body hairs. You have no clue what object might have transformed into the razor, and decide that it's not worth touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou apply the shampoo and close your eyes as you let it soak into your long hair. You imagine all the interesting styles you could create with it, and then stop yourself. Why the hell are you thinking this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My name is Will and I'm a straight man.\" you start to repeat to yourself until shampoo runs into your mouth. You spit it out, disgusted.<br>\r\nAfter the shower you try and wrap a towel around your head, like you've seen some girls do on television. But you fail miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk up to the mirror and look at your dark wet hair fall around your shoulders. You try and look angry, but find yourself looking a bit too sexy for your own comfort level. You really wish you could still pop a boner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the counter, you notice something else that's different than before. Almost all the objects on your counter have changed. The soap is scented soap. your comb is now a brush. There is a little mirror that wasn't there yesterday. You're not sure what it's for, but your guess is that it has something to do with make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, there are also some make up products you see around the sink. Blush, nail polish remover, some sort of skin cover, and many more you don't feel like examining. Temporarily possessed by morbid curiosity, you begin looking in your cupboard, you see some pills that weren't there before. (One of which you are sure is THE pill.) As well as some tampons and a douche.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My life can't possibly get any worse.\" you think out loud.<br>\r\n\"Just wait until you check out your closets.\" your reflection says.</span></div></div>",

You're not letting this slide.<br>\r\n\"I know you're there.\" you say to the women in the mirror.<br>\r\nThe thing in the mirror raises its hand and slowly waves at you. You look over in horror and see your hand waving in the exact same manner. You never wanted your hand to do that.<br>\r\n\"So, let's get this started.\" says your reflection.<br>\r\n\"Who are you!\" you say with a commanding voice.<br>\r\n\"Me? Oh, I'm just the answer to all your little problems.\" it says in an innocent tone, and it mockingly puts its finger up to its pouted lips. You mentally cringe as you feel your finger softly press against your lips.<br>\r\n\"Stop that!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Stop what?\" it coos back in a babyish voice. Your asses are now facing each other as your head is turned to still see the mirror.<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" you yell, temporarily snapping out of her control.<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun. Because you haven't had real fun in a long time.\" she says with an evil smile.<br>\r\n\"I was doing fine!\" you rebut.<br>\r\n\"Oh were you? Do you even remember half the nights you went out partying? Do you remember the last time you meant someone new? You've been living with your childhood friend for three years now. You've gotten nowhere are work, and you put on a show at the clubs so that your colleges won't think you any less of a man.\"<br>\r\n\"That's not true!\"<br>\r\n\"Please, stop with the anger, it's so unladylike that you're just embarrassing yourself now.\" it smugly replies.<br>\r\n\"It's not true.\" you say in a much more refined manner.\"<br>\r\n\"You know you're lying. In your head all you do all day is complain. Oh, I didn't get a promotion. Oh, I don't have the balls to tell Beth I like her. Oh, my friends might think I'm gay unless I grind myself against that strange women. Oh look, works done, I'm going to go home and not talk to Joey about anything besides sports and babes, and thank him for being a good friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Everyone wants to strive for something better.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"And I'm giving you the easy way to get there. Isn't that the American dream? Barely work, get rich quick. Face it girl, with this package you could have whoever you want.\"<br>\r\n\"I want to get there my way.\" you tell her, starting to get more than a bit stressed.<br>\r\n\"Oh please. You know that's bullshit. How many people have you told about your condition? Joey, and that's it.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to tell just anyone something they could hold against me for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n\"No, you'd rather have close calls, and people dropping to their knees before you. Why didn't you tell Nick about the curse?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'd never hear the end of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't you? Joey can be a bit of an ass, but he's done nothing but try and help you since this happened. What makes you think Nick is any different?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I haven't known Nick as long.\"<br>\r\n\"But when you went to his house, last weekend, you still went inside.\"<br>\r\n\"I was being polite!\"<br>\r\n\"All you had to do was drop off the papers and leave. But you couldn't have that. You needed Nick to pay attention to you. He wasn't at work, and you wanted to show him more about you...\"<br>\r\n\"I left when things got hairy.\" you say, justifying your actions.<br>\r\n\"At work, when he was constantly coming onto you, you could have told him off at any time. You could have threatened a sexual harassment lawsuit, but you didn't. You just let him come onto you as you played hard to get.\"<br>\r\n\"We needed to collaborate on the project!\" you say. You feel completely on the defensive here.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sure you needed something. You could have stayed home and got the same amount of work done. Instead, you kept going into work, showing off your ass to everyone who looked at you. And despite your objections, you liked it.\"<br>\r\n\"I did not!\"<br>\r\n\"You sat in Nick's lap, you took money from your boss. You think that's free? You know full well what he'll expect soon. No, you wanted success at work, and you wanted physical interaction from someone you knew.\"<br>\r\n\"I did not!\"<br>\r\n\"When's the last time you talked to your exes? Did you even have a relationship that lasted more than three months? You took the girl and through her away, giving yourself no reason to stay with her.\"<br>\r\n\"It's the lifestyle, those women knew what they were getting into.\" you protest. Feeling even more stressed.<br>\r\n\"It's because secretly, you don't want girls. You want to be held by someone bigger, more confident and caring than you.\"<br>\r\n\"SHUT UP!\" you yell at the mirror. Sick of it's lies.<br>\r\n\"Oh, did I touch a nerve? Face it CLAIR, most men in your position would just lock themselves in their room until they knew they'd see the goth chick again.\"<br>\r\n\"But I'm not most men. I'm better than that! I had responsibilities, and I had to hold up my part in them. Even if doing it meant I had to go out looking like this!\" you say pointing at her in triumph.<br>\r\n\"And look at how well things turned out. You're in line for a promotion, Joey got his rent paid, Nick listens to your advice and shares his success with you. Even your entire office was better off just because Clair went to that meeting instead of William.\"<br>\r\nYou stand back speechless. You hadn't thought of it like that, but your reflection is right. Things have been better for those around you since you started changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, it doesn't mean you have to like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Ben got shut stood up in his own apartment, and Eugene did something that could have gotten him fired. And Beth was humiliated.\" you say, trying to show that bad things could happen because of your situation.<br>\r\n\"Oh, but Eugene wasn't caught, and Ben and Beth were hurt because you weren't comfortable enough with your sexuality. There's still time to fix there egos if you go and submit to them.\"<br>\r\n\"Go away!\" you should again.<br>\r\n\"Go to your closet.\" the reflection says.<br>\r\nA strange force seems to force you to obey, covering its power with the feeling of morbid curiosity.</span></div></div>",

On the rack are many strange and crazy outfits that look more suitable for whoring yourself than working. You pull out a black leather mini-skirt, it can't be anymore than 9 inches in length. You toss it back into the clutter of clothes, and take out a strange looking top. It has a boob window in it. There are a pair of sweat pants that say 'squeeze here' over where your ass cheeks would go. You go through the pile, desperately looking for anything that looks gender neutral, or failing that, at least doesn't make you look like a whore. As you dig through the pile of shoes, you find a school girls uniform. Sadly it seems to be the most tasteful thing in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you are about to give up, you see a plain white shirt, and cargo shorts. They look tight, but they look good enough.<br>\r\nSqueezing into them, you go over to the mirror to see your result. It's not bad, you look skinny, but if you braided your hair and bought some guns, you'd be able to tell people you wanted to raid tombs for a living.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly go through your purse and take out your drivers license. It still says William, and has a picture of your original face on it. Why hasn't this thing been transformed with anything else?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw on some shoes, all of which have unnecessarily high heels. They're a pain in the ass, but through experience, you are getting better at walking in them. Plus they make your legs and ass look great. Not that it's a good thing. Maybe you could just get Joey to carry you around everywhere. You immediately shake that idea out of your head, you never want to depend on Joey for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your watch, you realize that despite all the extra steps you took this morning, you're still early. You must have been faster than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door and through some act of random coincidence, Joey opens his door at the exact same time.</span></div></div>",

Joey looks at you, and you try to look confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Joey says in a voice much more enthusiastic than usual.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say, trying not to let out a giggle.<br>\r\nJoey walks over slowly towards you. You can feel your own knees bending towards each other, touching together. Your hands are together in front of your waist, holding the purse. You're feel still like a statue, and you're having trouble, looking down, but figure you must be posing.<br>\r\nAs hard as it is for you, you can't seem to break the smile, or move your gaze from Joey's eyes. For whatever reason, they seem hypnotic this morning.<br>\r\nJoey seems to pick up on this as he moves with more of a swagger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love the bow.\" he says as he touches the object in your hair. \"Bow?\" you think \"This curse has me wrapped up in a bow?\"<br>\r\nJoey holds your hair for a second, and your heart races at the feeling of being touched by another human. You can feel your body blushing, totally against your will.<br>\r\nJoey smells the hair, which simultaneously flatters you and creeps you out. \"Strawberries.\" he says. He moves his hand away and you find yourself able to look down. You're wearing a completely different outfit. It's a two piece dress, a tiny skirt with the slit going up the middle instead of the side. The top seems almost more like a vest then a shirt, with the opening going all the way down to your stomach. Your breasts are barely covered by them.<br>\r\n\"Quit looking so happy, it's the curse, you perv.\" you try and say. \"Do you like it? I picked it out just for you.\" you body says, betraying you.<br>\r\n\"Ya, totally.\" Joey says, starting to look a bit suspicious, he probably thinks you're playing a joke on him.<br>\r\nYou quickly flutter your eyelashes, like you're trying to get a piece of dust off of them. \"Figure it out Joey.\" your mind pleads. \"Why won't you kiss me?\" another voice in your head says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you feeling okay?\" Joey says,<br>\r\n\"I've never felt better.\" your voice says in all seriousness.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" says Joey as he moves around behind you. \"So THIS won't ruin your day.\" he says as he slaps your ass.<br>\r\nYou let out a 'tee-hee' sound. \"Oh, that's bad, I should punish you.\" you say with a bit of a playful growl in your voice.<br>\r\nJoey stops and looks at you. \"Will, is there something wrong?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"THANK YOU! YOU NOTICED.\" the voice in your head yells in relief. \"It's just like any other day this week.\" you mouth says with an eerie smile.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to be late for work?\" he asks.<br>\r\nYour body forces you to look at your watch. \"Oh no, I'm going to be so late!\" you voice says in a mock tone. A second later, your body is pressed up against Joey's. \"If only someone would be able to drive me.\" you say, clutching onto his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should go to work today.\" Joey tells you.<br>\r\n\"Please tell me what to think.\" your body says in the innocent tone.<br>\r\nJoey takes his phone and calls the office.<br>\r\n\"Hi, yes, this is Joey, I'm Clair's roommate...I'll wait...Yes, I'm calling because Clair is incredibly sick today, and can't make it in...Yes...Yes, thank you...Maybe, she might get better by tonight...I agree, thank you.\" he says before hanging up.<br>\r\n\"There you go, you don't have to go into work today.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I don't think you should go outside today either.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"So it'll just be you and me all day?\" you say biting your lip.<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm leaving to go get groceries, and other things.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you whine.<br>\r\n\"Because I have a date tonight.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you say in shock. Both parts of your personality have the same reaction to this, but for two very different reasons.<br>\r\n\"I have a life outside of this place you know. And spending time with a real women will actually make me feel normal for a change.\"<br>\r\nAlthough you don't want him too, his words hurt you. Is he mad at you for something?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, I need you.\" you plead.<br>\r\n\"And I need to be turned on by a women who didn't used to be my best friend.\"<br>\r\n\"Used to be?\" your mind echoes. Does he really think of you that differently now?...Wait, did he just admit he got turned on by you?<br>\r\nJoey starts to walk towards the door. \"Joey!\" you plead.<br>\r\nHe turns around. \"Do not leave the apartment until I come back.\" he says pointing at you, he's trying to act stern and cool, but you can tell he's clearly embarrassed by admitting he got turned on.<br>\r\n\"Oh, so I'm just supposed to walk around barefoot in the kitchen?\" you yell. Joey rolls his eyes as he keeps walking for the door.<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to walk around barefoot in the kitchen?\" your body yells in an earnest question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door slams and suddenly control comes back to you. \"WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!\" you shout in frustration.</span></div></div>",

You're wearing cargo pants and a loose fitting T-shirt. Any and all unwanted feminine thoughts leave your head and you sit down on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened?\" you ask yourself. You behaved more like a doll than a person, producing a shallow vapid personality.<br>\r\nYou lie down and think about it. Did you just start acting out one of Joey's fantasies? Was the curse really that strong, that just him looking at you put you completely at his mercy? It could very well have been. \"How much stronger could this curse become?\" you ask yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back up, and walk into your bedroom. Everything looks like it should in a singe guy's room. You open the closet to see all your familiar clothes, and even look in the bathroom to see all the feminine hygiene products and other unwanted cosmetic products have disappeared. Replaced with your old items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror again. It's you. It's William. \"Hang in there man.\" you say at your tired reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you're male, but are trapped in your apartment. You try and think of ways to pass time. Watching sports seems too stereotypical, but your only other options are cooking yourself some breakfast, or cleaning up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can decide on an activity to pass the time, your reflection changes right in front of you. You feel the wieght of your chest start to pull on you a bit. Your hair is lengthy again. You look at the mirror and the word \"crap.\" shoots through your mind. You're now in a nightgown, but your face and hair is all made up. You look like Ben's ideal women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't think today was going to be easy?\" your reflection says mockingly. This is quickly followed by a quick knock on the door.</span></div></div>",

There is no way that Ben is going to see your look as anything other than you wanting sex.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to answer the door.\" you tell the girl in the mirror.<br>\r\n\"Aw, you honestly think that.\" she coos.<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to be a slut like you.\" you struggle to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly to feel another change come over you, and you fall back for a second.<br>\r\nSomething just happened, and if felt important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move towards the mirror again and look at it. You're still that woman Ben was into, but your clothes have changed. They're the top and cargo shorts that you originally pulled out of the closet this morning.<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" you say to the mirror.<br>\r\nYour reflection looks back at you. You look like you're dressed to walk the dog. There is nothing about how what your wearing that makes you stand out. At least when placed next to any other woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean in closer to the mirror again. You're defiantly wearing make-up. But it seems like the generic stuff that girls would wear when going to the office, not like what they'd wear when on a date.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head and see that your hair is in a bit of a ponytail. You look at your fingers and see your nails are painted a light pink which compliments your skin tone. Your shoes are even tennis shoes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can work with this.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to your apartment knocks again and Ben's voice says \"Is anybody there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay quiet, not wanting to lose control like you did when you saw Joey this morning.<br>\r\nYou don't move, if he doesn't hear anything, he'll leave.<br>\r\nYour head looks around the bathroom to pass the time. The colors are too warm from the male in you to feel comfortable knowing it's your place, and all the girly objects you saw when you woke up are still there.<br>\r\n'The curse must have altered all the objects I owned.\" you mind says, confirming it's suspicion from earlier. \"But why didn't the walls or couch change?\" you mentally ask yourself. \"Because Joey shares the ownership of those.\" you tell yourself. Of course it might be because those objects are too big to alter. Only the smaller or lighter objects around you have changed. Nothing that you couldn't lift on your own has changed with you. Of course you prefer to think that it's the first answer that popped in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear footsteps walking away and your reflection changes into the William who is still on your drivers license.<br>\r\nThere is a bulge in the front of your pants. An effect from all the blood flow caused by the transformation? Or maybe you were a bit more attracted to the girl in the mirror than you'd like to admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it for a second, what would your perfect piece of eye candy look like? You don't think about it too long. You're afraid if you do, your reflection might give you an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk out of your bedroom, you head for the couch and turn on the television. Putting your legs up on the coffee table, you lean back and watch reality show about fixing cars. You sit back in thought, barely watching it. For the first time in over a day, you feel like you've regained control of your actions.</span></div></div>",

You need to know that you're in control of your actions and not feeling forced by magic to jump up and attend to his every need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the door becomes unlocked as Joey comes in with his arms full of grocery bags.<br>\r\n\"Some help.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Don't feel like it.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\" Joey says in a deadpan tone as one of the smaller bags loses balance and spills on the floor.<br>\r\nYou slowly walk towards it and pick it up. You put the hair gel, cologne, and condoms into the bag and silently put it on the counter.<br>\r\nYou give him a jealous look.

You'd better keep calling me William. And yes, I think I am going to go there.\" you tell him. Joey seems relieved that you're not acting like you were when he left.<br>\r\n\"So you're not going to need the apartment tonight?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I'll be back before midnight. If you're going to sleep with her, go to her place, don't bring her here.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not making any promises.\"<br>\r\n\"Please? I really don't want to deal with another complication.\" you say, widening your eyes, trying to elicit some sympathy.<br>\r\n\"I can't say no to that face.\" Joey mocks.<br>\r\n\"Screw you.\" you say throwing a pillow at him. It was the reaction you wanted, but you hate the way you decided to ask.<br>\r\nHe catches the pillow and throws it back. It bounces off you, and you stand up.<br>\r\n\"I'll be in my room.\" you say, trying to sound defiant, after you've lost the meaningless show of strength. There are too many traces of fun in your voice pull it off.<br>\r\n\"Are you going to spend the next few hours trying on dresses for tonight?\" Joey says.<br>\r\nYou flip him the middle finger, and shut your bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at your analog watch, you realize you've got a few hours to kill before you have to leave for tonight.</span></div></div>",

One of the (very few) benefits of the curse is that you can walk up right next to any guy and look perfect to them. Still, you find yourself looking in the mirror, wondering that if the curse turned you into the perfect man for any women, if you'd get this much attention. You'd defiantly be more familiar with the outdoor plumbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, your parts do have their advantages. There is no way that you would have been able to go from an intern to a top player at your business in less than a week if you had just showed up as William. And it seems guys are much easier to manipulate to do what you want than girls are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaze into your reflections eyes, entranced by the look they've created. At least Joey doesn't have bad taste in women. Or a secret fetish. You realize that you could have easily been overweight or anorexic, or deformed in some way if that's what he was into. And you realize you're especially lucky that Joey doesn't have Nick's libido.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue to focus on your eyes, looking at the amount of work that went into making them stand out like that. You defiantly wouldn't be good at being a female if the curse didn't automatically doll you up. Your mind starts to think about your hair, your breasts, the rest of your face, and all the other parts that are groomed more on women then men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou've never really thought about it before, but how long would it take the average woman to get ready before she could hold her own standing next to you? You're guessing at least an hour, maybe two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting ready for this party should be the easiest thing you've done all week. All you have to do is throw your bathing suit into your purse, and get Joey to drive you to your destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your bed, and think of how Joey used to argue with you all the time about who got the car, and how tough it was to get him to help with anything. Now he offers. But that might be because he realizes your in trouble, and not just because you're a beautiful female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes. You've got this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeconds turn into minutes, and minutes into hours. Something is happening in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up in a panic. Are you late for the party? You quickly get up and rush out of your bedroom door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey? Joey?\" you ask the empty apartment.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Joey's bedroom door opens, and a your doppelganger steps out.<br>\r\n\"Okay, this has to be a dream.\" your mind realizes.<br>\r\n\"Hey Clair. I didn't think I'd see you until later tonight.\" she says with a playful cruelty.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Me? Why I'm everything to secretly wish to be.\" she says with a very seductive swagger.<br>\r\n\"Really? Because I just wish to be a man again.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Do you really limit yourself so much because of your sex?\"<br>\r\n\"I feel we've had this conversation before.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Then enough talk.\" she says walking up to you. \"Prove your a man and take me!\"<br>\r\n\"What?! No.\"<br>\r\n\"Why? Not man enough?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't want to give you the pleasure.\" you humph.<br>\r\n\"Hey, it takes to to tango. Either you be the dominant one, or I'll be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her in silence. You should be waking up soon. You're not going to give her the pleasure of playing her game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me. I have something to show you.\" she says walking into Joey's room.<br>\r\nYou don't want to go after her, but a strange pull makes your legs follow.<br>\r\nYou enter the room, and find romantic peddles thrown onto the floor, as two scented candles surround the bed.<br>\r\nYou see yourself before you as William, tied onto the bed almost naked, except for the ropes on your limbs and a gag for your mouth.<br>\r\nJoey is sitting next to you, smoking a cigar.<br>\r\n\"Mmmphh. Mmph. Mm.\" William struggles to say.<br>\r\nYour doppelganger puts her arm around your and leans in, enjoying the moment.<br>\r\n\"So, was it as good for you?\" asks Joey to the tied up William, unaware of your presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's just wrong.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"This is what's going through the mind of every guy who sees you. Even Joey is purposely trying to forget who you really were. He wants you as the trophy he sees.\"<br>\r\n\"Joey's not like that. I don't even think Nick is like that.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\" says the doppelganger as she walks over to Joey. She sits on his lap and starts stroking his chin.<br>\r\n\"Ready to go again?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Am I?!\" Joey says as he picks her up and lies her right on top of William.<br>\r\nSuddenly you blink and find yourself trapped in the doppelgangers position.<br>\r\nYou scream a silent scream before you wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to Joey looking down at you, gently shaking your shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Wake up Will, you're going to be late.\" he tells you.<br>\r\nYou look up at your clock, and see that it's only 25 minutes before you're supposed to be at the place.<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" Joey asks you.<br>\r\nYou look at him. Something is off, and Joey knows it too. \"He's probably reading distrust in my face.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine.\" you respond, in a tone much colder than you meant it to be.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" says Joey innocently, as he walks to the kitchen, and grabs the car keys.<br>\r\nAs Joey walks away, you realize you're unsure about if you still completely trust him or not. He still sees you as a guy, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab your bathing suit, and stuff it in your purse. Looking at yourself in the mirror one last time before you head out.<br>\r\nYou have 'bed-hair'.<br>\r\nThe female part of you wants to panic and get embarrassed. Split-ends are such a fashion faux pas.<br>\r\nThankfully, the male side of you remains calm. The next man to see you will cause the problem to fix itself. This curse just made you spend less time getting ready than you would of if you were still a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you coming?\" asks Joey.<br>\r\nYou quickly slip into some heels and move after him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel yourself starting to change less and less as the car moves off of the main roads and you head more towards the outskirts of the city. There is a light forest and you turn onto what looks like a back road. For a few minutes, it's just you and Joey driving in the quiet country road. He's dressed up to for his date. \"He at least cleans up well.\" you mind tells you before you tell yourself that you don't care. For a moment, your mind imagines a scenario where he pulls over and fakes the car breaking down so that he has a moment to get fresh with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind quickly dismisses that notion. You know more about cars than Joey does, he's smart enough to know he can't pull that off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you reach a clearing and see a gate up in the distance. Joey slows the car and stops in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA camera on the gate post looks at your car. And Joey turns towards you.<br>\r\n\"Last chance to back out. You know, if you're not feeling 100% in control.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. The more things I learn about here, the more I can use the information at work.\"<br>\r\n\"You do know you're about to step into a den of alpha-wolves.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"I'm a big boy, I can take care of myself.\" you say before you realize your hand brushed him off in a limped wrist motion.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Joey says as he presses the buzzer just outside the car window.<br>\r\n\"Hello, who is it?\" a voice says.<br>\r\n\"I've got this.\" you tell Joey as you unbuckle your safety belt and lean over Joey, pushing off his right leg to get your head towards the window.<br>\r\n\"It's Clair.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are a few seconds of silence.<br>\r\n\"Enter.\" the voice says, as you push yourself back to the seat. There is a buzz and the gate starts to open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have my cell?\" Joey asks as he goes down the huge driveway towards a fancy circular area right next to a giant garage. About a dozen other cars are already parked there.<br>\r\n\"Oh course. But I'm not going to call you. You just worry about your date tonight.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of the car with a sexy leg reveal, trying hard to balance in the heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt probably would have been provocative if anyone was there to see you.<br>\r\n\"Well, enjoy tonight.\" Joey says as you shut the door.<br>\r\nYou motion him to roll down the window.<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't worry about me. Tomorrow night, we'll find the bitch who did this to me, and we'll fix everything. You just have some fun tonight, just looking at me all week isn't healthy for you.\"<br>\r\nJoey seems to chuckle a bit, as he roles up the window and drives off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly walk up to the mansion The place must have at least 3 floors. You didn't know they made places like this anymore.<br>\r\nBig Mike opens the door.<br>\r\n\"Clair, you little minx. Come on in.\" he says in a cheery attitude.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you say hesitantly as you put out you hand to shake his. He grabs it and pulls it up to his mouth to kiss it.<br>\r\n\"That's how we greet beautiful women where I'm from.\" he says with a giant grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"I bet it is.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts and you see a room of mingling people.<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything? Some alcohol? water?\" Big Mike says.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine you assure him.\"<br>\r\n\"Well than woman, this is a party, enjoy yourself.\" Mike says before walking off to talk to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel strangely alone in this crowd. Your eyes quickly dark around the room to see who is here. About three quarters of the people here are men. But there are a group of women chatting near the kitchen. You're not sure how much girl-talk you could handle, but you don't really want to get hit on by strange drunk guys either. Maybe if you went over to a person from the office you'd be able to control the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice Big Mike looking in your direction, if you don't do something soon, it might let on to how awkward you are, and he might come and introduce you to people you care nothing about. You'd better make your choice soon.</span></div></div>",

You defiantly, look the part, you might as well introduce yourself to the ladies in the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then quickly realize that other people aren't wearing shoes, and kick your heels into a pile with the others. Your ankles thank you, but you still find yourself instinctively walking on with the pressure on the front part of your feet. It still was uncomfortable, but it made you feel taller, and quieter. Hopefully you wouldn't draw attention to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get closer to the ladies, you see try and see all of them in a small group. One of the taller ones is leaning against the counter, and speaking as the others listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly make your way around them, and try and listen to what is going on.<br>\r\n\"And then I said Mrs. Choo, I love your company, but your no Jimmy.\" says the alpha queen.<br>\r\nThe other ladies quickly give a polite laugh. Only one seems to genuine laugh at the joke.<br>\r\nThere are a few more stories that are told, and in a second, you realize that they're talking about fashion. They just keep referring to the clothes by the designer brands, and most the stuff goes over your head. You realize that this is how most women must feel at comic book movies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of the ladies tilts her head towards you and the alpha looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Why hello, why don't you join us.\" she says, beckoning you into the circle. \"I'm Ann.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm...Clair.\" you say nervously. A few of the women have stone faces as they look you over. You feel more eyes examining you now than when you were surrounded by men.<br>\r\n\"So Clair, who are you here with?\" Ann asks handing you a glass of clear liquid.<br>\r\n\"I'm here by myself.\" you say meekly.<br>\r\nThe women seem to murmur a bit.<br>\r\n\"I love your hair. How do you get it that way?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Thanks. It just happens.\" you reply. You self preservation instinct is telling you to give short answers and clam up.<br>\r\n\"And she's modest. How do you like that girls?\" Ann says to the other ladies in more of a rowdy tone.<br>\r\nThe women let out a polite laugh.<br>\r\n\"Clair, you must tell me where you got this bracelet.\" she says holding up your wrist and examining the jewelry on it.<br>\r\nYour eyes widen with surprise, you don't recall seeing this in the car. The curse must altering itself again.<br>\r\n\"Oh, it was a gift, from my mother.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nAnn lets go of your wrist. She seems to have more good sense to roast you for that.<br>\r\n\"So tell me, if you're not here with anyone, why are you here?\" Ann says, determined to keep you in the center of attention.<br>\r\n\"I was invited.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Invited? That's rare.\" she chuckles.<br>\r\n\"I worked on the Denver project.\" you tell her, taking a sip from the glass in case she tries to ask you more things. \"Holy crap, it's vodka.\" your tongues memory shouts. You can't really taste anything, but it's clearly not water.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know, you're that little harlot Jerry has working for him.\" she replies.<br>\r\nYou keep sipping the glass.<br>\r\n\"Well, we all do what we need to to get ahead.\" the woman says.<br>\r\n\"Sure. I guess.\" you say, slowly stepping away.<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you got it flaunt it.\" Ann says fondling your breasts.<br>\r\n\"She's had a bit too much to drink.\" you tell the others, excusing her behavior.<br>\r\nThe others laugh, and you notice the wedding ring on her finger.<br>\r\nShe leans right into your face as she pasts your belly.<br>\r\n\"Enjoy it while it lasts. The second you get a kid, you're stuck in whatever position you have.\" she whispers.<br>\r\n\"Weren't women supposed to be supportive of each other?\" you think, realizing that they probably see you as a threat, like Beth did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnn turns over to the other drunk ladies and ignores you. You slowly make your way through another room. Where there is a picture of her next to Big Mike. He didn't look so big then, and she looked so much younger.<br>\r\n\"That explains it.\" your mind says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk past a mirror, and even though the room is dimly lit, there is a giant mirror where you catch your refection. You hair is flowing and has some fancy locks fall down around your shoulders. The dress has a slit going right up to your waist, showing off part of your ass cheek. One of the shoulder straps is designed to keep falling down, and whoever did your make up looks like they spent an hour on it. Your petite mouth opens with a bit of shock, knowing that it's you in the mirror. You are overdressed for this. Your eyes keep blinking. Why has no girl ever dressed this way for you? You're clearly out to impress someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the initial reaction, your mind starts to race, wondering how much farther the curse will go tonight. Will you relapse into losing control like you did yesterday or this morning? The fear starts to rise. Maybe you did make a mistake coming here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in your purse for the phone to call Joey. You're not sure if you need to call him or not, but you just need to look at the phone. \"The battery is dead, great.\" your mind yells after trying to turn it on. If the lights suddenly go out, you'll be convinced you're in a horror movie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, you realize that you didn't think this through enough. You didn't have a solid plan for Joey to get you home.</span></div></div>",

Your hair has become blond once again. You were so focused on the phone and your ride, you didn't notice him walk up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Nick.\" you respond in cautious surprise.<br>\r\nNick has obviously had a drink or who, it's given him even more confidence than usual, but also doesn't seem as energetic.<br>\r\n\"I missed you at work today.\" he says as he starts to sway his hips against yours.<br>\r\n\"I was sick.\" you tell him in a matter-of-fact manner.<br>\r\n\"Really? Because you look like a million bucks.\" he says turning you around to face him.<br>\r\n\"How did he do that?\" your mind asks, as your hips start swaying in unison with him.<br>\r\n\"So you're saying it took me all day to look this good?\" you ask him in a sly manner. Hoping he'll slip up, embarrass himself and leave.<br>\r\n\"No, I'm saying to look like you have a healthy glow. And as far as beauty goes, it may have taken other girls all day to dress up like you. But you, I'm sure it took an hour, tops.\"<br>\r\nHe starts slowly moving his feat from side to side, and you realize you're following his lead. Your heart starts to flutter a bit, and you realize how embarrassed you'll be if someone were to talk in on you right now. Your heart races and you feel excitement.<br>\r\nNick's hands start to tighten around your back, and you realize that you're almost slow dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick, what are you doing?\" you ask, stopping yourself.<br>\r\nNick slows down his sway for a bit to. There was no music. There was no real reason for dancing. You can see his eyes refuse to focus on yours as he thinks of an excuse.<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" Nick tries to say something, but can't.<br>\r\nThe swaying stops, and a small part of you misses the motion. He then leads you be the hand and sits you down in the chair.<br>\r\nYou can see it in his eyes, there is something in Nick's mind that he's struggling to let out.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" he finally tells you, breathing heavily as he does.<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what came over me. I swear, I'm not usually like this. I just saw you all alone, looking like---that, and felt compelled to make your night magical.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I have enough magic in my life.\" you want to say to him. But something stops you, you've never seen Nick like this, and you don't want to hurt him with a snide remark when he's letting out his feelings like this. You're not sure if that's the curses doing, or you just trying to be a good human being.<br>\r\n\"Clair, ever since I first saw you, I thought that you were the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen. The first day in the office with you, I thought you were one of the best business women I've ever seen.\" he says. It's taking a lot out of him to admit this.<br>\r\nYour heart is beating hard. This is the first time in forever someone you respect is saying you're good at business.<br>\r\nNick is there biting his lip, trying desperately in his head to think if he should say what's coming next. You can feel your folded hands on your lap, with one hand squeezing your other wrist in anticipation. It almost sounds like he's going to propose to you.<br>\r\n\"I don't know how to put this, but Clair, I look up to you. Not just as a woman, but a person. And I want to know how to be worthy of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, is he proposing?\" you mind races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou star at him, almost unblinking for a minute.<br>\r\n\"Nick, I...\" you say, as he puts his finger to your lips.<br>\r\n\"Please, Clair, just another minute. That way, even if whatever comes next is a disaster, we'll always have this moment.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was corny. But it kind of worked.\" your mind silently admits to itself. \"I am a male, and totally not gay.\" you mind starts to repeat over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later, Nick pulls his finger away from your mouth. \"Okay, now you can talk now.\" he says.</span></div></div>",

Strange how so many life altering decisions happen in such a low key situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope I'm not late.\" Nick says as he exits the house with his bathing suit. You're ashamed to notice it, but Nick's abs show he's been working out lately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all, come on in, and sit with us.\" Mike says.<br>\r\nDespite your earlier encounter, Nick seems to think it's appropriate to sit between you and Kevin. Squeezing you between him and Big Mike.<br>\r\nThis makes the tub seem very crowded all of a sudden, since it's only designed for four people, and Big Mike is taking up the space of at least two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to feel squished between Mike's fat squishy skin on one side, and Nick's rock hard skin on the other.<br>\r\n\"Hey Clair.\" he says, pretending nothing happened between you earlier tonight.<br>\r\n\"Hi, Nick.\" you say very quietly, avoiding eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation continues between the men, and all of a sudden you feel forgotten as they talk about mergers and market speculation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you get a chance to contemplate your situation, Beth walks out of a house with a tasteful one piece suit on.<br>\r\n\"Hi guys.\" she says. \"Room for one more?\"<br>\r\nJerry looks at you, his eyes accusing you of telling her. With your eyes, you manage to convey that you've done no such thing.<br>\r\n\"We're a bit full.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, jump on in Missy.\" Mike says.<br>\r\n\"Are you sure? Jerry says.<br>\r\nBut everyone squeezes over more to allow Beth to sit in with them.<br>\r\n\"I didn't know you brought a bathing suit.\" you say with a phoney smile.<br>\r\n\"Oh, this is Ann's, she asked me to come out and join you. says Beth.<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel a jolt as your leg reflexes to something touching it. You look over and Nick is raising his eyebrows again. You look back at Beth again, who seems to smile in approval.<br>\r\n\"What did she tell him?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBig Mike looks at Beth and starts to question her a bit, but it seems clear Big Mike prefers to look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, Ann opens the door. \"Any room for one more?\" she says as she walks out in a bathing suit. She looks good for her age.<br>\r\n\"We're kinda full honey.\" Mike grunts.<br>\r\n\"Oh nonsense, I've seen you hold 16 supermodels in here.\" she says about to jump in.<br>\r\n\"I was 100 pounds lighter and they all weighted 60 each.\" Mike protests, but it's to no avail. Ann jumps in and water overflows from the top.<br>\r\nEveryone is squished.<br>\r\n\"I think I should leave.\" you say, offering to make more room.<br>\r\n\"No.\" say the men in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, just do what you did in the cab.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"What did she do in the cab?\" Beth asks in a patronizing manner.<br>\r\n\"She sat on Nick's lap to save us from paying another fare.\" Jerry replies.<br>\r\n\"What a team player.\" Beth says, splashing the water. Your eyes try and tell her to have mercy on you, but she won't.<br>\r\n\"Come on Clair, let's give these people their room.\" Nick says.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you contemplate your next move.<br>\r\nYou really don't want to humiliate yourself like this, but they might talk about something really important if you go.</span></div></div>",

And I hated every minute of it.\"<br>\r\n\"Because a vagina makes you feel sub-human?\"<br>\r\n\"Because I'm not a woman. I have a man's mind.

Your friend.\" you promise.<br>\r\n\"But guys don't just turn into girls like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.

I pissed of the wrong woman and this happened.\"<br>\r\n\"So, how does it work?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not 100% sure. Have you ever watched a werewolf movie?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I know about werewolves.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It kind of works like that. Except I don't change in the full moon, I change whenever a guy is in the area. And I always look like whatever he wants his perfect woman to look like. But I think women always see me as they first see me. Even if another guy alters me.\" you explain.<br>\r\n\"That's kind of messed up.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Yup. As near as I can tell, you've been seeing me, as Clair, as Nick's object of sexual desire.\"<br>\r\n\"So Nick likes blonds?\"<br>\r\nYou nod your head really quickly.<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I don't have full control either. Like when you're around, my body sees you as a threat or something, and I say a bunch of shit I never want to.\"<br>\r\n\"So, are you, fully operational, or is it just an illusion?\" she asks. Her rage has significantly dropped, and her curiosity is taking charge.<br>\r\n\"I haven't gone to the gynecologist yet or used a tampon, but near as I can tell, I've got all the plumbing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like being a woman?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou stop for a minute wondering how to answer her. You don't want to insult her, but you don't want her to think you like it either.<br>\r\n\"It, can be a pain.\" you finally let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you know what caused it?

She'll probably do something stupid if you don't calm down the situation.<br>\r\n\"What did you tell Nick?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she says, denial in her voice.<br>\r\n\"I mean, after you left the bathroom the first time, what did you tell him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"He told be about how you rejected him. I told him you talking to me while changing and told me it was the biggest mistake of your life.\"<br>\r\nThere is another awkward silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you say that?!\" you yell.<br>\r\n\"Because you hurt me, it seemed like vengeance.\" she says, here eyes avoiding yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath. That whole hot tub fiasco was set up by her. You feel like punching her. But will probably wait until the curse kicks in to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Nick know?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why haven't you told him about the curse?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get quiet again. It's a fair question, but you know Nick would hold it over you forever. And probably not believe you, and probably send Clair to some stacking position where he wouldn't need to see the crazy lady again. And you needed to ensure the Denver Project was properly pitched to keep your job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curse won't let me.\" you tell her. It's not the whole truth, but it's simpler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if you thought I liked the attention, why did you tell Nick I really liked him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I needed to see myself to confirm.\" she says in a low voice, almost sounding ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both sit wait around in the bathroom for a minute. Beth keeps looking at your junk partially falling out of the swimwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Beth. Do you mind leaving so I can change?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sure.\" she says, catching herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou door closes and you change into your regular clothes. You can't help but smile a bit. Beth isn't the best looker, and is a bit unstable.

I can see it in your body signals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't a girl girl dress up if she feels like it?\" you think of saying.<br>\r\n\"I didn't dress up for you.\" you end up telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what is going on? Are you doing this all for Will?\" Nick asks.<br>\r\nYou don't answer.<br>\r\n\"Oh god, you're doing it for that loser.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"I'm doing this for me.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Clair, William with chew you up and spit you out. He doesn't care about you or your future.\"<br>\r\n\"What is so bad about Will?\" you ask him. \"All I seem to hear is that he's not good enough for me. He lives fast, he's got a steady job. What's so bad about the man?\"<br>\r\n\"Will is my friend. I'm not going to spill what I know to anyone who asks. I just don't want to see you hurt he says as you start to move through the city.<br>\r\nYou see your face in the side mirror and feel disgusted about what most the creeps out a night seem to want in their women. Your reflection is telling. You're glad you don't have to walk around this part of town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's cool, I know I have no chance with you. But tell me something, was there anything we did together you enjoyed?\" Nick asks after a few minutes.<br>\r\nYour mind goes over all the moments that you were with him as Clair. \"No.\" you feel like saying, but you stop and think that that might destroy the guy. Just because you don't want him doesn't mean you have to be a bitch. It's becoming clear to him that Beth lied about how you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not a bad dancer.\" you finally say, and Nick seems to breathe easier. \"It might help if you picked an appropriate time to to dance though.\"<br>\r\n\"And that's the only thing, huh?\" he says, sounding a bit defeated.<br>\r\n\"You give good speeches.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That's my job.\"<br>\r\n\"And you're good at it. You just move way to fast for most girls. What works at the bar doesn't always work outside of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're around William's apartment. Do you want me to drop you off here?\" he asks after a few minutes of silence pass.<br>\r\n\"Here is fine.\" you tell him as he stops in front of your building.<br>\r\n\"Clair?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya?\"<br>\r\n\"I had fun.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the ride.\" you tell him, as you see he's trying to hide hoe much he's hurting.<br>\r\n\"No, problem.\" he says, looking away from you.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Nick?\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" he says, seeming almost afraid to look at you.<br>\r\n\"You'll figure it out one of these days.\" you say as you plant a small kiss on his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNick looks up at you in shock as you exit the passenger's door.<br>\r\n\"Bye.\" you wave.<br>\r\nNick reveals a huge smile and you can tell his confidence is restored.<br>\r\nYou walk up you your apartment and open the door before it hits you. You don't know if you meant to kiss him or not.</span></div></div>",

You never intended to kiss Nick. But you didn't feel force that made you kiss him yesterday. Was that you? Did you kiss him because you liked him, or didn't want to hurt him? You're pissed off at the party too. You collapsed in the hot tub. Your stupid weak body can't take the pressure that you can as a man. It's SO infuriating. The way those guys in the tub were looking at you, well, you're a man, you knew what they were thinking. The stupid curse doesn't just make you female, it makes you dress inappropriately for any situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of all of this, Beth found out the truth. Can you even go back to work now? You don't know if she'll help you keep your cover, or sabotage you. Although you are expecting the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn top of this, you can't even be yourself long enough to find a chick and nail her. All it takes is some guy seeing you, and he'll just hit on you non-stop. Even Joey is probably nailing some chick tonight, and getting that out of his system. Joey is getting more women than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just that, the entire freaking world seems to hate you as William. The crap they hint about you behind your back. No wonder you never get ahead, the rumor mill has a whole division dedicated to screwing you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that's not enough, every guy who sees you wants to bang you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck this.\" you say as you take a drink from the bottle, and turn on the television.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind isn't even processing what is on TV, it's replaying all the humiliating moments over in your head. All this came from slapping a chicks ass. It wasn't worth it. Your punishment didn't fit your crime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill you made the best of it. You saved the Denver Project, you kept Joey from getting kicked out of the apartment. You even got to rub elbows with the higher ups, and you did it in spite of the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take another giant swig of the beer and finish the bottle. You go back to get another and repeat the process until you're buzzed. It dulls your pain somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin nod off on the couch. You'll probably piss yourself before you wake up, but right now you don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many nights have ended like this?\" you ask yourself as someone on the television gets punched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the doorknob starts to turn, and you feel the curse take effect. Somehow, the alcohol makes it worse. Your female body can't process the liquor like the male body can. You've just gone from buzzed to tipsy. Something feels off about you, but you don't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey enters the apartment, and shuts the door.</span></div></div>",

You're tired enough that someone you didn't notice that Joey has managed to slip his arm around you and that you're leaning against him.<br>\r\n\"That actress looks so beautiful.\" you say without thinking.<br>\r\nJoey looks down at you, making eye contact.<br>\r\n\"Ya, she's totally beautiful.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second, you realize you are both gazing into each others eyes, and the outside world has all but stopped.<br>\r\nYou feel you should break the silence, but the minute you part your lips to speak, his are on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a wet slow kiss and you feel a bit of his tongue in your mouth. You still like kissing better as a dude, but your body is telling you that this is what it wants right now.<br>\r\nA second kiss happens and you realize that your eyes are closed for all of this one. When you open them, you're lying on your back and Joey is right over top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" you manage to say, licking your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a confession.\" Joey says while right on top of you, \"the date tonight didn't work, because I kept wishing the girl was you.\"<br>\r\nThat's simultaneously the nicest and creepiest thing anyone has ever said to you.<br>\r\n\"Joey, I...\" you try and say, but he puts his finger to your lips and you automatically shut up. \"Is that some sort of automatic reaction in women?\" your mind asks itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're afraid that in at any second will start thrusting himself into you, but what happens next is almost as bad, Joey starts the foreplay.<br>\r\nHis hands start to caress your curves as he slowly presses himself against you.<br>\r\n\"This is SO gay.\" you think yet your voice does not say it.<br>\r\nHis hands start to make his way up, and you feel your breasts start to become more sensitive to his touch.<br>\r\nThere is a moistness on you that you've never felt before. Your vaginal region feels like it's lubricating itself.<br>\r\n\"You're so gorgeous.\" you hear whispered in your ear, before you feel a nibble on it.<br>\r\nYou're frozen, although you're not sure if it's the curse or morbid curiosity about what's going to come next.<br>\r\nBefore you know it, you're in a hypnotic groove which causes you to grind against his body as both you and your clothes feel looser and looser, until you're both right against each other, mostly naked.<br>\r\n\"Joey.\" you say, although it's not please, or a question or a statement of pleasure. You just said he name.<br>\r\n\"I'll be gentle.\" he promises with a kiss.<br>\r\n\"Don't.\" you manage to say, you wanted to say something else to put the don't in context with the rest of a sentence, but even you have no clue what you meant by the word.<br>\r\nNext thing you know there is a thrust, followed by a feminine grunt. Withing seconds, a rhythm emerges and your hips gel together until both sides achieve climax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, did that just happen?\" you mind asks as you breath heavily.<br>\r\nYou're pretty sure Joey is saying something to you, but you feel too tired to listen. You're pretty sure you feel your lips move. Maybe they're saying something. Before long, sleep takes you.</span></div></div>",

You've slept on your side and your left arm is asleep. You feel a heavy pressure on you and see Joey laying face down beside you. There is a significant amount of dried drool coming from his mouth and ending up on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes again, hoping that this was all a misunderstanding and that what happened last night was just a nightmare. You look down, you're both next to naked. You're wearing frilly panties and he's wearing boxers. Joey's boxers are stained and his dick is slipped through a slot in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the life of you, you can't think of anyway that waking up in this position would be the result of innocent activities. You try and wriggle your way out, your head feeling a little hung over, but Joey's weight is too much for your feminine physique to push off of you without waking him. \"Joey, Joey.\" you say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggle again, and feel something wrong on your undergarments. Realizing you're stuck for a while, you cautiously lift them up, and peak under them. You see dried cum in the public hairs, sticking them together. \"At least he pulled out.\" you think. Realizing that Joey didn't have a condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it fully hits you. Joey made you his bitch last night. Your body was at the mercy of his advances. You feel like vomiting. That would wake him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey! Wake up!\" you say louder. Still not wanting to yell because of your hangover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact you can't push him off the couch makes this whole situation even worse. You're awake and have nothing to distract you from what you've done. You realize you didn't even feel pain last night. Your body's hymen was already broken. Joey's ideal woman wasn't a virgin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey starts to grunt some more beside you, and you see his dick twitching. You don't really want anymore of that stuff on you. With a sudden rush of strength, you shove him off and he rolls over, waking up as he hits the ground on his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeeze!\" Joey shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take this moment to run into the bathroom and vomit in the toilet. You don't even think about closing the door, and you're sure Joey is thinking of making morning sickness jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you finish emptying out your stomach, you shower for a good hour. No matter how hard you scrub, you feel unclean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next hour involves you throwing on a blouse and curling up in a fetal position on your bed, crying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a knock on your door.<br>\r\n\"Can I talk?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"GO AWAY!\" you yell. You're pissed, and scared, and probably a little hormonal.<br>\r\n\"I really think we should talk.\"<br>\r\n\"GO AWAY NOW!\" you yell even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could Joey do this to you? You trusted him. You were both drunk, but he knew the curse wasn't making you think right. That's the only reason this happened. What was his excuse? He should have known better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wrap yourself up in the blanket, covering your head under it. Things will never be the same between you now. He ruined it. He ruined a good friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank goodness there is no work today, you just want to lay down and die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no work today, it's Saturday, you've been stuck like this for almost a week now. That stupid witch at the bar ruined your life, all because you thought she had an attractive ass. You need to track her down tonight and beat the shit out of her. But that would involve you going to a club, looking like the hottest girl a guy could imagine. You shiver between tears, you don't want to do it. But you don't want to be stuck like this either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cry until it's hard to breathe. Then you take several big breaths and lay back down, falling back to sleep. Joey's search for the woman has come up empty. Going back to the same club to find her is the best way to undo this curse.</span></div></div>",

If I need food, you will bring me food. If I need anything, you will provide it. Is that understood?\" you continue.<br>\r\n\"Yes mam.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"Joey, despite appearances, a nice set of breasts and a uterus, I am a man, I don't want all this shit to happen to me. I hate having long hair, soft features, and strange guys staring at me. I am a man, and you will never forget that.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" Joey answer unenthusiastically.<br>\r\n\"Now, I'm going to go into my room, I am going to pick out some clothes for tonight, and to do this, I need you to go to the complete other side of the apartment, so I can be a physical male again, and put on the clothes faster.\"<br>\r\nJoey snickers a bit. The idea of you playing dress up is funny to him. \"Yes sir.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still mad at you.\" you say as you shut the door.<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" you think you hear Joey say under his breath.</span></div></div>",

You've got just over an hour before the clubs start to open, and you should probably get ready.<br>\r\nSighing you look at you closet. You're currently male, and most your clothes look respectable. You know that once the curse takes effect, everything in your room will look like props from a strip club. Rolling your eyes, you put on your nice pants and t-shirt. The type of club-wear that shows off your muscles. You flex in the mirror, you would totally look attractive to women if they saw you like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear Joey's bedroom door slam shut and the change instantly overcomes you once more. The mirror holds a woman in fishnet stockings with a skirt that rides a bit too low and a midriff that shows much to much for your liking.<br>\r\n\"Joey, I need you to go back in your room.\" you yell through the door.<br>\r\n\"Can't I watch?\" he yells back playfully.<br>\r\n\"You've already seen enough to scar me for life.\" you tell him.<br>\r\nJoey shuts the door and you see Will in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly change into another suit. You're wearing a sweater and pants that are too long for you.<br>\r\nYou hear Joey's door open again and again you see his dream girl looking right at your reflection. This time she's dressed even worse. The whore is wearing much too much make up, her skin giving off an oily look. The the fishnet stockings remain, but now you're wearing fishnet arm-covers too. The skirt is designed to go off balance, riding low in the front and high in the back. Your T-shirt is cut just below your boobs and your fingernails are such a dark red that they almost look black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey.\" you say in a eerily seductive voice. No matter how much you want too, you can't make it talk much louder. He can't hear you through the door. You open it and try again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey. Go to me bedroom.\" you say, peeking your head out of the door.<br>\r\n\"Go to your bedroom.\" you say again, desperately hoping he didn't catch the slip of the tongue.<br>\r\n\"Oh, Sure.\" Joey says, backing away. He doesn't take his eyes off of you until you finally shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the third try, you decide just to stick with the first outfit that you chose. At least with that you knew what you were getting.<br>\r\nYou put on your clubbing clothes and stand in front of the mirror, waiting for Joey to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finally does, you're confronted with an unwelcome surprise. Your clothes have changed in a way you did not expect. You legs are not covered at all and are perfectly shaven. You're skirt is much like the last one you had on, but it's shorter, and a bit frillier. The way is drops in the front makes it come down over your thong. Oh that's right, you're wearing a lacy red thong. It's behind practically disappearing up your crack. The bottom half of your ass cheeks are on display for anyone behind you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour torso is almost completely skin, the nipples barely covered by a shirt that is cut off just beneath them. The top of the shirt is cut off too, allowing maximum cleavage to show. You knees buckle towards each other in embarrassment. You're not even wearing a bra. As you examine your painted nails, your eyes cautiously look up to see what the face will reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou your horror, you see a woman whose lips are quivering in the pucker position. Her eyes looking half open.<br>\r\nShe looks like something out of a porn film. Barely recognizable from the girl you woke up as a week ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour brain tells you to stop trying on new clothes, or else they'll probably get worse. You're not sure how they could, but you feel they defiantly will. The stupid curse seems to know you're going clubbing and wants to get you as much attention as possible. You want to stay in, but realize that if you don't find the goth and get this undone tonight, in another week, you may be left as nothing but a naked nympho banging anything she sees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I have control of my actions.\" you think as you raise you hand to prove it you yourself. The hand is raised, but the wrist is limp, it's fingers stretched out to show the nails and rings on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I can talk okay.\" you try and say.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm okay at talking.\" your reflection giggles.<br>\r\n\"Okay, so I can say what I mean, it just comes out differently.\" you attempt to say.<br>\r\n\"I'm like, um, smart enough to think, you know, and talk what I mean.\" you reflection says as it twirls it's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this could go horribly wrong.\" you think.<br>\r\nYou reflection just gives you a come hither stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door.<br>\r\n\"Joey, I'm bored. When are we leaving for the club?\" you yell. You meant to tell him you were ready to go out and find the goth chick. This is how your body interpreted the mental command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looks at you, shuffles pants a bit, then looks down, trying hard to avoid eye contact with you. \"The clubs don't open for an hour.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Ah, but how can we have fun until then?\" you coo. \"Just be ready to go.\" you mind tries to say.<br>\r\n\"Uh, gee, I don't know, maybe, we can drive around the city and look for the goth chick.\" he squirms.<br>\r\nYou want to go into the room and clothes your door until the clubs open. But your body is not taking well to being ignored. It sways up to Joey until your breasts are right below his face. He's forced to look up to be polite and sees your face inches away from his.<br>\r\n\"You're so smart sometimes.\" you say with your index finger placed on the side of your lips, almost being engulfed by them as you speak.<br>\r\n\"Don't do this to me Will.\" Joey pleads.<br>\r\nThe sound of your name seems to snap you out of the spell a bit, and you don't seem to have more control, but you have stopped your advance for a moment.<br>\r\n\"Don't do what?\" your body asks innocently.<br>\r\n\"This. This seductive sweet talk act. Not after you chewed me out this morning.\"<br>\r\n\"You can chew me out later if you feel like it.\" you say with a wink. \"That's not at all what I meant!\" you mind screams.<br>\r\nJoey stops for a moment before his brain makes it a sexual innuendo. \"No. Come on.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"What, don't you think I'm pretty?\" and for a moment, you don't know if you feel worse for yourself for your body trying to give these signals, or for Joey, knowing what the consequence is if he accepts.<br>\r\n\"I think you need to go you your room.\" he tells you.<br>\r\n\"I will if you join me.\" you body says.<br>\r\n\"Will, go you your room.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"You will?!\" the body says excitedly, licking it's lips.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Joey says, as you both walk towards your bedroom door. But the second you pass the threshold, Joey shuts the door and quickly throws the couch in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe then sprints to his bed, and you become a man, gaining full control over your thoughts and movement.<br>\r\n\"This is going to be a long night.\" you say to yourself.</span></div></div>",

Bright lights flash as you try and cross the dance floor to get to the bar.

Realizing you'd rather show affection for Joey than deal with the drunk, you lean against Joey like you're a woman on a spy poster, and only feel incredibly dirty afterwards when you realize that your fingers where starting to slide into Joey's pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully it seems to work and the drunk goes to harass someone else.<br>\r\nYou both make your way towards the goth chick on the bar stool. She doesn't seem to have noticed you yet.<br>\r\nJoey doesn't make it, some lady has seen your display of affection for him, and drags him back onto the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost decide to get the goths attention by slapping her ass. Then you realize that might not be the wisest course of action into getting her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" you say, but she can't hear you over the music.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me!\" you yell tapping her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl turns around...</span></div></div>",

You see Joey come out of the men's bathroom. The bastard didn't even have to wait in line. A few seconds later, a woman he was dancing with quickly walks out. She's wiping her lips with her arm. And walks in the crowd for a minute before going into the back of the girls line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't be the only person to notice this.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the doors and see a familiar looking Goth walk up the starts and start to move her way across the dance floor.<br>\r\n\"It's her!\" you mind says.<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" Darrel says bringing you a glass of some pink drink.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you tell him and take a sip.

He's figuring out you don't want to spend time with him.<br>\r\n\"Darrel?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for everything.\" you say kissing him on the cheek.

You're not even sure if you're supposed to kiss him.<br>\r\n\"I...uh...\" Darrel starts to drool in shock.<br>\r\n\"Never stop being cute.\" you say with a wink as you walk towards the bar. You can feel his head turn as he's looking at your back. Probably eying your ass. You don't really care. Right now yo just want to confront the chick and make her cure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth is scanning the bar. She's keeping her distance from the other goth girl. Probably makes her feel less unique. She browses behind her several times. She doesn't even really seem to notice you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she's forgotten when you look like. Maybe you've changed so much in a week, she can't recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" you say.

You have two B-cup breasts, that slightly giggle as you sit up straight.<br>\r\n\"That bitch lied to me.\" you think as you stand up.<br>\r\nYou get out of bed, and see that you're just wearing a pair of panties. They're snug, but there's nothing fancy about them.<br>\r\nYou walk over too the mirror, and notice that something very different about the woman looking back at you. She doesn't look like Joey's ideal woman, she looks like your twin sister would have, if you ever had one that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look closer to the mirror, you realize that her hair is already put back into a large braid. You lean closer, and realize that you're already wearing make up. But it's a subtler style of the stuff, made to promote the more feminine qualities of your face, but just enough that it looks natural from a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou close your eyes and think of hot women. Your body seems to be getting jealous. You then experiment and think of hunky men. You respect that you find them attractive, but they don't turn you on, and you have no desire to be with one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the toilet, and sit down to be. You hoped you'd change back once you got the the toilet, but you don't. Looking at the counter, you notice that some of the objects have transformed like they did yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter wiping your ass, you go to your closet, and open it up. It is filled with all kinds of woman's fashions. There are pants, skirts, running shoes, heels, hats, bras, bikinis, nylons, and a ton of other clothing and accessories that you never want to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou toss on a shirt and button it up. Today is going to be a lazy day.<br>\r\nAs you leave your bedroom, you see Joey is already up and pouring himself some cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you're cured!\" he says.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking...\" you stop before you finish the sentence. That voice. That voice you just used belonged to William.<br>\r\nYou look down and see your in a dress shirt and boxers.<br>\r\n\"I'm Will!\" you tell him. Excited, as you feel the features on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run back into the bedroom to see if all the girlie clothes have disappeared.<br>\r\nTo your relief, they have.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it was a bad dream.\" you tell yourself. \"The illusions you see when you're not really asleep or awake.\"<br>\r\n\"What are you looking at?\" Joey says as he pokes his head in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm going to need some alone time.\" you tell him as you slam the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second it shuts, your room is once again reverted to how it looked when you awoke.<br>\r\n\"No.\" you say letting out a frustrated female voice as you look into the mirror.<br>\r\nThe woman stares back at you. She seems just as mad as you are about the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the closet full of clothing. \"What's going on?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go over to your underwear drawer, and pick out a lacy bra. You don't really want to wear it, but you can see the nipples poke through your buttoned shirt, and don't want to give men any more reason to stare at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take off the shirt and put on the bra, you decide to go back to the underwear drawer too see is there is a matching bottom to the piece. There isn't, but you do find a dildo hidden at the back of the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick it up as it slightly flops in your hand.<br>\r\n\"Why do I own this?!\" you ask yourself in disgust. You look at the bottom of it and see that there is a compartment for batteries. The word 'vibrating' on the compartment's cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put it back and swear to yourself that you'll never open that drawer again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go back to looking at the woman in the mirror. It's probably what you would have looked like if you were born a girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter picking out a comfortable outfit, you leave your bedroom again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Joey.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"What.\" he asks.<br>\r\nYou look down again, you're a man, in male clothing.<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to try something. Grabbing your running shoes, you exist the apartment and wander into the hall.<br>\r\nAs the door shuts behind you, you see your breasts instantly return. You look at your running shoes. They're a woman's style running shoes, but they're still made for exorcize, and don't require the balance that heels do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA woman from down the hall opens her door and walks by you.<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Morning.\" you reply, as she analyzes you with her stare. You can tell she's not sure what she thinks about the new woman she's just seen in her hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down a flight of stairs, when suddenly, Ben sees you.<br>\r\nYou freeze, hoping he won't try and hit on you.<br>\r\n\"Morning William.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Morning Ben.\" you say back to him.<br>\r\n\"I need your rent by tomorrow.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run up to your apartment, changing back into a woman the second Ben gets out of site.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Joey asks as you enter the room.<br>\r\nYou look down to see you're a man again.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" you tell Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter your room, and shut the door. Again, everything looks like it did when you woke up.<br>\r\nYou sit on the side of your bed trying to figure out what happened.<br>\r\nThen it hits you. The goth somehow inverted the curse.<br>\r\nA wide smile seems to go from ear to ear as you fall back on your mattress.<br>\r\nThe goth inverted the curse. Now you're only a man when you're around other men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you don't know what to think of this. You'll probably have to pee sitting down. Your sex life will probably get more difficult. But then you realize that no guy will ever hit on you again. You're not going to be seen as only some sex object, and you'll almost never be outside the view of a man when you're at the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mind starts to play with the possibilities. Weighing the benefits and consequences. This is defiantly preferable to the curse you had last week. For the most part, you can keep this condition secret, and you might even have some fun at the expense of girls you know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour smooth plump lips give out a calculating smile, there is some fun to be had.</span></div></div>",

Why don't you clean it up while the oven is on.\"<br>\r\nShe looks at you, and tries to be mad, but the look of disapproval soon vanishes from her face. \"Fine.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour later, your place is clean, and you're eating delicious cookies.<br>\r\n\"Joey's more useful like this.\" you think to yourself, and feel guilty for doing so.</span></div></div>",

A look that is equal parts intrigue and disgust comes across his face, as he takes a gulp.<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to speak to William.\"<br>\r\n\"Come on in, he's over there.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"Hi Ben, what do you want to talk about?\" you ask.<br>\r\nBen sits down on the couch next to you.<br>\r\n\"I'm concerned about the amount of guests you're having here.\" Ben says.<br>\r\n\"Guests?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Well, it looked like Clair was living here, from what the other renters told me.\" he says. \"That goes against the two person contract you signed.\"<br>\r\n\"I promise you, Clair isn't living here. We just had some late night study sessions.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm just telling you what the others are saying. If I start being lax on the rules for you, all the others will want exceptions too. Soon someone will want a cat, or a dog staying here, and then a domino effect destroys everything.\" Ben explains.<br>\r\n\"So where you against Clair staying here?\" you ask.<br>\r\nBen thinks about it for a second.<br>\r\n\"She wasn't seeing anyone, right?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"She told me she liked you.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"Tell her I liked her too.\" Ben says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes that overtook Joey are now starting to develop themselves in Ben. His hair is tucked back, and his face is now smoother. His brow and chin are no longer sticking out as far. Like Joey, Ben seems oblivious to the changes.<br>\r\n\"So if you weren't dating Clair, does that mean you're single?\" he asks.<br>\r\nBefore your eyes, you see his clothes rearranging themselves for form a one piece suit.<br>\r\n\"I'm not dating anyone now.\" you tell Ben. Her face looking much younger. She's somewhere around your age.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's too bad.\" she says, as her her fingers grace your arm.<br>\r\n\"So was that everything?\" you ask her.<br>\r\nAs she stands up, the whole transformation is complete. Her heels make her look taller than you, but her top is cut so low, it's impossible not to stare.<br>\r\n\"That's all for today.\" she says, slowly pulling her fingers off you.<br>\r\nYou direct her to the door, she almost trips on her heels, but catches you as she falls. She laughs it off.<br>\r\n\"Take care.\" you say as you get to the door.<br>\r\n\"Call me.\" she whispers in your ear. as she walks away.<br>\r\nYou shut the door, and look back at Joey.<br>\r\n\"She's such a slut.\" Joey says with an icy glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a cookie and begin to walk to your bedroom. From what you've been able to determine, this curse effects men in a certain range of you, and it takes about three to five minutes to take full effect. The victim than becomes the female version of themselves and has the hots for you. After the curse wears off, the victims mind creates its own memory of what happened. So far the sex drive appears to be random. Two questions in your mind are how would a crowd react to the transformation, and how do woman react to it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother question gnaws at your brain: How will this effect work tomorrow.</span></div></div>",

Your dreading having to try and keep him off you again.<br>\r\nAs you enter the office, you see the blinds on the glass are closed. No one can tell what's going on in here. Nick usually does this if it's very important, or if he's making out with someone. Since people see you walking into the office, they probably think this is a legitimate meeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit down.\" Nick says.<br>\r\n\"You cautiously sit down as Nick sits on the larger chair behind the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was talking to one of Big Mike's partners, Kevin. Have you had the pleasure of meeting Kevin?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"No.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Well, I met him, after the presentation.\" Nick lies. You know full well Kevin first met Nick in a hot-tub at Big Mike's place. Unfortunately, you're not in a position to call him on it.<br>\r\n\"Kevin is thinking of splitting from Big Mike and starting his own business.\" Nick says as his face again becomes smoother.<br>\r\n\"Okay, and you want us to help him get off the ground?\"<br>\r\n\"Something like that.\" he responds as his hair grows softer and longer.<br>\r\n\"So what does this require of us?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It requires...\" Nick pauses as he sees you staring. You can't help but take your eyes off his fully developed chest. The office blouse has it's buttons undone down to her stomach.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snap out of it, and see the that transformation is complete. Nick now looks to be a fully functioning woman, and one of the most beautiful that you've ever seen.<br>\r\n\"I...ya, totally. Tell me more about Kevin.\"<br>\r\nNick looks you over, and stands up, leaning over the desk. Her mostly exposed breasts jiggle as she does, and one nearly pops out. She silently walks around in her heels, showing off her incredible curves, and tight ass.<br>\r\nShe knows you like what you see, and she clearly likes her view as well.<br>\r\nA slight bite on her smaller lip shows the tension she senses.<br>\r\n\"About Kevin?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Will, let's cut the bullshit. You know full well I didn't call you down here to talk about Kevin.\" she says as she rests her ass on the desk right in front of you.<br>\r\n\"I don't understand.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nShe puts her hands on the ends of the arm rests of your chair, as she leans right over to you, her face inches away from yours. \"I want you.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"As a partner?\" you say, trying to be coy.<br>\r\n\"As an intimate partner.\"<br>\r\n\"I...I...\" you try and think of the politest way to say no.<br>\r\n\"Grow some balls and tell it to my tongue.\" she says as she throws herself on you.<br>\r\nThe chair tips over and you roll onto the floor. She's got the top position, and she's in no mood to waste it.<br>\r\n\"Mhhphmmm.\" you try and protest as she sticks her tongue down your throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of you just wants to go with it, she is gorgeous, and wants every inch of you.<br>\r\nAnother part of you realizes that just a few minutes ago, this was Nick, and this is all kinds of wrong. You don't want to take advantage of her like this, but at the same time, if positions were reversed, she probably wouldn't have any qualms about screwing you.</span></div></div>",

You see Nick whisper something in his ear, and seconds later, they disappear in the supply closet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later you hear a scream yelling \"WHAT THE FUCK!\" come through the door and reaching all the way to your ears. Greg throws open the office door and walks away, with all eyes on him. You look at the hairbrush Nick placed on the desk, it is now again a man's comb. A minute later, you notice Nick sheepishly leaving the supply closet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith everyone distracted, you figure now is a good a time as any to leave Nick's office. You want to get out before he returns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you head back to your cubical, you think to yourself that unless you can find the Goth and get her to undo this, events like this will become daily for you. Maybe you should get used to the attention, and just go with it. As disgusting as it is, it could make your life much easier. But your mind can't get over the fact that these women are male whenever you're not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sit down in your cubical, you wonder if the main reason you didn't take Nick's offer was because you'd feel bad about Joey.<br>\r\n\"That's a terrifyingly stupid idea.\" you think to yourself.</span></div></div>",

You knew she liked you for a while, and now she's throwing herself at you. If you don't take this opportunity, than what was the point of getting your manhood back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" you tell her. \"But let's be subtle about it. I'll go there first, and you come in two minutes later.\"<br>\r\nShe agrees, and you start your long walk to the storage closet, trying to be seen by as few people as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slip in the door, and find the floor a mess from when Nick was in here with Greg. You pick up the papers and pile them on one of the shelves. You don't want to slip of them and hurt your back falling against something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish, Beth comes in and locks the door from the inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\" she says.<br>\r\n\"So...\" you respond.<br>\r\n\"Did you learn anything about what turns a woman on last week?\" she whispers.<br>\r\nYou stay silent, refusing to answer.<br>\r\n\"Show me.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou put one hand behind her waist and pull the hair away from her face with the other.<br>\r\n\"Beth, I can't help myself.\" you say, playacting. With your lips locked, you begin to sway your hips, and hers follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you're the man in this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the kiss ends, she looks into your eyes. \"That was good. Now it's my turn.\" she tells you.<br>\r\nAs she closes her eyes again, yours open wide. Beth is now the same size as you.<br>\r\n\"Oh no!\" you think as your mind starts to panic. You quickly feel a bulge out of Beth's pants that's pushing yours back.<br>\r\nYou pull away from the kiss to see that Beth is now taller than you. Her chin is more defined, and eyebrows thicker.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she says in a deeper voice.<br>\r\n\"It can't get much worse than this.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Beth, I don't know if I...\"<br>\r\n\"Quick your bitching and kiss me.\" she says, as she pulls you into her surprisingly strong embrace.<br>\r\nAs the kiss ends, Beth is staring down at you, completely male. You're breathing heavily not knowing what to do. She's blocking the exit.<br>\r\n\"Beth, I'm not gay.\" you tell her, and then stop at the sound of your own voice.<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" you think. It's a woman's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to see a an unbuttoned work blouse, with perky breasts being held by a push up bra. Your skirt has already been hiked up, and your hair let down. The faint taste of cherry on your lips hint that you're wearing some sort of make up on them. Your legs are already spread, and your body is making it clear that even if you're not the seductress in this situation, you're clearly a willing partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you're not gay.\" Beth says. \"It's why I asked you here.\"</span></div></div>",

Even his biceps begin to inflate, and now look like they've been worked on everyday for the past year.<br>\r\nYou hate the fact you notice it, but Greg's pants are starting to get tighter, as his junk clearly increased in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as a man, you'd have to admit that Greg's transformation made him attractive, but as a woman, you can feel yourself blushing, and your heart flutter, as it just reacts the man of Olympian stature before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I am, fine.\" you manage to stutter in response to him.<br>\r\n\"Well, good.\" Greg says as he flexes his chest muscles. Like everyone else today, he seems unaware of the change.<br>\r\nYour legs are pushed together, and your eyes are looking at the ground. You try your best not to look at Greg, you're afraid you can't help yourself around him. Greg seems to catch on to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I know we're not supposed to, but I am thinking of ditching this place for a few minutes. I can give you a personal demonstration of my market abilities, in my car.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hear skips a beat as he finishes. Partly shocked that he is being so forward, partly out of fear about what you might say, and partly out of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you whisper without thinking.<br>\r\nGreg gives to a sly smile. \"Oh god, he has perfect white teeth.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"I'll meet you on the garage floor in three minutes.\" he says as he walks towards the elevator.<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you whisper under your breath as you return to looking at the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second after Greg disappears, you find your legs are walking you towards the escalator. You look back to make sure no one else is around. \"Good.\" you think as you see the place as being empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the button and wait for the elevator to come.</span></div></div>",

The guys around me all turn into beautiful women that want to sleep with me. It was more than a little awkward, so I thought I'd hang around you. Turns out that the curse turns women into straight men who want to sleep with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me I turned into a man?\" she asks, in a tone that's both disbelieving and curious.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you say in a deadpan manner.<br>\r\n\"And I don't remember any of it.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Then why am I not turning right now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Probably because we're both women right now.\" you say. \"Either that or the change is happening so gradually, neither of us are noticing it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth feels her long hair and looks at her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why have I turned back and you haven't?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Because you had some time away from me. I haven't had a chance to be alone for the curse to change me back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did we do it?\" Beth asks, in a manner that isn't as playful as a question like that should be.<br>\r\n\"No. I got too weirded out.\"<br>\r\n\"So what happens to guys when they see you like this?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"They become more masculine looking, and super attractive.\" you admit, hanging your head in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth lets a smile crack. She's concerned for you, but she also seems to find some entertainment in your discomfort.<br>\r\n\"If I was in your position, I'd wait until I turned male, then screw every hot guy turned chick I could find. Think about it, no matter what, after that, I would always have that over them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's a good thing you're not in my position.\" you snap back at her, a bit frustrated at her. Maybe its the hormones that are causing this outburst, but she seems to be taking your situation WAY too lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elevator door opens, and Beth gets off.<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\" you hear her say under her breath. She's definitely acting more aggressive than usual today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts again, and you hit the emergency stop button on the elevator before any other guy comes on. In a moment, you feel yourself shift back to normal. The entire elevator seems to shrink as you grow a bit bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far this day feels like it has been a disaster, you're tempted to go to the parking garage, and just head home. But you're already here, and its not like the curse is going to get better anywhere else. Maybe you should just go back to your cubical and shoo everyone away.</span></div></div>",

You can call up important contacts and do business that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head back to your cubicle, at this point Greg should have reverted back to normal, and is probably wondering why he is in his car alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of your co-workers say 'hi' to you, because they haven't seen you in a week, but you don't stop and talk, you just respond back to the with the same greeting, and keep on walking. Talking to anyone more than a minute risks them being effected by your curse. They're probably thinking that you're being rude, but you know its for their own good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next two hours are slow, as most people you call are not picking up their phones. And between the ringings you hear on the other end of the line, your mind begins to think of ways out of this situation. The curse seems to be keeping people's personalities intact, it's just altering them to have uncontrollable lust for you, and their bodies are responding accordingly. Accept Beth, she acted much more aggressive than she usually does, but that's probably because of the extra testosterone. And Joey, Joey isn't all over you like the others were, and you're not sure why.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour options at this point are to find the witch that did this to you, do some research into this new curse yourself, or just live like this. Beth stuck the idea in your head that maybe you should jump on some people who treated you like shit in the past, but part of it still feels gay to you. You spent the majority of last week trying not to sleep with these people, and now they're still throwing themselves at you. The only difference is that you're the man this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's still wrong.\" you tell yourself as you hang up on another unanswered call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WILL.\" Jerry says as he places his hands on your shoulders. You jump a bit in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Will, I want to see you in my office immediately.\" Jerry says.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\" you say as you stand up and follow him. By the time he opens the door to his office, you already see his hair staring to grow, and wonder if anyone else notices it.</span></div></div>",

Still, with a bit of giggling and more than a little grinding herself on you, she did get presentable before the heads of the department got into the room. You took Jerry's seat noting a minor wet spot but still, it looked more imposing this way. You closed your eyes in preparation for this insane plan you would soon act on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of the leaders who could fire you on the spot filled your head. You strongly, resolutely pictured them as lovely and well-blessed women. You needed them to do as you told them so you pictured them in nothing but collars, kneeling before you with looks of devout and loving respect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had been lost in this mental image when you heard a soft movement next to you. Jerry had apparently gone down on her knees and was wearing one of the collars you had visualized but, oddly, still had her clothing on. It seemed the curse was still themed on what you found attractive. A lot could turn a man on in the moment, it was going to be interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a knock, the door opened to an older obese man. You couldn't remember the man's name for the life of you but that wouldn't matter in just a moment. \"Jerry, what is this...\" He trailed off as he saw you sitting there instead of Jerry. The two men behind him moved into the room. They had to all be at least over fifty, not a young soul in the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in sirs.\" You stood, pressing your hand to your stomach. You mind locked on the mental image you conjured. \"Jerry stepped out so I will be getting you started. Please, have a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't easy to tell so early but it did seem as if they looked slightly younger already. Perhaps the more drastic the change the more quickly the changes came. \"I wanted to talk to you about the company stocks. It is to my understanding that a large portion of the company is traded publically?\" The large man had to shift his clothing as they seemed ill-fitting and a size too large all of a sudden. The other two looked as if they needed a good trim of the hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Two percent at most, purchased with a pay deduction. This is really a job for HR.\" The portly man said, no longer really able to be considered obese. A smile crept on your face as his voice raised an octave mid-sentence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou waved a hand dismissively and that seemed to set them to unease. \"No, I will deal with you on this. How much do you three own when it comes to stocks for this company?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seemed smaller all of a sudden, their presence less commanding and more passive. The man who was once large was absolutely swimming in his clothing now as the others seemed to be picking and fidgeting with their clothing. \"Well?\" You said in a commanding tone. That got them to all collectively look down. \"About forty percent of the total stock maximum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only to see a giant masculine hand press to the door and keep it closed. \"My car has more room in the back seat.\" Oh shit, it was just like the drugs and the drunk. How did you keep ending up in such situations?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo hell with that, if there was some kind of curse transforming into you and others and unique ways you had to at least try. If women turned into insanely aggressive beacons of masculinity you had to at least try to turn the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" You turn on every masculine trait that made you you and dialed it up to one hundred. \"You got me out here because you said you would let me fuck your giant tits.\" The words even tasted bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth on the other hand was shocked more than anything. But there was a clear shift in the exchange. You were almost encouraged by this small shift to be as extreme and as outrageous as you could be. \"You even wore your submissive collar and you have your leather cuffs in the car? Why are you not wearing them now?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth took a step back, his bulging muscles seemed less defined. His beared looked like he just hadn't shaved in a day. He lost that confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you step forward you felt the taller, the soft female flesh not so soft. Even your heels changed to flats. \"You tease me woman, but I'll only play along so far. You came here because you couldn't stand not fucking me. No other man could do it for you. Your like a addict for me to dominate you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. uh.\" Beth looked like she was about to get away more out of fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached out and took hold of his shirt collar. There was a huge shift as your breasts gave way to your masculine form. Your feminine arm grew with your old muscles and your nails no longer painted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see Beth changes far more dramatically as he shrunk below her previous height. Her chest ballooned outward with pale pliant flesh. Thick dark hair gave way to waves of the well cared for hair of a woman. The shirt vanished to a collar as you held it. She wore no other clothing, as it set in what she came here to do. \"Sorry master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that's over...\" It felt like a tiny tilt of power back the other way, she was about to go back into aggressive mode. You moved forward and kissed Beth roughly, possessively. She grew even shorter and her breasts swelled against your chest. You, on the other hand grew larger and stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt became clear that with women it wasn't so much a standard transformation as it was a playing of roles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sub, get into the car and let's satisfy you.\" Just looking at her she oozed femininity with a clear, and not really healthy in your opinion, submission. she opened the car door and moved to take your hand but you reached behind her and cupped her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the balance of power shifted so much you had to be careful or risk hurting her on accident. All the while she begged for more.</span></div></div>",

She was an absolute well of feminine allure as she sat with her back to the window facing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was well submissive to you but due to the curse, she kept testing you.

You had been forced to reach over and take hold of the ring before it vanished. Her body and behavior swiftly returning as you did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally pulled up to her house she was looking at you as if she didn't want you to go. You firmly pointed not wanting to make the situation any worse. \"Head on in.\" Her defiance and not wanting to go saw her gain an inch on you so you took her breast firmly into your hand. \"Think about me, have some fun, or I'll give you back side a swatting to remember.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nearly pranced out of the car and into her house. Only to the mortification of one neighbor. You pulled out and started back to get your car, you would likely get Joey to help get her car back to her when you got a call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment you picked up you heard Beth. \"I am so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled as you looked in the rearview mirror to see you had mostly returned to normal. \"No, I am sorry I had to do that to you.\" There was a long pause on the phone before you heard her voice come on the line \"I offered first... and I kinda liked it... I was going to force myself on you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked for a second. \"You remember?\"</span></div></div>",

Once you had him fully undressed you removed your own clothing and stepped between his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of you wrapping around him, he was around you, you gave and he received. As you reached around to help his legs around you and to squeeze his ass it went from hard to adding layers of curves rather swiftly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grip on him became more sure by the moment as he lost mass and you gained it.

She didn't seem to mind your hand between her and her garments. In fact the more you touched her the more she seemed to approve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rocking good sex.\" Her voice had raised a bit. She wasn't a baby girl voice but you would have been hard pressed to confuse her for a man or even a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not turning into a man?\" You rested a hand on her ass to see if she reacted. She only arched her back a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noooooo?\" She seemed confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, so the only forget the change but remember what happens if they are altered but their own gender, outstanding. \"Sorry, I am going to have to be the hyper male if we are to keep you a woman and remembering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled a bit, \"Do what you gotta do.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decided to test just how far you could push the curse, a curse that really had turned into a troublesome blessing. \"She would be so much more attractive if she was a cat girl.\" You waited with more than just bated breath, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all you really weren't attracted to that particular fetish from Japan. But you were very clever, it would just take a little more careful consideration. You thought about just how delightfully masculine you felt when you were firm with her in the car and also at breakfast. You really had no attraction to the whole BDSM thing but you did feel more yourself in those moments. You weren't necessarily opposed to a little spanking but it really wasn't your thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made up your mind, you went to the bathroom and grabbed a towel before walking up behind Joey. You noticed that she had switched from normal news to something about romance before her hair went crimson. It was getting more and more interesting to see just how deep the changes went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up behind her you place the rolled up towel gently about the back of her neck and very lightly graze her shoulders with your nails giving her a gentle start of a back scratch. More importantly, in your mind you firmly fixate just how amazing would be if she was a very responsive woman. Just the concept of the intimacy in touching a woman who cares deeply for you already stirring something deep within you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a contented little groan only a woman can give when she knows she is about to get a massage. She more flumps forward than than leans to give you full access to her back. It was a pleasure to pleasure another after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean forward and whispered quietly into ear. \"Be my good girl and remove your shirt for me.\" You noticed only a minor hesitation before something shifted in her demeanor. She crossed her arms in front of her and pulled her shirt over her head as if she had done it all her life as a woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce her shirt was up over her head you noticed that the towel was gone and in its place was a small band around her neck like a choker. The dainty strip of cloth made her feminine presence far more powerful to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had watched more than enough dirty movies and had massages yourself to know where to start. However Joey provided far more guidance in how she responded to your touch. Working her lower back earned you contented sighs but your masculine touch on her shoulder blades earned you a chorus of little moans from her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you scratched and pressured her back her bra got in the way. Almost as if she was anticipating your will she reached back and unfastened her bra. Pulling it free and placing a pillow from the couch under her breasts as she leaned back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't jump you, she wasn't slathering you with kisses or trying to force yourself on you. This beautiful woman who Joey had become was contently exposing her bare back to you. She clearly felt secure in your presence and that made you feel more masculine than any erotic experience so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that expression you could see that choker thicken and grow wider. She reached back and took your hand, kissing the first knuckle. Before taking your thumb in her mouth, suckling it for just a moment, and then placing your hand back on her shoulder. Tiny mewling urging you to continue your diligent work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe act more erotic than really anything she could have done otherwise. Sex was great but this was something a magnitude above. An intimate gesture and a resubmission to what you had planned. A gentle offer, this was a soft strength of you ever saw it.</span></div></div>",

So you decided to try to put it to the test and see if there's any direct influence on the curse. Apparently the Curse still decided on what was attractive, but in this case it wad much more important on what was attractive to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs evidenced by the car breakfast, her choker, and that gentle sign if affection. It was clear that what had the most power here was a mixture between your dominance and pleasuring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slid your hands down her sides and cupped her breasts causing her to give you a nice slow sigh as if to say 'finally'. You pulled her back straight gently with a squeeze. You slowly let go of those fabulous orbs and crossed your arms in front of her as if to claim her as your own. This had an effect on you both as you felt more and more comfortable with her submission, and she seemed even more enthusiastic for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your chin on her shoulder so you could whisper in her. \"I find myself enjoying your soft skin so lovely and smooth.\" Her eyes closed but you could see small moles and discolorations fade from her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grinned as you continued to boost her up as you formed her. \"I love that you are short, we grow until we're perfect and you were made perfect early. You are clearly sure of yourself and your height does not make you any less a beautiful woman.\" Your arms around her become more sure, there wasn't a great change but she could be just barely above 5 foot now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was squirming to get closer to you, to lean into you. \"How your feminine hips roll as you walk, teasing me with your lovely backside. How many times have you asked me to spank you?\" There was a chuckle in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To many.\" She groaned out in sexual frustration. It was a total fabrication, you knew, but to her she was doing this as long as she knew you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yet my touch leaves trails of white hot passion in you. It would be torture.\" You ran a had across the bottom of her left breast forcing a involuntary gasp from her that she very quickly and very forcefully recovered from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your breasts. So large no man could ask for more. So firm women ask you how you do it. And yet you've came to thoughts of me just playing with your sensitive chest.\" From your angle you could clearly see them swell up to eclipse your hand. Not so large to look grossly unnatural but she was definitely a blessed woman. One would have to be blind to mistake her for a man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take her breasts in your hands and massage her roughly causing her to squirm up the couch to press her back to your chest. \"Give me the gift of dominance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can easily see the cloth choker around her neck form of V with a single thick ring pointing to her soft cleavage. She turned around and kissed you, her lips slightly thicker than you remember. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your emerald eyes, your perfect legs.\" You say between kisses as she wraps the legs of a gymnast around you. She mounts you fully in a softness you never knew yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine.\" You say as she crushes her chest into you. You fall but she remains atop you. She was clearly in control of the love making but she followed where you lead her as you took her.</span></div></div>",

Think of this as a peace offering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly wrapped in heaven as you are pulled from your dream. The dreaded day star wasn't out yet but there was something weighing you down. When you opened your eyes fully you saw a curtain of red hair moving about your hips. As you tried to sit up Joey reached out her hand and placed it on your chest, pressing you back down with that soft strength of a woman. Still half out of sleep you decided to lay back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waking wet dream of a woman was energetic but as she suckled you it caused your mind to wander. You only had a hand full of blowjobs in your lifetime, and though she was enthusiastic about it you wondered what it would feel like to be pleasured by a truly experienced woman. As soon as the thought left you could feel that little shift again. There was no visible change but you could tell that something had changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey paused a moment before she took you deep in her mouth as far as you could go. Apparently, she had more talent than first seen. As she slowly pulled back up her tongue was involved in what you could only describe as a wave that pulled on you. When she reached your tip her tongue went rounds around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe may have been going much slower but it sped you up. You placed your hands on her shoulders and alerted her that you are coming close. She only made a small sound of acknowledgment and repositioned herself over you causing her to draw her breasts over your thighs. Not a bit of you escaped her and she even apparently knew about aftercare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly after she was sure you had been well milked did she stand up. \"Right,\" She still had the same body from last night, and it was a sight to behold.  \"Now to see to breakfast.\" As she walked out her hips rolled in a way that took hold of your eyes. She was a vision worth having. </span></div></div>",

As you went out to the main living area Joey had apparently turned back into his male self. It was a minor disappointment but it did provide a bit of wiggle room with all that was going go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well?\" You asked trying to probe how much Joey remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. Heard you and that girl all night.\" Joey seemed to be lost as to what he was doing in the kitchen, settling on getting himself an early morning drink. \"Didn't see her leave, you toss her out the window or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled and shook your head, apparently Joey's memory was filling in the gaps with pure fabrication. You pulled out your cell and pretended to be checking Facebook as you turned in the camera. Joey's hair was already looking a little bushy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah man. What else do you remember about last night.\" Record...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey shrugged, \"Not a whole lot. Watched some TV and I must have nodded off at some point.\" Joey abandoned the idea of just getting a drink and pulled out a pair of plates and for glasses, along with a pan. He had lost an inch and seemed all around softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember you came out of your room for something.\" He started up the stove and had already pulled out the instant pancake mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's boxers, which had been the only clothing he had on pulled tight as his hips grew out and his ass rounded out. \"You came out and scratched my back\" his voice grew into an Alto mewl of pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see he dropped in height dramatically and as if the mass needed some place to go you caught sight of the side of a breast before a curtain if hair blocked your view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey made pancakes like she was a mistress of mastery in cooking. Before long she turned around and set them out for you both. Joey had returned to his baseline female form and that was still nothing to laugh at. More so as she only had on tight lace panties, large breasts open to distract you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,\" you said around your mouth full of pancakes. \"I think it's situational. You are my live in so you end up being a lovely, Loving, and loyal girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey beamed a smile at you. She was pretty but when she smiled it was breath taking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ben is the land lord so she becomes the supportive authority woman, the cashier became a quick and dirty fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sluts.\" Joey added in her jealousy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave her a shocked look, wanting to test something. \"You always say that but you keep bringing women here to have trios.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looked confused for a moment so you followed up. \"Just last week you told me how hot it is when another woman and I go down on you, or how we pleasure other women as a duo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a tiny shift and Joey suddenly gave you a playful look, \"they are still sluts, but isn't that what we need more of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed situation set the tone of the transformation and attraction finetuned it temporarily.</span></div></div>",

More like Josey... would return to a baseline form it provided a rather vital opportunity to really test things out. Once you put your dish from breakfast into the sink you step up behind Josey and wrap your arms around her. \"Heading to the Gym. Meet me there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could protest you picked up your bag and keys and got the hell out of there. That was important because you needed Josey to become Joey again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the gym was a short one as living in the city had its benefits. The gym was starting to fill with people, and that wasn't surprising as you had already managed to get to the store and back. Seeing as there was really no risk you took up a weight bench right in the middle of the whole damn gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a token effort as you came here for science more than iron. It barely took one set before the gym rats looked more like normal guys than the muscle-bound hulks they had. It was right about then that Joey finally showed up and you waved him over to spot you. You needed him engaged to see if the situation changed anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long before your second set and with your rather useful vantage point you could already see the ratty T-shirt that Joey came in with started to tighten around his torso. On the other side of the room, however, the beefcakes had fully turned into gym bunnies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery color, every nationality, every type of lovely lady one could picture and they all looked like they spent every hour of every day sculpting lovely flesh. It was right about then that your vision became obstructed. Josey had moved around and was now straddling you on the weight bench. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was easy enough to see that it was elementally Josey, the female Joey, but she looked absolutely fit. Her waist was slimmer and her hips tighter. Taught flesh settled in your lap as her hair was kept back in a severe ponytail and her clothing was tight enough to leave very little to the imagination. With her slight form refined her breasts, although they did shrink a small bit, had looked absolutely massive on her frame and had only refined their shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me another set,\" She said as she wiggled in your lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, having a beautiful woman in your lap ramped up your testosterone. Lifting was a bit easier and each time you finished a set she rewarded you the best way a hyper fit Josey could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore too long you had gone well beyond your normal limit. When you racked the weights on the bench you leaned up and took hold of her hips. Josey responded just as aggressively and crushed her chest into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA public place was no place for this, nor was it the time. \"I'll see you at home, be ready for me.\" No doubt Josey would be in not but her skin but Joey would likely have ordered pizza and would be watching TV. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosey wiggled before she got off you and picked up her bag, bending at the hip rather than the knee. Her hips rolling to give you a show as she left.</span></div></div>",

People you would never see again and likely never had to worry about after this little event. You sat there on the bench and thought about how much better they would look with a change, or how they should be acting. The harder you tried the less something happened. It seemed you did not have direct mental control of the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill open for a test you got up and walked over to a rather beefy looking woman who had been a beefcake that clearly juiced. \"You can barely lift that, keep going and you are going to strain yourself and do some real lasting damage.\" You picked up a pair of rubber covered ten pounders. She looked at you a little strangely but dropped the larger weights and picked up the smaller ones. After just a few reps you could clearly see her arms, far too large for a normal woman, deflate. In just a moment she went from 'she juices hard' to 'she must work out a lot'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked over to a tan-skinned woman with oil black hair on a leg machine. she stopped for a moment looking at you. \"Taking it easy today. You've done so much more you made it look easy.\" You pulled the pin on the weight stack and moved it down to all but the last weight. She struggled to even push them at first but after a moment it was clear that she could. With each push her legs, hips, and ass grew thicker. And with each push, it was far more easy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back at the first woman and she had gone hyper-feminine. She was getting her sweat on with the lite weights and was clearly going for the distance to tone her body rather than to bulk up. Her clothing had tightened up and had gone to a far more feminine purple color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to do something extreme, you walked right up to the mousy redhead and stood in front of her. She looked immediately intimidated before you wrapped an arm around her to firmly grip her ass. \"You're always so aggressive during workouts.\" That same confused look crossed her face.\" Taking advantage of the moment of confusion you kissed her. Almost immediately she started kissing back rather aggressively. As you suckled on her bottom lip you felt them plump up before she wrapped a leg around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat her back on the bench and pulled the zipper to her top down exposing her nearly flat chest. \"Why do you even do squats with weights. Massive breasts like yours have to be enough weight.\" You pressed her back a little bit and took her nipple into your mouth. She gripped your head as breast flesh swelled in your face. You slipped your hand past her waistband and into her as you had to fight to keep more and more breast flesh from overtaking you entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned back and looked at the other women. \"I barely have to touch you and you're off like a rocket.\" You twitched your fingers and she was squirming around your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gone from a mousy redhead to a bombshell porn star in workout clothing. The other women looked like they clearly wanted to join in. That was what you wanted to know, it wasn't just one person at a time. If you started doing things to affect the group it would still take effect. The confusion moment was the marker.</span></div></div>",

What do you want for breakfast?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n\"Just some cereal.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Easy enough.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pour him the cereal and hand him the bowl.<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\" you say, in a warmer tone than you meant to.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" he says, and you catch him looking at your breasts.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I'd like some milk too.\"<br>\r\n\"You'd better not have said that because you were staring at my tits.\" you murmur under your breath as you get up to get him a class of milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" said Joey, as you hand him the drink. The second he grabs it, you revert back to yourself again.<br>\r\n\"That was a neat trick.\" Joey says, as you look down and see you've returned to normal.<br>\r\n\"Well it's one I never want to do again.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and walk to the mirror.<br>\r\n\"What would happen if Joey made his own cereal?\" you ask the reflection.<br>\r\nYour reflection just stares back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the transformation overcomes you again.<br>\r\n\"What now you moan?\"<br>\r\n\"Go out and see.\" your reflection says as it morphs into the goth, and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\" you ask Joey.<br>\r\n\"I swear, I don't know.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"You must have done something, said something, watched something, thought something, or something.\" you yell.<br>\r\nJoey looks belittled by your outburst. \"I just thought this place could use a vacuum.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Than vacuum it your damn self.\" you yell as you walk back into your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour reflection laughs at you.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you snap.<br>\r\n\"You're adorable when you're mad.\" it says.<br>\r\n\"So are you going to tell me what's going on? Or do I just have to ignore you.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ponders for a second, but sees you're ready to leave, and sighs before speaking.<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd be happy, I tweaked the curse a bit.--- Long story short, whenever Joey needs a woman around, you get to fit that role.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"So Joey needs a woman to cook and clean for him.\" you say in a disgruntled manner.<br>\r\n\"And other things, yes. But he never saw his dad do these chores, to him it's all woman's work.\" she coos.<br>\r\n\"And if I don't do the work?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Then you remain like this, until he no longer needs it to be done.\" she says with a laugh.<br>\r\nYour reflection than goes back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, when Joey needs a woman, I become one. But I still have complete control over my actions.\" you figure out.<br>\r\nYou then notice something new in the mirror. You're wearing a maid's outfit. You have no idea when that happened.<br>\r\n\"Okay, but if Joey cleans himself, I might be able to revert back anyways.\" you think.</span></div></div>",

With any luck, people will forget about Clair, before the week is through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're cured.\" says Beth is disbelief as she sees you.<br>\r\n\"In a manner, yes.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Do I want to know what you mean?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Honestly, no. But don't worry, it's nothing like what you saw last week.\"<br>\r\n\"But you look fine.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation devolves from there, as you brush off Beth's subtle displays of affection to focus on your work.<br>\r\n\"Wow, I don't think I've seen anyone working as hard as you are now.\" Jerry says as he passes your cubicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, a few of the guys are heading to the bar for lunch.\" Nick says, as another hour passes, and your lunch break approaches.<br>\r\n\"I'm in.\" you tell him, eager to be seen again, after your 'coincidental' absence during the Denver Project pitch.<br>\r\nStill pleased with the Denver Project, Jerry even offers to buy everyone's meal.<br>\r\nA cheer raises from your fellow coworkers as everyone digs in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmall conversations pop up that occasionally involve you, but for the most part, you just blend in with the scenery. A fact you use to your advantage as you sneak away towards the washroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome fat guy cuts you off as you walk towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Scuze me.\" he gruffs. The guy is at least 300 pounds and you fear what's going to come out of him. Wearing ripped jeans and a checkered shirt, he looks like a stereotypical trucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow him into the washroom, and take the urinal on the left, leaving one between you and him.<br>\r\nThe guy lets out a pleasureful groan as you hear the liquid hit the porcelain. You focus your concentration and release.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a stream of piss hit the floor, as something feels very, very wrong.<br>\r\nLooking down, you see that your hands are no longer holding down your underwear. That's because you're not wearing underwear. In fact, you're not wearing anything, but nail-polish, and possibly make up. You look farther down and notice that even that's not quite right, you're wearing open toed high heel sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out an instinctive gasp, as you see your exposed breasts. You're in the men's room, at a bar, next to a fat drunk guy. You regret opening you mouth the second it happens, as that gasp brings unwanted attention on you. The guy has now caught you in his peripherals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turns around, his face in shock, a steady stream of piss lands on your lower leg, although it quickly recedes as the man's member hardens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flee for the nearest stall and wait. \"What the hell is Joey doing?\" you think.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a penis sticks through a hole in the side of the metal barrier next to the toilet paper.<br>\r\n\"What kind of bar is this?\" you think disgusted.<br>\r\n\"Nothing's going to happen.\" you yell at the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, you've changed back into Will.<br>\r\n\"What the hell was that about?\" you think as you get back your table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the workday is uneventful as your productivity takes a dive. You're too worried that another incident like the one that happened at lunch of going to cause chaos in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everyone else leaves, you call it a day, and head back to your apartment, where Joey is watching television.<br>\r\n\"Hey man.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Hey Joey, what were you doing around lunch today?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, the usual.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"So you didn't want a woman to do anything.\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No, no chores, or anything like that. I did everything myself. Didn't even want your help. Why did something happen?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you could say that.\" you say as you walk into his bedroom.<br>\r\n\"Hey, what are you doing?!\" Joey says, worried that his privacy is being invaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see a waste basket next to his bed, full of crumpled up Kleenexes.<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't tell me this is what I think it is.\" you say looking at the basket.<br>\r\n\"Dude, get out of my room!\" he yells, and you can see a bit of blush on his face.<br>\r\n\"You masturbated at lunch!\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Like you never do it.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"Were you thinking of Clair, naked?\" you ask him.<br>\r\nJoey's face is the reddest you've ever seen it.<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit, did you...\" Joey can't even finish his sentence.<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, it only happened at the men's room at a sports bar.\" you say, ready to punch him.<br>\r\n\"Dude, I'm SO sorry.\"<br>\r\n\"You need to think of a naked woman to masturbate. Apparently you need an actual model for that.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"And the curse...\"<br>\r\n\"Yes. Apparently there is no limit on the distance for this to take effect.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"So I can't...\"<br>\r\n\"...Not until we find a cure.\" you interrupt him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave his room angry. What happened in the washroom has to be one of the most humiliating moments in your entire life, but at the same time, how could Joey know? Does the curse change you to try and fit all of Joey's male needs? You don't want to think about it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you lay in bed wondering what's going to happen. Will the curse effect you less if Joey has another girl to do all this stuff for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs midnight hits you are once again that naked woman. Joey probably thinks you're asleep. You almost decide to storm into Joey's room, but think that that might not be the wisest course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to find a real girl for Joey.\" your mind echoes. \"I mean, it wouldn't hurt.\"</span></div></div>",

Fearful of what you just did, that was a full on flirtation, but it sounded so witty in your head that you couldn't help yourself.<br>\r\n\"I'm Charles.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Clair.\"<br>\r\n\"Charmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes revolve around you talking about sports. Surprisingly enough, he's started making eye contact with you. Unfortunately, he's also made some unwanted foot contact with you as well. Your heart skips a beat, you're totally leading him on, and this body is reacting as much.<br>\r\n\"Hurry up Joey.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, although it feels more like an hour, you suddenly find yourself the same height as the guy.<br>\r\n\"What the fuck?!\" the guy says as he jumps back out of his seat.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the conversation.\" you say, as you quickly leave the area. The guy just stands there stunned. The girl he was just flirting with turned into you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meet Joey back at the car.<br>\r\n\"I got her phone number.\" he says triumphantly.<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"I think we're meeting again on Thursday.\" he tells you.<br>\r\n\"Joey that's great.\" you tell him.</span></div></div>",

In reality, you're going to look up similar spells to this one online and see if can find something similar to what you're experiencing. So far you've had no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Joey is about to leave, he calls Anne's phone to confirm the location that he's picking her up.<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anne. It's Joey. -- How are you doing? I just wanted to double check the location of...Yes?...No, this was scheduled for tonight. I had reservations and everything...your brother is in town for the evening? No, that's fine, it's family, I understand.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe phone conversation goes on a bit, as you overhear them trying to figure out a way around the scheduling conflict.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you invite one of your girlfriends?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"No, I won't mind, he can make it a double date.\" he continues.<br>\r\n\"Call me back in ten minutes.\" he says before hanging up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here brother is in town, she wants to spend time with him.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Well there is always tomorrow.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"She's meeting for a project tomorrow night.\"<br>\r\n\"There's always the future.\" you say as you turn off the TV and walk towards your bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, you hear the phone ring again. Joey is talking back and forth with a Anne on the other line.<br>\r\nYou're already on the computer looking up any vague bit of information to help you with this altered curse.<br>\r\n\"What if I get one of my friends?\" you hear Joey say.<br>\r\nYou feel a change, and look down, you're dressed to impress once more. You're in some sort of one piece dinner dress with a boob window. You look in the mirror to see the face of the woman you first woke up as over a week ago. Her face and hair is all made up, and a slit down the side of her dress is made to show more than a bit of leg. At least the heels are a manageable size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey opens your bedroom door.<br>\r\n\"I need you tonight.\" he says, eying you over twice. \"Oh good, you're ready.\"<br>\r\nYou feel like killing him. He knew this would be the result of the curse, he didn't even bother warning you or asking you. He just thought up a need for a woman to go with the girl's brother on a date, instead of postponing until a night they were both free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm sure she can totally make it.\" Joey says. \"I'll see you in a half hour.\"<br>\r\n\"You just set me up on a blind date, didn't you?\" you ask with a ferocity in your voice.<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine, it's a nice dinner.

There is no telling what the curse assumes Joey's need is, you could be stuck like this until he finally gets a date with Anne. Or maybe it's her brother he needs to find a date for. Either way, you don't want to sleep like this tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, you can't keep doing this.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"It's just this one time.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Ya right.\" you think to yourself. You know Joey too well, even if he's sincere at the moment, it doesn't mean he'll be sincere when his back is against the wall in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"We pick them up, go to a restaurant, chat for a bit at her apartment, and call it a night.\"<br>\r\nYou're not really sure if Joey thought this through, realistically, it'll end after dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" you tell him. Feeling pretty much defeated by this whole situation.<br>\r\n\"Dude, thank you. I'll make it up to you.\" he promises. It's an empty promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way to the car and drive down to Anne's apartment. She lives off campus. You and Joey are both quiet during the ride, you're still mad at him, and he's smart enough not to tease you with this. The radio is slowly turned up by the two of you to try and ease tension in the air. The only positive thing you can think of from the experience is that you're not changing with every driver that passes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey pulls the car over to the gutter of one of the back streets surrounding the apartment. \"Can you get into the back seat?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Can't I just come in?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"It'll probably be over quicker if you just wait in the car.\" he tells you.<br>\r\nHe's right, if they meet you in the car, it'll be less pointless chat, and you'll get to the restaurant faster.<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" you tell him, with more than a hint of anger and resentment in your voice.<br>\r\n\"It'll be over soon.\" he promises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next seven minutes are spent with you wiggling around uncomfortably in the back seat. You should have asked Joey to leave the radio on. You're about to leave the car unattended, when through the back window, you see Joey, Anne, and her brother walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly sit up straight, you don't want the guy opening the car and seeing your legs spread apart. It give off the completely wrong signal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Anne, Matt, this is Clair.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" you say to Anne as you wave to her.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" an says in an overly pleasant voice.<br>\r\n\"Clair, this is Anne, and her brother Matt.\" Joey tells you.<br>\r\n\"Pleasure to meet you.\" Matt says as he sits down and reaches his hand over to shake yours.<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you too Matt.\" you tell him, giving him a firm handshake. Matt reacts oddly to it. \"The hand should have been more limp.\" you think to yourself. Matt seems to take the strong squeeze as a sign of enthusiasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne and Joey sit down in the front seats, and you all buckle up as you drive towards the restaurant.<br>\r\nJoey, and Anne, start to chat about something up front. You and Matt just look awkwardly at each other.<br>\r\n\"You look pretty, Clair.\" Matt says, trying to start a conversation.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you tell Matt. Your heart is racing more than you want it too. You're taking this as a legitimate compliment.<br>\r\n\"So Clair, how do you know Joey?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"We've been friends since forever.\" You plan to make the answers short and to the point.<br>\r\n\"So he's like a brother to you.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, exactly like that. Like my little brother.\" you say to Matt.<br>\r\n\"Anne is my little sister. I told her to have a date without me, but she didn't want me to be alone tonight. I haven't seen her since forever.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, what do you do?\"<br>\r\n\"Military service, just came back from overseas. Thought I'd see my family again.\"<br>\r\n\"Now you're making me feel guilty for being here tonight.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh please don't. It's my pleasure to be in your company.\" he says. You let out a smile and roll your eyes. Unlike a lot of other guys, Matt isn't all over you. But maybe that's because the curse makes you look like Joey's idea woman, not Matt's. Either way, it's a bit of a welcome relieve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe military service comment really got you to focus on Matt's muscles, he was clearly working his upper body strength to a degree you couldn't reach when you were a dude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your fears of this blind date, so far, Matt has been the perfect gentleman, you could totally see why most woman would choose Matt over someone like yourself as Will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon you arrive at the Italian Place Joey had reservations at.<br>\r\n\"You're late sir.\" says the waiter who greets you at the door.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, we had some unforeseen scheduling problems.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"You're over half an hour late. I regret to inform you that we just gave away your table.\" the waiter says in a snooty tone.<br>\r\n\"We got here as soon as we could.\" Joey tells him, trying to look strong in front of Anne.<br>\r\n\"Perhaps a table will open in the next half hour.\" the waiter says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey turns around and looks at you.<br>\r\n\"Sorry guys, we can go elsewhere to eat.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"It's okay, I can wait.\" Anne says as she grabs onto his arm.<br>\r\nJoey looks at Matt. \"I'm fine with doing whatever.\" Matt says.<br>\r\nEveryone than looks at you. \"What do you want to do Clair?\"</span></div></div>",

It's an attempt at flirtation, but she's not responding. To her this is pure girl talk.<br>\r\n\"Aw, thanks.\" she says with a giggle. \"How did you get your hair to go like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Conditioner, a truck load of conditioner and gel.\" you lie, and you both laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over at Matt and Joey, they seem to be hitting it off too.

The floor has a nice tile patter, there is a huge mirror across the wall, and the stalls are made out of wood, with carved patterns on the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnne lets out a fart. \"You wouldn't believe how long I've been holding that in.\" she tells you.

The last two times she saw you she toyed with you like you were nothing.<br>\r\n\"Maybe Joey knows more about magic.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"Joey when you looked up my curse, what did you find out about magic? you ask him.<br>\r\n\"Not much.\" he shrugs. \"Sorry, I wish I was more help.\"<br>\r\n\"So if I go, I'm at her mercy, but if I don't go, she might think I'm fine like this and leave me. Or get bored and not show there in the future. Or a hundred other things that might go wrong.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"What do we know about her? She cursed you twice, for all we know she's outright sadistic, and thought that this version of the curse would make your life harder, not easier.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe she has a moral center and will regret her actions.\" you suggest hopefully.<br>\r\n\"Maybe, it's your call man.\"</span></div></div>",

Funny enough, one of the first things she said to you was that you seemed familiar for some reason. You response was something along the lines of meeting her in another life. At least Joey thought it was witty. However, there are times when Joey thought watching Jello wobble was the height of entertainment. In other words, the bar was set pretty low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bar, you wait to see if you can spot the goth anywhere. Nothing.<br>\r\nYou manage to squeeze in a dance with one of the girls on the groove floor. It's great, you're the pole, she's the stripper. It feels so nice laying back and being the man in this situation. The young woman rubs herself against you, trying to impress.<br>\r\nYou even offer to buy her a drink. She refuses, but you got what you wanted out of the exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and keep your distance from Anne and Joey. You know that Joey can be a bit crude when he's around other guys he knows, and you don't want him disgusting Anne with inappropriate humor yet. An hour passes and you're on your third beer. The buzz just starting to come over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you see her. She is not wearing black, or make up, but it's clearly the goth chick that was the cause of all your problems in the past life. She walks by you, and doesn't notice you. Why should she notice you, she saw you as a man two weeks ago for a possible total of five minutes before turning you existence upside-down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a seat in an empty chair, on the far side of the bar. Some slob comes towards her, and sits down beside her. She nervously talks to him before he whispers something in her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, you hear a slap over the music, as the slob is holding a red cheek, and he gets up to leave.<br>\r\n\"That's it? That's all he gets?!\" you mind shouts.<br>\r\nThe slobs leaves, and the seat beside her opens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have to play this cool.\" you think, realizing you probably got one shot at her while her guard is down.</span></div></div>",

Thinking if she should reveal the information. Finally she decides to share.<br>\r\n\"Last Tuesday, I met this girl amber. We hit it off, I took her back to my apartment. She said she was into some kinky fetish sex thing, using chemicals, she takes some sort of stone out of her purse. The next thing you know, I'm laying on the bed, as she does some rain dance. The next minute, she asking me if I want her. If I want her breasts and body, I squeeze them, say yes, and and the next thing I know, my own body is holding me down.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm confused.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"My name is...was...Aaron. I'm a football player.<br>\r\n\"She switched bodies with you.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"She...she...\" Aaron starts breaking down crying and leans over to hid her face in your arm.<br>\r\n\"This explains what she was doing at the club the last two weeks.\" you think. Realizing that she was looking for a man to switch with. She probably just learned that skill. Or was really picky about who she wanted to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at Aaron, and embrace her.<br>\r\n\"I know you're feeling better than you think.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"You have NO IDEA.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"My curse was turning into the perfect looking woman for any guy who looked at me.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she says sobbing.<br>\r\n\"My newer curse is connected to one person.\"<br>\r\n\"But you're a guy now.\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, until the person decides he needs a woman for anything.\"<br>\r\n\"Why are you telling me this.\"<br>\r\n\"Because Aaron, I need you to cure me.\" you say, wiping a tear off her face.<br>\r\n\"I don't know magic.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Can you just think that you can cure me, or go back to Amber's apartment, and we can look through some books.\"<br>\r\n\"When I realized what just happened wasn't a dream, I broke into her...my apartment, it was empty.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaron, why are you here?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I found a note, saying I would meet someone here tonight, you would explain everything.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I hope that person isn't me.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait until closing time, Joey, Anne and the rest of the people have left. It's 2am, and you're both waiting for any sign that someone would recognize you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to come to my place?\" you ask her as the bar begins to close.<br>\r\n\"Not really.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I swear I won't touch you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"I honestly don't feel safe around any men right now.\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two will have to leave.\" the bartender says.<br>\r\nShe grabs her purse and starts heading towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Do you want to split a cab?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"I was going to walk home.\"<br>\r\n\"2am, in that body, in this part of town. You're taking a cab.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cab ride is awkward, you let her say her address first. You make a mental note of her location before the cab takes you to your building. You give Aaron your number, but she refuses to give you hers. She probably doesn't even know what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe, just maybe, the connection to the curse is still connected to her body, and she can cure you, you hope.</span></div></div>",

She never called you, she just vanished, like she never existed. With her gone, and Amber in a male body, you've lost faith in trying to get one of them to cure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately you're internet and library research have come up empty handed. Unlike the original curse, there is nothing about this one, and how you change based on the needs of one man. Your best guess is that it is the current curse is some sort of alteration of the Eye Candy Curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only saving grace is that Joey is seemingly getting better at controlling the transformations, you've only changed once at work, and managed to sneak out until you reverted. The situation isn't ideal, but it's workable, something the first week of life as Clair was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour only real changes come from when Joey needs your help cleaning. (Although you're beginning to suspect he just has a thing for women in maid uniforms.) Although you have no hard proof, you're convinced you transform when you're sleeping. It may just be paranoia, but you're dream distinctively take different turns halfway through the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight after a heavy night of drinking, you awake on your bed to find that your fears were confirmed. Two breasts push down against your chest as you seem to be dressed as some sort of cowgirl, or buckle bunny, or whatever they were called now. You stand up to see Clair dressed up as a hot rodeo gal, a lasso around her hip, light cut off jeans clinging her her thighs, and a t-shirt, which is tied around your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the bathroom, and sit on the toilet, which was the whole purpose of why you got up. Was Joey really thinking about this scenario this late at night, even after he promised you he wouldn't.<br>\r\nAfter wiping your ass, you pull up remains of the jeans, and in your boots, walk across to his room. Ready to rip him a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the door creaks open, you see that Joey is snoring on his bed.<br>\r\n\"He's dreaming about me.\" you mind realizes. He didn't break his promise, but you just realized how much more complicated this curse has become. You're a walking wet dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad.\" you realize. If you change every time Joey dreams of Clair, keeping the secrets of your transformation might become impossible. You're now at the mercy of Joey's sleep patterns. If he or you travel to another continent, your routine is screwed. If he's had a late night and passes out while your at a meeting, it's all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay back on your bed, you realize how hard it is to sleep with this clothes on, yet, no matter how hard you try, you can seem to take off any of the clothes, except the hat. They're stuck to you, as long as Joey dreams of you having them on. Thankfully, you can move them around a bit, as long as they're touching your skin in the appropriate areas, but it's still a small comfort.<br>\r\nThen slowly, one by one, all the clothes except the boots disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a sinking sensation in your heart as you realize what this means in Joey's dream. At least laying down on the mattress is more comfortable, however, the new found disgust you feel towards your body, and your best friend, stops you from being able to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours after the sun rises, you revert back into Will. \"I probably should have woken him.\" your tired mind realizes.</span></div></div>",

You've slowly got her up to speed on how the new curse worked and what triggered it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really saved your ass when Greg walked in to find you as a naked woman under your desk. It turned out that Joey had been sleeping, and well, the transformation happened. Greg just thought you were a prostitute Will was testing out for a party. Beth got him away from you, and kept the situation under wraps. Of course, Greg will occasionally ask you when you're holding your next party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look disappointed.\" you tell her, as she seems rather bored with her daily routine.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I'm just tired today.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"How are the other girls doing?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"The same, always the same.

She's got five years max, before he best-before-date expires.<br>\r\n\"If you were in my position, would you do it?\" she asks.<br>\r\nYou think about Beth's lack of children and social connections. She's got little responsibilities, but little connections too. Plus she has a tendency to rub people the wrong way. And you're pretty sure she suffers from penis envy.<br>\r\n\"I'd say no, but that's because I just don't want to lose you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" she says leaning over towards you. You know the body language, she's attracted to you. You don't show signs of interest back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you look over these findings, and get back to me in 15 minutes?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" she says, as the playfulness erodes from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the business day is even more unremarkable than your conversation with Beth.

It seems to be an post traumatic effect from your curse. Despite your best attempts, you can't help but think that there is a small probability that the girl has been cursed into liking you. You're now on a date with the forth girl you've met this month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That bitch ruined my life.\" you think, as a beautiful young woman flirts with you from across from the table.<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"You seem a million miles away.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry Janice, it's just been a tough day at work. We've had a few big decisions to make. Some people are getting laid off.\"<br>\r\n\"That blows.\" she says as she leans over, making her cleavage impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n'Ya, totally. Did I tell you how pretty you look tonight?\"<br>\r\n\"Twice.\"<br>\r\n\"Is that all?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't mind, you can tell me that all night.\"<br>\r\n\"All night, huh?\" you say as your eyebrow raises. She raises hers in turn and takes a sip from her drink.<br>\r\n\"So why don't you tell me about yourself?\" you say with a gulp as her foot touches yours under the table.<br>\r\n\"Me? Oh, there isn't much to tell. I'm just a girl looking to make her way in the world.\"<br>\r\n\"And you're looking for a man to make it with you.\" you say, half playfully, half jaded.<br>\r\n\"For tonight at least.\" she says as she snaps a bread stick in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours later, she's given you her whole life story, and despite your reluctance, you're having a good time. You can't remember the last time you went out and had this good of a time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, you drive up to her building.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for dinner.\" Janice says to you.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the fun evening.\" you say, as you unlock the car door to let her out.<br>\r\n\"The evening isn't over, yet; that is if you don't want it to be.\" she says biting her lip.<br>\r\n\"Holy shit, I might get to sleep with someone as a man again.\" your mind thinks.</span></div></div>",

Not even your local donation center would take them.<br>\r\nThe kitchen looks like it's trapped in the 1980's. In fact, the only decent looking area in the whole place seems to be her closet, which is overflowing with dresses and shoes that look like they haven't been worn more than once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least it's clean.\" you think, and feel guilty for doing so. This girl probably didn't plan on inviting you back to her apartment, tonight. She must have felt something click, and was showing a side of herself that (hopefully) very few people got to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't look much like a woman's place, the colors are too cool, and there is nothing frilly in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have a roommate?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"One bedroom apartment.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I hope that's a no.\" you respond in a dickish manner.<br>\r\n\"You can be my roommate tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heads towards the bedroom.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to change into something more comfortable. Make yourself at home on my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly strip off your clothes as you lie back on the bed and look up at the ceiling. \"Tonight will be amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, Janice comes to the door, dressed in a pink translucent nightgown. You can totally kind-of see her nipples.<br>\r\n\"I hope you're ready for a good time.\" she says as she licks her index finger.<br>\r\n\"Oh baby.\" you say.<br>\r\nJanice gets on the bed and starts to crawl on you. She's eager to do most of the work, but you're wondering how much dominance you should show. You don't want to insult her, but being on top is preferable.<br>\r\n\"So tell me just how powerful to are.\" she whispers in your ear before tugging on it with her teeth.<br>\r\n\"As powerful as a pretty thing like you needs me to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foreplay lasts for a few minutes until the grinding starts. She starts moaning prematurely and it throws you off for a second. You're not THAT good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been so long since someone made me feel like this!\" she shouts. You're leaning right on top of her. Her eyes clothes and so do yours. In your head her imperfections disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFifteen minutes later, you role over, exhausted and spent. \"I'm out of practice.\" you think.<br>\r\n\"You've got more than that.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Janice...\"<br>\r\n\"It was a factual statement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe roles on top of you and slithers towards you legs.<br>\r\n\"Janice...\"<br>\r\n\"Relax and shut up. I want too.\" she says as she starts to massage the area between your legs.<br>\r\nYour member starts twitching again, you're not as spent as you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice leans down, taking her plump pink red towards you.<br>\r\nSeconds before making contact, the pressure you felt ready to explode is replaced by a warm moistness.<br>\r\nJanice lets out a quick scream and tumbles backwards off the bed.<br>\r\n\"WHAT THE FUCK!\" she says, almost in shock.<br>\r\nYou look down and see Clair's naked body, which you're stuck in.<br>\r\n\"I can explain!\" you tell her.<br>\r\nJanice stumbled backwards to the door.<br>\r\n\"How can you explain this?!\" she yells, breathing heavily.<br>\r\nYou sit up, your exposed breasts jiggling a bit as you do.<br>\r\n\"It's a condition.\" you say softly.<br>\r\n\"A condition?\" comes her skeptical response.<br>\r\n\"It's a curse, and before you ask, it's not contagious.\"<br>\r\n\"So you pissed on a voodoo Aztec's graveyard or something?\"<br>\r\n\"Something like that. I got drunk and slapped a girl in the ass once.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"So she thought making you a girl would be a curse. You think being a girl is a curse.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Being this one is. In my condition. Ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanice shuts the door behind her and walks to the closet. \"Put this on.\" she says as she tosses you her pajamas.<br>\r\nThey feel great on your skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know they'll probably rip when I change back.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"I plan on burning them after you leave.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how often does the 'curse' take effect?\"<br>\r\n\"As often as a person I'm connected to needs a woman.\"<br>\r\nShe looks at you piecing together the situation in her head. \"And you turn back...\"<br>\r\n\"When his need is satisfied.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nHer eyes open cartoonishly wide.<br>\r\n\"I don't have to be the woman that satisfies him, hell, he can satisfy himself.\" you explain.<br>\r\nHer eyes still remain wide open.<br>\r\n\"I should have worded that better.\" you admit.<br>\r\n\"And you're okay with this?\" she says in disbelief.<br>\r\n\"Well, it's happening less frequently, This is the first time in over a week I've changed. But I can't find a cure.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"I have so many questions.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"I wish I could answer them all.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver the next hour, you do your best to explain to her what's going on, and answer all of her questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So knowing all that, are you willing to go on another date with me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Ask me next week.\" she says as you grab your clothes off the floor, and head into the hallway.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for the evening.\" you tell her, and shut the door before she can respond. It's better if you leave her alone to figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to your car in your date's pajamas was defiantly one of the weirder moments in your life.<br>\r\n\"I think she likes me.\" you realize.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the seasons pass, you and Joey are driving up to the mountains for his last big vacation as a unmarried man. A nice ski lodge, where his brother and other best men will meet you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snow is falling thicker than you thought it would be as you drive. It's pretty empty this late afternoon, so full attention doesn't really have to be paid to the road, as you talk to Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is your sister coming?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"No, she's staying over with my parents for some reason. How's Janice?\"<br>\r\n\"Janice, is Janice, she's getting more energetic recently.\"<br>\r\n\"And she knows about your condition, right?\"<br>\r\n\"I think she's cool with it. In fact, she's bought a strap on in case she's already riled up when it happens. So PLEASE, PLEASE, call me to warm me if something is going to happen.\"<br>\r\n\"Is the strap on for you or her?\" he asks.<br>\r\nThen it hits you, you just assumed she'd use it on you, you never thought that it was for you to use on her. Strange how your mind always goes to you being on the receiving end of things as a woman. There's probably more than a little sexism in your ideas about what you're expected to do as a woman.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" you say in a dumbfounded manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence in the car as the wipers brush off the onslaught of snow.<br>\r\nJoey doesn't want to distract you as the snow gets this thick.<br>\r\n\"At this rate, it should only take us two more hours.\" you tell him.<br>\r\nYou pass a truck which is now stuck in a ditch full of snow.<br>\r\n\"Should we help him?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Nothing we can do. Look, he has a cellphone. He's calling for some pick up truck now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive on to see a number of people trapped at the side of the road. There must be black ice. You slow down. Your car isn't designed for this type of weather. \"See if they need help.\" you tell Joey, as he looks out the door.<br>\r\n\"There is a woman hanging up her phone in disgust.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly pull the car to the side of the road, and Joey gets out. You both immediately regret opening the door. An ice wind blasts Joey as he walks down to the woman's door. For a minute the snow is so thick that you can't even see him. You just hope no one swerves and hits you.<br>\r\n\"Her cell phone is dead.\" Joey says as he gets back.<br>\r\nYou open your phone and see if you can get any coverage. \"Either the snow is too thick, or we're out of range.\"<br>\r\n\"So, we can't help her?\"<br>\r\n\"Throw her a bag of snacks, and we'll call for help once we get out of this storm.\" you say.<br>\r\nJoey does, and you begin to drive in the snow once more.<br>\r\n\"She said thanks.\" Joey tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have your low beams on, but it's pointless, you can't see anything.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to pull over.\" you tell Joey.<br>\r\n\"Sure, it's cool. I'll just call the guys to let them know we're late.\" Joey says as he opens his cell phone.<br>\r\n\"Right.\" he tells to himself, remembering why the woman didn't call for help.<br>\r\n\"SHIT.\" you yell as you hit a patch of black ice.<br>\r\nYou try and swerve, but you're going a whole 360 before feeling a bump and drop in elevation.<br>\r\nThe car falls into a giant wall of snow, cushioning your fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike all the cars you had passed, you're now in the ditch at the side of the road.<br>\r\n\"Are you okay?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Are you?\" you ask him.<br>\r\nYou both give nods to show that you don't have whiplash.<br>\r\n\"Can we back out?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\nYou push the gas for fifty seconds. First in reverse, then forward.<br>\r\nYou turn off the engine.<br>\r\n\"I need to check something.\" you tell Joey. You open the door, and some snow falls through the side as you open it. You close it again.<br>\r\n\"The snow is above the exhaust.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"What's that mean?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"It means that if we turn the engine on to heat this, the fumes will probably kill us.\"<br>\r\n\"Can we dig our way out?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Not in this weather, we'd have to wait for the snow to die down a bit more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes, and the heat produced by the engine before your off-road detour has now dissipated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So cold.\" Joey says through all his winter clothes.<br>\r\nYou try your phone once every fifteen minutes. \"Still nothing.\"<br>\r\n\"Do we have a blanket, or extra coat in the back?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya, I brought a sleeping bag, pull down the back seat and get it from the trunk.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Why did you bring a sleeping bag?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"It was for your friend Pete, so that he didn't have to buy his own hotel room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gets the sleeping bag out and crawls inside it fully dressed.<br>\r\n\"Better you ask?\" as you can see your breath freeze in the air.<br>\r\n\"A bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start shaking in the car.<br>\r\n\"You can come in here too.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"I'm going to take my chances freezing to death.\" you tell him.<br>\r\nYou look up, the sun is already setting, and the snow hasn't let up. Freezing to death might be an option.<br>\r\n\"Dude, just come in and join me.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I--I'mmm, f-f-f-ine.\" you say chattering.<br>\r\n\"Any minute now, this snow will let up, and help will arrive. Or at least my phone will work.\" you think as you look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try and figure out your reluctance to get close to Joey. Is it really because you think sharing a bag with him will make you seem gay? Isn't that a petty reason to freeze? Joey's not gay, you're not gay. He's not going to blackmail you or tell anyone. But still, the last time you were that close to Joey, you were both drunk and sex was involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just come in.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-no.\" your pride says to him, determined to do this.<br>\r\n\"Then turn on the engine, and at least let us die warmly.\" Joey taunts you.<br>\r\n\"Don't be stupid.\"<br>\r\n\"Then start acting smart Will!\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at a bottle you pissed in an hour earlier. You touch it for warmth, only to find out that it too has gone cold.<br>\r\nYou look down at your hands. You probably will get frostbite if you stay out here. You really wish you had the foresight to bring another sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come into the damn bag.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"I-i-it's not e-even big enough-gh for the two of us!\"<br>\r\n\"It is now!\" Joey says, and you look down to see you're naked, and female. Your nipples are pointing from the cold, and you're covered in goosebumps.<br>\r\nJoey starts to strip off his clothes.<br>\r\n\"Our body heat will warm each other, now either get into this bag, or we're both probably going to die of cold.\"<br>\r\nHating yourself, and Joey, you crawl into the bag. The cold is worse now that you've lost a lot of muscle mass, but the heat from Joey feels more comfortable than it would have if you still had it.</span></div></div>",

Then I wouldn't have to deal with this bullshit anymore.\"<br>\r\nJoey stays quiet, he knows you're mad, but he doesn't know how serious you are about rather being dead than having this curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyday this hangs over me. Not knowing if I'm going to change in the middle of some meeting, or end up naked in the middle of the men's room.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you want me to do?\" Joey asks. \"I thought I was doing excellent self control.

Joey lets out a light snore as he pulls you tighter.<br>\r\n\"Joey. Joey.\" you whisper. But it's pointless, he's asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire night, you don't sleep much, you get an hour or two before sunrise.<br>\r\nYou awake to the feeling of Joey's erect member, a thin later of his underwear is all that separated the foreskin from your exposed ass. The area poking you feels wet. \"It's probably sweat.\" You try and assure yourself.<br>\r\n\"Sleep okay?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Never.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly there is a knock on your window.<br>\r\n\"You two okay in there?\" someone asks as he wipes snow off the fogged window.<br>\r\n\"Hey check this out.\" he says to someone, and a breaded guy peaks through a melted area of the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, get lost!\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two guy's laugh. \"We got a towing cable.\" the bearded one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you help us out?\" Joey asks. He grabs his pants and tries to put them on while not leaving the bag. His efforts accidentally squeeze you out a bit and expose your nipple to the strangers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we can!\" one yells with a twain in his voice. \"For a price.\" the other adds.<br>\r\n\"Give me a minute, I'll be right out.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree minutes later, he's all dressed up. \"Careful Joey.\" you tell him. Your intuition is going crazy, something tells you these guys can't be trusted.<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you cared.\" he winks, as he gets out of the car.<br>\r\n\"I don't.\" you reply as he shuts the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only hear so many words from the conversation. But the phrase \"blow me and my friend,\" is defiantly said.<br>\r\nYou see Joey shake their hands.<br>\r\n\"Throw on some extra clothes, and get out of the car.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou throw on a spare coat, and freeze as you see your car getting lifted to the road again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey goes inside and starts it.<br>\r\n\"It's good.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Now give us what you owe.\" the bearded man says.<br>\r\n\"Come on guy's, really?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Tell her to give it to us, or we'll break your legs and take it anyway.\" the guy says as he looks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guy walks up to you.<br>\r\n\"The hell! You're a dude!\" the guy says.<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" you say to him in a noticeably masculine voice. \"I've always been a dude.\"<br>\r\n\"It's a dude!\" he yells to his bearded friend.<br>\r\n\"I thought I saw her taking a piss near that snow bank.\" you say pointing towards a treeline. \"Just wait, she'll be out in a second.\"<br>\r\nAs the guy goes over to look, you head towards the car, and shut the door.<br>\r\n\"Drive, for the love of all that is sacred drive.\" you tell Joey, and he speeds off, at a faster than recommended speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen horror movies like this!\" Joey says, as he grips the wheel.<br>\r\n\"Why did you agree to that?!\" you ask him.<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd turn back!\"<br>\r\n\"Have you watched the horror movies? Those guys probably don't care if I'm a guy or a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the rear view mirror to see the strangers' truck in a snow ditch.<br>\r\n\"We're safe!\" says Joey with relief in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you slow down to well under the speed limit, until you reach the ski resort.</span></div></div>",

Including his brother Ted. A healthy diet of beer and chips is giving party a lively atmosphere. Ted, taking responsibilities of the best man, has offered his apartment to hold the celebrations. Joey looks content, but still a bit anxious about the life changing ceremony that's going to be happening in a few days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't we go to Vegas?\" Gus asks.<br>\r\n\"Because only Will there could afford a trip to Vegas.\" Ted says pointing at you.<br>\r\nYou don't care, another beer will dull your notice of them.<br>\r\n\"So are we going out to a strip club?\" asks Paul.<br>\r\n\"No, don't worry, I got the entertainment to come here.\" Ted says.<br>\r\n\"Fuck ya, all the perks of a strip club, in the comfort of your apartment.\" Gus says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey looks at you knowingly.

This is my last chance to party like we used to.\"<br>\r\n\"After all the garbage I've been through, I don't know if I can party like that anymore.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"I don't think I can, to me this is one last shot to try and regain some glory. After tonight, Joey the ladies' man is retiring and Joey the family man is taking over.<br>\r\n\"Good.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't get it, the entertainment should be here right now.\" Ted says as he takes out his cell phone.<br>\r\n\"Dude, it's fine, we'll go to a strip club.\" Gus says.<br>\r\n\"No, I paid these guys. They're sending the ladies here.\" Ted snaps.<br>\r\nHe opens up his cell phone and starts yelling to the people on the other end. Shutting himself in his room, you hear the occasional curse word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can always go to a strip club, right?\" you ask Joey.<br>\r\n\"Ted and Ryan got blacklisted a few years back.\" Joey answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could always go home early.\" you tell Joey.<br>\r\n\"Can I see you in the hall?\" Joey asks as you cautiously follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You have to keep what I'm telling you between you and me, okay?\"<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n\"One of the reasons Ted got picked for best man isn't just because he's my brother, it's because lately, he's been a bit unstable.\"<br>\r\n\"Unstable, how?\"<br>\r\n\"He tried to off himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lost his job, his girlfriend, got kicked out of school, all in a span of a year. He's been pretty depressed. My parents thought that giving him the role of my best man would be good for him. And for the last month it was, it gave him something to look forward to and gave him a reason to live.\" Joey continues<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good...\"<br>\r\n\"Tonight has to go over smoothly.\" Joey interrupts you.<br>\r\n\"So I'll call and order some girls over.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"And have them here in two hours when everyone is worn out?\"<br>\r\n\"Joey, I don't like where this is going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel a not so subtle draft, and look down to see yourself in a skimpy female cop costume, complete with a cap gun and handcuffs.<br>\r\n\"Dammit Joey.\" you squeak, your incredibly high heels almost throwing you off balance. It's been a while since you've worn them.<br>\r\n\"Please man, it will save the night.\" he pleads. \"Just come in, do a dance, then say an emergency has come up and you have to leave.\"<br>\r\n\"Joey, I know most the guys here, and they're drunk.\"<br>\r\n\"I swear, I'll make sure nothing happens.\" he tells you.</span></div></div>",

Police!\" you shout in the most authoritarian voice you can pull off in this body.<br>\r\nThere is a moment of silence as the music is turned down as Ted opens the door.<br>\r\n\"We've been having complaints about the level of music in this apartment.\"<br>\r\nEveryone has shut up, they're playing along, just waiting to see where you're going with this.<br>\r\n\"...It's not loud enough!\" you shout.<br>\r\nYou except a cheer or something, but it's still quiet.<br>\r\n\"Turn it up!\" you say, forcing a smile.<br>\r\nGus turns up the music until it starts to hurt your ears. You kick shut the door behind you and start shaking your ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt just hits you that you have about three dance moves that you know how to do as a woman. Once you stop shaking your ass, you'll have little to follow up with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe music is pumping and the net thing you know you find yourself grinding against Gus.<br>\r\n\"Are you the one in charge here?\" you ask him. Not wanting to give away that you know who anyone is at this party.<br>\r\nGus actually seems to be keeping his distance from you. He's sticking his ass out away from you as he's putting his hands up in the air.<br>\r\n\"Talk to Ted over there.\" Gus says.<br>\r\n\"Is he the bachelor?\" you ask, sounding more bimbo-ish than you meant to. The male part of you is glad that Gus is afraid to get close to you. The stripper part feels a bit insulted.<br>\r\n\"No, he's the guy paying you.\" Gus squeaks.<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" you tell him as you circle your ass towards his waist. It's too much fun to watch him squirm.<br>\r\n\"I'm not a real cop, you know. You can feel free to give it a slap.\" you yell, curious to see if he'll take you up on the offer.<br>\r\nYou barely feel a little tap on your skirt. You give him a mock look of disappointment, playfully push him away and head towards Ted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told you were the big spender.\" you yell over the music as you grind against him.<br>\r\n\"That's me, the one with the cash.\" he says as he grinds you right back. Unlike Gus, Ted is straight forward with his intentions. He's not afraid to show that he's a man. Not only do you feel a quick slap on your ass cheek, but it's followed up immediately by both his hands massaging them. No wonder he was banned from strip clubs, he doesn't even give you the option to say no. You're about to slap him, when you realize that that may destroy his self confidence even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Careful, keep this up and I'm going to write you a steep ticket.\" you tell him. Ted's eyes are up in the air, he can't hear what your saying. You don't really need him to speak though, he body is telling you more than enough. You quickly grab out the hand cuffs, and trap each of his wrists together.<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Ted yells as he comes out of his trance.<br>\r\n\"I'll deal with you later.\" you say pushing him back onto a chair.<br>\r\nYou skip your way over to Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is really something...\" Joey says. His words aren't helping.<br>\r\n\"Shut up, I need to concentrate.\" you tell him as you direct him to an armless chair.<br>\r\nJoey sits and you stand on top of him.<br>\r\nYou groove to the music, and you stick your cleavage right in his face. The professional businessman in you hops your doing this right. Joey and the guys seems to be giving you a free pass because you look so gorgeous.<br>\r\nYou squirm your way down until your thighs are making circular grooves on his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel Joey's hard excitement as you get into him, and a feeling of regret comes over you. Still, your body seems to be swaying to the music, and at one point you can even feel Joeys erection under your skirt. It presses against your panties and you suddenly let out a little jolt. This shocks him, and somehow your breasts pop out of your poorly constructed top. Your giant nipples hang out erect, for everyone in the room to see. A cheer is let out, as the others think it's part of the show. Joey sees by the surprise and uncertainty in your face that this was a total accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Touch them.\" you mouth to him.<br>\r\n\"Touch them!\" you tell him again, realizing he isn't looking at your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gives two firm but gentle grasps just as the song ends. The sensitivity seems to surprise you and you give out a feminine gasp for air. The others think it's still part of the show and all start clapping and giving out wolf whistles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and give a bow, your breasts swaying off your chest. As you lean over, Joey slaps your ass, not missing a beat, and your face turns bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in the corner of the room and see that you forgot all about Ryan. He's holding up a camera-phone, and was probably videotaping the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, my exploits will be posted online. My own personal hell is complete.\" you think satirically, realizing that you probably made a huge mistake trying to do this.</span></div></div>",

And the other part moves your bad hand towards his pocket to try and grab the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other guys at the party seems to be congratulating Joey. This is your chance.<br>\r\nWith a quick grab, you take the phone and squeeze it down the crack in the back of your skirt. At the same time you take while moving your ass so that Ryan doesn't know the object is missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say big boy, do you want more?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Ryan squeaks out.<br>\r\nYou get up, squeezing the phone between your thighs. \"Then just give me a minute to get ready for you.\" you say as you balance yourself and head towards the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second you shut the bathroom door, the phone goes off. The damn things on vibrate. Trying not to clentch up, you split you legs apart and let the phone hit the bathroom rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the text, you quickly go to the video options, and delete the video taken earlier that night. You then hide the phone behind the toilet seat.

Matt is leaning away, trying to keep his bad arm out of your view. He clearly needs an ear to talk too.<br>\r\n\"You're not losing her.\" you say, almost intuitively.<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n\"You look sad because you think she'll be spending too much time with Joey to bother seeing you. But Joey's not like that. He'll just go visit you with her.\" you say, trying to be gentle, and get him more comfortable about talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a glance at you as if Matt is memorizing your face.<br>\r\n\"What, is something wrong?\" you ask gently touching your face. There is a minimal feeling of discomfort at the moment.<br>\r\n\"I...no.\" Matt says before shutting up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is an awkward pause. You're about to suggest that you leave, when an unfamiliar tune comes up.<br>\r\n\"I like this song.\" Matt says looking at you.<br>\r\n\"I like this song too.\" you lie.<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful.\" Matt says.<br>\r\nYou heart flutters a bit as butterflies seem to swarm in your stomach. At this moment, the comment comes out of left field, you expected him to start the conversation mentioning something about you, but this far in, you weren't prepared for it.<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"I want to dance, with you.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" you say. Saying no might have destroyed his recovering self esteem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his remaining hand, he pulls you onto the edge of the dance floor as he pulls you close to him. (Closer than you would have liked anyway.) But your mind is telling you that that's because he only has one hand and wants a firm hold of you. And when your mind is having doubts, your body doesn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeeting gazes, the swaying starts, but Matt still fails to crack a smile.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"You're leading.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou think about it, you've been a man so often you've forgotten that you're not supposed to lead when you look like this. You relax your muscles a bit and let Matt do his role as the man in the dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's cautious, but that's because he's not used to the alterations in his body yet. You understand this feeling more than he'll ever know. About two minutes into the dance, your head is resting on his shoulder, your body telling his that your comfortable in this position. You could almost fall asleep like this and feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see Janice sitting down at your table, here eyes widen as she recognizes you. \"Oh My God.\" she mouths to you. You give her a harsh stare, signaling not to interfere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother minute later, the song ends and Matt looks at you once more, a huge smile slowly begins to break out on his face.<br>\r\n\"That was...\"<br>\r\n\"Fun.\" you interrupt.<br>\r\n\"Magical.\" he corrects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think I need a moment to sit down and rest.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Matt says, although in his face, you can see he's ready for more.<br>\r\n\"It's these shoes, they're a killer on the feet.\" you explain.<br>\r\n\"Oh sure,\" Matt says, as he goes off to get a drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, the shoes didn't bother you that much, which itself is concerning you a bit, but you figured Matt would have no clue about how much pressure women could take in heels and believe your lie. You just wanted to talk to Janice.</span></div></div>",

It's just your body mimicking the actions of a pregnant woman.\"<br>\r\n\"CALL ME CLAIR!\" you shout, before suddenly stopping.

Something tells you that if you went home pregnant, Janice would freak out. With a sigh, you convince yourself that if you can't be cured, you should never see Joey again. The pregnancy thing was the final breaking point. He HAD to have known that that was a possibility, and he had gained enough control over his connections with the curse that it couldn't have been accidental.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fart an amazingly numerous amount of times on your way home. And there is a hollow feeling inside of your gut, like you've just lost something that can never be regained. Clenching your fist and drying your tears, you swear never to mention this incident to Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Joey is gone from you life for the next six decades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom time to time, you hear of what's going on with him through neutral friends. You even stop yourself from going to Anne's funeral. You're not sure what killed her, but six months after, you were stuck in woman's form, and no matter how hard you tried, you always seemed to look way too much like a prostitute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat six months absence cost you your job. And Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you invested your money well in the stock market and were able to do a lot of work out of your house, thanks to new computer advances. Two decades after the pregnancy scare, you noticed one of the advantages of your curse. While your male body aged, when you turned into Clair, you never looked older than 30. Your bones and muscles seemed more limber too.<br>\r\nOnce you reached the age of fifty, and were unable to maintain a healthy relationship because of your curse, you through respectability to the wind and even made some web videos as Clair. Selling them online for a nice little profit. Enough to live on, anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only after you turned 80 that you got a hand written letter placed at your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear William,<br>\r\nI do not have much time left in this world, and before passing into the next, I'd like once more to see you and make amends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Joey<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom other information left at your door, you realized that Joey was just a bus ride away and was expected to go any day now.<br>\r\nWith a sigh, you wonder if you should meet him. You still felt an almost instinctive hatred for you, first for making you pregnant, and second, for destroying the baby in you. It was a maternal instinct to be sure, but it's one that hit you on a genetic level. You never liked how much control he had over your life. You were almost tempted to go down and see him, just to tell him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes get heavy, even thinking about the subject. You haven't turned into Clair for years. Maybe the curse has faded away. Maybe today really will be your last chance to let Joey make amends.</span></div></div>",

There is still the lingering feeling of death behind the closed doors here, but it's hidden though the clean sheets and bright lights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA young nurse smiles at you, and you give her a wolf-like grin that only old perverse people possess. You look at her the way men looked at you the week you became everyone's dream girl. Not that it matters, you are no threat to her, you can't even get erect without medication now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually you get to Joey's room and see him hooked up to all kinds of new age machines that do things your perverted old brain can't even comprehend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey?\" you ask at the man in the bed, his eyes closed, old age blotches covering to much of him, and hair that is almost non-existent.<br>\r\n\"Will?\" he asks, as his eyes slowly open, and his head turns in your direction once more.<br>\r\n\"You look like hell.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"I can't even tell what you look like anymore.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear your a grandfather.\" you say.<br>\r\n\"That's all I am. A ton of debt, and my daughter won't even see me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is more silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was never a good father. I was almost a good grandfather.\"<br>\r\nYou don't respond.<br>\r\n\"How are you living?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"I'm living.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"Single?\" he asks.<br>\r\n\"Stupid curse made it hard. It messed me up more than I realized.\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's what you wanted to hear. A legitimate apology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I could see Clair one more time?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"Joey, you can't even see me.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when are they letting you out of here?\" you ask, knowing full well he isn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n\"I'm too stubborn to die. I've got at least another week in me. But no one to go home to.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou want to respond, but don't know how.<br>\r\n\"Do you need a roommate?\" he jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh a polite laugh, but it takes to much energy to be anything other than somber. Too many of your friends and colleagues have passed away recently. And your beginning to feel like you won't hit 90. You're not even sure if you want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want me to forgive you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Hell no. There is nothing to forgive.\" Joey says cockily.<br>\r\n\"You bastard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I actually wanted to ask you a favor.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving you a chance to respond, you feel your body change. You look down to see your wearing some sort of fancy dress. Your nails are painted and you have the perky breasts of a 17 year old girl. You can taste some sort of lip-gloss on your mouth. And you feel your heart race at a pace which it hasn't worked at in years. You're wearing heels again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to take my grandson to prom.\" Joey says.<br>\r\nYou look down at yourself in disbelief. You were never this young as Clair. You quickly move to the bathroom mirror. You're Clair all right, and look like you just got back from the beauty parlor, but you look a decade younger than when you first became her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do this?\" you ask Joey.<br>\r\nJoey looks too tired to respond.<br>\r\nYour wallet has even become a a tiny purse to match your outfit.<br>\r\n\"Joey! JOEY! Answer me!\" you shout.<br>\r\n\"Is everything okay in here?\" the nurse asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" you say, surprised to hear her voice.<br>\r\nShe walks over and does a quick check over Joey.<br>\r\n\"He's fine.\" she says. \"He's been fading in and out like this for months.\"<br>\r\nJoey has some new medical condition of this culture, which first got discovered five years back. You can't remember what it's called, but a lifetime of over-stimulation, and a poor diet, causes the effect when the people get elderly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout meaning to, you breathe a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\"You look amazing.\" the nurse says. She's the hot nurse you grinned at earlier.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, it's prom night.\" you say, faking enthusiasm.<br>\r\n\"Well I'm jealous of whoever did your hair.\"<br>\r\nYou're blushing. Not that the nurse can tell under all your make up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the nurse finishes up and walks out, a young man walks into the room, he looks remarkably like Joey did when he was 19 years old.<br>\r\n\"Hi, you must be Clair.\" he says.<br>\r\n\"Damn you Joey, you set me up!\" you think as you look at Joey lying on the table, probably unable to hear you, but sporting a huge smile.<br>\r\n\"I'm Dan.\" the youth continues as he guides your wrists to him mouth and kisses it.<br>\r\nYour heart rate increases to a speed that would probably be bad for you if you were an 80 year old man.<br>\r\n\"I'm Clair.\" you tell him.<br>\r\n\"How did this kid not get a date?\" you brain responds. Then you realize, you have the brain of a 16 year old girl, which just happens to have an extra lifetime of memories in it.<br>\r\n\"My Grandpa said he was friends with yours, and that you were a classy lady who'd like a good time.\"<br>\r\n\"I...I...ya, I'll want to go to prom, if you're asking.\" you say, and want to die.<br>\r\n\"Hey, I'm not going to let a girl dress up for nothing.\" he tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms lock, and you're being escorted out. Joey's smile still glowing behind you.<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad, right? One more night of youth. One more chance to dream and have fun.\" you think as you walk out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea what kids are into these days, but if it's anything like your prom, it's going to be a wild night.</span></div></div>",

I never thought that I'd write over 150 entries in this interactive story when I first started to continue the fun set up Wanderer0426 created, but the characters were enduring enough that I kept coming back to continue the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you've noticed a major tonal shift from chapter/option #96 to this one, it's because there was. Major character's disappeared, there were major time skips, characters disappeared. The reason for this is because I wanted to do a sequel to the original concept, but didn't want start a new interactive story, and I wanted to do a Cole's notes type pacing, picking what would have been the highlights out of a fully realized story and showcasing them for any readers who were interested. In fact anything after Will/Clair meets the Goth is the club, after a week of the having curse, should be treated as a sequel or a spinoff. If you treat it as such, you should be able to have more fun reading the options and watching Will/Clair 'suffer' in creative ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo at nearly 175 entries (as I type this) do I plan to abandon this project? The answer is no. While I've completed all I intended to do (and more,) with this story, there are still bits that I believe could be improved. Now that the core story is finished, there are smaller scenes I'd like to add in alternative chapters, kind of like deleted scenes on a DVD (because they won't go anywhere).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anyone wants to add to this, all I ask is two things;<br>\r\n1) Be inspired, and keep within the core rules set up at the beginning. Try and keep up the the quality and tone found throughout this interactive story.<br>\r\n2) Finish what you write. Don't leave an interesting plot hanging. Wanderer0426 &amp; myself have done all the hard work, setting up atmosphere, characters, locations, and rules. Give your shot at how you'd end the story by choosing an option close to the end of the story and see where it takes you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's about it, if you have any thoughts, constructive criticisms, ideas, ratings, whatever, please don't hesitate to contact myself of Wanderer0426 and let us know!</span></div></div>",

Screw him!  He had an incredibly hot wife, a beautiful daughter, was somehow successful at work, and had a better friend in you than he ever deserved.  When he dies, hopefully your connection to him will be over, and you\u2019ll never have to worry about this stupid curse again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make yourself some lunch, and sit down to watch a holographic computer projection that replaced television, and the internet.  You may not be young anymore, but you feel young playing this.  A device scans your eye and plays the program.  You\u2019re fighting dragons as a 21 year old version of yourself, back when you\u2019re at the height of your physical power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext comes your favorite part, when you save the princess, and she is about to reward you.  They did such an amazing job with mimicking the sensations of her touch.  But before you can put your digital hands on her, the computer says \u2018error\u2019 and shuts down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are disconnected from the system, and all your physical senses return to you.   You look down, and you are completely naked.  Not just that, you are not you anymore.  You see large breasts, and other feminine body parts, as your straight dark hair falls down to your elbows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run to the mirror, your naked feet slapping against the ground as you do so.  You look into the mirror, and see a youthful face looking back at you.  You\u2019re not even sure you\u2019re 18 years old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoey!\u201d you curse, as you race to pick up the phone and called the hospital.  The hospital puts you on a runaround as they keep transferring your call from one department to the next.  Finally, you hear a voice of a female doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking for your friend Joey?\u201d she asks, and you confirm the last name, and birth year.<br>\r\n\u201cJoey died last night.\u201d she says, and your heart stops.<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d you say, your hormones overtake you and you begin to sob.<br>\r\nThe call ends abruptly, and you realize that this change occurred after Joey\u2019s death.  You\u2019re connected to someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night comes, you realize you\u2019re not changing back.  It\u2019s been years since you\u2019ve remained a female this long.   Sleep is hard as you toss and turn, trying to get into the perfect position, but it\u2019s no use.  Your mind overflows with concerns and worse case scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s only the next day, when you get a call from Joey\u2019s lawyer about him leaving something in the will for you.  You order instant on the hour clothes to wear for the funeral, and try and hide in the back, as a boy your own age can\u2019t stop staring at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d you finally confront him at the reception.<br>\r\n\u201cNothing.  It\u2019s nothing.  You just look exactly like a woman I dreamed about the other night.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cIs that supposed to be a pickup line?\u201d you ask disgusted.<br>\r\n\u201cMayb\u2026no.\u201d he says gaging your reaction.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m William.\u201d he says shaking your hand.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2026Clair.\u201d you say defeated.  After all this time, it still doesn\u2019t feel right referring to yourself as Clair, but you can\u2019t for the life of you think of a better name.<br>\r\n\u201cHow do you know my Grandpa?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.\u201d Your mind thinks, as reality seems to crash down around you.  This is Joey\u2019s grandson, his closest living male blood relative.  If anyone is effecting your curse, it\u2019s probably him.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m here to represent his friend William. Who was too sick to make it.\u201d you say.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that.  That he is sick, not that you\u2019re hear.\u201d he corrects himself.  \u201cI was named after that guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a close look at William.  Against all odds, he does look a bit like you when you were a teenager or early adult.  Was this some sort of twist of fate, or a side effect of the curse?  Joey never looked like you.   Of course you for large parts of your life, you didn\u2019t look like you either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day after the funeral, you are gathered in the layers office for the reading of the will.  It\u2019s mostly boring speech, about the splitting up of his estate, until it comes to your part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd to my good friend William, who I have asked my daughter to name her only son after, to you I leave a box of artifacts that I have collected throughout my lifetime.  Including my rare Menhitian books, which I have spent many countless nights translating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat.  Maybe, just maybe he found something to cure you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the lobby, you look through the box provided.  And start frantically flipping through the pages.  Inside one of the pages is a note:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam.  I never intended to make your life miserable, but I know I complicated it.  I am sorry.  Forgive me.   To make it up to you, I have provided this ancient cleansing amulet.  It will break your curse and return you to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down and think about this.  You look at your body, and see the changes that had been made to it.   Your nails are painted.  You don\u2019t recall that happening.  You take a compact mirror out of your purse.  You don\u2019t recall buying that either.  You open it to see that your make up looks like it was done by a professional to get ahead in an office setting.  You quickly close the compact and slip it in your purse.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curse is changing you again, but this time you\u2019re not noticing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I sit down?\u201d asks William.<br>\r\n\u201cFree country.\u201d you say without thinking.<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did my grandfather leave yours that?\u201d he asks, assuming you\u2019re your own granddaughter.<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You lie.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird, he never liked reading or other languages, but my mother says that he\u2019d spend four nights a week studying those books.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cToday, we\u2019d just get a computer to translate them.\u201d you respond.<br>\r\n\u201cYa, this world we live in is amazing.\u201d he says, as his eyes meet yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop for a moment, lost in them.  Then snap out of it, and realize that he has a point.  You\u2019ve just got six decades of your life back.  Well, maybe not your life, but six decades of youth.  This is a new adventure, a new chance.  You could could live life again, with the wisdom of your life as Will, but you\u2019d still be effected by the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the amulet in your hand, all you have to do is squeeze it, and you\u2019ll be rid of this curse forever, but then you\u2019d also be an old man.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You slowly do. You have long pink hair, you can tell by the feel of it that it's a wig.<br>\r\nYour nails are a bright red, but your hands are clearly those of a man, although it looks as though all the hair on you has been waxed.<br>\r\nYou're wearing a some sort of shirt that covers your chest, you're not sure what's under it, but its defiantly something artificial which mimics the appearance of boobs.<br>\r\nYou're wearing a knee high skirt, with some nylons underneath, running down to your high heeled shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try moving, but it is difficult with your center of gravity, and no matter what you do, you can't help but feel your sack move around with every step you take. You shuffle your way over to the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you see is not pretty. It is a face slathered in make up in a desperate attempt to hide any masculine features. It looks artificial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start running some water, and splash your face, figuring all the cosmetics will wash off. To your surprise, you notice no difference in your appearance after trying to wipe your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tug on the wig, it doesn't hurt, but no matter how hard you try, you can't seem to take it off. Same with your shoes and shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, you can pull down the nylons and skirt, but it won't do you much good for anything other than sex or going to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still a man at least, right?\" Joey asks. You see his reflection behind you in the mirror.<br>\r\n\"I guess so.\" you say, in your fake feminine voice.<br>\r\n\"Maybe it will wear off.\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" you say quietly.

She must have put it on before she changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look good today.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nBeth looks around, making sure there are no other men in the area, then she leans over to you.<br>\r\n\"Will, your curse, I think it's contagious.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Really? I'm cured.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nBeth looks at her breasts. \"I caught it!\" she whispers intensely.<br>\r\n\"You do look different.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Please, Will, you have to help me figure this thing out!\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Morning Clair.\" a co-worker says as he passes by her.<br>\r\nBeth smiles. not knowing how to respond.<br>\r\n\"That's the third person to call me Clair.\" she tells you, worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The curse makes you look like a guys ideal woman. The guys in the office knew that ideal woman as Clair. They see you the same way they saw me. You're Clair!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"But I don't want to be Clair!\" she whines.<br>\r\n\"It's not so bad, (for you) it's not like you had a day to learn everything that is expected of the opposite sex. Guys will actually listen to any ideas you have. And if you're shopping for a relationship, you can have anyone here.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can see Beth thinking about it. She's still freaked out, but you can tell she's thinking about all the ways she can use this to her advantage. She was in the same position as you before, stuck not going anywhere. Now she's the perfect looking woman, and the sky is her limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\" she says, giving you a sly look.<br>\r\n\"Maybe what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll let you tell me more over lunch and dinner.\" she says.<br>\r\nThe then walks away, making sure you get a good view of her as as she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Clair just asked me out on a date.\" you say to yourself in disbelief.</span></div></div>",

If Joey didn't see her, and no one else mentioned seeing her, maybe she wasn't there at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que, your memory brings up a fact about the curse. They can be broken by learning a lesson. You learned about sacrifice and humility, and how to take your destiny into your own hands. Once you proved that, the curse removed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about it some more, and that seems like a dumb explanation. Maybe she secretly cast a spell.

Your heart stops, you're in no mood to be polite right now. \"Here's my number.\" he finishes, handing to a card.<br>\r\nYou silently take it and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on Clair?\" Darrel asks you.<br>\r\nThen it hits you, she's seeing you as Clair again.<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nDarrel almost falls down the stairs when she reaches them. She has no practice walking in heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you make it to Joey's car.<br>\r\n\"I think you should come to my place.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"Darrel just nods her head, too ashamed to be asked to be driven home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make it to your building, you walk up the stairs to your apartment.<br>\r\nJoey get's stopped half way up by Ben. \"Where do you keep finding these models?\" he asks your roommate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you shut the door, you revert back to William. You look at Darrel, but she hasn't changed into a man.<br>\r\n\"Clair, you've changed again!\" she says pointing at you.<br>\r\n\"I thought you would too.\" you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come to my room, we'll figure this out.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nAs she opens the room, she sees it clearly belongs to a guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks back at you in surprise.<br>\r\n\"This is your room?\"<br>\r\n\"Ya.\" you admit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gazes back at you again. \"You weren't always Clair.\" she realizes.<br>\r\n\"Not until last Saturday.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"So what happened?\" she says.<br>\r\n\"It's a long story...\" you start. You tell her about the curse, what triggers it, how bad it gets, and while you tried to meet that Goth girl.<br>\r\n\"But if I have the same thing, why am I not changed back?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe it's a different trigger that sets off the curse.\" you tell her.<br>\r\nYou leave your room for a second, and then return.<br>\r\n\"Did you change while I was gone?\" you ask.<br>\r\nShe shakers her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at her hunched over. The poor girl has no idea how to balance her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we know you changed during sexual stimulation.\" you tell her, feeling queasy as you mention it. \"Maybe similar stimulation will alter you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face blushes a vibrant red. She's demeaned by her down body, but she reluctantly agrees to try.<br>\r\nAs you walk towards your dresser, you look under it to pick out an old swimsuit calendar.<br>\r\n\"Here.\" you say tossing it to her.<br>\r\n\"I'll go outside.\" you promise as you shut the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute passes before Joey enters. You immediately become Clair again.<br>\r\nHe's about to say something, when you both hear a high pitched scream from your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Joey burst in.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" Darrel says.<br>\r\nYou look around your room. It now looks more dainty and Clair-ish.<br>\r\n\"What?\" Joey asks.<br>\r\n\"It just changed!\" she says, looking at the provocative clothes in the open closet. She throws the calendar down in the bed and you see it's full of next-to-nude-firemen.<br>\r\n\"Didn't know you had a type.\" Joey says to you, holding up the calendar.<br>\r\n\"Get out.\" you tell him, and he does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make sure Darrel sees you gesturing across the room.<br>\r\n\"All this change was because of my curse, not you.\" you assure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou sit next to her and put your arm around her, trying hard to give her a feeling of comfort and security. To your shame, you feel maternal doing it.<br>\r\n\"I know this is hard.\" you assure her. \"But we have less than 36 hours before you're expected to go into work. We need to figure everything about this curse that we can.\"<br>\r\nShe lets out a big sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll try.\" she says.<br>\r\nYou leave the room as sit down on the couch, feeling horrible that her limited association with you has caused this change to happen.<br>\r\nYou close your eyes, and about an hour later, Darrel comes out of the room, still not cured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to try something.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"I need you as a man.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey's in the apartment, I can't help you.\" you tell her.<br>\r\n\"But your friend Joey's a man, right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n\"Technically.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens the door. to his room.<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" she responds meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door shuts, and about 15 minutes later, you hear Joey give a giant scream.<br>\r\n\"That's the second scream tonight. The neighbors will complain.\" you say opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really wish you hadn't opened that door. You see Darrel and Joey in the bed, a male Darrel leaning on top of a male Joey.<br>\r\nDarrel pulls up his pants, as Joey lays back, paralyzed in shock.<br>\r\nDarrel walks out of the room and stops to talk to you.<br>\r\n\"I found the trigger.\" he says.<br>\r\nYou're afraid to ask.<br>\r\n\"Juice.\"<br>\r\n\"Juice?\"<br>\r\n\"Juice.\" Darrel says as he motions towards his penis, to ashamed to mention the actual term for the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll never change back again.\" you tell him, trying to be optimistic.<br>\r\n\"As long as I never get off again.\" he says, a clear sign of anger in his voice.<br>\r\nHe looks like he's going to punch the wall.<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure that any, even mine, that touches my skin, triggers the change.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stay silent. You want to ask how he knows this, but something tells you he knew it instinctively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no clue what to say to comfort him. You're shocked that he went as quick as he did to Joey. There's probably some history about Darrel that you don't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going home.\" he says. \"If I don't have any sexy dreams tonight, I'll see you Monday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at him exist into the hallway, impressed about how calm he's being about everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then peek in Joey's room to check up on him. Joey is in the fetal position, he has little clue what just happened.<br>\r\nYou slink back to your room, wanting to erase this entire week from existence, but realizing that no matter how bad you have it, there will always be someone who has it worse.</span></div></div>",

Before you can make a response, he thrusts forwards forcefully into you, bracing your front against the door.

There are transformation spells, but most of them come with a price of some sort, a bit of the caster's looks, a piece of their soul, it's all heavy material which your mind tells you not to get involved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, even Joey picks up a book and starts looking through the spells. Part of your mind is terrified about what Joey might learn and try on you. He was into pranks. But you stay silent, hoping that he is smart enough to see the struggle you are going through because of magic and not get involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour passes, and you're starting to get into the more complex material.</span></div></div>",

Feelings of hope seep into you.<br>\r\n\"You're a sponge.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"What?\" you repeat, this time in a more annoyed voice. She sounds like she's insulting you.<br>\r\n\"Um...okay, how do I say this? Most people are like an apple, water seeps in a bit, but most just runs right off it. But some people are like a sponge, they soak everything up.\"<br>\r\n\"And?\"<br>\r\n\"And that's what you are. You absorbed the spell, and when you were around magic, it must have been feeding it.\" she explains.<br>\r\n\"So she's like a magnet for magic.\" Joey explains to himself.<br>\r\n\"He, he's like a magnet.\" you correct him.<br>\r\n\"That makes sense. Okay, so, maybe, this will let us know what type of magic we're dealing with.\" Amber says.<br>\r\n\"Wait, I was nowhere near you, how am I absorbing magic?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmber shuts up for a second. Thinks before talking again. \"I think someone in your life is using it.\" she says.<br>\r\n\"Someone in my life is using magic?\"<br>\r\n\"That's my guess. Magic causes energy, leftover energy hangs around, like a half-life.

Could you actually do magic? But you calm down a bit after you remember what you read in the books about the price magic has.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd have to be very careful. You're not born or trained for this, the results could be random.\" Amber adds.<br>\r\n\"Is there a safer way, you know, to drain me?\"<br>\r\nAmber sighs. \"Not really, and the truth is that this could do more harm than good.\"<br>\r\n\"And if we just wait this out?\" you say.<br>\r\nAmber sighs again. \"Your body isn't just absorbing the magic, it's purifying it and ingraining it into your system.\"<br>\r\n\"What's that mean?\"<br>\r\n\"It means that the spell is actually making you a woman. Did you notice yourself changing more over the past few days?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" you say, not going into details. The skimpier clothes and make up are embarrassing enough without you having to relive it by explaining them to her. Plus Amber seems to have an idea about what's going on.<br>\r\n\"But you still turn into a man when no other guys are around, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's good, once that stops, the curse is almost irreversible.\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean ONCE that stops?\"<br>\r\n\"The magic is still doing its initial spell, it made you look like a woman to other men, but it is going one step further. It's building on the initial spell, and for lack of a better term, evolving it.\"<br>\r\n\"So that means?\" you ask panics, a large part of you doesn't want to know the answer.<br>\r\n\"It means that in another few days, you'll only be able to pee sitting down, and start to plan your calendar around your menstrual cycles.\"<br>\r\n\"But, you'll fix me, right?\"<br>\r\nAmber sighs again.<br>\r\n\"I have a few ideas that could work.\"</span></div></div>",

You look like you've seen a ghost.\" says Joey, who you didn't notice had started to gravitate towards you. He puts his hand on your shoulder, and you shake him off. \"It's me, Will.\" you say. He chuckles. \"I like funny girls. Speaking of which, you aren't, y'know, with Will, are you? Because there's no way he could land someone like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Will,\" you say. \"And I can prove it.\" Joey grins. \"For the record, I'm not really into role-playing, but I'll make the exception for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fourth grade, you peed your pants during recess and I was the only one who didn't run away from you. That's how we became friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grin vanishes from Joey's face. \"Will shouldn't have told you that. That's private information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Fine. What about the time we went swimming in your uncle's lake and your swim trunks fell off, so I had to go snorkeling to find them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey's face turns red. \"How much did he tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do this one more time,\" you say. \"Remember that time in eighth grade I convinced you that Laura Jefferson had a huge crush on you, so you went up to her in the hall and kissed her? And then she screamed and got you suspended?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will, holy shit man... it's really you!\" Joey exclaimed. \"Dude, you're hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick up the middle finger at him. Up at him. Joey's about 5'10\", and you had always been taller than him, at 6'1\". Now you couldn't be more than 5'6\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened?\" Joey asked. You shrug. \"I don't know. The only thing I can think of is this weird dream I had last night. I was at a club and grabbed some chick's ass. In fairness, I was pretty gone. Then she started yelling about some kind of curse she was putting on me. It was a pretty weird dream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, dude? You did go clubbing last night, dumbass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...\" you say. \"So that was real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey shrugs. \"I know as much about supernatural curses as the next guy. What exactly did she say to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scratch your head and feel thick, long hair. \"Uhhh... she said something about how I had to 'learn my lesson for treating women like objects', and now I have to be every man who sees me's ideal woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does that make you my dream girl?\" Joey asks. You shrug. \"I guess it does. Never knew you were into black girls, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I am. And this roommate situation just got a whole lot better.\" You punch him in the arm. \"No, it didn't. I'm the one who has a job here, and I can't exactly show up to work in a completely different body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah...\" says Joey. \"Hey, what am I gonna call you while you're a woman?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will would be awesome,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just saying, it'd be kind of weird to call you 'Will' when you look like...that.\" You shrug. \"I don't really care, you decide what my girl name is.\" \"Awesome.\" says Joey. \"Yeah, just nothing too bad,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey pulls out his laptop. \"What are you doing?\" You ask. \"Uhh... I'm going to a baby names website,\" Joey says sheepishly. You sigh. \"Just be quick about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go to the kitchen and grab an apple, and take a few bites, but you quickly fill up. This new body requires less sustenance. Or maybe you're subconsciously watching your weight now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Danielle?\" Joey calls. \"Okay. That works.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just realized something.\" Joey says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wearing girl's clothes. Where did you get those?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down. Instead of the white t-shirt and cargo shorts you'd worn yesterday, you now had on a white, low-cut feminine shirt that showed off ample cleavage, and greenish leggings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But this kind of looks like the feminine version of what I was wearing yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey nods. \"Do you think all your clothes changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good question,\" you say, and run upstairs, fully aware of Joey's eyes on your ass as you do so. However, something weird happens as you go; as soon as you get out of Joey's sight, you're a man again, in the clothes you wore yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a guy again!\" You exclaim in your male voice, and run back down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, no you aren't.\" said Joey. You looked down at your body. You're still the black girl. \"Wait... stay there.\" You say. You walk back upstairs, out of Joey's eyeshot. You become male again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" You say. \"Looks like whenever I leave a man's line of view, I become myself again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did your clothes turn back?\" asks Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm assuming when you're a girl, your possessions will change to fit with your new form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what we still need to figure out? What happens when a woman sees you?\" Before you can say anything, a knock comes on the door. Joey motions for you to leave. You run into the bathroom and close the door, reverting back to male. You hear the familiar voice of Trevor, a man who lives a few doors down in your building. He's kind of a douche. You can't seem to hear what they're talking about. Leaning against the door to hear, you nudge it open and stumble through, instantly becoming a woman. In the mirror, you see a mix of Joey's dream girl and Trevor's; your breasts and hips have become wider, you've become shorter, your skin has lightened a bit, and your hair is also lighter. You wonder: do they see the girl you see in the mirror, or each their own respective dream girls? You'll ask Joey after Trevor leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" says Trevor. \"I'm Trevor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Danielle.\" you say. He smiles at you. You don't really know how to react, so you just smile back. Trevor nods at Joey, and then leaves. You become fully Joey's dream girl in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, when I came out, did I look the same as I did before?\" You ask. Joey nodded. \"Yeah, why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the mirror I looked different. I guess when two guys are looking at me they each see their dream girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Weird.\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess we should go see how women see me?\" I suggested. I didn't really want to go into public, but it was better than not knowing what would happen when I went to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Joey. \"Where do you wanna go?\"</span></div></div>",

Sure, there would be a lot of people there, but even if you\u2019re not quite sure how comfortable you are with people seeing you like this, you know you have to find out the full extent of the curse before something bad could happen at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to the mall,\u201d you say. Joey grabs his car keys. \u201cThe mall it is.\u201d You kind of feel bad for him; you can tell he\u2019s obviously attracted to you in this body. You walk to the car and get in the passenger seat, briefly shifting from female to male, then back to female as Joey gets back in the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the drive there, you feel yourself changing a lot, because other men are seeing you through the windows. You kind of wish it was tinted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two of you arrive at the mall. As you walk towards it, Joey says awkwardly,\u201dHey, I\u2019m not sure how you\u2019re gonna react to this, but I kinda have to get my mom a birthday present\u2026 do you mind if I leave you on your own for like, twenty minutes, tops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \u201cFine, Joey. But please try to be quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks,\u201d he says. Knowing Joey, he\u2019s probably going to GameStop. Whatever, you\u2019re an independent woman who doesn\u2019t need a man, you jokingly think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gets far away and another transformation comes along. In the reflection of the windows of a shop, you see an extremely well-endowed Latina girl. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/ff/22/3b/ff223b25866d86919a11f8ec1cbd12ff.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/236x/f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d you say to yourself in a sultry voice. As soon as the transformation comes along, a man walks up to you. He\u2019s very tall, at least compared to you now, because in this body you can\u2019t be more than 5\u20192\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice how beautiful you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, you feel your heart flutter. You aren\u2019t into guys! What the hell was that? You recompose yourself. \u201cThank you,\u201d you say. \u201cBut I have a boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, although that doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI, uh, I hope you have a good day.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you, you too.\u201d you say. He awkwardly walks back to the food court. That was weird, but you also realize that\u2019s probably going to be one of the less creepy encounters you have with men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk through the mall, you feel many changes come on. One second you\u2019re a mousy redhead with glasses. Next you\u2019re a petite Asian. After that, a chubby girl. It\u2019s not painful to change, but you can definitely feel a sensation each time you do. It feels kind of\u2026 bubby. It\u2019s pleasant, actually. However, you didn\u2019t like the effects of the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve been the chubby girl for a decent amount of time now, and it leads you to believe that someone is following you. You wish they would just stop, because you don\u2019t really want  to be a fat girl for longer than you have to. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/3a1f08ae932d4c7dfdc4deaa91870fe3/tumblr_neuy50qPsv1t1cfk5o6_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://31.media.tumblr.com/3a1f08ae932d...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk faster, but your whole body jiggles, and you don\u2019t like that sensation at all. You start to sweat. You really hate this body. Suddenly, you see a safe haven: a women\u2019s undergarment shop. Even the most detemined man won\u2019t follow you in there alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk in, but don\u2019t change. You\u2019re still the chubby girl. You look around, but there\u2019s only women here. You look outside the shop. There isn\u2019t a man in sight. Then you piece it together; maybe women see you how the last man to look at you sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcuse me, ma\u2019am, but our plus-size section is over there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn around and see a mousy-looking teenage girl who works in the shop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d you say. Skinny bitch, you think. Wait, what? You have nothing against skinny people. Why did you think that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leave the store and almost cry tears of joy when your skin turns black and you become skinny again. Joey is walking towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoey!\u201d you exclaim, and hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, why so excited all of a sudden?\u201d he asks. You lean in close. \u201cListen, I think someone\u2019s following me. Hold my hand, pretend you\u2019re my boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey gladly obliges.</span></div></div>",

You don't know why, but you find yourself feeling jealous and almost... territorial? As the girl pulls away from the embrace, you recognize her as Vanessa Powers, a girl Joey dated in high school. For some reason, that made you feel even more angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Joey, how long has it been? It must be at least three years!\" she exclaims. She looks at you. \"Who's this?...Is she your girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her an icy look and press yourself against Joey. \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanessa, this is Danielle,\" says Joey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you!\" she says. \"Likewise,\" you say in a cold voice. You don't know why you're acting like such a bitch all of a sudden. Then you realize... maybe Joey likes that in a girl? Maybe, to a certain extent, the curse alters your personality as well as your appearance?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have so much catching up to do!\" says Vanessa. She and Joey start talking, and it doesn't seem like they plan on stopping. All you know is you don\u2019t want to be around Vanessa for another second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJoey, I\u2019m gonna go look around some more,\u201d you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBye, Danielle.\u201d they both say in unison. You walk away, and almost immediately become the fat chick again. Whoever this guy is, he\u2019s nothing if not persistent. And creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach rumbles. You hadn\u2019t been hungry before, but now, all you can think about is food. You walk to the food court, your body jiggling with every step. As you approach the food court, you walk by a group of teenage girls who all giggle at you after you pass. You look back at them, upset, but then continue towards the Burger King at the food court.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait in line, an older woman gives you a dirty look, as if to say \u201cLay off the carbs.\u201d You shrug it off. Honestly, you just need food right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order a double bacon burger, two sides of fries, and a large soda. You take your food to a table and scarf it down, then belch loudly. Who the hell has a dream girl this disgusting?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you snap out of the trance you had been in before you ate. \u2018What the hell was that?\u2019 you think to yourself. You look down at pudgy hands. Your whole body is squishy. You must be about 250 pounds.  It\u2019s a scary thought to think what you would look like if you ran into a guy who was into women in the 500 pound range. This was bad enough as it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to think. There are some creeps out there with all sorts of weird fetishes. You could end up anorexic, or limbless, or deformed. You\u2019re lucky Joey isn\u2019t into weird stuff like that, although it definitely is a new thing to be black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you feel another shift. You look down at yourself. You\u2019re no longer the fat girl, so you stalker must\u2019ve left. In fact, you\u2019re quite the opposite. You literally have the body of a porn star now. You look like you\u2019ve been edited for a magazine cover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://downshiftmagazine.com/coppermine/albums/userpics/10001/Alice-Eve-07.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://downshiftmagazine.com/coppermine/albums/userpics/10001/Alice-Eve-07.jpg</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs different as this is for you, it\u2019s still preferable to being the big girl. And it also means your stalker is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man sits down in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, hot stuff.\u201d This guy\u2019s obviously pretty simple; hopefully, you\u2019ll be able to manipulate him better than the curse manipulates you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the curse starts working against you. You twirl your hair. \u201cHey.\u201d Come on, snap out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou concentrate really hard to gain control again, and...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you saw this, your nipples hardened, your new tight pussy became warm and moist, which was such an odd sensation to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were feeling so odd, but the shock of the situation made you gain control over yourself for a moment, and you ran back into your room, breasts bouncing without a bra and in your booty shorts you know your firm ass was slightly bouncing visibly too. As soon as you closed the door you became yourself again, wearing boxers and a white tank top, like you did to bed, not like the morphed version you were in. As soon as you changed back into yourself you realized what a haze had been on your mind, you didn't realize how weird you were feeling mentally until the fog was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what in the hell just happened. Being very analytical, you realize you looked exactly like a combo of the women your roommate has pinned around his room, not really your type of girl, and when you looked at him, what you felt must have been the female version of getting horny, only it was much more powerful and almost overwhelming than anything you'd felt before. You remember your roommate telling you before how to him, the most attractive thing about a girl would be an insatiable sex drive, especially towards him. It seems you temporarily were that person....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that doesn't make any sense, why are you back to yourself again? Joey wouldn't have done this to you....would he?

Your underwear has also changed but that is something you are forced to feel rather than see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm71/tunaman3000/Hot%20Asian%20Girls/hmh-cool-shirt01.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm71/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wipe that look off your face and let's get going.\" You say rolling your eyes and head out to Joey's car.</span></div></div>",

He's walked into your bedroom, and found your lover. His conscious fights the losing battle. But it's too slow for your appetite, your consent too subtle for him. Hormones flood your veins, as you find yourself reaching forward. Caressing his crotch, you unfasten his jeans, teasingly slowly lower the zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoey is now panting in fevered anticipation and disbelief. You swallowing reflexively, the mouth that was bone-dry moments before now awash in preparation for the feast ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCooing, your appreciation, you slip his cock free from his pants. It stiffens at your touch, at your warmth, your breath ruffling his pubic hair. The aroma of him, now filling your lungs with every breath.

You choke, as you feel him fill your throat, unfamiliar muscles working him. His grip on your head tighter, more controlling, as he sets his pace. Your breathing, nasal and shallow, you gasp a breath as best you can. The scent of Joey now a fog that surrounds you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a few minutes of feverish, sweaty humiliation. You embarrassed by how much you're loving it, by how vocal you can be with a cock in your throat, and climaxing with a delicious treat. The excess bursting from your lips, as you gargle and gurgle the sweet reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour humiliation mounts, as you guide the slick excess back towards your mouth, eager, desperate for none to go unappreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove you, the regret is clear on Joey's face. He's just fucked his best friend's date. The guilt battling the joy that slips out too clearly. You pout softly in sympathy, you hadn't meant to cause him any pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRising higher on your knees, you take his softening member between your breasts. The slick tip, already leaving a dab of his cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for round 2.\" you purr seductively.</span></div></div>",

A soft snort comes from your cute nostrils, as you briefly imagine smothering him with the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he can change you simply by looking, you don't want a confrontation. With everything feeling out of control, you hope, desperately hope, your old body might return if you wait long enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettling down, you try and calm your nerves.

It is a great story, and should be read, also, I wrote 95% of it, so I'm sure the original writer won't mind if I re-post it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe original summary went like this: <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inspiration for this story came from a party I went to the other night, unfortunately at first there were more guys there then girls, so naturally I found myself wishing more girls would show up, fortunately they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this story you\u2019re a guy that pisses off the wrong woman and end up cursed to transform into the eye candy of whoever is around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow here are a few ideas about how it works:<br>\r\n1. The transformations are quick, painless, and the people around you don\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n2. When I say the eye candy of whoever is around you I mean that you become the physical preference of the person around you. Like if you\u2019re around a guy that likes blondes, you turn into a blonde, if he likes Asian women, you turn into an Asian, if he likes them tall or short, big breasts or small breasts you get the idea.<br>\r\n3. If you\u2019re around multiple guys you become a combination of all their preferences.<br>\r\n4. Try to keep clothing appropriate to the situation, no string bikini at a restaurant unless it is at the beach<br>\r\n5. And when you are alone you turn back to normal since there isn\u2019t anyone around, this will also eliminate any unnecessary playing with the new bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I\u2019m not going to worry so much about rules but I do reserve the right to remove anything I believe to be inappropriate or just a pointless filler<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy :)</td>",
