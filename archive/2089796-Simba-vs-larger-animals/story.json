This must be the wrestling arena Timon and Pumba mentioned. On the way over, they told Simba that they wanted to show off how strong their protector was. Smba figured, as long as he got to show off his skill, he'd be good. He met with the vulture, and the vulture directed him towards the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba crawled through a gap in the fence, and instantly winced as he felt his paws sink into the mud. He struggled to pull himself through the glue-like trough. He walked towards a corner, the mud squelching and shifting around him. Eventually, the vulture flew into a barn, and flew back, ready to introduce the opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was the opponent?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus: A pig the size of a boulder infamous for his squashing ability and terrible smell. He's also known to snatch up poor fighters with his mouth or his butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCody: A Clydesdale horse that towers over Simba. He loves sitting on creatures smaller than him, and using his butt to humiliate them further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty: A large, voracious cow. She loves to taste her opponents before winning a fight, and tends to squash and smother foes..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona: A promiscuous fox made infamous for teasing and playing with prey. She typically humiliates opponents in the middle of the arena through any method, no matter how sexual.</span></div></div>",

He turned towards the source, and was horrified to see his opponent. Just behind the fence was a pig that was as large as most of the boulders he's seen. A fence opened up, and the pig walked through it, and Simba was able to see the full figure of the monster. He saw lots of folds from his fat, and he seemed to sport a butt bigger than his head, which already seemed pretty big compared to Simba. Worst of was the smell. The pig absolutely reeked of stink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus looked at Simba, and didn't seem to show much emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be over quickly\" Zeus said.

His enormous bulk didn't stop Zeus from breaking into a full charge. The cub looked at his opponent, frozen like a deer in headlights. The humongous hog leapt up a little and landed his big belly in the mud. The earthen sludge splattered everywhere, hitting the cub, Timon, Pumbaa and the rest of the audience too. The farm animals cheering on the pig barely seemed to care about this quick mud bath. The cub was alltogether far more shocked that Zeus was still surging towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis rotund body slid along the muddy surface with easy, stuck on a collision course with the hapless lion. Simba's awestruck staring left him oblivious to the fact that his paws had sunk a little in the mud. There was no chance of dodging out of this one. The cub had underestimated his environment and he was about to pay a heavy price. A price the sliding pig was intent to collect. His only hope now was that those jiggling flabby rolls rushing towards him would soften the impact a little. The crowd hooted and hollered, watching the little lion moments away from being tackled by Zeus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pig only thought about one thing. How to best humiliate this puny opponent? He was already surging towards him face first. He needed only to open wide and the lion would tumble right into his waiting mouth. Just had to make sure he didn't swallow. Or he could put one stubby foot down and turn himself a little. That way his flank would face the cub. The rounded surface would push the lion down, letting the rest of his massive bulk roll over him, smothering the little guy beneath his great weight. Lastly he could turn himself around completely. His might butt would make a fine example of this cub, smashing him into the reinforced white picket sides of the ring. Each of the options was sadistically satisfying in their own special way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does the pig slam into Simba?</span></div></div>",

The worst he had though of was that he'd headbutt him, but he was in for a far more unpleasant experience. As Zeus slid closer and closer, he opened up his mouth, and Simba was surprised as the dark void of his mouth seemed to envelop him more and more. He was suddenly yanked out of the mud and felt himself slide past the creature's lips, which snapped around his tail. The crowd fell silent, confused at the sudden speed of the attack. The only indication to any of them as to what happened was Zeus noisily slurping up Simba's tail. He licked his lips and patted his belly, as if making Simba out to be a mere morsel that disappeared into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before they could display anger, Zeus opened up his mouth, letting the crowd see Simba's face peering out. Suddenly seeing the light, Simba jumped towards it in an attempt to escape. However, Zeus clamped his lips around Simba's neck, cutting his escape short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HELP!\" Simba screamed out as Zeus slowly, torturously slurped SImba back in. The little lion was thrust back into the hot, wet, smelly darkness. He tried to pry at the lips in a futile effort to escape as the pig pondered how to humiliate the lion. </span></div></div>",

He was too busy panicking in his newfound prison to care much. The pig quickly changed the cub's mind when he showed off his tongue's impressive agility. It constricted itself around the lion's waist, quickly giving him flashbacks of all the times the elephants back in the Savannah manhandled him with their trunks. The added horror of a thick coat of pig saliva and the everpresent stench of Zeus' rotten breath only caused more panic within the terrified cub. Somewhere at the back of this dark cave lay a gullet hungrily waiting to swallow him up. This isn't how he wanted things to end. Suddenly he heard the pig's voice rumbling around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... 's a tasty thing, a lion. Pity rules won't let me swallow ya. Just gonna have 't taste ya more.\" It provided some relief to the cub, but by the sounds of it, his nightmare inside the saliva-drenched maw was only just starting. As his tongue started licking more aggressively the lion couldn't keep his footing. He was thrown aside, landing on a row of molars. Zeus felt it and playfully closed his jaws. He barely touched the cub, mostly trying to scare him. It worked better than he could have hoped for. Panicked screams were muffled by the large pig's mouth, but he could hear them just fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith every passing second the action in Zeus' maw got more erratic. His tongue was actively tossing the lion around, smacking into him and grabbing him at the pig's leisure. At times a limb or a screaming head popped out between the pig's lips, only to be slurped right back in. Finally he let Simba charge forward and burst through, only to lock his lips around the cub's waist. The pig stood up a little, making sure the dangling cub had nothing he could reach. The large tongue had a parting gift left for the little lion. It dragged itself across the cub's rear, the pig's smile curling up even higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't know what was going on. Why did the immense hog just stop like this. When he felt the tip of Zeus' tongue poke against his rear he immediately knew what was going to happen. He squirmed and protested as best he could, but his opponent was deaf to his pleas. In seconds he found his target, the cub's tightly clenched pucker. With overwhelming force the pig pushed himself in. Simba yelped in confusion and pain as the large tongue attempted to probe even deeper inside of him. Zeus didn't expect much of his slobbering tongue to fit in there, but he managed to slide in further than he thought possible. The cub was shocked silent, feeling the large tongue push inside of him. It pressed against his prostate, forcing out an immediate reaction just below. The cub sported an erection, a fact that had not gone unnoticed by his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zeus couldn't possibly stuff more of his tongue into the cub he pulled it out all at once. Simba let out a numb shriek before the pig's lips parted enough for him to slide out, falling onto his back in the thick mud. He was smothered in an almost unreasonable amount of pig saliva and the grinning hog looming over him wasn't done yet. Between the cub's legs was his stiffened member. Zeus had his target in mind. It was adorably puny to the huge pig, who knew precisely what to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, I didn't know ye were this happy 't see me.\" He chuckled before sucking Simba's member into his...</span></div></div>",

The little lion was trying desperately to calm himself down after the pig had stuck his tongue into his ass. But the large nose touching his manhood was enough to send waves of unwilling joy through him. He tried to escape, but the combination of pig slobber and mud he was lying in made movement difficult. The large snorting nose above was in control and soon the evil pig knew exactly how to abuse this position to the fullest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba froze when he felt it. The single most disgusting sensation washed over him. The warmth all around his cock was sudden and strange. The vague tickling of dozens of little hairs along the head and shaft felt a bit arousing. But when he realized those things could only mean one thing the cub was overcome with revulsion. Zeus had pushed his round nose over the little erection before him, snorting the cub's manhood into one of its foul nostrils. The cold surface pushed against the little lion's crotch, ensuring all of his cock was inside of Zeus' nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the audience, who were used to seeing the pig abuse his size in unusual ways, were taken aback. The suction Zeus' big nose could produce was strong enough for him to lift the lower half of the lion out of the mud a little. Applause soon thundered again, adding to Simba's embarrassment. The warmth of the nostrils was soon joined by the inevitable addition of pig snot. The overwhelming hog sneezed a little, blowing the cub back into the mud and pushing his member out a little. When the pig leant back down to restore his hold on the little lion a thick coat of snot accompanied the warm embrace. It lubricated the whole process, letting the little manhood slide in as deep as possible without resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus would bring about the ultimate humiliation. He would drive the cub to release in pleasure inside his big disgusting nose. He stood up a little, letting some of the snot-soaked member slide out before pushing down. Gradually he pumped the tiny cock in and out of his nostril, the disgusting passage greedily snorting up his member every time it was released. The combination of the warm slime and the gentle stimulation from Zeus' nose hair was too much. The cub shuddered in shame as he felt himself shoot his load into the cavernous depths of the pig's nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely unfazed by the addition to his snot the pig kept pumping his big nose up and down. Only when the cub was spent and his manhood turned floppy did he relent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, he's all out already.\" The pig joked. Simba was still drenched in sticky pig drool and laying in the mud. Only with great difficulty did he manage to get onto his shaky feet. The pig wasn't impressed one bit and smiled cruelly.</span></div></div>",

He could only watch as the pig walked around and got behind him. \"The most you're is a teeny morsel.\" With that, he wrapped his lips around Simba's tail, and the lion's confidence disappeared as the pig's other attack dawned on him again. Zeus began noisily slurping, pulling Simba back more and more, and the crowd cheered the pig on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again!\" Simba shouted out. In little time, the pig's lips were kissing his butt, but he went further than that. Another slurp lifted Simba's hind legs up, leaving him to try and futilely grip the mud. With another slurp, Simba was pulled up to his waist. At this moment, Zeus decided to give his opponent a little reminder of his previous torment. Simba yelped out when he suddenly felt Zeus' tongue rub along his legs, butt, and groin. Then, Zeus' tongue wrapped around his waistline, and pulled the screaming lion the rest of the way into his cavernous maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba winced again upon being introduced to his horrid breath.

The force wedged his snout between his buttocks and yanked him out of the mud. And yet the pig kept sliding. Soon, Simba felt the wooden fence behind him as he was sandwiched between the two masses. He felt like he was struck between two boulders, one of them being rather smelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba could hear the crowd cheering at Zeus' attack. Zeus, meanwhile, was drinking up the praise and chuckling at how easily he caught the lion with his attack.

The cub felt himself slip into the only place with room to spare. The pig's nasty asscrack greedily accepted the lion into its smelly surroundings. The huge blubbery butt easily engulfed most of the cub. But he still was not done. He kept pushing the little lion deeper and deeper. Simba couldn't put up any fight against the large mass around him, but when he felt a huge warm ring touch against his head he thrashed like his life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weird comments about a 'second mouth' suddenly made complete sense! The huge hog would naturally have a huge butt and more importantly, a pucker so large it could swallow little cubs like him with ease. Zeus put this theory to practice with one final heavy shove. The cub slid forward, his head pushing through the muscular ring of the pig's anus. He felt it immediately when the cub entered and the slimy tunnel clamped down on his head. No words could fully describe the unholy stench that Simba was mired in. The pig's intestine was filled with noxious farts and stinky slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus trotted towards the center of the arena and turned his butt to the crowd. He wasn't just mooning his fans though. Through great willpower he manages to part his asscheeks enough to show everyone the fate of the cub.

With surprising discipline the buttcheeks slam together again, knocking the wind out of the little lion's lungs. His puny breath tickled the pig's insides. With great control he opens up the fleshy ring again, only to push more of the cub in. Progress is slow and he shows it off everytime another small part of lion is pushed into his monstrous butt. The ref had no comment to make. The sheer brutality on display was almost inspiring. Very slowly the lion began to vanish into that second maw of the pig.

The noxious stench made every breath a nightmare and to make matters worse Zeus regularly farted, further contaminating what little air was available. He hit the sides of the stinking tunnel, but stimulating as it was, it did nothing to help him escape his horrifying prison. He could hear every disgusting rumble that came from inside the lengths of the pig's digestive tract.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus knew he had to be patient. If he put some effort into it, his butt could slurp up the remainder of that little lion with ease. But he had to win the match first before he could claim Simba like that. With the biggest and smuggest grin he paraded around the ring, showing the audience the lower half of his prey. The little wiggling legs were hilarious to the crowd, who were beside themselves with laughter. The impatient pig enjoyed the laughter, but he just wanted his win already. The cub's tenacity was adorable, but he knew just how to finish this off. With a heavy snort he began to clench his butthole shut with the cub still stuck in it. No effort was made anymore to pull him inside. This was just the muscular ring versus the little lion's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub felt the change immediately. He wasn't just held down anymore. The stinking passage began to narrow and the tight ring around his waist and chest bore down on him. Did the pig just lie down? Roll over? Was he getting help from outside? Whatever the cause, Simba could not escape the effect. The constricting pucker squeezed his torso, making breathing even harder. The stench already had him feeling lightheaded, this was the last thing he needed. Worse yet, every so often it would bear down on him even harder. The crushing force was so unbelievably strong. He'd fallen prey to large snakes before in the ring in Africa, but those coils seemed pleasant compared to this. He yelled out in pain, but the thick layers of fat on Zeus' butt absorbed all of it. The only thing the pig felt was a bit of a tingle running down his colon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing torment was barely visible to the crowd, but Simba's reaction was crystal clear. The wiggling had been replaced with fierce thrashing and twitching. It was clear the cub wouldn't last much longer in these conditions. Timon and Pumbaa looked in shock, seeing their stalwart guardian defeated by nothing but a pig's ass. The intense resistance soon died down until the cub stopped moving completely. \"Oh, I think he fainted in there.\" Zeus said with a snort. He immediately let out a sigh of relief and calmed himself down. The crushing pressure dissipated and the cub went back to simply being held in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref flew into the ring to call a winner and to check if Zeus hadn't just killed his opponent. \"Alright, let's see...\" he said as he inspected the lower half of the cub sticking out of the pig's hindquarters. There was only one way of finding out. He stuck his feathery hand inside to feel the cub's heartbeat. The pig apologised profusely for the inconvenience, but the bird had been through this before. This wasn't the first victim of Zeus' 'second mouth' and it probably won't be the last either. He knew the lion would probably still be alive in there, but he had to be sure. The faint heartbeat he felt was enough for the ref, who quickly pulled his hand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba is not able to fight anymore! Zeus wins!!\" The crowd cheered a little. Sure, it was nice to see the cub humiliated like this, but alltogether this fight had lasted a minute. They were a little disappointed by the result. Zeus could feel the atmosphere and turned to the audience. \"I'm sorry guys, but this was just so easy... I had expected a little more from the fiercest animal the Savannah has to offer. Maybe the other two could put up more of a fight?\" They looked for Timon and Pumbaa, but those two had already vanished from the scene, possibly out of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promise I'll toy a little with the next lion before shovin him in me butt!\" The crowd laughed and all eyes were on the ref again. \"Moving on. Zeus, you've won this fight, do you want to claim your opponent?\" The pig didn't need to think about it. \"Yes please, he'll be coming with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref nodded in agreement and flew away. Zeus probably had a few minutes before the next fight started. He decided the least he could do for the crowd was to show off what his first plan for the cub was. It hardly came as a surprise to anyone, but they enjoyed watching it all the same. The pulsing pucker began to greedily devour the remainder of the cub, slowly pulling the waist and legs into the blubbery body of the pig. The small cub failed to make even the slightest bulge in the many layers of fat, trapped inside of the pig's colon. The slimy slurping sounds with which the pig's rear pulled in the lion were the stuff of nightmares. With a small victory fart he leaves the ring, his prize firmly secured within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Simba finally wakes up, he finds himself...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba was awoken by the infernal smell lingering in Zeus' colon. He had a nightmare about fighting some oversized pig and being sucked up said pig's ass. He smirked at the weirdness of his dream when it dawned on him. The abhorrent stench, the slimy walls... That was no nightmare. The cub began to panic all over again, the realization hitting home that he'd been pulled completely inside of Zeus. Everything around him moved, the slimy walls churning and the pig itself walking home. The unsteady lion had no frame of reference as to how deep inside the pig he was. No sound from outside could pierce the thick blubbery body, leaving the cub trapped with nothing but the noises of Zeus' body to listen to. The squelching of the slimy walls wrapping tightly around him and loosening up again. The slow thump of a distant heartbeat and the unrelenting bubbling and rumbling of the lengthy digestive tract of the pig. Slowly those rumbles became louder until the floodgates opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, thundering fart violently rushed past Simba, washing him in scents too foul to describe. Zeus stopped to let his rear speak, impressed by the noise he could make. When the gas had passed he instinctively clenched his entire colon. A fart that heavy could push his prized lion out and offer chances at escape. He couldn't have that so soon. The tight squeeze of the pig's colon could put a constrictor to shame, he was that nervous about losing his little toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hot damn you feel good back there. My butt usually isn't this excited to eat someone. I'm going to have so much fun with you.\" He thinks back on the first time he showcased his ravenous rear. The crowd was shocked silent, seeing the little bunny dangling from his rear. The moment the ref called his victory he let everyone see just how hungry it was. The feeling of the small animal sliding into him was a thrill he'd been chasing ever since. And this little cub was performing better than almost all of its previous meals. The panicked squirming was so easily suppressed with a powerful clench, but it felt so good to just let the cub wear himself out in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore farts bubbled up through his colon, each one smelling worse than the last. Simba was amazed he hadn't passed out again from the stench, though that felt more like a curse that a blessing at this point. The only thing that kept buzzing through his mind was what the boar wanted to do with him. He knew better than to think this would be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus was struggling with the same dilemma. The cub in his colon felt good and all, but how else could this little creature be useful to the pig? His first point of order was where to take him? If he dropped Simba in the pig pen the other hogs and sows could have some fun with him. But Zeus didn't feel like sharing his prize with anyone, with perhaps only one exception. He'd been getting intimate with a sow for a few months now. She was the pig of his dreams, everything he could've asked for. Stunningly beautiful for a pig and just as horrifyingly large and fat as him, if not worse. Her name was Hera and tonight he would make love to her with the lion to spice things up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the side of the pig pen was a barn for the extra large pigs like Zeus. They got their own little sections to avoid them accidentally rolling onto the smaller pigs in their sleep and hurting them. The huge pig walked into his area. It was spartan, little more than some hay with an extra large and extra flat stack in a corner that he slept on. But it was all the pig really needed. He'd already arranged the entertainment as he turned himself around and pushed the lion out. From the smelliest pit of hell Simba was released onto the cold hay floor. His eyes hurt from the sudden exposure to light once again. The air in Zeus' pen smelled faintly of pig farts but was downright heavenly. Simba sucked in large lungfulls, happy to be able to breathe somewhat normally for the first time in minutes. But Simba's nightmare had only just begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay runt, here's the deal. You're going to help me mate with the biggest and most beautiful sow on this farm. Her name's Hera and you'll do whatever she asks of you. Are we clear?\" The cub hesitated, to which the pig growled more loudly. \"Are. We. Clear?! I don't want you messing this up, so let's make this a little bit more interesting. If you last the night, then tomorrow you're free to go. Screw this up and you'll be sorry.\" The cub nodded, scared half to death but strangely hopeful. One night couldn't be so hard, though remembering what Zeus had done to him in five minutes of wrestling sent a chill down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Hera show up right away or does Zeus get some private time with Simba first?</span></div></div>",

He saw a sow that looked almost like a mirror image of the pig he just faced. Except, somehow she was even bigger than the pig! She probably had a solid inch and a half over him in terms of radius. She saw Simba, and seemed to lick her lips upon seeing him. Simba audibly gulped at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, what have we here?\" the pig named Hera said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got 'im from a wrestling match,\" Zeus said. \"Ah figured you'd want a little somethin' new t' play with.\" Simba tried to run off, but Zeus snatched up his tail with his mouth.

Suddenly, Simba stopped flailing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeh said you got him wrestlin'?\" she asked. \"How wus he 'n a fight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man, you wouldn't believe how wimpy he wus,\" Zeus laughed.

There was no escape from the pigs now. Hera let Simba go and the cub immediately dashed for the corner furthest away from her. He was trembling in every limb, terrified of what the large sow might do to him. There were no rules in here. She could swallow him whole and no critter would bat an eye. Hera looked at him playfully and hobbled her corpulent form over to the middle of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little cat. Show me your moves. Hit me with your best shot!\" Simba was afraid to get near her and she quickly grew impatient. \"What are you, a lion or a pussy? Hit me or I'll eat you.\" Zeus began to frown at the cub too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba had to dig deep to find his courage, but finally he approached his opponent. He raised his paw and smacked her in the side of the head with all the strength he could muster. To nobody's surprise she barely even flinched. The grumbling anger seemed to fade though, replaced with a gleeful smirk. He was playing along with them, for better or for worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you weren't kiddin, he is wimpy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't lie to you, babe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do with him? Any ideas? How did you beat him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I crammed him right up me butt. Crowd loves that one. You should try somethin else though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose, maybe we can keep him around and train him up to be less wimpy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like work. I also kinda promised him that he could go tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you're such a gentleman.\" The sow giggled. Simba was about ready to barf listening to all this cheesy bullshit. Hera seized on his distraction and lunged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he knew it the cub was in the shadow of the pig's huge body. She'd leapt forward, getting just enough air to soar over her victim before gravity took hold and smashed her back down. In an instant the little lion vanished beneath her flabby form. His tormented screams were muted by the heavy barrier of fat resting atop him, but Hera could feel it. She felt the little body flatten under her chubby rolls, grinding her belly back and forth to smother him even more. For her final trick she began to contort herself weirdly. Zeus knew what she was doing and watched intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overwhelming surface above the cub stretched and warped in weird ways. The thick rolls of fat spread and squished together, producing a disturbing squelching as the ages-old sweat between them was squeezed out. Simba couldn't move at all, forced to simply endure the crazy antics of Hera. Nonetheless he still shivered when a large patch of soggy skin pressed down on him. The stinky, sticky sweat clung to his fur. What followed felt like something straight out of his worst nightmares. The sticky sweat was enough to lift him off the floor and inbetween two of her bulky rolls. She rolled onto her side to show her lover that the cub had vanished. He showered her in compliments and both laughed at Simba's misfortune. Whenever she curled up her body the rolls would squeeze together, crushing him and smearing more sweat into his fur. No longer squashed by her entire body, the cub was able weakly squirm, trapped in Hera's fat. The stench makes him light-headed and by the time he's released...</span></div></div>",

Mashed around in her fatty rolls and drenched in stinking pig sweat. The cub had to fight the urge to gag, but thankfully Hera was there to make him forget all about it. She'd already lined herself up for her next move and quickly informed the lion of her intent. She opened her cavernous maw wide, letting a wave of horrid pig breath wash over him. She licked her chops and moved forward. The cub took a shaky step back but he knew there was nowhere to run in this small pen. Her tongue flew forward, trying to lick him but the lion dodged out of the way. She was not deterred so easily and approached him again, this time opening her maw even wider before craning her neck forward and trying to swallow everything in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to backpedal further, but the reach of her slavering maw caught up with him. Her lips met around his midsection, leaving his butt and legs hanging outside her maw. Inside she set about thoroughly licking and suckling on her prize. She left Simba's lower body dangling outside so Zeus could see the helpless cub flinch and twitch whenever her tongue got rough with him. Wrapping around his neck and squeezing or trying to pry open that cute little muzzle. When the lion started to fight back too much for her taste she would violently swing her head from side to side, thrashing the cub. Zeus looked at the sadistic display with an amorous spark in his eye. This was the sow he fell in love with so long ago and seeing her 'play' with the cub made him feel those same butterflies in his substantial belly. Hera noticed his almost drooling gaze and knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does she involve him in the action?</span></div></div>",

The sow had no interest in biting down, but she needed the little lion out of the way as she tried to speak to her lover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at you, feeling all left out. Come on, there's enough me to go around. Let's show that little brat what love truly feels like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZeus didn't need to be told twice. He happily hoisted his bulk towards his mate and prepared for their little game. Simba was pushed back into his original position. The tightly closed lips of the sow made it impossible to see outside, but the warm breath of the hog was all he needed to quiver like a reed. He knew the mammoth pig was close by and soon he made himself known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge maw opened and Simba saw the first bit of light in a long time. He screamed in terror as the very first thing he saw outside of his saliva-soaked prison was Zeus' quickly approaching open mouth. The two pigs locked lips, sealing the cub completely in their powerful kiss. The cavernous wet hell had doubled in size and neither pig wasted a moment to showcase to the little lion all the ways in which he'd be involved in their romantic antics. Their strong tongues pushed, pulled and threw the cub around. their gullets rumbled menacingly down the back of their throats, a dire warning for any cub who would prove too disobedient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba had little he could do as both pigs had their way with him. They kissed with a fiery commitment to involve the cub in as many team actions as possible. They began to bat the cub back and forth with their slobbery tongue. Soon more intimate actions followed. The cub winced in disgust as the felt the rough, slimy surface drag itself along his buttcrack or past his sheath. Next they began coiling around his body, squeezing him and seeking to get him to open his mouth. The little lion's maw was the grand prize. Without saying a word they agreed that whoever got their tongue down the cub's throat was the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis fight was valiant, but the large pigs simply outlasted him. Finally, when the cub was too tired to fight of the large tongues it was Hera's who found its way in. She immediately pushed it in as far as she could, driving it far down his throat and threatening to suffocate him. Not wishing any major harm on the little lion yet, she withdrew just as quickly, leaving the cub gasping for air. Not even the foul stench in the cavernous maw could stop him from sucking down as much oxygen as possible. Finally their lips parted and the bruised cub was allowed to flop on to the floor in a puddle of pig drool. Hera looked down at him with disdain, but Zeus had all but stopped paying attention to the cub. His focus was on the sow of his dreams. When she looked him in the eye it was clear to the both of them that there was no other way. It was time to make some epic love. What role will Simba play in this?</span></div></div>",

What kind of predators would this farm setting even have? He'd seen some cats earlier, but those were smaller than him even when fully grown. Maybe it was a dog? Those looked pretty scary, or at least some of them did. A bigger question popped into his mind. Where was his opponent? Nobody in the crowd seemed worried. Was his opponent so small he couldn't see it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a bunny charges into the arena. The thick slop quickly catches him and within a few hops he's hopelessly stuck. This was the Monstrous Maw? Simba felt like he was being tricked by the announcer. Slowly walking after the fleeing bunny was a creature he'd seen on the farm already. It looked slow and dull-witted. The cub was reminded of the wildebeest at home, but lacking the horns and coated in a bright black and white fur coat. The crowd erupted in applause. Was this slovenly beast his adversary? The bunny seemed to believe so, as it started loudly begging for his life. \"No, Betty, don't! Please, I beg you don't eat me! Noooooo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow resolutely ignored the little critter's pleading and opened her maw wide. Simba was horrified at the spectacle unfolding. Betty's large tongue tasted the bunny before wrapping around his midsection and hoisting him out of the mud. With ease she pulled her prey into her large maw and stood tall. A loud gulp sealed the deal as a squirming bulge traveled down her neck. What kind of psychotic horror show did Timon sign him up for. The crowd was on their feet, cheering at full volume for the show Betty was giving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the cow began to heave, a distinct bulge rising up her neck again. With a loud cough she spat out the bunny again. His fear for the cow seemed to have evaporated. He stood on his hind legs and took a bow. The bunny patted the cow on the snout and hopped out of the ring. Betty stepped forward, her large frame completely unimpeded by the mud. With heavy steps she hoofed it to her corner. Simba begins to realize the bunny was all part of her entrance. It sure as hell left an impression on him. Was this cow going to do the same to him, minus the releasing? With trembling limbs he looked to his opponent. Her size alone would make defeating Betty damn near impossible. Her head was practically the size of his whole body and her own large mass could match a wildebeest and then some. Whatever she was eating, she ate a lot of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer spoke to the two wrestlers directly. \"Alright you two, the rules are simple. No blood, No eating your opponents and winner gets to claim the loser! Now get ready!\" No eating, well that was a relief. But what did he mean by claiming the loser? Simba wasn't given any more time for questions. A loud horn signaled the start of the fight.</span></div></div>",

The little lion feels his body get pulled free from the thick mud, dangling from the cow's lips. He thrashes and swings his body around but the lethargic movements of his tormentor were unaffected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smiling cow stood tall facing the crowd, showing them the trapped cub. They knew what this cow was capable of and held their applause in baited breath. She rolled her large eyes, knowing what she was expected to do. But the struggling cub was so much fun to play with. Maybe she could entertain the crowd a little like that. Her domination of the lion was a certainty already. She had every advantage and soon the little opponent would be too dizzy to react. He felt her large head rear into motion. She swayed it to the left, then the right. Faster and faster the evil cow shook her head, tossing the cub's body back and forth. Simba felt a little queasy, but the constricting tongue left little room for anything other than panicked gasping. She violently thrashed the cub around, earning her the much-beloved applause she sought after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the cow was done Simba hung limply bar for a few twitches. He'd learned not to fight her lest she shakes him up again. Betty is pleased to see Simba knows who's in charge in this fight. Now the dominant cow had a lion to break in.

He knew she couldn't swallow him, but he knew she could do a lot to him in this position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, the ground underneath him began to shift as her tongue stirred.

The cub was practically swimming in its undulating grasp, waves of cow slobber washing over him. The flexible tongue licked every part of the tasty lion.

Her tongue kept getting ever more aggressive, shoving him around. Eventually it wrapped itself around the little lion and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba yelped in shock. The cow's agile tongue was crushing him like a powerful snake. How did she even do this? More importantly, with her tongue all around him, how would he get out of this position, let alone defeat her. So far he'd spent most of the match either stuck in the mud or stuck in her maw. His uncommon flavour was intoxicating. Betty knew she had to do everything in her considerable power to win this. Many an idea sprung to mind on what to do once she'd claimed her prize. But as she was getting carried away with her fantasies the tongue loosened. The cub didn't know why she relented, but he took the opportunity and dashed forward. He shot past her slobbery lips and fell flat into the mud. The fresh air was welcome, but he had to face the facts. He was seconds from being slurped back in and tormented again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow, annoyed that her inattentiveness had cost her a tasty lion, was looking to spice this fight up.

Surrender.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill shaken from his adventures inside her maw, the cub didn't hear what the cow said. He looks up to her and offers a shaking \"What?\" His dazed state annoys Betty to no end. She wanted him to give up so she could start putting all her delightful ideas into motion. Fine, if he wasn't going to play ball, she'd make sure he'd be too flattened to keep fighting. With an angry huff she turned around, further confusing the cub. He was left staring at her ass, hovering high above him on a pair of strong hind legs. Whatever she had in mind, the cub knew sitting around and letting her do it would not be good for his chances in this farce of a fight. He trudges through the thick mud, away from the cow, but he was far too slow. He didn't even notice her sliding those hind legs forward, letting that distant butt crash down with meteoric speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt smashed into the mud with a great big splat, showering half the audience with the sloppy dirt. They burst into applause. Less so because of their sudden mud bath but more because they saw and heard the lion. He howled in pain, buried up to his neck beneath that vast butt. Betty grimaced too. Slamming herself down on the ground like that stung a little. But listening to the squashed lion's agony made it so very worth it. If he wouldn't surrender to her she'd mash him into submission. The cruel cow began to shuffle back and forth, grinding her overwhelming weight on the cub. Her thoughts turned to fantasies once again. Maybe she could play with him a little using her backside. Squeeze him into her buttcrack or cram him into her pucker. No, something that tasty could only go into her through the front door, where she could savour that taste again. Maybe she could give him the full tour of her insides. He'd probably survive that, right? The cow was shaken out of it by the loud voice of the ref. Simba had stopped screaming and looked about ready to die under her. She quickly got up, freeing the cub from his heavy prison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was alive, but couldn't even muster the strength to stand on his legs anymore. It was clear as day that this fight was over. The ref quickly flew in to make things official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba cannot fight any further. Your winner is Betty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub wanted to protest, but he couldn't kid himself. He wasn't even able to stand. This fight had been a complete joke from the start and the punchline was her being allowed to claim him now. Hearing her moan whenever her tongue was wrapped around his body told him enough about what would happen next. He didn't even hear the ref ask her if she wanted to claim him as her prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes please. I claim this tasty morsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she'd carry off her prey in her maw and wait until she's at least out of the ring, but the temptation was just too high. She looks at the crowd and asks with her sweetest voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I swallow him here?\" The first members of the crowd were ready to leave but they froze upon hearing that question. Looks like this fight might get an encore. Their response is every bit as unsurprising as she'd expected.</span></div></div>",

The fight was over, the cub was hers to do with as she pleased. Normally she'd have the decorum to at least wait until she's out of his ring. But with such an exotic guest fighter he couldn't blame the cow for not wanting to wait. He flew into the barn to set up tomorrow's fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetty was alone with Simba, who still couldn't even manage to stand up. She licked her chops in an exaggerated fashion, spooking the cub with the loud slurping and licking noises. They both knew this couldn't go any other way, but she was adamant in milking this moment for all it's worth. Her maw was drooling like crazy, leaving a trail behind as she leaned down to inspect her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion grunted, tapping into whatever strength was still left in him. Suddenly he felt himself get on his feet. Unfortunately it was all too clear where this sudden surge of power came from, as he felt the moist tongue under his belly lifting him up. It wrapped all the way around his midsection, savouring the taste of his bruised body. The subtle hint of cow butt added to his flavour. Her tongue withdrew and he flopped right back down again. Betty could not contain herself any longer. The looming maw opened wide and descended on the cub's hindquarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took his hind legs and most of his lower body into her large mouth in one go. Her tongue coiled itself around his legs and she lifted the cub for all to see. With practiced patience she pulled him inside, loudly slurping as he slipped past those slobbering lips millimeter by millimeter. She was working her hardest to draw out the moment. He barely had it in him to struggle and scream, but when the probing tongue slipped past his butthole adrenaline began to rush through him. Betty saw the cub liven up when she did that and she knew how to get a show out of him. Her tongue returned, this time probing inside a little. It was enough for him to start fighting for his life, hurling abuse and trying to swat at the huge bovine's head. None of it did anything as she suckled unabated, pulling him into her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cub in her maw she played around with him some more. Simba was drenched in cow slobber and thrown around the inside of her mouth. Her strong tongue kept him in check at all times. But the cow had waited long enough to do this. With a playful flick of the tongue he was pushed further back than ever before. Her gullet was hungering for him, opening a little to showcase the dark abyss with his name on it. The lion fought for his life but another push put his lower half firmly in the tight grip of Betty's throat. She parted her jaws wide to show the cub's predicament to the audience. They applauded wildly, finding ways to increase the volume with every little gulp sucking more of the cub down her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of him in her gullet the cow could not hold herself back. Her instincts took over and a loud gulp made the lion disappear with a last terrified scream. The crowd got on their feet and gave her a standing ovation whilst the cub was reduced to a weakly squirming bulge traveling down her neck. It quickly entered her body, leaving no visible impression of her meal. With tears of joy she stood before the elated crowd, happy to have given such an amazing performance in the ring and even happier to be able to conclude it like this. When the applause finally simmered down she thanked everyone for coming to the show and walked to the barn she lived in.</span></div></div>",

The strong grasp of Betty's gullet overpowering him and one final gulp sending him to his doom. The passage around him was unbelievably cramped, squeezing him along the slimy length with some difficulty. Gradually it widened until he slipped past a narrow sphincter into a pool of mush. It smelled atrocious and he screamed loudly inside the spacious chamber of Betty's stomach. The cow was well on her way to her barn when she noticed the cub's protests. With a dismissive tone she chided the little lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet down you. I can't digest you in there. I'm a herbivore, I eat plants and grass and stuff.\" Simba had a hard time believing the cow. She was much too fond of his taste for her to no be eating meat. \"I mean, maybe if I leave you in there for days but otherwise you'll be just fine. And you better learn to live with that fact because you're not coming out until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConflict beset his little lion mind. She was going to keep him in this sweltering pit of gunk for a whole night? That was horrid, far beneath his princely stature. But what was that about coming out? Was he going to avoid death by cow belly? Many questions swarmed him, but the cow was silent. Perhaps a subtle hint that she wanted to sleep and the cub was keeping her awake with his incessant babbling. Betty was contemplating coughing up the lion and giving him some painfully heavy cow discipline. But before she got any madder, she heard the cub inside her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, good night miss Betty.\" Whatever Simba's plan might be, pretending to be friendly could only help his position. The cow smiled and laid down, preparing herself for the night. Inside of her the cub was shaken about by the sudden change in movement. The thick goop present in the cow's stomach washed over him when she laid on her side. He coughed a little and tried to make the best out of this bad situation. He shoved together the clumps of half-digested grass into a makeshift bed and tried to get some sleep inside the noisy cavern. All around him was the symphony of Betty's body. The dripping of stomach juices, the low thump of her heart and the gentle churning of the stomach itself. The background track to his slow and inevitable demise maybe, but for now he'd be safe from digestion if the cow was to be believed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith little other choice the lion settles down and attempts some form of sleep. To his great fortune Betty was a heavy sleeper, nearly unshakable in her position. It afforded Simba the calm he sought to catch a few hours of sleep himself. A real blessing, he thought. The cub knew well that whatever this day held, it probably wouldn't be pleasant. He shuddered at the not insignificant chance the cow might eat him up again at the end of tomorrow, even if just for safekeeping. She felt damn near orgasmic pleasure swallowing him, there's no way she wouldn't try that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Simba awoke to great tumult. Everything was shaking and sloshing around him. He could barely grasp which way was up or down. Loud heaving could be heard and suddenly he was pushed into a familiar sphincter. Slowly he slithered back up along her neck until Bessy finally coughed up the cub, looking triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning little guy. You look good for someone who's been in my belly for hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" He said, unsure of where the cow wanted to go with her statement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an awkwardly silent moment the cub spoke up. \"So, now what? You're just gonna keep eating me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite...\" The cow answered cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Betty have in mind for Simba?</span></div></div>",

I swallow someone up and spit em back out to show what part of me is the most dangerous.\" The cub silently nodded. He had firsthand experience of the horrors that huge maw could inflict. He became a little fearful of what she might ask next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that bunny has been helping me for months now and I think he's earned a vacation. But I still need something or someone to eat before the match starts. That's where you come in. For the next two weeks, I want you to take the bunny's place. You just run away in panic, get stuck in the mud and beg loudly before I swallow you. Do this for me and in two weeks I'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion was not a fan of her idea. Getting swallowed probably daily did not rank high on the list, but he thought for a moment about the alternatives. Betty wasn't just going to let him walk if he refused and whatever plans she had for him in that even likely involved swallowing him too. If he accepted her proposal he could at least gain a tenuous amount of leverage. With the bunny away she would rely on him for her entrance. If she mistreated him outside the ring he could threaten to mess up her entrance. His logic sounded ironclad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that sounds... fair enough I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Duster will be delighted to hear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duster?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bunny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. Out of curiosity, what would've happened if I said no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd eat you. No points for guessing there. Though afterwards I'd probably push you all the way through my digestive system and let you simmer in my rectum for a bit to smell my farts. That or I'd just digest you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub gulped. He didn't want to be known as the lion that met his end in the stomach of a cow of all creatures. One last important question still burned in his mind. He was worried asking it may land him in some trouble, but he couldn't live in uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betty, what are you going to do to me outside of the matches?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cow laughed, making the little lion shudder in fear. She looked down with those big piercing eyes and smiled. Her large tongue probed outward and licked her chops. She leant in extra close until her large muzzle hovered just beside his ear. With a low tone in her voice she whispered ominously:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever I damn well please, my little lion toy.\"</span></div></div>",

Having spent a full night in her digestive tract numbed the terror, but not by much. The cub mostly worried about what might happen after the match. If her idea of fighting is to eat him, what was 'playing' going to be like? He hoped the answer wouldn't involve eating him as well, but the odds of that being the case were not great.

Just run out there into the ring and pretend to get stuck. I'll walk in after you and you plead for your life. I swallow you and a few seconds later I'll spit you out beside the ring. Take a bow to the audience if you want to and enjoy watching the fight. It's not that scary and you already know what being swallowed is going to feel like. Oh, and you better act your little heart out, because if the audience doesn't like it, we're going to practice that act a lot after the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mere suggestion that she would repeatedly swallow him just to practice this stunt sent a shiver down the cub's spine. Sadly acting weak and helpless before the cow wouldn't require a lot of imagination. Even getting stuck in the mud will probably come natural. He heard the ref announce Betty in the ring. It was showtime. As fast as his little legs could carry him the cub bolted into the ring. Predictably he only managed a few steps in the thick mud before he was completely stuck. Already the crowd was cheering, remembering the lion well. Betty casually walked in after him, prompting the cub to begin begging for his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please! Don't eat me miss Betty! I'll do anything, just spare meeeeee...\" The cub's pathetic whining was music to her ears and her open maw loomed over him, allowing him only time to scream in terror as she took most of his body into her mouth. Thunderous applause washed over her as she pulled the cub free from the mud and slurped the remainder of him into her maw. No time for tongue play this time as she hurriedly straightened him out for the money shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GULP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one single action Simba was sent sliding down the thick neck of the cow. The squirming bulge clearly visible before vanishing into her body. With a splash he landed in her stomach, only for the cow to immediately begin heaving him up again. The journey back was a little harder, but Betty had lots of experience with this. Soon daylight washed over the slime-soaked cub, his sodden fur glistening in the sun. The cow had deposited him next to the ring. Remembering what the bunny did, Simba politely took a bow before the audience, who showered him with praise. Were the act a little less utterly revolting, he might like receiving such applause. But the cub knew well they mostly applauded because they loved to see him get swallowed whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently Betty steps into the ring, allowing the cub to wipe some of the spittle and goop from his fur and spectate. Though with her busy performing, now might be a chance to escape. He needed to be completely certain of his success, because if she somehow got her hooves on him again he had no doubt he was in for a one-way trip to her belly. Does Simba risk it and try to escape the farm?</span></div></div>",

He looked somewhat like the wildebeest from the savannah, but far more well-kempt. His dark brown shiny fur glistened in the sunlight, beautifully highlighting the vast amounts of muscle beneath. The only place this bull wasn't looking as muscular was his gut, which sagged and swayed a little with every step. He smiled at the little cub confidently, licking his chops and walking off to his corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting any bull would be a harrowing challenge, but Burt was far from any bull. He was bigger than any other creature the little lion had seen on the farm. He could match the hippos and rhino's at home, perhaps even beat them in size. The ref flew in to start the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, contenders. I want a clean, fair fight!\" Simba looked at the bird incredulously. How was putting him up against the giant bull anywhere near fair? \"That means no eating your opponent.\" The ref continued, staring straight at the cub. Did he think that just because it was a lion, he could somehow eat Burt? Wouldn't that be a show, the cub thought sarcastically. Unfortunately, it was more likely for the bull to eat him. Burt stared at his victim with a lustful glare, further unnerving the cub. \"Alright, fighters ready?\" The bull nodded and the ref never even bothered to check on the lion. He gave the start sign and flew out of the ring before the fireworks could commence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt chuckled loudly, casually walking towards the cub. \"I don't know who signed you up for this, but I'd love to shake their hand for lettin me have a bit of fun in the ring.\" Simba stared daggers at Timon, who began to grasp to extend to which the ref had bamboozled him. The bull noticed the strange critter alongside the ring and called out to him. \"Was it you? Thanks, little guy. I promise I'll keep your friend in one piece.\" Turning his attention back to the cub, the bull hovered his head just above him and whispered: \"One very flat piece.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant bull nudged the cub down into the mud, his big wet nose easily overwhelming the little lion. The towering bull stood before him and the thick mud left no escape. Simba tried in vain to free himself, but was too slow to stop the bull's next move.</span></div></div>",

Simba wrenched upwards, his head peaking up above the mud. He noticed Burt's thighs on either side of his head, as the bull was sitting behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get off of me!\" Simba demanded, struggling against his weight.

His tail crawled underneath Simba, and the tip tickled Simba's stomach. At that, Simba's legs tensed up, suddenly too overpowered to try and free himself from Burt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you only get to come up when I say you can,\" Burt said, rubbing his butt side to side on top of Simba.

He scoffs at the dirty fur, but when he looks to see his victim he is in for a surprise. The large crater in the mud houses no lions, just a small hole where the cub used to be. Did Simba really manage to recover so swiftly? The bull quietly hopes so, as it would allow him to keep going much longer than he had thought possible before. Suddenly he feels a strange itch on his butt and everything falls into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How you doin back there, twerp? Couldn't get enough of my ass? Can't blame ya, it's a thing of beauty. I'd tell ya to take a close look, but I don't think you can get any closer.\" The crowd laughed as the bull taunted his victim. \"Tell ya what, if you can get yourself off my butt, I'll let you have a little breather. But if you take too long, I'll give you a hand. By which I mean I'll scrape you off on one of the turnbuckles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub didn't need to think twice. He began to wiggle vigorously, trying to free a limb. But the huge butt had smothered him ferociously. Several tons of weight had pressed him into the dirty fur so tightly even the wiggling was a heroic effort. He kept working at it but by the time the cub had freed a single paw Burt's patience had run out. Slowly the bull stepped back, closing in on the solid wooden post in the corner of the ring. The little lion was so preoccupied with freeing himself he only noticed the impending squashing at the very last second, letting out a surprised yelp before getting smooshed. The bull didn't even bother trying to scrape his opponent off. He simply leaned against the coarse wood, crushing the cub with his many tons of bull butt once again. When that grew old, he began to rub up and down, slowly dislodging the lion from his buttcheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt was slack-jawed with relief, finally able to scratch that pesky itch that was his opponent in this fight. His tongue hung out as he felt the lion peel free from his butt. He wasn't helping any by leaning onto Simba, squashing him a little bit. But he had to be a bit careful with the ring. Already he could hear the wooden pole creak. Against someone of his sheer mass it wouldn't last long. One more quick push and he stepped forward, no longer feeling a cub plastered against his buttcheek. He looked behind him and chuckled. The little lion was worn out, lying at the base of the post and panting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fun, wasn't it? But you didn't peel yourself off in time, so no breathers for you.\" Burt said ominously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull leaned in closer, licking his chops again. Something about the cub just had him salivating madly. What would a lion taste like? He answers his question by opening his huge maw and taking Simba's head inside. With a quick flick of his head he throws the cub back to the center of the ring. The little lion lands with a big splash in the mud, already struggling to find his feet. The quick flight had shaken off most of the dizziness from being squashed. Burt turned and approached the cub once more, ready to play again.</span></div></div>",

With a terrifying lick of the lips, the horror of his opponent's next move dawned on Simba. Burt's jaw opened up, and out his long tongue came, hanging tauntingly over Simba's snout. As it hung over him, Burt felt Simba squirm underneath him. He felt his feet kick against his belly, and saw him wriggle, trying to slink away from the organ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt chuckled at this display. Then, he delayed no longer. Simba felt his slick tongue plant itself on his chin, and then drag itself upwards, up his chin, past his lips, up the bridge of his nose, and all the way off the top of his head. As if the muddy punishment from before wasn't enough, the way Burt's tongue dragged up his face made him feel filthy in an almost indescribable way. But, to his misfortune, that was far from the end of it. Burt licked his lips, and delivered a rapid series of licks to Simba's face, the lion squealing and struggling as he's tongue-lashed.

With several tons of weight behind the hooves pinning down his shoulders the cub had no choice but to endure the intense slobbery licking the bull was handing out. With gritted teeth he endured the abuse until the large tongue reached low enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silent gasp emptied the cub's lungs as the tip of the bull's tongue found Simba's sheath. The pushy mass pried inwards a little, managing to just brush by the dormant member tucked inside. The response was immediate. The cub felt himself glow with embarrassment as his dick twitched with excitement. How in the world could it possibly be enjoying this? Burt was busily licking him from head to toe, the stench of bull spit was as overpowering as it was disgusting. What could possibly arouse him about this? The tiny erection did now fail to get a reaction from the bull. He raised a brow, looking at the lion. Another lick further hardened the lion's manhood, causing it to cautiously poke out of the narrow sheath. soon the audience picked up on it too, laughing loudly at the humiliated cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to them, little guy. I'll make you feel real good an' make it all worth it.\" The bull said facetiously. His tongue had picked up the taste of lion dick and he was going to see if the cub could die of embarrassment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bull barely needed to move his massive head to have his lips connect with Simba's erection. The little boner looked puny next to the bull's slobbery tongue. The cub felt those heavy lips press down on his belly, smooching him whilst Burt's tongue wrapped itself around his shaft. He pursed his lips, pulling the rigid lion rod straight up and assaulting it with his tongue. The cub could barely believe what he was feeling. A maelstrom of muscle and spit surrounded his tiny member, feeling truly pathetic inside the bull's cavernous maw. There was enough space in there for all of Simba, but Burt fastidiously made sure only to suckle on the little dick of his nemesis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe temptation certainly existed for the bull to loosen his lips a little and let his maw's powerful suction slurp up most of the lion. But this was about only one thing, using that same maw and nothing else to bring his opponent to a shameful climax. Few adversaries could resist his practiced technique and overwhelming size. The large tongue sensually licked and coiled around the throbbing little mass of the cub. Simba's breathing grew shallow as his erection felt almost painfully hard, ready to burst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurt tried as best he could to taunt the lion. But with his lips pursed not a legible word was produced. Instead it would be his actions that tell the story here it seems. He felt the lion inching closer to the climax too, licking all over the little manhood in his maw. He huffed and snorted, blasting the cub with foul air from his nostrils. With such intense pleasure radiating from his groin, the little lion had blissfully ignored the overpowering stench of the thick coat of bull spit he was buried under. But soon reality would come crashing down on him. With one final gasp the cub bucked, thrusting himself forward and spraying his load into Burt's maw. The bull kept on sucking, seemingly unaware or rigidly committed to suck Simba dry. Whichever it was, the effect was profound. Even mid-climax the cub felt his urges intensify further until finally he had nothing left to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe action was obscured by the mud and the bull's large head, but the crowd could see the relaxed, defeated grimace on Simba. They knew the cub had shot away his dignity, laying beneath the bull panting with exhaustion. He was at Burt's mercy, but for the briefest moment he didn't care. The bull had made him feel so good, he would accept whatever happens next. Burt was all too happy to abuse that.</span></div></div>",

His short brown fur had the odd splotch of white on it and every inch of him looked stronger that all the muscle in the cub's whole body. Though he had two strong hands, his feet were still the same crude hooves one would expect from a bovine, but his legs were thicker to compensate for only having two. His head too still looked much like that of a regular bull. Burt smiled, instantly recognizing his friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Louie, nice you could make it.\" He turned to the cub and enthusiastically explained. \"Louie here might not be as big an' heavy as me, but he makes up for that with a can do attitude and a love for squashing things flat in the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLouie laughed. \"Haha, that's right Burt. But you called me in for this? I can barely fit one hoof on this little squirt.\" He hovered one of those crushing hooves over Simba, the cub helpless to escape his impending doom. Only by the grace of Louie's mercy does he not get stomped flat. The large hoof instead slams down just above his head, sending a wave of pure fear through the cub. He could feel the ring shake from the impact. Had the bull chosen to flatten him, he would've been squished flat as a pancake instantly. Instead he gets to watch as the anthro bull leans down and grabs him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, not five minutes in the ring and this one looks ready to throw in the towel. You need to toughen up, little guy. Don't worry, we'll take good care of you, won't we Burt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes we will, but where to start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckon I got a few ideas...\" Louie said with an ominous smirk, feeling the cub shake with fear.</span></div></div>",

Now he was going to put this cub where he belonged. The mud slowed down the little lion's escape. Burt lowered himself, his belly no longer hanging just above the floor. The pudgy mass was dragged through the mud like a huge fuzzy boat about to run down the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't struggle, let it happen. Give my belly a big hug, little one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba thrashed and pushed himself through the mud as fast as he could. But the sticky goop was exhausting to navigate. Even with the added drag of his belly in the mud, Burt's immense strength easily carried him forward. The crowd had front row seats for the whole spectacle. The first sign of the cub's impending doom was a rapidly building weight on his tail. The heavy belly pushed it deep into the mud, leaving it no wiggleroom and further slowing the lion to a crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge belly advanced on the cub, pinning to into place. Simba's back legs were about to vanish beneath it. With them pinned he was no longer able to push himself forward. He scrabbled away from the looming belly, but he didn't move a hair further from the approaching mass. With a pleased snort the bull felt his belly overwhelm its prey. Only Simba's head remained visible. He shrieked for help one last time before he was pulled under, crushed beneath the unstoppable advance of Burt. The crowd were on their feet, cheering wildly at the ruthless display. The bull felt his victim wiggling beneath the endless expanse of his gut.</span></div></div>",

This was Timon's idea of toughening him up a little? He'd not had the most stellar run of fights at home, but this seemed a bit over the top. Sure, nobody knew him here and that was all fine. But this blistering cold wasn't making him any faster. The slippery snow sure as hell didn't help either. Ahead of the trio an ominous structure loomed. An old derelict hangar stood in the desolate frozen waste. Half of it had collapsed, the other half had been turned into a makeshift stand for the audience. Cheering and shouting echoed from it. They entered through the door and laid eyes on the ring. It was out in the open, a junkyard construction of old parts of the hangar. It looked impressively sturdy, though that only made Simba wonder what animals he was going to face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the corner a large penguin sat with a microphone. The three approached him and Timon arranged a fight. The cub wasn't encouraged when the bird took one look and started laughing. He chatted back and forth a little with the meerkat, nodding eventually. Timon ran to Simba excitedly. \"Good news, champ, I got you a fight. Just get in that ring and show these guys what you're made of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion cautiously stepped into the large ring. The penguin's voice rang loudly overhead. \"Ladies aaand gentlemen! Tonight, we have a challenger from warm, warm Africa. He wants a taste of the cold! I'm sure we can provide him. We have some fine fighters lined up for you. From the Arctic, Antarctic and all the cold corners of the world!\" The crowd was cheering loudly. \"First up tonight, it is...\" The penguin paused for dramatic effect as Simba's opponent stepped into the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho would he fight?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOlaf: A large polar bear notorious for his horrid hygiene.

He sniffed the top of his head, and Simba could feel some of his fur get pulled upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This shrimp's my opponent? I thought I walked into a wrestling ring, not a buffet!\" Olaf said. Simba could ear the crowd watching laugh, and he felt a twinge of fear. This guy just threatened to eat him!

Simba decided to walk to the other corner. The two got into position, and waited for the penguin to start them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight!\" the penguin shouted.

Whoever this was, he or she was already quite well-known and undoubtedly popular. And the cub knew well that you don't get popular in these circles by losing. He was so taken aback by the loudness of the crowd he missed the heavy footsteps coming from around the stands. The raucous shouting and yelling from the audience drowned out the approach of Simba's opponent. When she finally stepped into the ring the little lion's eyes just about popped out of his skull in disbelief. Towering over him was a creature he'd never seen before. Her body was humanoid in nature, but brandished a large finned tail. Most immediately noticable though was her size. Judging by her surroundings, Simba would hazard a guess that he was facing someone about 20 feet tall. Her whole body didn't have a single hair on it, the smooth, glistening skin marked with a stark black and white pattern. She looked extremely intimidating to the puny little cub, who was getting ready to run all the way back to Pride Rock without ever looking back. The huge orca woman looked down at the little lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaw, he's soooo cute!\" The high squeak of her voice took Simba by surprise. Of all the voices he could imagine, that was just about the last thing he expected to hear from this colossal beast. It filled him with a weird sense of relief to hear her squee like this. On the other hand, she had stepped into a fighting ring with him. The number of ways this could end badly was vast and above all Simba had to wonder one thing... How was he going to beat her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani was less troubled. All she had floating around in her head were the different ways she could play with her new toy. It'd been a very long time since her last real fight. Nowadays the ring mostly offered little distractions to break up the day to day life in the cold. She loved the cheering of the crowd whenever she took one of these high and mighty warriors and humiliated them. Her size rendered their strength pointless. Numerous foes had been stomped flat, sat on or even eaten. The more arrogantly they blustered about victory, the better the taste. Now she stared down at the small cat. She'd not seen anything like Simba for a while. The closest she could think of was a snow leopard who she squished flat with two heavy steps. This one looks tiny enough to finish with just one. However, There was something inexplicably endearing about just how outmatched her opponent was. If he could play along well enough and prove he was fierce enough, she'd lay down and let him 'pin' her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to have fun playing with you.\" Avani announced dryly as the bell rang and the match started.</span></div></div>",

He needed an escape plan before she'd scoot right on top of him. He could try jumping over the legs imprisoning him, but he was getting distracted. Her long legs had muscular thighs. He could see every detail of their immense, toned form under her smooth skin. The heavy thighs came together around a pussy that looked huge enough to swallow him whole. He was so transfixed on the orca's huge body approaching he didn't notice her undoing the leg prison, stretching them out before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you don't know what to do.\" She cooed with that same disturbingly cheery voice. Simba only caught a glimpse of her insincere smirk before she brought her legs together. Those muscular thighs snapped shut around the cub like a huge bear trap. It surprised him that even this part of her body still had thick layers of blubber smothering him. Or was it muscle squeezing him? The painful vice grip on his head made thinking clearly into a real challenge. He felt the overwhelming pressure compress his whole body. Flatter and flatter, squeezing ever harder to keep him in pain and struggling. Avani enjoyed the sensation of having the little lion pressed between her legs. He squirmed and wiggled in so many pathetic and delightful ways. The orca woman had no expectations of the cub, but so far he was proving to be a good toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani shuffled and twisted her thighs to maximize the damage inflicted on the poor soul trapped between them. To keep the crowd entertained she did all manner of humorous and sexy poses. Laughter and whistling filled the arena, though little of it could pierce Simba's fleshy prison. She was a favorite for many who enjoyed watching a wrestler get completely dominated. Pair that with an ingrained dislike for outside fighters and the crowd lost their minds when the orca finally revealed Simba. Almost as flat as a sheet of paper and firmly plastered against one of her big thighs. A helping hand peeled him off and let him flutter onto the floor. He slowly regained his normal shape again, letting Avani bask in the applause. The cub was still uneasy on his feet, but the show had to go on.

What are you?\" Avani asked, holding the terrified cub at eye level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a lion! Put me down!\" Simba shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lion? I've never heard of a lion before. I wonder... what does a lion taste like?\" If he weren't hoisted ten feet in the air, Simba's jaw would hit the floor right about now. The whale slowly brought him closer to her slavering maw. A tongue the size of the cub lolled out, licking Avani's chops. As pointless as it might be, the cub began to struggle. He wasn't sure if it would do anything, but it seemed to get the orca's attention. With the maw getting closer and closer the little lion was surprised with the foul smell of her breath. He was out of options and soon out of time. He did the only thing he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me Miss Avani! I don't want to go to your belly!\" Tears streamed down his eyes as the cub begged for his life. Avani paused, looking at Simba like he'd just lost his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat you? I'm not gonna eat you! That's against the rules! You thought I was going to eat you? I just want a little taste, that's all. Did nobody tell you the rules around here?\" Simba stared daggers at Timon, who smiled awkwardly trying to shrug it off. Avani looked at the dangling cub with pity. \"Oh, you poor thing. You must've been terrified. It's okay, I'll give you the quick version. First rule: no killing your opponent. Hurting's fine, but no killing.\" The whale fiercely shook her head to emphasize her point. \"Rule two: no swallowing your opponent. Matches would get real dull if I just ate everyone that went up against me. Rule three, the winner gets to... actually, let's keep that one a secret for now, much more fun.\" Great, a mystery rule at the end of the match. Simba felt a little at ease, knowing he'd at least not die in the ring. If he got out of this alive enough he'd ask for his next match to be against Timon. His grumbling was interrupted by Avani.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for that taste.\" She stuck out her tongue and dragged the cub along its slimy surface. Orca drool was rubbed into Simba's fur by the rough surface of the tongue. The first lick left him sodden already, the next few just added insult to injury. An almost unreasonable amount of saliva was slathered onto the little lion. With each lick the orca hummed with pleasure. Whatever Simba might taste like to her, it was good. She finished her tasting of the cub by coiling the saliva-ridden appendage around the dangling cub. The whale slurped loudly, taking in as much of the little lion's flavour as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad at all little one...\"</span></div></div>",

The wretched goop was cold and clingy, matting down his fur and assaulting his sense of smell. Already he dreaded the sheer number of showers and baths it was gonna take to smell like himself again. And Avani didn't look anywhere near done playing with him. Her fingers kept painfully pinched around his tail, dangling the cub in freezing air. He was shivering from the cold, amplified by the copious amount of slimy saliva surrounding him. The shaking was so powerful Avani could feel it resonating in her fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you're cold, aren't you. I guess Africa isn't as chilly as down here, is it? Well don't worry, I have just the spot for you!\" Immediately Simba looked her in the eye, dreading to see her mouth open. But she simply smiled at him. \"No, silly, not in my mouth. Down here.\" The cub was so occupied with the thought of the whale possibly eating him he hadn't seen her lower him a little. When her breasts brushed against his back he yelped with surprise. Before long he was perched on the whale's soft globes. Their smooth skin was a little reminiscent of a hippo's skin. The size of them was unreal. No animal he'd ever seen had boasted breasts of this magnitude. Each of the malleable orbs was at least as big as Pumbaa and considerably fatter to boot. The whale leaned back a little with the cub perched on her impressive rack. The crowd cheered and shouted in response. Some even praising the lion for being this lucky. It gave the little guy a much needed morale boost. But Avani wasn't done yet and the cub was about to learn he'd let his guard down by one of the oldest tricks in the book. Distracted by her tits, the little lion had been oblivious to the fact she was still holding on to him. Only when a heavy finger pushed down on Simba's back did the gravity of his mistake dawn on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unsteady surface left him with barely any footing, powerless to resist the whale pushing him over and pressing him against her boobs. Worse yet she pushed him right inbetween the huge orbs. The saliva acted as a lubricant and in a second he had been plunged deep in Avani's impressive bosom. No time was given to protest, beg or even scream in fear. In a instant his world had become the sweltering space between her tits. Overpowering pressure surrounded him, keeping him firmly in place. Simba was going to need outside help to escape this entrapment. To his dismay, the only thing that happened was the orca squeezing her boobs together for a laugh. The cub cried out in pain but none of his wailing escaped the fatty prison of Avani's tits. All she felt was a pleasing struggling that she could intensify by raising the pressure a little. Feeling the lion engulfed by her cetacean body made her feel more powerful then ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about ready to kick things up a notch. So far the audience was pleased, but the cheering and hollering began to dim down. Avani could sit and just experience the feeling of Simba trying to mount a futile escape for hours without growing tired of it. But a show is a show. She'd show everyone the nasty extent to which she will go to humiliate this little lion. With a subtle pop Simba is freed from the large mammaries by the whale. She immediately brought him straight to her...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It felt so nice to stuff you in my tits, let's see where else you can bring pleasure.\" Avani cooed with delight. The cub felt his tail slowly go numb. He was still dangling by it and looking around in fear. What crazy plans did this monstrous whale have for him? Wherever she was taking him, the audience loved it. Their applause grew more thunderous by the second. The disorientation from his sudden release out of her boobs began to fade and things became clear. A strong female musk crept into his nose. The orca woman had leant back even further, nearly lying flat on the mat. The cub finally looked below him and saw the source of both the smell and the applause. Terror gripped his brave little heart as he stared into the fleshy abyss of Avani's pussy. It was fully engorged and looked almost hungry for him. The whale saw him staring in horrified fixation and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've never seen a woman as big as me, have you? Well, hold on tight, because you're about to get real close with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba could yell out no more than a shocked \"Wait!\" before Avani lowered him onto her pussy. The slippery wet lips offered no resistance and the cub slid into her love tunnel almost immediately. The whale moaned in ecstasy, feeling her little toy lion squirm inside of her. Holding on to his tail became a real challenge with the amount of distraction. Simba was lost in a slimy, fleshy maelstrom. From all sides the walls pushed in on him, squeezing him almost painfully. There was no air at all in the slippery tunnel. He was reliant completely on Avani pulling him out every few seconds for a deep breath. Whenever she did the shock of the cold air outside was amplified by the slime in his fur. It stood in stark contrast to the sweltering heat inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa watched from the sidelines as their strong protector had been reduced to a sex toy and publicly humiliated. They saw him thrash and struggle every time he was pulled out of Avani's slimy cavern. The warthog was concerned for his friend whilst Timon was already thinking about which venue they could visit next, since nobody was going to take them seriously here after this fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani wasn't burdened by any thoughts besides the waves of unmitigated joy she felt every time she plunged the cub into herself. She rarely faced opponents his size, so a little bit of sexy play was something she almost never got to do on stage. Her earthshaking climax was building deep inside of her and release was close. She kept moaning and dunking the cub into her wet passage. Her inner muscles grabbed him so enthusiastically it felt like her pussy was actively try to suck the cub deeper into her body. Even soaked in her arousal her grip on his tail remained strong. One more time would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does sexy playtime end?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba's world was a blur. The orca dropped him into her pussy and pulled him out again with increasing speed, making it hard to keep track of anything. Every hair on his body had been soaked ten times over in her slimy arousal. Still she kept going, a moan echoing through her body. Inside the warm and wet tunnel he can do nothing but let the whale toy with him, squeezing him with her inner walls. Were it not for her holding on to his tail, he had no doubt he would've been lost to her depths already. Avani suddenly stops, holding the cub above her pussy again. He was dripping with her warm feminine juices and nearly completely motionless. His fight had been worn down to feeble wiggling in her fingers. She could feel her climax approaching. It was time for the finale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathes heavily, uttering one last phrase between gasps. \"One... more... time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was ready to be plunged inside the disgusting slimy depths again but instead the whale opted to let go of his tail. He lands snugly between her labia but doesn't slip inside just yet. What was Avani doing? The answer soon revealed itself when two large fingers pushed down on his rear. She wanted him in feet first this time. The little lion was helpless to defend himself, shuddering as he felt her love tunnel take hold of him again. Everything below his midsection was pushed in before the whale pulled away her hand and braced herself. The cub was stuck halfway in the orca's large pussy, but this time he had no lifelines. Not even the slightest effort was made to ensure he didn't vanish into her hungry womanhood. When it began to pull him inside Simba panicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani was so close she could practically taste it. The heavy scent of her arousal washed over everyone in the arena, making a few men in the stands awkwardly having to hide their own tentpoles. With every wave of pleasure her snatch pulled in a little more of her toy. It would take all of her willpower not to fully swallow him right now. She barely noticed his increasingly desperate pleas, too lost in the brilliant sensation of his little body wiggling inside of her. The ref paid close attention as the cub sank up to his neck into Avani. Finally a bellowing moan echoed across the arctic wastes. A surge of slimy excitement washed over the cub, pushing him out a little. He was still firmly stuck inside of the orca, but at least he had some breathing room again. With a loud thud she let herself drop down on the arena floor. A big smile grew on her face and she called out to the judge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I need a count.\" She reminded him. Both her shoulders were on the floor. If she didn't get up in ten seconds she would lose. But Avani was basking in the afterglow of a downright stellar orgasm. The little lion had earned victory here today. The audience knew this could happen, but after the erotic display none of them grumbled too much about it. Avani treated the fights more like a game anyway, since her enormous size tended to make any fight horribly onesided. The ref counted her down and finally declared Simba victorious. The cub was still stuck in Avani's pussy from the midsection down, but that didn't stop the ref from grabbing one of his tired arms and raising it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen! Your winner, Simba!\" Mild cheering came from the stands, the crowd begrudgingly agreeing that the cub had been entertaining enough as a toy to Avani. The ref then turned to Simba. \"As the rules state, the winner may claim the loser!\" What? Simba couldn't believe his ears. That was the rule Avani kept secret? If she hadn't thrown the match he'd be her special little lion toy now. Timon was going to have a lot to answer for. But wait, did that mean he could now claim this huge whale as his own? He saw her look at him expectantly. First things first though, getting out of her love tunnel. After a moment of deliberation Simba told the ref:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I claim her for however long it takes her to get me out of here.\" The crowd burst into laughter. Avani too was so busy laughing she didn't notice her pussy beginning to pull him in again. Before it could make too much progress she fished the cub out. His whole body was drenched in her release. She offered to bathe him with her tongue but Simba had seen enough of that thing for a while. It took some insisting from the whale before he sighed and relented. With a happy squee she picked him up and dropped him in her mouth. In seconds her large tongue had the cub clean of whale arousal. She gently picked him out of her maw and set him on the ground again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe match is over, what happens now?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba stumbled out of the arena, bruised from head to toe by the whale's playing around. The crowd was quickly thinning out. He and Avani were the last fight of the day and everyone headed back to their homes. Only a small handful lingered around, among which Timon and Pumbaa. The cub had some choice words for his 'friends', who were waiting just outside the arena. Before he said anything he noticed a large, looming shadow around him. Simba looked around and saw Avani awkwardly smiling at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cborange\">\"What do you want?\"</span> The cub asked, annoyed that the whale did not leave him alone. She feigned ignorance and put her brightest smile on.<b><span class=\"clblue\"> \"Oh come now, you won the fight. I'm yours.\"</span></b> Simba rolled his eyes, not buying the whale's story for a minute. <span class=\"cborange\">\"You mean to say that you now have to obey me? I don't remember that being part of the rules. Why would you listen to me anyway? You let me win.\"</span> That seemed to upset her a little and she angrily huffed, glaring at the little lion. <b><span class=\"clblue\">\"I didn't just let you win. You put in a lot of effort with a little guidance from me. I haven't felt anything that good in months. Don't sell yourself short, little lion. You make a good toy.\"</span></b> The cub was a little frightened. First at her anger, second at her continuing to reference to him as a toy. <span class=\"cborange\">\"Is that really why you're following me? So you can play with me some more?\"</span> he asked, looking at her with eyes full of sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani didn't quite know how to react to that. With a big sigh she sat down. <b><span class=\"clblue\">\"Maybe a little... but only games that you want to play. Was there nothing back there you could enjoy? Even just a teensy bit?\"</span></b> The cub blushed brightly. Though most of it was a strange blur, he couldn't deny feeling his loins burn a little when he was inside that enormous pussy. Then again, an environment that sated with her feminine scent might have some influence on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly an evil thought popped into his head. Maybe this playful whale could help him get even with Timon for neglecting to tell him the rules. Had he known that she could've claimed him as her toy the cub would have never agreed to fight her. Not to mention all those rules about killing and eating. The little lion had feared for his life in the whale's grasp. It would've been real nice to know that she wasn't just going to gobble him up. He looks at Timon and back at Avani. The cub motions for her to come closer. She responds by extending a hand to hold him close to her head. <span class=\"cborange\">\"Listen, I don't really feel like playing after all that happened in the ring. But my friend Timon, that's a different story.\"</span> Avani raised an eyebrow, curious to hear where the little lion in her hand was going with this. <span class=\"cborange\">\"He's the one that didn't tell me about the rules and honestly I think he's due a little punishment for that. You get to play and he gets what he deserves. Everyone's happy.\"</span> The whale woman nodded and smiled. The cub whispered a suggestion in her ear and Avani nodded, carefully setting him back down on the floor. She stood up and walked towards the pair. In just a few big steps she was looming over the meerkat, who looked up at her inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"What do you want, lady?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clblue\">\"I just want to play with you a little. Your lion friend told me you would love to play with me.\"</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\"Simba? Wait? Wh...\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meerkat didn't get to utter another word as Avani's strong hands wrapped around him. Pumbaa looked surprised at the spectacle unfolding. <span class=\"cbrown\">Why didn't you tell me you wanted to play with her? I'll give you some time.</span> the warthog said before trotting away. Timon wanted to yell out to his friend to help him, but the orca's strong grip prevented every action. She lowered him to a familiar place and pressed his legs between her pussylips. The warm moisture immediately caused the meerkat caught in her fist to panic. Undeterred she pushes, squeezing half of Timon into her love tunnel. The little meerkat is a lot more narrow than the cub. But his fidgeting and squirming more than make up for it. Quickly Avani begins to moan again, reliving the feeling of Simba stuck in her snatch. Timon felt more and more of his body get enveloped by the wet passage. It greedily tugged on his legs, seeking to swallow him completely. The powerful waves of pleasure wracking the whale surged through him in a wave of pleasure. Slowly, Simba approached the scene. With a certain amount of petty satisfaction he yelled out to the meerkat. <span class=\"cborange\">\"I bet you're regretting sending me in without telling me anything now! Serves you right!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whale was nearly cross-eyed with pleasure. She had difficulty keeping her balance with her hips bucking forward, trying to swallow Timon whole. She kept a firm hold on him, but the teasing only served to arouse her more. She stumbles around, managing to stay on her feet for now. Simba quickly realized he'd gotten way too close to all of this. In his efforts to spite Timon he hadn't noticed how close to her he'd gotten. One of the random stumbles put a foot directly on top of Simba. Avani instantly squashed him flat under her large foot. She was so lost in the pleasures of having a meerkat in her pussy that she completely missed the flattening of the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his whole body being smothered under Avani's smelly soles, Simba reflected on his choices and wondered if this was karma for him siccing the whale on Timon.</span></div></div>",

This meerkat may be small and slender, but he was certainly energetic and stubborn! Avani loved every moment of this experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Simba was not as happy with his plan as he expected he would be. Avani's foot remained glued to the floor and she ground down unknowingly on the lion cub. He cursed his prideful desire to get so close and taunt Timon in his punishment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Simba felt a bit of a reprieve. In her near orgasmic state, Avani plopped onto her back, leaving a crate in the snow and ice. While the lion was still stuck to her sole, at least her weight was no longer bearing down on him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Timon, unfortunately, the pressure had only increased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me outta here!\" the meerkat tried to scream, but none of his words made it to daylight, much less to Avani's ears, as they were swallowed up by the mass of flesh that was in the process of chewing up his thin body. Timon lashed out, kicking and punching in frustration. Every swing of his limbs sent new waves of pleasure down Avani's body as he reached pleasure points she didn't even know existed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Timon felt his surroundings grow so tight he was completely unable to squirm or move, though it didn't prevent him from trying. With one final surge, Avani orgasmed over the small creature. This time, unfortunately for the meerkat, his body remained stuck within her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, amazing,\" Avani moaned, enjoying the afterglow of her playtime with Timon. \"Thank you Simba, what do you want me....Simba?\" she asked, looking around confused. Suddenly, her eyes grew wide as she spotted the lion's tail sticking out from the side of her foot. The orca gingerly peeled the cub off of her sole and held him in her palm gently as she sat up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that Simba! Guess I lost my footing a bit,\" she remarked, trying to lighten the mood a bit. She had really taken a liking to the small lion. At first, he was simply a toy. But his willingness to allow her to use his friend to get a second euphoric experience started a deeper connection for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Avani tended to Simba, Timon managed to crawl out of the orca's massive vagina. He fell to the snow in a heap, too exhausted and tired to do any more. Though in his mind, he was directing every curse word he knew at the lion and orca. Unfortunately (yet again) for the meerkat, the snow beneath Avani began to melt just slightly, sending him slipping and sliding until he collided with her fleshy ass and thigh. The orca didn't even notice the impact and mindlessly shifted as she continued to help Simba recover, while Timon found himself buried by Orca flesh, pressed flat against her massive ass. All the while Pumba looked on smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad Timon got to play, he's always so stressed out,\" the warthog thought happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Simba recovered and looked up at Avani in irritation. She smiled back at him, which just caused the cub to grow more annoyed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what's next Simba?\" she asked, hoping to move on from the fact that she had accidentally stepped on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next is we get the heck out of here,\" Simba said, clearly still irritated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw c'mon Simba, I'm sure there's something here that can make you want to stick around...\" she teased, slowing moving the lion toward her vast cleavage. Simba glanced down, but was immediately entranced. Her chest was so far away for the duration of the match he didn't have the opportunity to fully appreciate her breasts. But now, in the shadow of her cleavage, it was all he could focus on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We....well....maybe we could stay for a little longer,\" he said, slowly inching toward the edge of Avani's palm, nearer to her alluring cavernous cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Avani remembered Timon and realized she no longer felt him squirming. She gave the lion a wink. \"Hold that thought,\" she said teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her free hand, she scanned the surface of the ice. Finally focused on finding the meerkat, she felt an unusual sensation beneath her. Smiling, she realized she had found him. Remembering Simba's request from earlier - \"...he's due a little punishment....he gets what he deserves,\" the orca figures that his presence there is just a logical continuation of Timon's punishment. She smiled as she shifted happily in the ice, in no hurry to free the obnoxious, but energetic, creature. Timon just groaned as he felt the pain ratchet up a notch, unable to fight back. Avani moaned at the buzzing sensation he created against her flesh as she focused her attention back on Simba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, my champion,\" she begins seductively, moving the lion back in the shadow of her breasts once again, \"What is your request?\"</span></div></div>",

The soft flesh heaved and sagged with her every breath, entrancing the cub. With a laugh the whale brought him closer. He leapt off her hand and landed squarely between the supple mounds. They moulded themselves around him and offered an endless surface upon which he could play. Without the surroundings of an arena fight Simba could really appreciate the whale's huge assets. He didn't even flinch when Avani pushed his body deeper between her jiggling boobs. He was completely encased in soft, smothering flesh. The smooth whale skin surface pressing against him gently from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the cub on cloud nine and the meerkat squirming under her left asscheek the orca woman turned her attention to Pumbaa. <b><span class=\"clblue\">\"Hello, what's your name?\"</span></b> <span class=\"cbrown\">\"I'm Pumbaa, nice to meet you.\"</span> Avani giggled. She liked his name. But the warthog was looking a bit left out of all the fun. <b><span class=\"clblue\">\"Do you want to play too?\"</span></b> The apprehensive Pumbaa furrowed his brow with concern. He'd seen her dip two of his friends into her vagina. What sort of play was she thinking about with him? It didn't take long for his na\u00efve curiosity to win him over. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Sure miss Avani, I'd love to play!\"</span> The orca woman reached down and carefully picked up the boar. She made sure to lean some extra weight onto the flattened meerkat just to be sure he wasn't getting comfortable with her punishment. Simba barely noticed the whale moving, surrounded by her soft, insulating breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog was a little afraid and nervous of what was to come. Avani opened her hand and smiled. <b><span class=\"clblue\">The boobs are already occupied, so you'll have to wait your turn for those. Down below on the other hand is ready and eager for you. Your friends loved it in there.</span></b> Avani had a hard time keeping a straight face. Not just because she was embellishing their enjoyment a little bit, but mostly because she really wanted to put the warthog in there too. When Pumbaa agreed the whale let out a happy little squeal, lowering him to her nethers quickly. He was a good bit bigger than Simba and almost seemed to chubby to be pleasurable. But her pussy had warmed up already on two victims. time to make it three for three with these curious creatures from far-away places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani pushed Pumbaa's sizeable butt down into her love tunnel first. Despite knowing exactly what she was going to do, the warthog was still taken by surprise. The eerie sensation of a whale's vagina surrounding his entire lower half was uniquely disturbing. Almost without help it suckled and slurped on his body, slowly pulling him deeper. Avani moaned loudly, the warthog's size providing what she was missing from the other two. As fidgety as Timon was, his squirming could not compete with the huge pleasure of feeling herself fill up with the warthog's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clblue\">Squirm... please... just a little... bit...</span></b> She panted loudly. Pumbaa was fine with humoring the whale and wiggled himself around. Her snatch responded immediately, squeezing his body and flooding the inside with warm release. A deafening moan echoed out and the warthog was pushed out. Like a cork on a bottle a wave of feminine joy rushed out of her vagina. The musky scent was powerful enough to pierce the soft confines of Simba's chamber. Even Timon, flat as a pancake beneath her butt, caught wind of the smell. Pumbaa just enjoyed the slimy waterslide and landed in a pool of her pleasure. The release wracked Avani's body so much it shook Simba free. She caught the cub mid-air and, barely seeing straight, dropped him in the puddle next to Pumbaa. She even fished the compressed meerkat out from under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three were sitting in a pool of sticky slime, the warthog completely soaked in it. Avani sat down, spreading her legs. With her dripping pussy still leaking out the last of her release she spoke to the trio. <b><span class=\"clblue\">\"You guys are the most fun I've had in so many years! Can I pleeeeease come with you?! I promise I'll only play with you if you want to play with me.</span></b> All eyes were turned to Simba. With some hesitation in his voice, the cub said: </span></div></div>",

Only Pumba still seems oblivious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...Simba please!\" Timon cries, but the lion cub ignores his friends pleas and easily tosses him back over his shoulder. Timon scrambles in mid air, but can do nothing to change his direction. He sees himself falling toward Avani, with a hungry look in her eye. The orca correctly assumes that look from Simba was permission for her to play, so she prepares to catch Timon...</span></div></div>",

The smooth skin offered little in the way of friction to slow him down and his narrow frame went nearly all the way. Had her aim been just a hair better she'd have felt his head poke into her pucker. No doubt her body would've seized on such an opportunity. Would that be a bit too much 'traveling in the back'? Simba didn't seem to mind. As it was her tiny captive was wedged in deep, no more than an inch away from that twitching hole after hitting his head against her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon can't make heads nor tails from the situation. The oppressive buttcheeks seemed to stretch infinitely, like two squishy walls pinning him down. The only other time he'd felt crushed like this was when he accidentally got caught up in a hug between two hippos. Their smooth bellies a disturbing parallel to the enormous cheeks holding him now. More distressing was the smell. Pumbaa's farts used to be the worst stink on the planet, but Avani was giving him a run for his money. It probably didn't help that he was wedged right on top of the source. It provided a constant stream of odd and disgusting noises and it twitched and pulsed with excitement. He could feel the shivering flesh brush against his back. The meerkat thanked his lucky stars he came to a stop here and not inside the whale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba smiled broadly seeing that annoying meerkat vanish in the ocean of jiggly assfat. Avani smiled back and got up. They set off back home with the cub getting increasingly curious about his new travel partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Avani, have you lived here long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All my life, as far as I can remember. I mean, my memory before the accident is all but gone, but I don't recall ever having been anywhere that wasn't snowy.\" She furrowed her brow, trying to force those old memories, but she knew it was of little use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"the accident?\" Simba asked wide-eyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Many years ago I came across a stranded ship. Looking for food and shelter, I poked around inside and found a strange device. Since it was already nighttime I decided to sleep in the ship. The next day I woke up two times taller and surrounded by my new family. Somehow the device had created about a dozen copies of me. Since then we've hollowed out the ship and now we live in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe we can visit them sometime. I'm sure they'd love to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering the licks and squeezing hugs he'd endured from just one Avani, the prospect of meeting a dozen of them didn't fill the cub with joy. But he also felt a little sad now for his massive companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're just gonna leave them to go with us?\" He asked cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's not a big deal. All of us have been on little field trips like this before. Would've liked to say goodbye before we left, but you're in charge here...\" She sighed a little to further push the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba knew he shouldn't have pried further. He couldn't just force Avani to leave her 'family' behind without even a goodbye. He was more than ready to leave these frozen wastes behind. He already knew he was going to regret it if he agreed. No doubt every single one of those whales wanted a piece of him to smother in love. At least they'd probably not dip him into their pussies like this one had. But if they really were copies of Avani, who knows what they've got in store for him? He grit his teeth and looked the orca straight in the eye.</span></div></div>",

The crowd was on their feet, loudly applauding for this most exotic act. Nobody expected the 'fights' with Avani to be anything other then a showcase of just how puny the other fighters were. But this cub had received the greatest humiliation in many months. Not a chance was given to him. Stomped flat, squashed and used as nothing more than some quick pleasure for the orca. She loudly cleared her throat, demanding the dangling lion's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look so cute when you're helpless. I'll cut you a deal. Surrender now and become mine. Normally I just KO my opponents at this stage, it's honestly not that hard for me.

Is this about that rule you wanted to keep secret?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very clever. You are right. If you lose in this arena, the winner gets to claim you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a way out of this that doesn't involve me becoming your property?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could wrestle me into submission.\" She suggested, her voice dripping with insincerity. The crowd laughed loudly at the suggestion. Avani quickly continues: \"Don't get me wrong, I think we both know you're coming with me. You just get to choose how painful your loss is. I mean, I could sit on you, step on you, squeeze you in my hands, with my tits...\" She kept rattling off suggestions for the cub's demise, none of which sounded very appealing. Finally Simba urged her to stop, sighing deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it, I get it. There's lots of ways you can end our 'fight'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then, little guy. What will it be? Surrender?\" The crowd jeered and booed at the very word. \"Or a heroic fight to the finish!\" The applause returned.

Sit on him! Stick him in your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub gulped. What does he decide? </span></div></div>",

He was still a little ashamed of having to surrender, but the alternative probably wouldn't be any less humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I surrender, I can't beat you.\" He stutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd predictably lost their minds, booing and hissing at the defeated cub. Avani frowned deeply. \"Oh, like any of you heroes would keep fighting in his position!\" They backed down a little, but kept grumbling.

Avani sighed angrily and glared at the ref. The fox was a notorious troublemaker and the ref saw an opportunity here. He nodded suggestively at the orca and looked the other way. With the ref 'distracted' she reached into the stands and plucked the troublesome heckler from his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you're so adamant I squash someone, thanks for volunteering. Simba, wait outside the ring please. And don't go running off on me or I'll carry you home in my mouth instead of my hands.\" The little lion obeyed as the whale squeezed the arctic fox in her hand. She dropped the sputtering pile of fluff on the ground and mercilessly stomped on it. After flattening him underfoot she gave her 'opponent' a moment to recover. She carefully lowered her butt down towards the arctic fox. He could only offer a muffled scream as the huge cheeks enveloped him. The whale grinned maliciously and let out a fart, sealing the fox in with her horrid stench. It didn't take long for him to stop squirming. Avani stood up again, showing the crowd a fox crushed flat and gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pity I can't claim this one too. Oh well, I hope everyone enjoyed the show.\" The crowd needed a moment after seeing one of them get pulled into the ring and thrashed by the whale. Predictably they launched into raucous applause. Avani smiled and walked back to her corner of the ring. She stepped on the fox along the way, ensuring him that was a complete accident.

But instead of anger the whale immediately looked around like a distressed parent. \"Where's he gone? Where's my little lion run off to?\" Simba hadn't gotten far yet. The whale hadn't even spent a minute squashing that heckler flat and there weren't a lot of hiding spots around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orca woman turned to the crowd. \"Can any wolves or other trackers help me find my cub?\" They mumbled a little before a wolf hopped forward. He walked to the corner where Simba was supposed to wait and began to sniff around for unusual scents. It took the experienced nose mere seconds to pick up on the exotic smell of lion. Avani stood up and called out to him. \"Simba, stop playing around, I don't want you to get hurt. You're only making things worse for yourself.\" The cub wasn't going to fall for that. He wanted nothing to do with that horrible woman ever again. Not after the humiliations he'd suffered already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hiding lion couldn't see much outside of his little hidey hole. He'd tucked himself into an old metal container. His limited vision stopped him from seeing the wolf hot on his trail. When he'd reached the container he silently signaled the whale. Avani walked in and peeled the top of the sturdy container open to reveal her little cub. \"There you are! Were you trying to hide from me?\" Simba fiercely shook his head. \"Were you...\" The whale asks again, slowly and threateningly. The cub hesitantly nods. \"That's better. Don't lie to me. Let's go home now, I can't wait to show you around.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large hand reached in and picked up the cub by the scruff of his neck. He was lifted high for all to see. The crowd stood up in rapt attention. Simba didn't quite catch on until he looked down at the enormous gaping maw below him. Her threat to carry him in her mouth was no exaggeration. She carefully planted him on her tongue and sealed him in darkness. The huge tongue curled around the cub and began slathering him in smelly whale slobber. With her little prize safely tucked into her maw Avani set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trek through the frozen wastes was short and she soon arrived at her home. A derelict ship had found it's way here and had cracked open. The large hull offering a great living space for someone of Avani's stature. A large piece of tarp acted to keep the worst of the weather outside. Inside the ship's hull the whale had worked hard to remove most semblance of structure, leaving only the heavy support struts in place whilst effectively hollowing out the ship. It was amazingly spacious, and it needed to be too. When Simba was pushed back out past her lips he caught his first glance of her home. Avani put the drool-ridden lion on her hand and deposited him on the floor before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was dazed and confusing by the constant licking he'd endured along the way. Her tongue was flexible enough to coil around him and squeeze him. Her constricting licks had left him lightheaded as a result. The first thing he noticed were voices. They were not alone in here. He couldn't make out a word they were saying though. He tried to rub the worst of the saliva off his face to open his eyes. What he saw was both amazing and amazingly scary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around him he saw whale women, looking down on him and giggling. Each of them towered over him as tall as Avani. They also shared the same annoying high-pitched voice. \"Oh he's sooo cute!\" \"Can I play with him first?\" \"No I want to play with him!\" A piercing stink reached Simba's nose. Feminine musk washed over him again. He remembered this from his brief career as a sex toy for Avani. Immediately he looked around only to be confronted by the gaping pussy of one of the whale women. She was busily fingering herself, seeming lost in fantasies about the cub. After the others were done cooing over his cute and tiny body Avani spoke up. \"Okay ladies, I won this one, so I get first night. After that it's all up to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was shocked at the sheer size of everything around him. He'd never felt this puny before, sitting in the middle of a circle of giant whale women. \"Who... who are you...\" He stuttered. \"Oh, how rude, we should introduce ourselves. Hi, I'm Avani.\" \"I'm also Avani.\" This gave the lion more questions than answers. They were all called Avani? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story short, we're one crazy family. Used to be just one of me that went scavenging into this here ship for food. Safe to say the 'food' I found had a few side effects. I fell over and when I woke up again I was laying amidst a pile of these girls. Best we can piece together is I split up somehow. But that's not something you got to worry yourself about. You only have to think about tonight and the things we'll do together.\" She added a suggestive wink to fully creep out the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and I wouldn't recommend running away again.\" The others gasped. \"He tried to run away? Naughty little cubs like that must be punished.\" Simba shook with fear when a large hand grabbed him. \"Just don't go hurting him too much, we want this one to last a while.\" The Avani that brought him here picked him up and took him to her private corner of the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you...\"</span></div></div>",

Perhaps some other part of me can use some attention.\" Simba didn't stand a chance against Avani's strong grip and was forced to await her decision in silence. Any attempt to speak up was quickly cut short with a brief squeeze, making the lion peep like a squeak-toy with sudden yelps of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH, I have it. You saw me smush that mean fox with my butt right? That's the punishment for being naughty!\" The cub's heart skipped a beat. Did she really just cheerily tell him she is planning to sit on him? He'd seen those huge buttocks envelop the heckling fox. Simba was in no rush to experience any of that. He struggled more fiercely but another squeeze brought him to heel. His panic was duly noted by his captor. \"Oh, don't you like that? Well, you should've thought of that before you tried to hide away from me! It's scary out here and I was really worried.\" The little lion wasn't sure if she was being sarcastic or not. Could there be something more dangerous than a huge whale woman trying to sit on you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAvani sat down on the floor in her corner of the ship, still holding onto the cub tightly. Her big butt offered a deep thud as it rested on the cold metal. She leant a bit to the side, hoisting one heavy buttcheek up far enough to slot a lion cub under its mass. With a casual throw he was slipped under the immense flabby cheek and before he could even spring to his feet she sat down. In an instant the huge fleshy wall slammed down on Simba, immobilizing him and crushing him flat. He roared in pain, but his noise didn't stand a chance against the massive layer of blubber insulating him from the world. The whale relished feeling the little twitching cub beneath her beautiful butt. His pathetic size and weak struggle were an utter treasure to the domineering orca. Soon merely pressing him flat between a buttcheek and the unmoving floor became boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large mass lifted as Simba was inspected by his captor. \"A little worse for wear, but otherwise a quite impressive resistance to my weight. But don't you worry, I have more than weight down there.\" A large finger swept in and pushed the cub aside, letting him face his next ordeal. Above him was the orca's buttcrack. Much like the smooth cheek from earlier it descended at a staggering pace. This time the flattening didn't come from above. The cub was easily surrounded, sandwiched between her immense cheeks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that feels good little one. I think you just earned yourself a nice night's rest.\" Simba let out a sigh of relief, happy that this torment was over, at least for today. \"... in my butt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words she lied down and swiftly fell asleep. Simba was still wedged between those immense buttcheeks and quickly running out of escape plans.</span></div></div>",

It felt like he was sandwiched between two sleeping hippos that reeked vaguely of fish. Whenever the whale moved the heavy mass sluggishly ground against his fur. He tried to get at least a short nap in, knowing he'd be spending the foreseeable future as a plaything to the whale women in this den. He'll just have to sleep through the crushing weight. A small fart further added to his discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went on he managed to get a few hours of sleep in. He eventually found himself waking up to almost no weight on his body. In her shifting and wiggling his captor had accidentally squeezed him almost completely out of her buttcrack. Only one leg was left trapped between the cheeks. Adrenaline surged through the cub as hope rose up. When she next shuffled her body in her sleep the cub wiggled his leg and slipped free. He slid along the smooth buttcheek onto the ground, trying to make as little noise as possible. He didn't want to wake her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snuck away from the sleeping whale woman and cautiously peeked around. It was silent in the orca den bar some distant snoring and the howling wind outside. If he went out at night he would get lost for sure. Only during the day would escape be possible. For now his only recourse was to enjoy his limited freedom and get some sleep. He'd need it for the long trek through the frozen wastes. He hid himself in a small corner of the large cavernous ship hull, slinking behind a warped metal plate. His eyes grew heavy and almost instantly he enjoyed some rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sleep was rudely interrupted when a large hand wrapped around his body. He shook awake to the concerned stare of Avani. From the corner of his eye he saw the Avani that captured him still fast asleep. This was a different one. Her grip was consirably rougher and so was her temper. He tried to command her to set him down, but a large finger blocked his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, be quiet. You'll wake them. It's a miracle your snoring didn't.\" She whispered. \"You're already in trouble for not being supervised, don't make it worse.\" The little lion looked at the whale with fear in his eyes. \"You're lucky I found you before you tried to run away. You don't want to know what happens to toys that try to escape.\" Simba gulped audible at her suggestion. She looked around and stood up, holding him firmly in her clenched fist. She quickly went to her own corner of the ship and sat down on a makeshift bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I just saved you from a lot of trouble, but I expect something in return.\" She looked at her little lion toy with a troublesome grin. This Avani was feeling very...</span></div></div>",

He could hear things gurgling and broiling beneath him. It didn't sound normal, that he could agree on. With an uncomfortable grimace he looked at the whale. What did she want from him? The answer came when her large hand laid itself on top of him, twisting him around to face her muscular legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wiggle and massage my bowels a little, maybe that'll get them to loosen up.\" Simba knew as little about medicine as the whale, but he was confident it wouldn't work. Nonetheless, if this is all he needed to do to repay her favor he wasn't going to complain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe laid down flat and began to rub the big whale belly. His paws couldn't stretch to cover the whole thing, not even close. But he could hear it having an effect. The rumbling got louder but seemed to be spread more evenly in her guts. Evidently it felt good because the orca sighed in relief. \"Just keep doing that...\" Avani said, feeling ever more relaxed. Perhaps she'd get a good night's sleep after all. Simba wouldn't quite be so fortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PHFFFRT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, he knew how this would go. The vile stench of whale farts quickly reached him and his eyes began to water. It was a stink more foul than he could have ever dreamed of. Nothing he knew could compare. He'd faced gassy opponents before in the ring, but somehow this whale woman had them all beat without even trying. Her hand kept him firmly in place, pinning him against her belly and making the message very clear. \"Keep rubbing, don't mind the farts.\" Avani said to encourage him. She could hear the frantic coughing and felt the struggles. But her mind was entirely occupied by the relief the lion was bringing to her troubled belly. Said relief manifested itself once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PFFFFFBBRRRT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of her efforts to keep the volume down for the other ocra's around, Avani farted ever louder. Each time a new wave of stench washes over the lion he feels like he might just pass out from the sheer horribleness of the stink enveloping him. But he feared she might do worse to him if he disobeyed her. If there was any silver lining to this nightmare it would be that the gurgling beneath him has seized almost entirely. The ongoing string of farts seems to have drained her excess gas. Her belly even felt a little softer now that it wasn't so bloated. Were it not for the hellish stink he wouldn't mind spending the night here, her large hand acting as a warm cover. One last little toot signaled the finish line for the whale. She looked down at the little cub with a pleased grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba wanted to fire back, but speaking would require him to breathe even more of this wretched stink. For now he just held his paws to his nose and prayed the smell would go away soon. Avani was happy with his help and wanted to reward him. Perhaps a nice place to sleep? He'd need his rest for tomorrow he was going to be played with a lot. How does she reward the little lion?</span></div></div>",

She cupped her hands with the lion inside, allowing Simba some freedom of movement. He knew all too well that if he abused that freedom in an ill-conceived escape attempt those hands would be upon him before he could leap out. He was dragged up along the soft bed towards Avani's face. She spoke with a soothing smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you joined us. You're a lot of fun to pl... have around.\" Simba frowned a little. She wanted to say she liked playing with him. The stinging truth that he was little more than a toy in the eyes of these orca women. He hid his scowl and waited for the whale to get to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel a lot better now, so I'll return the favor and let you feel comfortable for a while. At least for the rest of the night. After that all bets are off.\" If she was trying to reassure him, she was doing a poor job of it. She moved her hands down a little, bringing the lion eye to eye with her voluminous chest. The cub gulped a little, unsure of what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you eyeing them and I can't disagree. They're a thing of beauty. Would you like to sleep there? Cuddle in their soft embrace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub stammered out a barely legible response, but it was good enough for the large orca. She brought him in close and pressed him gently against the malleable surface of one of her boobs. Not content to just let him sleep she rubbed him along the smooth surface, letting him squirm a little as her engorged nipple bumped into him. After giving her other boob the same treatment she wedged the exhausted cub between them. Their impressive size allowed her cleavage to all but swallow the little lion, leaving little more that a tiny head poking out from between her jiggling tits. He couldn't deny that his new prison was soft beyond compare. The hefty rack held him in place with a gentle smothering embrace. Avani looked down at the little cub and spoke softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sleep well, little guy. Tomorrow is playtime. Oh, and if you try to escape again you're spending the rest of the night stuffed into my asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba smiled awkwardly, trying not to picture what it would look like to be shoved up a whale's ass. For now he had a rare bit of comfort and he should use it. With a few wiggles he got comfortable and fell asleep. His dreams were filled with happy thoughts and the odd flash of nightmare as he recalled the humiliation he suffered in the ring. The grim visage of a huge pussy swallowing a little cub with an audible gulp like a mouth shakes him awake. Morning had come and he found himself in a peculiar position.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile he felt his legs already dangling down below. It took some time for him to figure out what this all meant, but he puzzled things together fast enough. Avani was already awake and on the move. He'd been left between her large tits to rest up. They jiggled happily around him as Simba began to worry he was going to slip out and fall down. He carefully wiggled his body, sliding down some more and hopefully alerting the whale woman that he was awake. Not a moment too soon a large hand caught his legs, letting him exit the comfortable breasts safely. The sudden brightness blinded him for a moment before things came into vision. A fishy smell filled his nostrils. It wasn't whale stink or sweat, but rather their breakfast. An unreasonably large pile of freshly caught fish sat in the middle of the cavernous room, surrounded by all the Avani's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of them were eagerly digging in, grabbing the fish by the handful and shoveling it into their mouths. Most didn't even bother chewing, ravenously devouring their breakfast. The Avani in charge of Simba sat down and placed him next to the pile. She coerced him to eat some too. The cub sneered a little at the prospect of eating fish, but it was very clear there'd be no other food around here. Reluctantly he ate from the pile, making sure to quickly grab a few fish and keep his distance. These hungry whales would scoop him up with their meal and eat him without a moment's hesitation in his mind. In spite of its size, the heap of fish disappeared quickly into the big bellies surrounding it and with big smiles they all sat back. Simba's current Avani cubsitter spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, who's next in line to have the to... cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrantic murmuring among them led to most Avani's reluctantly agreeing on a candidate. They'd worked the pecking order out already, but one of them was a bit upset that she only got him for half the allotted time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, then you should've kept a better eye on him and not let him wander off like that.\" She huffed and grumbled. The little lion hoped he wouldn't be put in her care again anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, little guy. It's time for me to say goodbye. It was fun looking after you.\" She spoke whilst grabbing the little cub and bringing him to her face. She smooshed him into her soft chest for a moment. \"I hope you'll remember these.\" The whale then lifted him up and pursed her lips. Fishy breath washed over the helpless cub as she closed in for a kiss. Avani was not content to simply peck him on the cheek and leant into her passion. The cub was smothered in love as the heavy black lips pushed him down into the palm of her hand. For a moment he feared the sloppy kiss was going to suck him into her maw. She too nearly felt the lion get slurped inside. It gave her an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it's now your turn to play with him, but can I suggest we have a little fun passing him from me to you?\" The Avani that would soon be in charge of Simba perked up with curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we all line up and pass him from Avani to Avani using only our...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All the Avani's in the room perked up at the sound of that idea. Loudly giggling they agreed, forming a line between Simba's current caretaker and the new one. The sound of them licking their lips in anticipation was sending a shiver down his spine. He was hoisted up towards those thick black lips again to receive another overwhelming kiss. They smothered him in the palm of the orca's hand. But where he'd feared before she might accidentally slurp him in, he felt her actively working towards that goal now. Spurts of suction toyed with his defenseless body, pulling in a paw at first before taking hold of his leg. The playful tongue of Avani lay in wait just beyond the big lips, slathering the captured paws in thick saliva. Another suckle pulled most his lower body into the slobbery maw. The suction was nearly constant, slowly drawing his body past those heavy lips and into the wet hell of her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other Avani's were getting impatient, egging their sister on to get on with it. Finally Simba's caretaker revealed him. Only his head and front paws still stuck out from between her lips, the rest was busy getting assailed by her tongue. All the orca's laughed at his horrified expression as the wet muscle wrapped around his body like a snake. He screamed and begged to be released, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. All it got him was a subtle squeeze from the big lips holding him whilst she kept licking him unabated. The only thing more terrifying than the large tongue was the sight in front of him. His current caretaker had motioned for the next Avani in line to lean closer, her open maw approaching the cub. When it was close enough to obscure the other orcas' view the cub felt one final powerful suckle as he vanished behind those lips completely. Avani immediately followed up by kissing the other whale. Their lips met and soon the lion found himself in an even larger cavern, formed by their mouths joining together in passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis also means a second tongue had entered the game and he soon felt it creeping around him. They co-operated to squeeze and smother the cub, throwing him back and forth through their maws. They might only seek to play, but their overwhelming strength was exhausting to keep up with. Simba felt himself growing weary as they continued their slobbery games. After what felt like an eternity one of the coiling tongues took a firm hold of him and dragged him down. The whales' lips parted and light was allowed in once again. The maw never fully closed, allowing him to see his former caretaker wave goodbye as his wet prison turned to face the next whale in line. Her rapidly approaching lips indicating this little game between two tongues was going to continue for some time. He let out a heavy sigh and braced for impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach new whale along the chain added their own little creepy additions to the game. One crushed him as hard as possible in its constrictin coils, presumably as payback for him escaping her earlier. The next was obsessed with trying to stuff the tip of her large tongue into his maw. After all, it didn't seem fair to her the lion didn't get any kisses whilst they were all smooching like it was going out of style. The orca just before the last had a strange fixation on his sheath, poking and prying to see if his little manhood wanted to play. When that didn't work out it moved its affections to his butt, dragging itself deep between his little cheeks. Finally he was passed along to the last Avani, his new caretaker. She loved his taste already and quickly acquainted herself with his body. Her large tongue slid beneath him and pushed him up, pressing him against the roof of her mouth. A loud, horrifying gulp echoed through the chamber, followed by gasps outside. The maw opened to showcase the cub, a little prank played on the others at his expense. Two cupped hands awaited him as she gently spat him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion barely moved, soaked from head to toe in seven layers of drool. The whales were all smiles but he'd just endured a solid ongoing kiss for minutes on end, passing from one overly affectionate maw to the next. Each cavernous, wet chamber filled with more foul fishy breath and a tongue with no respect for his personal space. He looked up to his new caretaker, exhausted and worn out. His eyes were pleading for mercy. She just smiles quietly and takes him to her room. What does she do with him?</span></div></div>",

He probably realized this fight was going to be a complete joke, so he might as well have a laugh too and rush the big scary monster. She could appreciate the showmanship, but he wasn't going to hit anything above her knees being so small. He would need a little help to make this entertaining. The orca woman leaned down and sat herself in the middle of the ring. She crossed her legs and looked for the cub when she noticed something. The crowd was nearly falling over with laughter. What had happened that was so funny? All she did was sit down... oh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the orca woman felt the little lion wiggling underneath her heavy butt she too realized what had happened. The cub got to her so fast he found himself right beneath her as she sat down. The hefty asscheeks immediately pinned him down. Through nothing short of a miracle he ended up wedged between them. If he had to contend with her full weight all at once she'd probably crush him unconscious in seconds. Less pleasant for him was the smell. Avani unwittingly let out a small fart as she sat, making the cub's stay between her cheeks all the more miserable. With all his strength he slowly tried to fight his way out of the overwhelming and smelly prison. She lended him a hand by parting her asscheeks a little, allowing him to slip out and stumble away from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry little guy, I didn't see you there...\" she said sheepishly as the crowd kept laughing. A large hand descended on the weary cub, grabbing him firmly and bringing him up to Avani's face. She let him stand on her palm and looked at him with concern in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want to play with you, I don't want to hurt you. Are you okay?\" The cub shuddered to think what she might mean with playing, but at least he felt a little safer knowing she wasn't going to brutalize him in front of an audience. The ways in which she could hurt him were numerous, but for now she seemed more interested in just having some fun. Probably for the best, since he couldn't imagine a fight between them to last very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hit me.\" She suggested. \"Hit me with your best shot!\" The cub looked at the whale incredulously as she moved him closer to her face. Deciding it's best to just play along with her crazy plans the cub raises his paw and smacks her as hard as he could on the cheek. It barely felt like a scratch to the orca, but what does she do with it?</span></div></div>",

Simba had the breath knocked out of him as the huge reindeer sat down on top of him, instantly obscuring the lion between her cheeks.

His actions had been easy to justify in his head, but now that he was forced to explain them out loud, he faltered. Simba was a prince, but in retrospect, he hadn\u2019t been acting like it.

Vixen frowned at his tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, then, who taught you how to take care of yourself?\u201d</b></span> She asked, and Simba remained silent. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cAs I thought.

Before Simba could respond, she continued. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cWell, here we are. This is where you\u2019ll be staying for a while.\u201d</b></span> Simba looked around, only to realize how far they had travelled from the arena. He had only been distracted for a few minutes, and it seems the reindeer had somehow travelled dozens of miles! The same thing happened when Timon and Pumbaa were bringing him to this place. Something strange was going on here, but Simba couldn\u2019t quite figure out what. Besides that, the place Vixen seemed to be referring to was a small, cramped cave in the side of a cliff, just a few meters away from the bitter ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat\u2026 is this?\u201d</b></span> Simba asked. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhat lesson is this going to teach me?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cI -- and a few others -- am going to be teaching you how to survive out here, in the cold,\u201d</b></span> Vixen explained. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re out of your element, so you\u2019ll need the help and guidance of others to survive\u2026 which means you\u2019ll need to leave your ego at the door.\u201d</b></span> Simba shivered. Even though it was July, the unrelenting cold of Antarctica was already getting to him. How long was she planning on keeping him here? Did he really need to go through all this just to learn his lesson? <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry about that, right now. You just need to get some rest. I\u2019ll keep you warm,\u201d</b></span> Vixen promised. She set Simba down on the floor of the empty, seemingly desolate cave, letting the exhausted lion find a comfortable spot to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Simba laid down, the huge reindeer curled up all around him, her warm body and thick fur keeping him surprisingly comfy and warm. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cGood night, little lion,\u201d</b></span> she said as she snuggled in around him, letting him use her soft belly like a pillow.

He had never seen anything like this place before. Before now, the pride rock was the biggest thing he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ever seen; but here, huge mountains touched the sky all around him, leaving him in awe of their grandeur. Trees of all shapes and sizes he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never seen before stretched out every horizon, and it seemed almost greener than the jungle was. <span class=\"corange\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow far have we been walking?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.

It was, of course, impossible that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d travelled that distance\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 but Simba certainly didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize any part of this place, so he was definitely outside of Africa, at least.

As they walked towards the entrance, Simba gawked at all the animals that were loitering in the grass around the gazebo. He thought he had seen every animal there was to see back in the pridelands, but there were many here he simply didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize. Were those the other contestants? They looked terrifying! Standing in the strange structure, looking down almost meditatively on the landscape below, was a black-necked crane; a species that looked comfortably similar to a few birds Simba knew back home. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cHello? Madame?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Pumbaa said, proudly pushing Simba forward. <span class=\"cbrown\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a prime contestant here!

There was something Pumbaa and Timon weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t telling him. Eventually, the crane paraded him out in front of all the other animals. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cD\u00c3\u00a0ji\u00c4\u0081, d\u00c3\u00a0ji\u00c4\u0081!

To his surprise, his introduction was met with a chorus of laughter, although the crane seemed unphased. He backed away, intimidated by the crowd, but the crane pushed him forward. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo on, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be shy.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Having recently emerged victorious from the coliseum, Zhulong was lazily twist around in the branches of a dove tree. As the only snake in the coliseum, he had a fearsome reputation for how easily he could immobilize his opponents with his tail, and how sadistic he was with his powerless quarry. He smiled a bit from his perch in his tree, his serpentine dual shafts already half-erect as he reminisced about his matches. Just earlier today he was holding a corsac fox tightly in his coils, thrusting into both of her holes while she moaned helplessly before the audience, before he topped it off by swallowing her whole. It was all in good fun, of course; the two of them were good friends, and he let her out unharmed afterwards, but still, the feeling of power over his opponents was always intoxicating. Even after all that, he was feeling strangely unsatisfied today, like he needed something more. He doubted anyone would challenge him today, though, after a match like that. As if on cue, he heard an unfamiliar voice calling to him from the bottom of the tree. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cSh\u00e9i ji\u00e0o w\u01d2 q\u01d0l\u00e1i?\u201d</b></span> the serpent asked, only to slowly lull his head out of the tree and find himself staring face-to-face with an african lion. That was about the last thing he expected to see today\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat?\u201d</span> the lion asked, uncomprehending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhulong sighed. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cFar from home?\u201d</b></span> the serpent assumed in that same unfamiliar accent, and the lion nodded. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re in the motuo county, little lion. China.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\"><i>\u201cChina?\u201d</i></span> the lion gasped, baffled. Even though the snake was corroborating Timon and Pumbaa\u2019s story, it just didn\u2019t seem possible. He didn\u2019t know much about the world outside of Africa, but he did know that China was supposed to be pretty far away. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHow did I get to <i>China</i>?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nZhulong titled his head, in the closest equivalent to a shrug a serpent can muster, lacking shoulders. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d</b></span> he said, still not fully understand why this tiny lion had decided to bother him, of all people. <span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cIs there something you wanted? A fight?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba stared at him, momentarily confused. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cA <i>fight</i>?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cSorry. I assumed you wanted to be broken in,\u201d</b></span> Zhulong said, seeing his mistake, and lifting his head back into the trees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cWait!\u201d</span> Simba yells, and the snake groans and looks back at him, lazily. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018broken in\u2019?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cYou\u2019re new blood, aren\u2019t you? If you want animals around here to accept you, you have to show what you can do in the coliseum,\u201d</b></span> Zhulong explained, begrudgingly. Simba considers it silently for a few seconds. Compared to all the other animals here, the snake didn\u2019t seem that scary. Back in the pridelands, snakes were a relatively easy form of prey; just had to step on their tails just below the neck, so they couldn\u2019t bite you. How hard could it be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cMaybe\u2026 you could show me to the coliseum\u2026?\u201d</span> Simba asks, and the serpent grimaces. He was about to turn the lion down, but\u2026 he was feeling up for round two. Zhulong prefered female opponents most of the time, but the lion did look small enough to swallow down for a while. Male or female, once they were in his belly, they all felt the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll get you started,\u201d</b></span> Zhulong agreed, sliding down the tree before the little lion. Seeing the huge snake\u2019s full length, Simba was starting to regret his decision, but it was too late now. The coliseum was already being prepped for a...</span></div></div>",

She had been fighting all around Asia for so long, she had more stories than she could ever tell, even if she tried. The calming waters of the hot springs were all that soothed the scars the B\u00e1i H\u01d4 had acquired. She was a tough old feline, though quite bitter and cynical in her age; though she was popular, none of her fans ever dared approach her. Other than the occasional fool who challenged her in the arena in the pursuit of personal glory, nobody ever really talked to the huge tiger, and that was fine by her. She just wanted to be left alone. Ironically, it was because of her experience and lack of empathy that she was so popular in the coliseum. She always knew exactly what would please the crowd the most, and humiliated her opponents without any regard for their safety. Sometimes she'd devour them, or crush them, or smother them... whatever the audience demanded. She didn\u2019t particularly enjoy it, of course, but she had to make a living somehow, and this was the only thing she was really good at. Just as she got comfortable in the hot springs, B\u00e1i H\u01d4 heard another set of small paws entering the water. She grimaced quietly, praying that the visitor wasn\u2019t going to bother her with some inane gibberish. Unfortunately for her, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cUh\u2026 hello?\u201d</span> Simba said, nervously, sitting across the spring from the huge, quiet tiger. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cEverybody says that you know a lot about this place\u2026\u201d</span> The tiger didn\u2019t open her eyes, not yet acknowledging his presence. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cThink you could help me out? I\u2019m a little lost\u2026\u201d</span> Simba laughed nervously, but the tiger remained completely silent. The lion was quiet for a while, unsure of whether B\u00e1i H\u01d4 was simply sleeping or ignoring him, but he grew impatient quickly. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cUh, hey. I\u2019m talking here!\u201d</span> Simba said, a little louder, trying to get her attention as she sat there motionless, hoping he would go away. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cMiss? Can you hear me?\u201d</span> Eventually Simba was certain that the tiger was just completely ignoring. Offended, he started pushing at her side, forcing her to notice him. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cHey! I\u2019m talking to you! Don\u2019t just ignore me!\u201d</span> Eventually, the tiger\u2019s resolve hit its breaking point. Her paw suddenly reached up, and dunked Simba\u2019s head beneath the hot springs with terrifying force. She held him under the hot waters for a long time, until she finally relented, allowing the lion to come up for air just before he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Simba\u2019s head emerged from the water again, he found himself face-to-face with B\u00e1i H\u01d4, who looked frustrated. <b><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhat. Do. You. Want,\u201d</span></b> she said, slowly. Unlike the other animals, this tiger didn\u2019t seem at all phased by the presence of a lion. She must have seen crazier things in her time. Still coughing up water, Simba was equally angry, confused and frightened by the sudden act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou - crazy - bitch...\u201d</span> Simba said, being interrupted intermittently by his coughs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cI just wanted help!\u201d</span> B\u00e1i H\u01d4 stared at him, her expression unreadable. Was this the new blood, she wondered? If so, the bratty little lion was definitely going to be a thorn in her side for as long as he stuck around. She should get rid of him quickly. She hadn\u2019t been in the actual coliseum in a while, and people have been begging her to give them another show; perhaps this was the prime opportunity. After all, once they were in the coliseum, she could do whatever she wanted to him, and she doubted that he could fight back. Just as Simba got his bearings, the tiger grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, hoisting him out of the hot spring as if he was one of her own cubs. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cH-hey! What are you doing?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cTeaching you a lesson,\u201d</span></b> she said, her booming, deep voice almost stunning Simba into silence.

The visitors handed over leaves and scraps of paper for autographs, and Wu Fu took to scribbling as simple a \u00e2\u0080\u0098\u00e4\u00ba\u0094\u00e8\u009d\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0099 she could muster onto every one of them. Her fun-loving nature in the ring presided over her competitiveness, but being an anthro, her dexterity gave her an edge against her opponents. Her ability to fly helped as well, of course; she loved to grab her opponents and lift them high into the air, only letting them come down if they promised to do whatever she wanted. Simba came to her partially because she looked nice, but mostly out of curiosity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d never seen an anthro before. With all the humans gone, anthropomorphic animals were the closest thing they had left. Her bipedal form was strange to the lion, with sylphlike legs and torso dominated by her large breasts, which were prominent on her chest for all to see. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cN\u00c7\u0090 sh\u00c3\u00ac f\u00c4\u009bns\u00c4\u00ab?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> she asked him, while he was distracted staring at her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head, knocking himself out of his stupor. All the other animals had dispersed, satisfied, leaving Wu Fu alone with the lion. <span class=\"corange\">\"W-what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Simba asked, confused. The bat woman giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you a fan?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b> she clarified. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must have come a very long way to get here.

She cradled the small lion gently, holding him comfortably against her soft breasts. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to admit, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen a lot of animals, but you are.

Simba didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really know either way, so he just took the bat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word for it. He was too busy relaxing in the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms to think too much about his situation. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, welcome then! Allow me to show you around!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> She continued holding the lazy, half-asleep lion in her arms as she walked around the coliseum grounds, introducing him to other competitors and pointing out buildings of interest.

How long was he supposed to stay here? He thought he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d only stick around for one match! But before he could ask, she moved on to the main course; the huge stadium that towered over everything else on the mountain. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that right there is the coliseum.

The two of them emerged just in time to see a leopard fighting against a wolf in the middle of the coliseum. Wu Fu sat Simba down on the bench beside her as they watched. Simba had to admit, it was cool to see the two animals fight. Both of them were jumping around, batting eachother with their paws in devastating displays of might. Eventually, though, the two competitors had gotten even more close-quarters, as they grappled with eachother on the ground. In fact, the way they had started wrestling seemed kind of\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 strange. <span class=\"clkhaki\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhoo! Get him, Liling!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> Wu Fu called out, temporarily soothing Simba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns. They both looked like they were trying to overpower the other, but eventually, the leopardess emerged on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopard had the wolf pinned under her, in a very\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 unorthodox hold, it seems. Honestly, it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem like it would be that difficult to push her off, but the wolf didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to be resisting much. Wait\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 what was she doing? On closer inspection, Simba realized that leopard was definitely riding that wolf dick right in front of the cheering crowd. It was hard to make out any details from this distance, but their movements made it clear. The wolf tried half-heartedly to push her off, but even in the heat of battle, he couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help but give in to the pleasure. The audience erupts into giggles and laughter as the wolf leans back and pants, letting the leopard dominate him however she wanted. Simba was horrified by the sudden display, but couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bring himself to look away; he had never seen anything like this before! <span class=\"corange\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat the hell kind of coliseum <i>is</i> this?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span> Simba exclaimed, but his question was drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. After a long while, the leopard finally let out a ear-shattering roar as she climaxed right in the middle of the coliseum floor, before rolling off the unmoving wolf, satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think we have our winner, ladies and gentleman,\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> the crane announced. The leopard paraded around the coliseum, still panting, while basking in the adoration of the crowd, while the wolf lied motionless and defeated, his half-erect shaft hanging in the air, still dripping. He wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t injured; he was simply too exhausted to continue. The rest of the audience seemed unphased by this -- in fact, they loved it! The mood in the crowd seemed jovial, with animals laughing and telling jokes while they watched the incident occurring below. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cChoose your reward, Liling. Claim money, food, shelter\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 or your opponent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> The leopard seemed to consider this for a while, before getting a devious look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"cpblue\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be taking this poor fella here home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b> the leopardess smirked, lifting the wolf up onto her back, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t even bother to resist. Simba watched with horror as the leopard trotted off with the helpless wolf, heading away to do god-knows-what to him. Once she disappeared out of sight, Simba turned back to the crowd, still shivering. Somebody else must have realized how bizarre that was, right? That was practically rape! To his astonishment, everybody else seemed to be acting like this was completely normal. Even Wu Fu, the seemingly normal woman, was amused by the events. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis trip to the coliseum had definitely left Simba with more questions than answers. This place, and all the animals in it, were insane. Simba had to get out of here as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his horror, the crane happened to notice the two of them. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! And what do we have here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b> she smiled. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooks like our newest contestant is eager to fight! A little lion, coming all the way from Africa, just to be here at the coliseum! What dedication, am I right?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b> She rung a loud bell, announcing a new match. <b><span class=\"clgrey\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome on out, little guy. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be shy!\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheered loudly, hoping to coax the lion to come out onto the battlefield. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cUh oh. Looks like Madame Wenqing wants us onstage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d</span></b> Wu Fu frowns, immediately standing up to heed the call. However, Simba lingered behind, terrified at the prospect of entering the coliseum proper. The bat gives him a little smile, bending down and petting him for a while to try and offer some reassurance. <b><span class=\"clkhaki\">\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry, little lion.

The cheering of the audience hurt Simba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ears as he emerged into the coliseum, and he whimpered when he saw dozens of eyes on him, perversely waiting for a \u00e2\u0080\u009cshow\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Wu Fu took her position on one side of the arena, and Simba nervously stood on the opposite side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u00e2\u0080\u009cReady?\u00e2\u0080\u009d</b></span> the announcer called, before ringing the bell once again, presumably to signal the beginning of the battle.

She almost never wins, of course, but she enjoys being humiliated in front of an audience in any way her opponent desires. The coliseum doesn\u2019t have to be so serious all the time, after all!

A female clouded leopard and a male gray wolf sat on the other end of the coliseum, impatiently awaiting their opponents. These two looked tough; he was sure they weren\u2019t going to go easy on him. Simba was starting to have second thoughts, but he couldn\u2019t back out now. It\u2019s not like there was any chance they\u2019d hurt him for real\u2026 right? <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cZh\u01d4nb\u00e8i?\u201d</b></span> The announcer called, which the uncomprehending lion mostly tuned out. <span class=\"clgrey\"><b>\u201cD\u00f2uzh\u0113ng!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle began just about as the lion expected. The two teams stalks around the coliseum, sizing eachother up, each preparing to leap at any moment. Simba tried to follow Ti\u0101n M\u0101o\u2019s lead, figured that she would have more experience; however, the lynx seemed to making several questionable decisions, and appeared more excited about the battle than she probably should be. It was the wolf that made the first move, leaping towards the lion\u2019s companion; the leopard followed soon after, trying to pounce on Simba. Simba just barely rolled out of the way of the huge feline. Simba continued dodging the leopard\u2019s advances, waiting for her to let her guard down. Meanwhile, the lynx grappled with the wolf on the ground, seeming helpless against the much larger canine. She didn\u2019t even seem to be taking this particularly seriously; Simba noticed, out of the corner of his eyes, a smile on her face. Simba was starting to doubt his chances more and more with every passing second. If Ti\u0101n M\u0101o was defeated, would he have to face both animals on his own?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was able to do some damage to the leopard he was facing, but ultimately he found himself pinned to the ground on his back, the larger feline looming over him, amused by his weakness. Overcome by panic, Simba tried futilely to push the leopard off of him with his paws, knowing that at any moment the feline might sink her fangs into his throat. He was distracted from his predicament, however, by the sound of Ti\u0101n M\u0101o\u2019s loud, frantic moaning. He turned his head, seeing the lynx was now lying on her back, the wolf holding her neck with his teeth as he stood over her. Simba gasped as he saw a flash of pink as the wolf drew back, before the canine instantly plunged his shaft back into the helpless lynx as she wriggled under him, panting and gasping as she was dominated by the larger, muscular canine. The audience cheered with unnerving eagerness at the display, while the lion laid there, wondering just what he\u2019d gotten himself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, horrified, to see the leopard blushing with excitement, the smirk on her face showing that she had captured the lion for similarly devious purposes...</span></div></div>",

It was rough after Mufasa was taken away from him, but ever since he met the two, he felt like he was with a whole new family. The relationship worked out both ways, because now not only did SImba have another family, not only did Timon and Pumba have a new buddy with them, but that buddy was a lion, a lion that could protect them from any predators that would otherwise have them on a silver platter. One day, they decided that they needed to let any nearby predator know what kind of creature was protecting them. Conveniently, a group of animals were hosting an animal wrestling tournament for any animal to prove their strength. <br>\r\n\"So, wait, you want me to beat up a bunch of other animals?\" Simba asks Timon as they approach the wrestling arena the animals set up. There are tall trees spread equidistant from each other, and three vines were tied from tree to tree to tree to tree then back to the first one. A crowd of ostriches, zebras, wildebeests, and other native animals surround the arena, waiting to see one opponent destroy the other.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. Animals beat each other up all the time. You doing it wouldn't by any-\" Timon starts while riding on Pumba's snout.<br>\r\n\"No, that's not it! It's just, aren't I a bit small for this?\" Simba interrupts.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that. You're a lion, just follow your instinct and you're sure to get the jump on any chump here. Okay?\"<br>\r\n\"...If you say so.\" Timon's positive Simba's got this in the bag. He's a lion after all, there's no way he'd let himself get flattened by some wrestler nobody. The trio made their way up to the arena, where a vulture stands in wait, waiting for each opponent to show up to fight their appropriate opposite. The vulture looks down at Simba, and snickers.<br>\r\n\"What's so funny?\" <br>\r\n\"Just try not to let the match end to soon, shrimp. The crowd came to see a show,\" the vulture responds, to Simba's confusion. He's saying that because he's a lion and lions could, literally and figuratively, eat anyone here for dinner, right? \"Simba the lion, for this match, you'll be facing...\"</span></div></div>",

The entire crowd watched in complete silence, enraptured by the spectacle on display. One could hear a pin drop in the arena.

The only thing worse than the pressure was the stench. It was clear the elephant had little interest in keeping her butt clean. To top it all off her sputtering asshole produced a steady stream of vile farts. None of them were loud enough to escape the muffling cheeks, but the smell was unlike anything he'd imagined. Sour and pervasive, making the little lion's nostrils burn with distaste. Judging by her relative lack of squirming, the cub figured Shenzi was a whole lot less bothered by it. How she could endure this stench so easily was beyond him. Maybe it was just a hyena thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried to speak up from inside the jiggling prison, but the large mass of fat muffled most of her words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luna... mmmf nm mmpmf mhm in mmsfm... gas hm rmmmf mmhf... just lmmmf mmn hmmf ummhm fmmmf bmmpff hmf farts.\" The elephant was a little puzzled, but figured she knew what to do. Time to unleash the full devastating power her butt held. Shenzi was very surprised to feel the large pucker twitch already. She'd asked Luna to wait and let her shove him in deep. But the elephant wasn't waiting for the hyena. She demonstrated the terrifying potential of her bottom in spectacular fashion. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The two squirming wrestlers between her cheeks gave the elephant a most devious idea. Since Shenzi was so adamant in guiding Simba to the depths of her rear, why not help the hyena a little? She swayed her butt around for all to see, disorienting its passengers. The lion was gripped tightly by the hyena, who in turn squirmed busily to get Luna's attention. But the only attention the enormous backside gave them beyond powerful clenches to keep them in place was a playful little fart. The pair of tawny legs sticking out between the elephant's buttcheeks twitched nervously at the foul stink. The crowd could only guess at the horrors the cub was enduring. They cheered on the elephant and shouted encouragement as she leaned up on her back legs. She was going to drop the hammer and invite her guests inside of her vast body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi was the first to feel her orientation shift. She knew what was about to happen, looking up fearfully to see the elephant's pucker open wide. Not a fart this time, but a disturbing prelude to her next move. She didn't think it possible to hold the squirming lion tighter to her chest, but her fears proved her wrong. Between the hyena's crushing unintentional bearhug and the clenching buttcheeks squashing the both of them the cub could barely breathe. The air was tainted with elephant farts and the fidgeting hyena seemed to get ever more panicky. Simba hadn't caught on yet and when he looked up at the gaping butthole about to descend on him he screamed in fear. The elephant barely heard the muffled noise before executing her plan and dropping her giant rear on the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cheesy smile she yelled out: \"All aboard!\" and let herself fall back onto her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact was heavy enough to shake the ring and the stands. The crowd fell silent at the savage spectacle before them. The enormous buttcheeks were soft and yielding, allowing for the duo to be forced halfway inside that terrifying ass. No longer clenching her cheeks to keep her prisoners pinned, Luna let out a small sigh of relief before turning her rear to the crowd, allowing them to see the fruits of her labor. It took some help from the elephant parting her cheeks to showcase exactly what she had accomplished. Stuck almost up to her waist inside that ravenous pucker was Shenzi, desperately wiggling her legs to get Luna's attention. Below her the keen-eyed members of the crowd could see the puny cub, struggling for his freedom. The hyena already made him look pathetic, but now that both of them were trapped he looked more pathetic than ever before. The pulsating hole began to shift and move, slowly trying to pull its prey in completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref keeps a keen eye on the fight. Luna wasn't allowed to fully insert them and judging by their squirming they were still very awake. The elephant realized she had to act fast before her ravenous rear would get her disqualified. She knew only one way to fix this and immediately plumbed her innermost depths for the foulest gas it had ever produced. It bubbled through her intestines and polluted the already foul air in her rear. Both cub and hyena were forced to endure the hot, putrid stink of digesting grass and so much worse. The pungent fart barely made a noise as it blew past them, making their eyes tear up. The large hyena twitched and fell unconscious, letting Simba rejoice in his first taste of victory. He'd outlasted her in this shared hell, but even he couldn't stand up to the horrid foulness of Luna's rear. Shortly after he too fell prey to the noxious gasses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant felt both of them stop squirming and signaled the ref.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they're both unconscious. They're not moving, but they're still breathing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee flew down and took a good look at her butt. He didn't have any intention to get any closer to that pit of stench. Luna had definitely won this. But who lost? Did the elephant and the hyena beat Simba together? Or did she defeat both the cub and the hyena? The rules of the ring state that the winner is allowed to claim the loser. But who won and who gets to claim who?</span></div></div>",

She knew Shenzi wanted her to show off the power of her ass, and it could certainly deliver a powerful blast when she wanted it to. Luna focused and prepared, she let the muscles of her cheeks relax slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi and Simba heard a gurgling sound from above them and started to panic. The hyena shoved the cub forward, hoping to block the brunt of the blast, but as Luna's anus opened, its sheer size let Shenzi know her attempt was hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna unleashed massively loud and powerful fart that nearly deafened the referee. The force of the blast sent Shenzi flying out, tumbling into the corner of the ring. Unfortunately for the prince, he was positioned too deep and the hyena blocked his exit. As the fart ended, Simba found himself still trapped between the elephant's massive cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow, Shenzi was still conscious as Luna scampered up to her, eager for an evaluation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was that? I have no idea why you'd want me to fart when you were point blank, or why you would go diving in yourself, but....\" Luna started enthusiastically. But Shenzi cut her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why I would WANT THAT?\" the hyena seethed. She then unleashed a stream of curse words not fit for a Disney character to know, directing them at Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was not an elephant that was in a mood to be bullied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem,\" Luna cleared her throat, interrupting Shenzi and cutting off her rant by wrapping the hyena up in her own massive trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're forgetting your place,\" she said sternly. \"<i>You</i> were just deep between <i>my</i> ass. <i>You</i> just got farted out. I'd be very happy to reunite you with your lion friend if you want...\" Luna threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant chuckled as she felt Shenzi shivering in fear within her trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have a better idea,\" she says, throwing the hyena full force back into the corner. </span></div></div>",

The hyena feared the elephant might try to take over her bout, but she didn't expect her to rise to the occasion so quickly. She'd barely made it back on her feet when the immense grey form of Luna's butt hovered over her. With a terrified squeak the hyena made a run for it, but the huge ass came down fast. When she felt the coarse skin brush against her back she knew she had failed to escape. In a split second it was all over for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>BOOM!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ring shook with the heavy butt slam Luna had delivered. She felt the struggling form of the hyena try to break free, but against the huge mass of her backside there was no hope. She had buried Shenzi up to her neck under an avalanche of ass. The slam was so powerful even the little cub felt it. He was shaken loose, shifting a bit further away from the gassy pucker but still thoroughly trapped between those huge cheeks. The elephant could not have aimed her attack better. With Shenzi's face still free she had a front row seat to the hyena's screams of pain and pleas for mercy. She lifted her huge elephantine ass just a little, making breathing merely difficult for the hyena instead of impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, let me go. We're supposed to put that little brat in his place! We should aaaaAAAAH!\" Shenzi was interrupted by the elephant putting her weight back onto her back. When she had screamed all the air out of her lungs, Luna coldly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am putting a little brat in their place, two of them even.\" The crowd hollered and cheered. They didn't care if this was all planned beforehand or just pure happenstance, they loved the drama unfolding in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCruelly the elephant let Shenzi waste a few more lungfuls of air with meaningless pleas before crushing her flat again. The constant shifting of her rear over the struggling hyena caused the cub the be ground between the rough surfaces of her cheeks. Luna almost completely forgot about him and soon enough he began to emerge from his prison. A few more shuffles and he was freed. But the heavy grinding had taken its toll on him, not to mention the monstrous point blank fart from a few minutes ago. He took a few steps, coughing loudly before his wobbling legs gave out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref flew in and commanded the elephant to get off Shenzi. He ordered them both to opposite corners of the ring and attempted to regain some control of the match. He grabbed the cub and held him high for all to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba can no longer fight in this match. He will be the prize for the winner of this bout. On top of the usual rules of course. Wrestlers, prepare yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi was visibly nervous at the prospect of fighting an elephant. Her back still ached from their last scuffle and Luna wasn't going to go easy on her. But with a moment of recovery she could focus all her energy on taking that newbie elephant down a peg. With a vicious scowl she looked at her adversary, still starstruck that this is really happening. She should never have invited that damn Luna into the ring. The hyena huffed at the amount of work she now had to do to get her grimy paws on that little lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell sounded and the two cautiously approached eachother. Luna had the wits not to charge in blindly. She knew her opponent had experience fighting in this ring. She might be up several tonnes of weight, but she couldn't afford to get sloppy. Shenzi, grateful for the moment of calm before the storm, offered the elephant a deal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you take a dive, I'll give you the lion after the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna responded with an icy tone. \"Why should I settle for just one toy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho emerges victorious to claim both the lion and the loser?</span></div></div>",

With her size, strength, and sheer mass, there was no way she could physically beat the elephant. She'd have to out smart her. Get her disqualified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena didn't like the plan that was coming together in her mind, but it was the only thing that seemed to give her a prayer of coming out victorious. Assuming she \"came out\" at all of course. Luna was clearly already very mad, both from Simba's attempted retreat and then from the hyena's own sharp response. If Shenzi could capitalize on that anger, she could get Luna to go a little too far and break the rules of the match. It would get the elephant disqualified and get Shenzi a nice, large new pet to boss around. She'd rule the pack with Luna by her side and at her command!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi swallowed hard.She knew exactly what this meant. But she was in this for the long game. Luna could win the battle, the hyena would have the war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you don't want to take my deal?\" Shenzi hollered at Luna, \"Just remember I was generous when I own you after this is over with,\" she growled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After this is over, you'll see just how generous I am. With my gas,\" Luna retorted with a snarl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued to slowly circle each other. Shenzi had to ramp it up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never should have even offered you the chance to come in the ring. All you do is take up space and muck things up. I'm sure you'll be right at home with me in the graveyard though. Plenty of space for you there with the other deadbeat elephants,\" she snarled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna paused for a moment, \"Graveyard?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my home tubby. I gotta say, you elephants take up a lot less space without all that flesh. No need to worry about turning around and getting accidentally sat on or shoved up someone's ass,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna was fuming. The elephant graveyard was not something to be disrespected. \"Oh don't you worry hun, there will be nothing accidental about it where I'm going to shove you,\" she seethed, charging at the hyena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Shenzi was too quick for Luna and easily evaded her attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, too slow moron. You really think you can catch me? I spend all day sliding up and down rib cages twice your size,\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna had no response but to reverse course and charge at the hyena again with a growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was fully behind Luna at this point, cheering her on against the bullying tactics of the hyena. They booed as Shenzi dodged once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nothing but a coward, just like the lion,\" Luna growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nothing like the lion. But we both know you wouldn't have even caught him if it weren't for my help! What are you even doing in this ring? Go back to the crowd where you belong!\" Shenzi continued to taunt Luna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where I belong? I'll show you where <i>you</i> belong!\" Luna howled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi smiled, she had the elephant right where she wanted her. The hyena intentionally started her dodge too early and Luna easily caught her in her trunk. The elephant held the hyena to her face and squeezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I've got you. No more running little pup,\" Luna taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is...that all you've...got?\" Shenzi taunted back through strained breath. \"I've gotten a better squeeze from the bones in my bed!\" she cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes narrowed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's this for a squeeze?\" she asked. Luna carried Shenzi over to the corner of the ring and started to climb. The tree strained beneath her weight, but held. Luna wasn't a gifted climber, but she had a very specific goal in mind.  The hyena swallowed hard as the elephant savored the fear in Shenzi's eyes. Upon reaching the highest part of the tree, Luna reached back and parted her cheeks with her hands. With a devious smile that mixed anger and hunger, the elephant slammed Shenzi to the mat. The hyena quickly composed herself, selling the pain as best she could as she stumbled to her feet. If she remained on her back, she'd be squashed flat and lose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna didn't so much leap backwards as she allowed herself to fall backwards, her exposed crack aimed squarely at the hyena. The crowd gasped and then erupted into a loud cheer when she made impact. The elephant moaned in pleasure as she felt Shenzi's body rocket up her back door. The hyena had braced herself for this impact, but had to complete her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's that for a tight space pup?\" Luna laughed as she bounced in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of confusion registered on the elephant's face as she felt something she didn't expect. Shenzi was squirming, but not for escape like she expected. She was moving...deeper? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant stood up quickly and exposed her cheeks to attempt to pry Shenzi out, but she was too late. Shenzi had pulled every last hair of her tail into Luna's ass and the elephant's pucker was sealed tight. The audience groaned as Luna realized she had fallen right into Shenzi's trap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref flew in and evaluated the scene. \"No full insertion Luna! Disqualification! Shenzi is the winner!\" he declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Luna was angry before, she was furious now. And she had Shenzi perfectly positioned to pay for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let her out Luna,\" the ref demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Luna listen?</span></div></div>",

You gotta believe me, she crawled right up in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll see about that.\" The ref replied sternly. \"First, get her out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, I'm trying!\" Luna yelped, her voice increasingly emotional. \"But she's not stopped, she's trying to stay in. I'm pushing as hard as I can.\" She demonstrated this by parting her cheeks and grunting. With some effort Shenzi's stubby tail came out, but it withdrew seconds later. The ref furrowed his brow. Intentionally crawling up someone's ass to get them disqualified was cheating. Granted, the elephant's massive butt slam did a lot of the work there, but had the hyena then tried to sneak in a win by cheating? It would be hard to tell. He didn't feel like Luna was lying to him. He needed words with the hyena, but this was proving a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience was grumbling among themselves. They too felt divided on the spectacle that just unfolded. Some believed the elephant was just making a scene whilst trying to get away with swallowing her opponent with her ass. Others believed Shenzi was up to something and trying to get an underhanded win. The only two things they agreed upon were that watching the elephant pulverize the hyena beforehand was greatly entertaining and that her flying buttslam was the stuff of legends. It was nothing short of a miracle she hadn't squashed the hyena unconscious with it. But to be in Scar's personal goon squad required a thick skull it would seem. The only one that didn't seem to interested was the cub. It barely mattered to him who won, he'd be tormented by either of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna couldn't believe the stubborn hyena was still trying to stay inside of her ass. Did she not hear the ref call out the disqualification? Perhaps not, insulated behind her massive buttcheeks. But if she didn't come out willingly, perhaps the elephant should give her a sampler of life inside of her ass. If pushing isn't working, maybe some gas could convince her to leave. With a nervous smile she turned to the ref.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't push her out, she doesn't want to leave. Can I try farting?\" The ref looked at her with exasperation. Was this really how this fight was going to go? With a deep sigh he nodded, flying back a little to stay out of the elephant's danger zone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi had resisted the squeezing from the slimy walls around her. Just a little longer and the ref would have no choice but to disqualify the elephant. She could already picture all the things she'd do with Luna as her slave. She'd become the top hyena and overthrow that melodramatic lion. Her new best elephantine friend could enjoy tormenting him as she would have the cub for herself. Her musings were rudely shattered when a loud rumble echoed throughout the massive elephant gut. She had mere moments to brace before a horrid rush of hot gas blew past her. She felt herself slipping closer to the exit. The stench was unbearable, making her reconsider her plan of camping out in here. With her senses overwhelmed by the first fart, the second volley of gas hit her even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready a tail could be felt twitching past Luna's pucker. She needed to keep at this. With a wry smile she kept bombarding her stowaway with thundering farts. Shenzi's tenacity was admirable, but she couldn't hold out against this. Gleefully the elephant maintained her foul assault. If she was going to be the hyena's slave, she'd make her suffer for her cheap tricks while she still could. Finally, with a squishy pop, Shenzi was ejected from the elephant's massive rear. She shot out like a cannonball, landing in a heap behind Luna. The hyena writhed and whimpered, trying to sell the pain. But the ref wasn't so sure. All eyes were on him, the crowd murmuring wildly with anticipation. Luna had only broken the rules if Shenzi didn't intentionally climb in there. </span></div></div>",

He lifted her leg and watched as it flopped back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure what the display was when Luna was trying to get Shenzi out of her ass, it was certainly possible that the hyena found herself so deep she just tucked her tail in the rest of the way.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Shenzi tiptoes her way out of recovery, it's not hard to find Luna. The elephant is still trumpeting in anger loudly. The hyena makes her way to her former opponent. She quickly speaks before Luna can attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on Luna, I know you're pissed and you have a right to be. But hear me out,\" Shenzi asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's eyes narrowed and she crossed her arms, but she didn't leap at the hyena, so Shenzi continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, I didn't mean any of those things I said in the ring, I just had to get in your head to get the DQ. You're an amazing competitor, especially since this was your first match right out of the crowd. And I don't even live in the Elephant Graveyard, we left that neighborhood for Pride Rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna seemed unmoved, but Shenzi continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just come back to Pride Rock with me as my backup. After we're done, if you want, you can come right back here to the ring. I'll even endorse you to be a regular. But I have a feeling you might want to stick around for a while. How would you feel about squashing <i>another</i> lion?\" Shenzi asked with a devious smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sound of the opportunity to squash another so-called king, Luna finally cracked a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, give me some credit here, you put me through hell to get that DQ win. I felt like I was in your ass forever!\" Shenzi responds with a smile of her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna took two big steps toward the hyena. \"If I don't like what I see at Pride Rock, you really <i>will</i> be in my ass forever. But you've got a deal Shenzi.\" Luna said in a threatening agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi swallowed hard and clenched her cheeks over her other prize as if he was a furry little stress ball. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n__________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the long walk back to Pride Rock, Shenzi and Luna had a chance to talk strategy. They both knew exactly what to expect when they arrived. Even so, Luna was surprised by the sheer number of hyenas surrounding the rock. Even she couldn't take down that many at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it kid,\" Shenzi whispered as they walked through the crowd, \"The pack won't touch you when you're with me. Just walk confident and be your usual, tough self,\" the hyena said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the throne, where Scar was lazily sprawled across the seat, they paused. A murmur crossed the crowed on sight of Shenzi, who had been gone for a while. Stirring, Scar sat up and growled at his lackey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shenzi! Where in the lion's mane have you been!\" he seethed. \"And who is this?!\" The old lion stood up and began to circle the hyena, as the rest of his hyena henchmen started to chuckle in anticipation of what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar, this is Luna. Luna, this is Scar. He's the lion I was telling you about earlier,\" Shenzi said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare address me by name! I am King Scar! And you should both be on you knee-----ULP!\" Scar began, before finding his scrawny body wrapped up tightly in Luna's massive trunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike she had with Simba earlier, Luna lifted Scar high into the air and slammed him to the unforgiving surface of Pride Rock. The lion stirred, he was a great deal tougher than the cub, but Luna wasn't close to finished yet. The enormous elephant reared back on her hind legs and delivered a devastatingly painful stomp to Scar's smaller, frail body. She wasn't satisfied with just one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSTOMP!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi kept her head on a swivel to ward off any hyenas or lions who might attempt to interfere and save Scar, but laughed to herself as she noticed a look of approval appearing on their faces. They were enjoying this almost as much as Luna was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final loud stomp, Luna stepped back and revealed a paper thin Scar. He looked like he could be a throw rug. But the duo wasn't quite done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Luna, how about we see that full moon again?\" Shenzi said with a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling back, Luna used a wall to support herself as she parted her huge cheeks. Shenzi grabbed the devastated Scar by the scruff of his neck. He was too battered to resist, but he saw what was coming and whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have been a better king,\" she whispered to him before running straight toward the elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi was very careful about her footing this time, and when she released her hold on the lion, she breathed a sigh of relief when she didn't follow him herself. Her aim was true and she laughed heartily when she saw Luna's massive cheeks close over Scar's thin body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, we had quite a walk didn't we Luna? Why don't you take a rest?\" Shenzi says with a smile. Luna nods and smiles in return before plopping down onto her ass in a seated position. Her smile grows broader as she feels Scar get pushed in deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd of hyenas and lions erupt in a huge cheer at the sound defeat of Scar. But...what's next? </span></div></div>",

She needed him awake and aware for this conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Prince,\" Shenzi seethed, \"Luna and I have a plan that's going to finally rid us of your evil uncle. The one who, by the way, killed your dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's eyes shot wide open at this revelation, but he didn't get the opportunity to ask any questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So seeing as how we're pretty much going to avenge your dad for you, once it's done, there's something you need to do for me. Keep in mind, you're technically my property and if you disobey, Luna and I won't have a problem putting on a repeat performance from the wrestling ring. Get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba nodded meekly as Shenzi explained exactly what she expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---End Flash Back---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi and Luna bathed in the glorious round of cheers from the crowd of lions and hyenas, finally united in something. But Shenzi had further plans to reveal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hand moved quickly to her ass and revealed Simba. The sight of the prince, who many thought was dead, silenced the cheers and drew a loud unified gasp. It wasn't just the sight of Simba, but where he had been. The gasp started to transition into an uneasy murmuring amongst the lions in the crowd. That was Simba's cue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Simba spoke the words he was given earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th.....thank you Shenzi. You kept me safe from my Uncle Scar. If you hadn't hidden me, he likely would have killed me. Just like he did my father. All he wanted was the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe murmuring died down at Simba's words. The crowd remained silence as the cub continued to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Citizens of Pride Rock, I realize that I am the rightful and true King. However, I am unfit. I ran. I abandoned you. I was unable to protect my father and I would have been unable to protect myself from my uncle. I would be unable to protect you. I relinquish my crown and give it to someone who I have seen to be a true protector. And someone who has shown she can unite lion and hyena alike - Shenzi. All that I ask is that you continue to protect me as you have today....my Queen,\" he said, bowing to the hyena before placing himself in a prone position on the large throne. The crowd was shocked, but bowed to Shenzi as well in acceptance of Simba's words. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi put on the acting performance of her life demonstrating shock and humility in accepting the crown. She smiled as she stood  above the throne and Simba's small head. She casually caressed her large ass and smiled at Luna, still enjoying her seat on top of Scar. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Simba, I'll make sure you always stay safe,\" before plopping down hard and enjoying the feeling of his head sinking deep between her cheeks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShenzi would enjoy a long, prosperous reign as queen of the Pride lands. She maintained balance between the hyenas and lions and learned not to repeat the actions of the power hungry Scar. It helped that she could always call on her elephant friend Luna for backup as needed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba remained obedient, but was never truly able to grow beyond the size of a cub. It's difficult for a body to mature and grow while living a life trapped between a larger creature's soft ass cheeks. He grew to, if not enjoy his place, to accept it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was said that the queen rarely moved from her seat on the throne, but was in constant motion, shifting and grinding in place and always had a smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiles away from Pride Rock, a meerkat and warthog happily munched away on bugs, rarely giving a second thought to the lion friend they met in passing. Hakuna Matata. </span></div></div>",

She smiled in silence for a few moments basking in her victory as Shenzi looked on in approval. Her job wasn't quite done though. There was one final piece of her agreement with the hyena that Luna had to honor before being granted her freedom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive elephant clenched her cheeks and stood, leaving no sign of the thin, one time king trapped between her cheeks. With a smile, she slowly approached Shenzi. The crowd grew hushed in anticipation, unsure of her intention. Even Shenzi swallowed hard, hoping Luna would honor the terms of their truce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long, pregnant pause, Luna dropped to her knees and bowed before Shenzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you my Queen,\" she said, loud enough for the crowd to hear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a murmuring amongst the crowd, but eventually, they all followed suit. One by one, every lion and hyena bowed to Shenzi as well. The hyena stood tall, knowing that her plan had worked and that the throne was hers alone. She slowly walked over to the stone throne that Scar had recently been sprawled across and plopped down hard with a broad smile. She felt Simba get pushed deeper into her ass as she sat and her eyes fell on the remainder of the royal family, bowing along with the rest of the crowd. She couldn't help but to laugh to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smiling Shenzi handed a crumpled, roughly written document to Luna and called her former partners in crime \u2013 Banzai and Ed \u2013 over to her. They were the only two who could possibly know of Simba\u2019s continued survival. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you two to accompany Luna back home. Make sure no harm comes to her,\u201d she commanded with a knowing smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEd smiled ignorantly while Banzai swallowed hard, looking up at the elephant who had made quick work of Scar. She needed their protection? But he wasn\u2019t in much of a position to argue with the new queen. So the trio walked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna walked along at a slow pace, swinging her hips from side to side. The hyenas had to be constantly aware of her massive ass as she wasn\u2019t taking much care to avoid smacking them with it as she walked. She was enjoying the sensation of Scar\u2019s squashed body too much to care. Despite his defeat, every few steps he would squirm and try an escape, sending shivers of pleasure down her spine. Once, he dared to unsheathe his claws and slash at the elephant\u2019s massive rump. It didn\u2019t exactly draw his desired response. The sharp, sudden impact on her sensitive flesh rocked Luna, drawing out a moan of pleasure and forcing her to her knees for a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the group arrived at the makeshift wrestling ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is it?\u201d a confused Banzai asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna simply nodded happily and strode confidently to the  vulture referee, handing him the note from Shenzi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hereby release Luna from my service and fully endorse her as a fulltime competitor in the Wildlife Wrestling Federation. I also submit the two hyenas accompanying her to act as her opponents in her inaugural match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSigned,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen Shenzi, Pride Rock\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture read the handwritten note in shock, but accepted the terms. Before they knew what was happening, Banzai and Ed found themselves thrust into the ring facing a very excited Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember the rules Luna, no full insertion!\u201d the vulture stated sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna clenched her cheeks over scar\u2019s secure body and nodded with a smile. \u201cNo problem.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and Luna made very quick work of Scar\u2019s former lackys. She tossed Banzai onto Ed with her trunk and brought her feet down with a roothless STOMP that had the crowd cheering. She repeated her stomping action several times, ensuring her hyena opponents were crushed flat. But she wasn\u2019t done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her ass occupied, she moved her body into position over her opponents and let herself drop into a belly flop onto the overmatched hyenas. The ref waited a moment, but seeing that the elephant was comfortable and seemed relaxed, he called the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna finally stood and smiled, peeling the flattened hyenas off the mat, separating them with the slightest difficulty. She smiled to herself, remembering Shenzi\u2019s words of advice. Once she was out of the ring, she pulled Scar\u2019s battered body from deep between her cheeks. His eyes flinched at the sudden light on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna maneuvered her defeated opponents quickly. Individually, they wouldn\u2019t be near enough. But together, she smiled as she thought, it would be a tight fit, but would work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tied their legs and tails together, leaving just enough room for her legs to slip through where she needed them to. Finally, she grabbed Banzai with one hand and Ed with the other and pulled the trio up until they fit snugly around her waist, with Scar once again planted deep within her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna caressed her full backside. With her new uniform, she could fight freely without having to worry about her opponent using her asshole, or any other hole, as a loophole ever again. It might seem strange to the other animals on the savannah to see an elephant walking around in a thong, but she never worried much about what others thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna\u2019s dominating career as a wrestler was only getting started. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The elephant simply uncoiled her brutal trunk to let him flop on to the floor. With a vicious glare she stepped forward, planting a heavy foot on top of the cub. He squeaked back into clarity, feeling the heavy foot squash him. The little lion felt his body compress under the overwhelming pressure, only to bounce back. Had the elephant stopped already? A new stomp quickly removed that silly notion. Of course she'd keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe angry elephant bore down on Simba with one angry stomp after the other. Each time his body was smooshed under her sole. And each time it sprung right back up again. The pressure and the pain kept the cub from dashing away. Not that he'd get far. The crowd seemed to love watching him get hurt. Though this wasn't quite regulation, they cheered all the same. The vulture ref kept a close eye on things to stop them from getting out of hand but he didn't interfere. He saw the cowardly cub receive what he would consider just punishment for trying to run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an unrelenting volley of demolishing stomps the elephant rears back on her hind legs. Simba looks up, powerless to dodge away. Both front come down like gray meteors. They land right on top of the cub with a huge thump. The little lion is for a moment nearly two-dimensional before his resilient nature cause him to sproing back up on to his feet. That was her final blow. The irate elephant huffs and puffs with pent up aggression. She slowly composes herself and the ref flies in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies aaand gentlemen, we have ourselves an issue. Simba cannot fight any further, but who gets to claim victory and possible this lion?\" The crowd murmurred among themselves.

The hyena slunk away in disappointment, allowing Sophie to turn her full attention to her prize, the lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time, Simba felt himself lifted by Sophie's strong, thick trunk.

She had pinned down both his front paws under her own and was giving the cub a most disturbing look. Her maw was hanging open a little with a sultry toothy grin and she was salivating madly. Drops and strands of drool landed on the little lion's chest, making him feel deeply terrified. His opponent looked about ready to chow down on him. Isn't that against the rules? Shouldn't someone stop her? Or at least call her off? He looked around to see the vulture intently watching both of them. Shenzi exchanged a glance with him as well, silently assuring him she wouldn't bite. This gesture was completely lost on the cub, who was quietly outraged that the hyena was allowed to continue. Her hot stinky breath washed over him, making the trapped cub wiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, squirm for me Simba. I'm going to make sure you'll never forget this fight. And that you'll never forget me.\" the hyena whispered, speaking soft enough for only Simba to hear her. Her drooling maw hung over his face directly, leaking onto the cub and filling the air with a mix of hyena breath and hyena slobber. Both had their own unique stench but they shared the noxious aroma of rotten flesh. The little lion kept on his fight, but the large hyena had him pinned down well. With a cruel laugh Shenzi went in for her next devastating attack. She plunged her head down, mouth open wide. Simba closed his eyes and prepared for the worst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he got was something decidedly less painful than expected. Shenzi had closed her maw around Simba's and was laying on a thick, sloppy kiss. Her lips sealed his mouth off from the outside, forcing him to breathe through his nose. The stench was bad, but the hyena was only getting started. The little lion had kept his mouth shut, but that was not going to deter her. She licked his mouth, soaking every part of it in foul hyena drool. The hyena knew that with patience she would be able to claim her prize, looking the terrified and disgusted lion straight in the eye. With a lustful glare she made it obvious to the cub what she wanted. He knew to keep his mouth shut well and deny her this. Her response was subtle, closing her maw just a fraction, enough for her fang to poke the little lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould she really do this? Was she willing to bite down just to get him to open up? Or was she just bluffing? Simba couldn't get a read on her hungry look, but became increasingly convinced as Shenzi meticulously upped the pressure her fangs were putting on the cub. She wanted in, to kiss him deep and passionately. She thought about it many times before but being here and now, about to fulfill her fantasy? It was even better than she could have dreamed. This little bluffing game to force his mouth open was unexpected, but oh so very thrilling. Tension built up higher and higher until something or someone would have to give.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer came moments later as the cub sputtered to get the horrid hyena drool off his face. Shenzi saw her moment and took it. She relaxed her jaw and leaned in deeper. Her tongue pushed in, setting to work on contaminating the unspoiled little mouth with her saliva. Simba's eyes widened as he felt the bulk of the hyena tongue slather up the insides of his maw. It was utterly horrifying, feeling her coat every part of it in her taste. The smell of her drool was bad enough, but the taste was on a whole new level of revolting. His own tongue stood no chance in this one sided kiss. Shenzi closed her eyes and focused entirely on giving the little cub every ounce of what she had to offer. Only when she felt the little lion practically choke on the large tongue did she back herself down a little. She kissed him with a conviction she hadn't felt before. The crowd watched breathlessly as the cub was held down in the dirt, the hyena smooch causing him to twitch and shudder with disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like an eternity for all parties involved Shenzi leaned back a little, A huge smile on her face. Simba was still stuck on his back, his mouth hanging open and half his face coated with smelly hyena drool. He needed time to process this terrible assault on him, but she wouldn't not give him any. She was in charge and he was going to feel it, one way or another.</span></div></div>",

His mind was blurry after her overwhelming kiss and he could desperately use a moment to regain his fighting spirit. How were things going this rotten already? She was just a hyena, a decent opponent but not that threatening. Yet this cunning gal had floored him from the start and seemed more interested in playing around. She wasn't even trying to fight, yet he felt like he was losing. He just needed to bring out some of that famous lion courage and resilience, that would show her. But Shenzi was sitting back, eying her opponent with a lustful hunger. Her gaze was drawn to his groin and her next target was set. One kiss wouldn't sate her. She needed more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion tried to roll back onto his feet, but he was stopped by a heavy paw landing in his gut. He groaned a little at the weight. Mild discomfort made room for fear when he saw her looking at his crotch with that same slavering, hollow stare. 'She wouldn't...' he thought, but Shenzi was nothing if not driven to milk this victory for all it had. She slowly lowered her head towards the cub's groin, sniffing loudly and humming contently. Any resistance from her struggling prey was squashed quite literally by the hyena leaning more of her weight onto his gut. Soon her cold, wet nose was poking between his legs, probing him for a response. To his horror, Simba felt himself stir. The keen nose of the hyena picked up on the subtle change in the air and she replied with a long, drawn out lick along the cub's sheath. The slobbery tongue pressed down softly, pushing the sheath open a little bit and getting the briefest touch against the cub's shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgainst his will the little lion's cock began to rise up. Shenzi was merciless in stimulating it to grow further, licking and sniffing the cub's groin like nobody was watching. The crowd wasn't sure whether to feel pity for the cub or not, all watching the hyena work her magic with great attention. The hyena dragged her tongue along the rising member and at its peak slid her head back down along the full length, taking it into her maw. Simba squeaked in fear as he felt a fang briefly brush against one of his balls. The foul hyena had his whole dick in her maw and began to suckle and slurp on it. Any semblance of words or protest were slurred into incomprehensible gibberish by Shenzi's actions. Her tongue felt experienced in the matter and the cub felt like she would be mocking his size if it weren't for her pushing him to climax in front of a whole crowd. She looked the little lion in the eyes with a confident stare. She was making it inescapably clear who was running this fight and who was being humiliated for show. The cub didn't dare move a muscle in case she decided to play rough with his little soldier in retaliation. The hyena had him by the balls and she wouldn't stop until she'd sucked them dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wave of shame flowed over Simba as he felt his release into her slobbering maw. Shenzi gulped it down like it was the last drink on Earth and finally released his spent member. It was soaked in her slimy drool and quickly slipped back into its sheath. The little lion was burning up with embarrassment so intensely he felt like he could combust at any point. He'd been made to cum in the middle of a fight. If she hadn't made it clear she was just toying with her victim before, nobody could have missed it now. The crowd showered Shenzi with applause, causing her to get off the lion and walk around the ring, drinking in all the praise.</span></div></div>",

Just follow my instinct, and I'll get the jump on anybody here.\"<br>\r\n\"Atta boy.\" A short while later, the vulture called Simba and Henriette to the animal made arena. \"Knock 'em dead!\" Simba charges into the arena, determination at its max. He slides under the bottom most vine, and gets to one corner of the arena, a smug grin on his face.<br>\r\n\"In this corner, we have, Simba the lion!\" The vulture motions to Simba in one corner, resulting in the crowd laughing at his tiny stature. Simba scowled, ready to prove them wrong. \"And in this corner, we have, Henriette the hippo!\" The vulture motions to the other side of the arena, with not a soul in sight. Then, a series of steady, loud thumps resounded throughout the general area. Trees shook, the Earth seemed to tremble, when a massive hippo, walking upright, stepped over the upper most vine, before sitting down in her corner, resulting in several members of the crowd, and SImba, being tossed into the air from the resulting shockwave. Simba's awestruck and terrified by his opponent's gargantuan size. She stood just a third shy of the height of one of the arena, if she were carnivorous, she could probably swallow Pumbaa whole. Most striking of all was her massive butt, which could pin 3 Simbas and still have room to spare. Henriette stares down at Simba, and grin maliciously. <br>\r\n\"This shrimp is my prey? Guess it's up to me to put on a show,\" Henriette speaks smugly. Simba's initial fear was replaced with anger. His strength was renewed, and he's ready to show this rock with legs who's boss.<br>\r\n\"Ready, and, fight!\" <br>\r\nHenriette stays in place, eyeing SImba up, as he took the initiative and charges at Henriette. He leaps as high as he can, poised to pounce upon Henriette's massive belly. As he descends towards Henriette's stomach, Henriette maintains her grin. She then contracts her stomach muscles in front of Simba, much to his shock. She thrusts her stomach forward, smacking Simba in the face with her own fat, and sending him flying pathetically back onto the dirt floor of the arena.<br>\r\n\"Ha-ha!\" Henriette cackles as she gets on all fours and walks towards Simba's dazed body. Simba was seeing triple as Henriette looked over him, grabbed his tail, and roughly yaned him up to eye level, giving off a more cruel grin as she stared at the suspended cub.</span></div></div>",

Outside, the crowd left as they saw Henriette concentrating her efforts in squishing Simba with her tongue. To Timon and Pumba's terror, they watch SImba struggle against the sides of Henriette's mouth.

Now, let's see about you, cub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA strong hand grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and pulled him into the air. Henriette's curiosity was also peaked. That voice was very familiar to her. Could it be? She walked to the side of the ring to see who was causing such a commotion. Her eyes widened when she saw the cub's rescuer. She too was a hippo and looked quite similar to Henriette. Her full belly and bright smile practically a mirror image. Her skin was a bit lighter and missed Henriette's earthen brown hue in favor of a more grey tone. She smiled at Henriette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are ya sis? It's been a while, hasn't it?

He might be a punching bag, but at least he wasn't a coward like them. He looked around to see if Timon or Pumbaa were there, but he figured Timon would just get himself hurt and Pumbaa wasn't much for fighting.

He could see them approach, but he had no idea what would hit him next. Henriette and Michelle readied their bellies and threw themselves towards the cub. In unison they rushed him belly-first, catching his head between their huge guts. Simba's head was completely pinned, tons of hippo fat pushing in from all sides. The roaring of the crowd had been effectively silenced by the insulating mass. The pressure all around him was intense and, though he though it impossible, growing. Henriette and Michelle leaned towards eachother, further squashing the little lion between them. Suddenly they stand back a little and Henriette reaches down between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's head hurt from the pressure. When they'd parted the sudden light blinded him. He was almost shell-shocked and barely registered a hippo hand grabbing him. The cub was lifted off his feet and held in front of the hippo's face. Henriette blew him a quick kiss before turning him to face Michelle, who did the same. Then they dropped him again, catching him between their big bellies. Once more they closed the gap, this time catching the lower half of the cub between them. He held on to Michelle's gut as the hippo's began slowly shuffling their bellies around. His hind legs were shoved, rolled and squashed before the hippo's revealed their next move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubtle movements gave the cub's body the opportunity to slide down ever so slightly. Simba could scarcely believe it. He was sinking inbetween the wobbling bellies, as if the gap between them was trying to eat him. The crowd went insane, watching the cub slowly sink deeper and deeper into the roiling sea of hippo fat. There was plenty of belly to go around and soon only his head and two thrashing paws were left visible. Henriette and Michelle laughed at the hapless lion before sealing the deal. Simba was now encased completely between their pudgy bodies, the rapid shifting and squashing rolling over him like inevitable waves of pain. Before long the hippo guts had slowed themselves, almost massaging the cub between them. If it weren't for the overwhelming pressure giving him the idea he'd come out flat as a pancake Simba might have enjoyed this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis joy was short-lived however, as the hippo's stopped moving their bodies and leaned in for a hug. The trapped lion felt himself compress as they forced their bellies together in a great and powerful embrace. What little air could enter between their shaking guts had been cut off and Simba could only hope this hug wouldn't last too long. Fortunately they parted themselves after a few seconds, revealing him to the world once again. Simba was wrecked, his body aching all over from the pressure and more humiliatingly, stuck to Michelle's gut. With a giggle she peeled the cub off and dropped him on the floor. He'd been thoroughly squashed between them. Was he going to stand firm or throw in the towel. </span></div></div>",

He was a lion, and he would show these animals that a lion's courage is no mere myth. Both hippo's raised their eyebrows in unison, surprised at the little cub's fortitude. Soon their smiles turned with glee. They got to do more to him. This time Michelle whispers and idea into Henriette's ear, who mostly nods at her sister's delightful suggestions. Simba knew their next move would probably flatten him again, but he was ready for them. Let them do their worst. Had he known what was still in store he might've been a bit less bold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette walked up to the cub, waving her big hips from side to side. She reached down to grab the little lion, but he wasn't going to make it th\u00e1t easy. He ran between her legs, dashing so quickly that even the hippo's butt squash was too late. She stood up again, dusted herself off and grabbed her growling stomach. Simba looked at her with a puzzled stare. What was she doing over there? Was this another trick to get a hold of him. He glanced over to Michelle, who seemed entirely unconcerned by her sister appearing to be in distress. This confirmed it for Simba. She was luring him into a trap, and he would not fall for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe groaning hippo looked up to see where Simba was and closed her eyes. She stood tall, growling a little at the discomfort she was feeling. She then opened her maw wide and let forth the single most devastating belch ever witnessed by man or animal. The noise alone was deafening, a nearly orchestral burp, long and drawn out. But the following stench hit Simba in ways he could've never anticipated. The caustic smell set his nostrils ablaze, making the cub quickly put his paws in front of his nose.The unearthly smell was so potent, several people in the crowd behind Simba turned queasy with one even throwing up. The little lion wasn't too far from throwing up himself as a result of the infernal stench. Henriette seemed unconcerned though, casually walking towards the gassed lion as if nothing had happened. She picked him up with ease this time and took a front paw in each hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo sat down, holding the cub against her belly whilst leaning back. Eventually Henriette was lying flat on her back with the cub positioned in the middle of her big belly. Any escape attempts were met with subtle but powerful squeezing of his paws. Simba was completely stuck in this position, at the mercy of the other hippo. Michelle slowly walked into his view and approached him with a sudden burst of speed with her big belly. She simply let herself fall onto Henriette, neatly sandwiching the cub in between them. Simba's scream was cut off by hippo fat as they once again hid him from sight. This time gravity helped to squish the cub even harder. He felt his whole body, trapped and utterly immobilized, glow with dull pain. He'd been here before, a little more weight wasn't going to make a difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a solid few minutes of Michelle rocking back and forth, allowing the lion the slightest window to breathe, she leant back and got off her sister's belly. Simba was squashed again, pushed aside and landing on the ground like a little heap. The hippo's were getting ready for the vulture's conclusion, simply waiting for the cub to do the right thing. Timon and Pumbaa could be heard shouting over the crowd. \"Don't give up Simba, you can do this!\" Simba wondered what fight they were watching. So far he'd been slammed, thrown and squashed twice. What was he going to do to turn this around? Throwing in the towel certainly wasn't going to make a difference. Simba closed his eyes and growled to himself before gritting his teeth and making the hard decision.</span></div></div>",

They'd claim him as their own and squish and crush him for days to come. He'd be kept between bellies, in armpits and under butts. They smiled at eachother, gleefully giggling in anticipation when Simba stood up. His legs were a little shaky, but he was on his feet. The hippo's were shocked. He'd been pressed between tons of hippo fat twice and still he stood. Either he was so concussed he'd gone mad or he sincerely believed he stood some kind of chance. It mattered little to Henriette and Michelle. They'd just play with him in here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth hippo's sauntered up to the cub, standing on either side of him. He looked up to see them exchange a steely glare before raising their right arms. The little lion got ready for a pummeling, but opened his eyes when he saw something entirely different taking place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One! Two! Three! Rock!\" \"Scissors!\" \"Haha, I win sis!\" \"Yeah yeah, let's get to the fun part.\" With those last words they both looked down at Simba. He froze, and after they threatened to both fart again he made sure not to move a muscle. Michelle plopped her big butt on the floor with a thud and leaned in to grab the cub. Simba was torn between fleeing and not getting gassed again. Had he known of their game he would've ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPudgy hands grasp his sides and the hippo lifts him up. Henriette meanwhile turned around, showing her big bottom to the cub. She bent over, getting down on all fours and letting the whole crowd see it's beautiful rotund form. Simba panicked a little when he noticed the massive butt getting bigger. Henriette was backing up towards him. Soon her bottom was so close Simba's nose almost touched it. It stank of sweat, dirt and things far worse. A small toot from the hippo didn't do much to make the stench any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Michelle pushes him forward, jamming him between her sister's big asscheeks. The little lion is surrounded by flabby, stinky flesh as Michelle keeps on pushing him deeper. After a while she stopped, leaving Simba completely stuck in a hippo's butt. The crowd roared with enthusiasm. Another toot from Henriette flew straight into Simba's face. Michelle smiles widely before...</span></div></div>",

Michelle giggled and pushed hard, pressing Simba's head deep into the recesses of her sister's crack. With little difficulty she reached the bottom, pushing the cub's head into the darkness. The little lion couldn't see anything, his head enveloped by hippo buttcheeks. But he could feel exactly where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette's pucker was so close his nose was touching it. It twitched a little and slowly moved on its own. It was the single most disgusting thing Simba had ever experienced, to feel another animal's asshole pressed against his nose. The blubbery hippo soon added to his torment, her bowels growling to announce a big fart. The burst of gas was enough to briefly part her hefty cheeks before sealing the cub back into darkness. The stench lingered, assailing the lion's nose and eyes. He had no way to cover them and was forced to endure the potent farts produced right in front of him. He knew they were planning on a KO by fart, but he wouldn't give them the satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the hippo's grew annoyed. The little cub should've passed out by now.

With just a few heavy pushes, Michelle had managed to stuff his entire head into her sister's body. The stench was unrelenting. Outside, her farts would dissipate, but in here they had nowhere to go. Especially with his head blocking the only exit. He found a new surge of strength and struggled as fiercely as possible. It didn't last though, as the lack of breathable air and overwhelming pressure quickly subdued him. Seeing his struggles fade, the hippo's decide to pull him free, confident that they'd sealed Simba's fate this time. There was no way he'd be left in fighting condition. And as soon as they would be allowed to claim him, they were going to have so much fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle carefully pulled the cub's head back outside where he breathed a gasp of air.

The cub, against all odds, stood back up again. Defiantly he smiled at the hippos. His whole body ached and smelled like ass, but he would not quit. Whilst they were a little mad that the cub still wasn't beaten, both Michelle and Henriette began to respect his tenacity. They would have to result to their most devastating team technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, cub. If you want to be buried so badly, allow us to provide your tomb!\" The crowd collectively lost their minds. The Tomb was rarely ever used by Henriette, and nobody had ever withstood it. Simba grew a little worried at the audience's excitement, but stood his ground. Michelle walked towards him, ready to grab him for their next move. In the background Henriette was digging a hole. It didn't look very deep, only just big enough to hold something like a small hyena, maybe a lion cub... Simba began to wonder just what they had planned. It seemed clear he was to be put in the hole, but he dreaded to think of the follow up on that. He was so distracted that he noticed Michelle reaching down for him at the last moment. Once again he'd dash between the hippo legs, but this time they were ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heavy thud was heard when Michelle quickly sat down on the cub. He was fast enough to keep most of him safe, but his lower back and tail were caught. The hippo shuffled her cheeks a little, wedging Simba a little deeper between them. She looked up to Henriette, who had finished digging. Quickly she grabbed the pinned lion and pulled him free. The cub struggled and fought her grip, but she had both her hands wrapped around his torso. He was going nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she reached the hole, Michelle gently placed Simba in it, laying him on his back. She held his upper body down whilst Henriette turned around, showing him the familiar sight of her butt. She sat down, covering Simba's lower body and pinning him down. Michelle let go of his body and turned around herself. The little lion could only watch as her round bottom lowered itself onto him. The two hippo's were sitting back to back, a little lion buried beneath their butts. A little rumble from one of their guts preceded the unholy domination that followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't move at all. The hole he was in provided a lot of relief from the hippos' crushing weight, but it did little to stop him from being pinned into position by their hefty posterior. He too heard the rumbles passing through the big guts above him. He braced himself for what was to come as best he could, but he knew that this might be the one that'll knock him out. The crowd waited with baited breath, ready for the hippos to unleash the storm on the entombed lion. And they delivered far beyond all expectations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer volume alone would be enough to let bystanders believe a hippo's gut is just a big gas balloon. Simba could feel the rancid wind surging along his body as the hippos had opened the floodgates to a seemingly never ending volley of farts. Each more loud and thunderous then the last. The crowd cheered at first, but soon even they were covering their noses at the pestilent miasma emanating from the two. After three minutes Michelle and Henriette began to run dry. A few more little extra smelly farts escaped them before they got up. The entombed lion was breathing, but not much more. His gaze was distant and his body still twitching from the horrors he'd experienced. He was in no way prepared for the relentless rancid assault he endured. Michelle felt a touch of pity as she lifted the cub out of the fart-blasted hole. He sputtered a little, but it was clear to everyone. He had lost this fight, and he was down for the count. The Tomb had claimed another victim, and Henriette was confidently beaming with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture entered the arena to conclude tonight's event. He quickly looked over the lion to confirm everyone's suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We haaaave a winner! Give it up for Michelle and Henriette, the brave hippo duo who stood their ground against this ferocious lion!\" The crowd laughed loudly at the vulture, cheering for the winners. \"Now, as is our ancient tradition, they are allowed to claim him for themselves! Ladies, what will you decide? Can Simba go to let his ego recover? Or will he be coming with you?!\" Henriette and Michelle smiled and looked at eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll take him, thank you very much.\" The crowd against burst into laughter and cheering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle looked around and quickly added. \"A pity none of you had the stones to join him, we could've had some real fun.\" Most of the audience shuffled a little on their feet, quietly embarrassed by themselves. Though having seen what Simba had been put through and was possibly going to be enduring in the near future did make them feel a bit better about their decision.</span></div></div>",

He had lost the fight in awe-inspiring fashion and they had laid claim on him as was their right. The little lion was still recovering from the merciless assault he'd faced during the match. His body had been squashed repeatedly and stunk heavily of hippo farts. It took a few more minutes before he regained much of his senses, finding himself held in Michelle's arms like a baby. He tries to get away, but she quickly wraps him into a soft hug. For once she was not trying to squeeze or crush him, which caught the cub off guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome back Simba. I'm afraid that you went a little KO during the fight, so you sort of lost that. But the good news is we get to make sure you'll be all better again.\" Henriette giggled at her sister. \"By which she means we claimed you. You're ours now.\" His eyes grew wider. Was that part of the fight, or was she just messing with him. She noticed his confusion. \"Didn't Timon and Pumbaa tell you about that? The winner can claim the loser as their own after a fight.\" Simba was overcome with fear. He'd only been around them for ten minutes and his body was wracked with pain and practically infused with hippo stink. He struggled in Michelle's grip, but she responded only by hugging him a little tighter. He wisely surrendered, too exhausted and bruised to do much about his current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry, we're not going to hurt you. First we should share a little something with you.\" Henriette smiled at her sister. \"It's been so long since we stood in the ring together. So we'd like to reward you a little for allowing this reunion to happen.\" \"And to make it so much fun.\" Her sister added. The hippo's stood across from one another and Michelle raised Simba to eye level. Both leaned in and planted a gentle kiss on each side of his head. \"Thank you for not bowing out or running away. Most fighters wouldn't have had your courage.\" Simba stays quiet, knowing he's not got much he can do anyway. He's already happy to be treated nice for a change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle and Henriette exchanged looks again, this time a lot more sultry. They leaned together again, pursing their lips. This time however they held them pressed against Simba's head before slowly suckling on more and more of it. In little time they reached eachother and began kissing. Simba's head was stuck between the two smooching hippos. Before long their tongues got a hold of him and began playing with him and with eachother. The large muscles slathered him in sticky saliva as he could hear both of them moaning in pleasure. One of the tongues even briefly tried to probe its way into his mouth, but gave up when he kept it firmly shut. After what felt to Simba like an eternity they released him. His head was dripping with slimy saliva and he took a few deep breaths before shuddering so hard Michelle nearly dropped him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two cuddled with the little lion for a little while before some familiar faces approached them. Timon and Pumbaa sheepishly stepped forward. They asked the pair of hippos if they would please give Simba to them. The cub had suffered enough for one day and could use a little help. Michelle and Henriette looked at eachother and replied.</span></div></div>",

The meerkat and warthog weren't exactly in a position to complain, so they left the cub with Michelle and Henriette. He dreaded to think what they'd do to him, still sore from spending just ten minutes in a ring with them. Though he did note that their attitudes had grown a lot more friendly towards him. Admittedly their friendliness did result in his head being soaked with drool. But he'd take that over being intimately introduced to their ass any day. He groaned a little as the Michelle held him aloft again, giggling with glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should visit Henriette some day. The mud pools near her place do wonders for sore muscles like yours.\" Simba produced a strained smile, trying not to think too much on what'd happen if he took her advice. He doubted Henriette would just let him use those pools without toying with him first. She interrupted his train of thought with a reply. \"And it does wonders for your skin. I mean, have you felt mine?\" Michelle smiled and pushed the cub against her sister's belly. Now that he didn't have to worry about crushing weight he had a chance to feel her skin. The rubbery hide was almost completely smooth, a hearty earthen scent filling the little lion's nose. In some ways it kinda smelled nice, but the pervasive hint of her salty sweat ruined it. And if the cub was entirely honest with himself, it smelled like a field of roses compared to her farts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sis, since he was so nice to let us squash him, how about we give him a belly massage?\" Simba gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y'know, I think he'd love that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was placed between the hippo bellies, silently hoping this wouldn't be a repeat of the double hippo rush he'd endured earlier. Michelle and Henriette leaned forward, gently engulfing Simba up to his neck between their soft guts. They used their hands to make the large mass jiggle and wobble, waves of fat coursing along their bellies. The experience was almost surreal for Simba. He felt the hippo guts jiggle all around him, pressing and releasing in a way that felt remarkably pleasant. He relaxed a little, letting the flabby bellies do their thing. Unfortunately, the hippos didn't quite leave all of their mischief in the ring. With a subtle step they split up a fraction of a centimeter at a time, until the cub began sliding a bit lower. Before long his head was lost between their bellies. They nodded and stopped jiggling their guts, reaching in for a hug instead. The gentle massage became an overwhelming reminder of the fight and Simba was squeezed flat between them for a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, so sorry Simba, we forgot you were there.\" They sheepishly giggled. \"Don't worry, I'll make it up to you.\" Michelle added, lifting him back up by the scruff of his fur. She dropped him between her boobs, the soft flesh yielding around him. Each orb was half the size of the cub, and Michelle quickly pinned him between them. She rolled them back and forth over his body, making the cub coo in surprised delight. Henriette, slightly jealous, retrieved him from her sister's rack and promptly pushed the little lion into her own cleavage. She too massaged him with her breasts, but Henriette was decidedly rougher in her approach. Simba didn't care though. For once he wasn't being squashed, even if he had zero say in what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the soft hugs followed more kisses. Both hippos wanted some and Michelle got to go first. Not content with just a kiss, she quickly sucked the cub's whole head into her maw and began to lick it. Henriette repeated this one-sided French kiss as well, but was a little more persistent. Cunningly she placed her tongue on the cub's nose, waiting for him to take a desperate breath. The moment that happened she plunged her tongue in to his mouth. Michelle giggled when Simba's body suddenly twitched and shuddered at her sister's loving kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just can't resist. Can I sis, please?\" \"Oh fine Henriette, go for it, he's almost done anyway.\" Simba barely caught most of those words, still working through the fact he'd French kissed a hippo. Suddenly she began to suckle on him again, slurping in an attempt to pull the rest of him into her maw. His struggles were meaningless against the large hippo maw, but he tried all the same. Like a furry, struggling string of pasta the cub slowly vanished between Henriette's lips. She murrs loudly, relishing the little lion's delightful taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa just came around the corner when they saw the two hippo's sitting next to eachother, one with a mouthful of cub. They looked at the two as if they'd been caught doing something naughty and Henriette quickly leant forward to deliver Simba back to freedom. He was just a drool-soaked floppy ragdoll of a lion, his expression horrified by what he just experienced.

Timon and Pumbaa decided to lay low for a while, their stalwart protector not quite the ferocious force of nature they'd hoped for yet.

Timon and Pumbaa could pick him up near the ring when they were bored of him. Simba didn't speak up, still dumbfounded that his friends neglected to tell him about this. The pair of blubbery beasts turned their attention on eachother and their little captive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we take him to my place?\" Henriette suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds great, I can always use a mud bath\" Michelle cheered. Henriette rolled her eyes. \"You worry too much, you look great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says I want a mud bath for my looks?\" Michelle replied, her gaze falling on to the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoh, I see. I'm all for that kind of bath.\" The hippos kept talking back and forth for a few minutes before preparing to leave. They argued back and forth on whether they should carry Simba. Michelle didn't want to slow down to let him stumble after them, but Henriette didn't want him to get lazy. After some fruitless bickering Michelle offered a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if he isn't carried on our back?\" Henriette raised a brow, curious to hear what her sister was talking about. \"I'm sure a pair of hefty ladies like us can find a different accommodation for this little cub.\" Her sister was slowly beginning to drool. Michelle turned to Simba, who looked both terrified and confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you've either not heard or experienced it yet, my sister loves to eat things. Living things.\" She said, her voice deep and sultry. Henriette chimed in: \"I didn't get this beautiful just eating leaves.\" She patted her belly, which grumbled a little in confirmation. Michelle then drew the cub's attention back to herself. \"Me, I can't stand that sort of thing. I prefer my victims a little further back if you know what I'm saying.\" Simba looked more confused than before, making the hippo giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't spoil the surprise, it's funnier when they don't know. Now for more serious matters, who will carry him?\" Henriette was no longer objecting to this duty and the two quickly agreed there was only one way out. A quick round of rock-paper-scissors later a winner had been determined.</span></div></div>",

The hippo carried him around her sister, who'd gotten down on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette held Simba up close to Michelle's big round butt, its cheeks smooth with an even grey sheen. \"Go on, give them a little kiss.\" The hippo goaded, but the cub was in no mood to play.

He could vaguely feel her surprised pucker clench down on his midsection. Michelle herself had let out a little yelp in shock, but was already cooing and moaning at the sensation of Simba struggling inside her. The hippo's body needed no instruction on what to do next. A low rumble announced a foul fart and the cub knew he had no escape. He braced himself as best he could. The power of Michelle's gas could not be understated. It was unbelievably smelly and voluminous enough to briefly distend the slimy passage the little lion was lodged into. He felt the hot gas rush past him, even pushing him back out a little. The foul stench clung to his fur and made his eyes water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette walked behind her sister and saw the spectacle unfold. The stench had long ago lost it's effect on her, and she giggled loudly at the sight of Simba's lower body struggling between her cheeks. \"You need a hand with that, sis?\" Michelle rolled her eyes and replied. \"It's okay, I got this.\" With those words Simba felt the passage around him stir. The slimy walls pressed into him and began to... pull? The cub couldn't quite place what he was feeling, but his suspicions felt confirmed when he noticed the pressure from her pucker had shifted a bit further down his body. He was now even deeper inside, and it didn't seem like the large body around him would stop until he was in completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time ticked by, Michelle slowly worked on the lion, dragging him into her anal passage at a glacial pace. Granted, it was not easy doing this with no outside help. But the inescapable nature of her actions made things all the more satisfying. With each pull she felt the cub unwillingly stimulating her even deeper and more profoundly. Her sister just loved watching the little lion slowly vanish up the hippo's ass. She was a little jealous, but they'd have plenty of time with the cub. She'd get to show off her own little tricks with him in due time. The odd fart from Michelle prompted a little twitch and squirm from the little legs still outside of her. She could clench her buttcheeks together and crush them, but she was far too focused on pulling those little legs in with the rest of the cub. His hips were a little wider then the torso she'd taken in until now. Her walking slowed and she groaned as her body worked its way past that last obstacle. The rest would be smooth sailing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt himself slip in deeper, the muscular ring now bearing down on his legs. This would be child's play for the hippo and she seemed to know it. Almost as a celebration she sent several smaller farts down her bowels to make the little lion feel welcome inside of her. Each volume of hot, noxious gas tortured his nose and hazed his mind. He had to breathe in the foul air to gain what little oxygen as present in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the last of him was pulled in too. His tail was slurped up like a string of spaghetti, vanishing in the slowly closing pucker. Simba's new home was dark, smelly and cramped. Michelle's walking caused his environment to constantly shake and squeeze him. His unsteady surroundings were lined with thick, smelly slime and the air inside was breathable but infused with the potent stench of hippo gas. It was going to take days to wash this unholy stench out of his fur. By far the worst though was feeling how he'd been reduced to a toy in her butt. He could hear her moan outside every time the walls bore down on him, squeezing and crushing his whole body. He'd squirm and wriggle as best he could, which seemed to be the only way to get her to release the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly an hour of Simba being squeezed and farted on, Michelle and Henriette finally reached their destination. It was a fairly remote stretch of land, marked by the presence of several large pools. Some of them were filled with water, but most of them were the mud pools the pair was talking about earlier. After a little bit of arguing, the hippos decide it is time to...</span></div></div>",

The load on his back lightened and faint giggling was heard. His surroundings then tilted the other way and the same routine followed. Simba figured the hippos were eating big mouthfuls of fruit one at a time. And whomsoever found a little lion among their fruit would win this little competition. With each mouthful of fruit removed from the bowl the weight on the cub's back diminished. Soon he had the ability to move back and not a moment too soon. He felt Michelle's hot breath brush against his skin with her last chomp. They were getting close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub used his newfound mobility and dug himself in deep among the fruit. The hippos' hunger seemed unending and with each new load of fruit taken out of the bowl they got closer and closer to their prey. On a few occasions Simba already felt the edges of a hippo maw brush against him. Eventually he was all that was left in the bowl. It tilted towards the winner of this depraved competition. Henriette's hungry stare leered at him ominously. The cub wondered for a moment if 'keeping him' meant him spending the night squeezed in her arms, or really anywhere not inside of her. The hippo removed all of those questions by opening her maw wide and leaning in. The little lion had to escape now or it'd be all night inside of a hippo belly. He tried to dash away, but the surface of the bowl was slippery with fruit juice. He couldn't find the grip to bolt away in time and the jaws closed around him. Henriette triumphantly lifted her prize from the bowl and showed it off to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"awww, he looks so cute like that.\" Michelle said, giggling at the little lion's situation. His upper body was hanging from the hippo's vast maw. Henriette quickly wrapped her dexterous tongue around his lower body and began to pull. Slowly but surely the cub was dragged past her big lips, screaming for help from whoever could hear him. His pleas fell on deaf ears and after milking the moment for a solid minute Henriette finishes the job and pulls him in completely. She suckles and slurps on her hapless little prey. Smacking loudly as if he's the last meal on the planet and she wants to savor every last moment. Michelle wasn't one for eating other animals whole, but even she got a little jealous at just how much fun her sister was having with the cub.</span></div></div>",

The slick surface gave him no help, and he began to slip. \"Please! Stop!\" he cried out. He screamed as he lost his grip and fell towards He riette's throat. Outside, Michelle watched as a lion-shaped bulge traveled down the hippo's threat with a single gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urp!\" Henriette belched. Simba braced himself for a terrifying demise. He fell further and further down her throats and into her belly, where he was sure he'd meet his end...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...only to not run into anything remotely deadly. He looked around himself, and saw no signs of digestive juices. \"We're herbivores, tiny. We can't digest lions like you.\" Simba sighed in relief, though he did feel embarrassed with his situation. Somehow, the king of the jungle wound up in a hippo's stomach, surrounded by chewed fruit and gross stomach smells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after a game like that, I think rest is only natural,\" Henriette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! What about me?\" Simba cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you're little head,\" Henriette began. \"I'll get you out of there in the morning.\" The two hippos chuckled at the events of that day and began to sleep. Simba hated the idea of sleeping in someone's stomach, but he couldn't exactly do anything about his situation. He tried to lie down somewhere without fruit, and sleep.

The walls around him shifted and moved, pushing him along in a wave of powerful inner muscle. His head bumped against a fleshy wall, which yielded surprisingly easy. Sunlight entered and the cub saw the outside savanna for the first time in many hours. His head popped out of Henriette's rear and the rest of him followed soon after. The process took just long enough for him to feel utterly disgusted before he flopped out. Below him was water, a shallow pond that she had perched her immense butt over. He yelped loudly when he came in contact with the cold water, landing with a loud splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wash up little guy. You're needed for a very important task.\" Henriette said, leaving the lion to his own devices for a minute. He was still dazed from the journey through her, meekly rinsing the foul stench of her stomach juices off of himself. Thoughts of escape could wait until the fetid odour had cleared up a little. Before he could turn his attention to fleeing the insane duo she returned, grabbing him by the scruff of his neck and carrying him over to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you've been our little guest, Michelle hasn't had a lot of time with you. You're going to fix that by giving her a massage.\" Henriette said confidently. Simba did not share her optimism. What kind of massage were they thinking of? Could he even manage massaging them with their thick hides? What if they weren't satisfied? Michelle was laid out on the floor, waiting for him to start. Her sister casually dropped the little lion on her back. The rigid skin barely moved on impact, further instilling a sense of dread in him. He pushed as hard as he could, but the hippo didn't seem to notice at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you started yet?\" She asked the lion. He was getting tired from all his efforts and Henriette had to work real hard not to laugh out loud. Michelle saw the contorted face her sister held and asked her what was going on. \"He's been going at it all this time!\" She says, bursting out in laughter. \"He's so weak you don't even feel anything.\" Michelle giggled a little too, feeling somewhat sorry for the puny cub. Even Simba managed a bitter smile. At least he wasn't getting punished for this, or so he hoped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's find him something more sensitive to massage.\" Michelle suggested. The lion's smiled disappeared immediately. There were few sensitive areas on a hippo and he preferred steering clear of all of them. Especially with these two hippos. They both thought in unison about areas the little lion could take care of. Michelle grew a devious smirk and shook the cub off her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a new place for you to massage. Now be gentle with me little guy, I want this to feel good.\" Henriette snorted with laughter at the thought of Simba being able to do any damage to her sister.

Their stalwart hero had been reduced to a ragdoll and was about to face off against two hippos. Nobody in the crowd would be mad enough to willingly stand up to that. They were both far to happy not being squashed by the pair of hippo wrestlers and they really wanted to see what they'd do to the little cub. For his part, the cub looked up at the two, silently hoping for a miracle. Pumbaa then began to nudge Timon with his snout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what gives?

The rest of the crowd seemed to be rapt with attention, eager to see the two hippos lay down the law.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what to do with this one?\" Michelle loudly asked. \"We really only want to play with the prince... I'm gonna need to sit down and think about this...\" She casually dropped Simba on the floor and dropped her big butt on top of him. With a heavy thud the cub found himself pinned underneath the hippo. Thankfully she didn't smother him completely under her butt, leaving his head free to breathe and watch what she would to with the little meerkat. Timon was begging for mercy, but it fell on deaf ears. Michelle's smile grew wide as she put his neck between two fingers on her other hand. She released Timon's scruff and grabbed his legs, pulling him like a rubber band. The meerkat's head couldn't slip past Michelle's fingers and his body proved surprisingly elastic, stretching thin.

The hippo had to be careful her prey didn't bounce right down her throat, lest she'd accidentally swallow him. The punishment for consuming an opponent was steep and she didn't want to suffer it. Timon got one more look at the light outside before the cavernous maw closed around him. His yelp was muffled as Henriette's tongue stirred around him. During all this, Simba was made to watch by Michelle, who was still sitting on him. His whole body was pinned underneath her fat ass and his head was held down, forced to watch his friend be tormented by another hippo's maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon felt the slimy tongue curl around him, dragging him back and forth through the mouth and slathering him with thick saliva. At times he was pushed against her teeth or lips, leaving a bulge visible from the outside. The crowd gasped at the spectacle. They'd seen Henriette take down people with her mouth before, but it was still special every time she beat some poor schmuck with nothing but her tongue. Timon's head popped out between her lips just once, screaming for help before quickly getting sucked back in. Michelle sat looking at her sister attentively, occasionally shifting her butt a little to enjoy the cub wriggling underneath her. She saw his horrified face and leaned down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better put up a good fight, or you're going in there too... or worse.\" Simon gulped. What could be worse then being almost eaten? He vowed not to find out and keep himself out of their mouths as best he could. Though he dreaded that when it came to it, he'd have bitterly little choice in the matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette grew bored with this glorified opening act. It was Simba that she really wanted to play with. She aimed towards the crowd and spat Timon out. The meerkat made a graceful arc before landing on top of Pumbaa, connecting with a wet splat and knocking him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two clowns won't bother us anymore.\" She huffed, looking back at Simba. \"It's just us now...\" </span></div></div>",

This hippo was going to do wh\u00e1t to him? With that gut? That'd be the death of him. He tried getting up, but his body wouldn't cooperate. Be it because of paralyzing fear, sheer stubbornness or perhaps a tinge of curiosity, he would not move. Henriette barely payed attention as she got down on all fours and sprinted towards the lion. Building up a good bit of speed in a short distance she leapt into the air. With all the grace one would expect of a flying hippo she stretched her arms and legs wide, looking Simba dead in the eye as gravity took her towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact felt almost surreal for Simba. At first her belly simply rested on him, pressing him downwards almost gently. As he was pushed to the floor the belly simply began to yield, folding around him. This didn't last long as eventually the belly simply enveloped him entirely, cutting off all light, but still feeling weirdly ethereal, almost weightless. Then, after what seemed like an eternity the weight settled in. First pressing along his spine before quickly pushing his whole body in on itself. He felt himself compress a little under the vast ocean of her mass, but the belly proved remarkably soft. The experience wasn't nearly as torturous as he'd feared. Then reality caught up with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't just pinned underneath a vast hippo gut, he had absolutely no movement at all. Not a millimeter could be found. What's worse is his lungs were thirsting for air, but the massive weight had pushed it all out and made finding a fresh breath nigh on impossible. He sucked what minute amounts of air there were left into his burning lungs and hoped the giant gut would allow him to breathe before he passes out. Worst of all was the cheering. Even buried underneath her massive belly, Simba could hear the crowd losing their minds. He never stood a chance and now he was squashed underneath some hippo for their entertainment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could only hope Henriette would release him before he passed out. It wouldn't be much of a show if he'd be knocked out in under a minute after all. A horrid question snuck into his mind though. Was passing out and giving a bad show really worse then being awake to experience the things this hippo still had in store for him?</span></div></div>",

But she had other plans for Simba. Things that would make being her belly-cushion seem like a nice relaxing vacation. She was well aware of him not having much air to work with and she felt his struggles peter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting him awake for the next round, she quickly rolled herself back into a sitting position, revealing Simba to the world once again. He was about ready to pass out, and gasped loudly when the sharp light hit his eyes. As wholly as he was surrounded by her mass he now felt the liberating freedom of not being buried in hippo belly. He was still dazed from the lack of air, but a few deep breaths had him regain some of his stamina. At that point he began to feel the damage her belly flop had done to him. His body ached from head to toe, and it was nothing short of a miracle nothing had broken. Every muscle burned and he needed serious effort just to stand. He prayed for any kind of pause, if just to let him recuperate a little. To his greater surprise he was given this time. He'd feared Henriette would have immediately continued her assault, but nothing happened. With a dazed, distant stare on his face he looked around. Was she really giving him an unofficial time out or was she preparing another big attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette hadn't moved at all, contently sitting on her big butt behind him and watching him squirm. She put a finger to her chin, pondering her next move. He wasn't going to be much use as a fighter anymore, so she'd have to do all the heavy lifting... again. But she kind of liked that. </span></div></div>",

Henriette would have to be a little careful, but this would knock the crowd dead. Simba was still struggling to stand, his time underneath the hippo's belly having done quite a number on him. He was worn, but ready to continue fighting if only he was given a minute to regain his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he felt next he couldn't immediately place. It was vaguely reminiscent of two elephant's trunks pushing on his lower back. It was only when the chill of slimy saliva pushed through his fur that he realized these were the hippo's lips. She planted a kiss on him with such enthusiasm he was pushed right back into a prone position. Her squishy lips pressed and squeezed around his lower back, as if she was somehow expecting it to kiss back. Simba was too dazed and confused to immediately dart away. He figured he'd let her continue whatever the hell this is, as it allowed him time to recover. Henriette noticed the lion's body relax. She giggled to herself, smiling broadly as she was about to reveal her hand to the hapless cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle push and pull of the heavy lips was practically soothing to Simba after the overwhelming massage he'd received. He barely noticed the gap between those lips getting wider and wider with every squishy push. Saliva began to soak his lower body as kissing slowly turned to suckling. Simba was a little worried at the weird sensations he was feeling, but she had been doing this for almost a solid minute now. He was about ready to spring his trap when he felt his tail slip inside. He'd accidentally pushed it past the tender lips of the hippo and had inadvertently given her the start sign she was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips were no longer content suckling the small of his back. She pushed further and opened her mouth slightly. This was already enough for them to slither halfway down his hips. Her rocking motions now lifted his hind legs off the ground and a chilling realization hit Simba: She was going to eat him! Adrenaline raced through his body and any haze there was left instantly vanished. He felt her tongue awaken and caress his tail. The large muscle playfully slathered it with more drool whilst the hippo stopped her rocking back and forth. Simba's hind legs were left suspended in the air as he felt Henriette suckling on his body and slowly pulled more of it into her maw. With some speed she slurped on the helpless cub. When his legs were inside her mouth, the hippo pursed her lips and sat up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by adrenaline, Simba's front claws had come out as a reflex, a desperate and futile gambit to anchor himself to the arena floor. As she lifted him into the air he pulled them back in, remembering the rules about drawing blood. He feared for a moment she would not be as concerned with these rules, particularly the one strictly forbidding the consumption of an opponent. He had more direct concerns to worry himself about though. with millimeters at a time his body was sucked into the wet cavern of Henriette's maw. Her pursed lips nullified any escape attempts and her slick tongue was unrelenting in applying a thick coat of saliva to every part of him it could reach. Henriette milked this glorious moment for all it's worth. She'd taunt the cub if her mouth wasn't presently full with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>slurp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery passing second brought him closer to his inevitable destination. Simba could only hope she'd have some degree of mercy with him in her mouth. He knew all too well of the awe-inspiring strength housed in a hippo's jaws. Once inside, there'd be nothing he could do to escape. Henriette for her part relished the cheering of the audience. The sheer volume of everyone around her was exhilarating. With every slurp she got closer to playing with the little lion in her mouth. The anticipation was almost too much to bear. But she remained patient, slowly slurping him in bit by agonizing bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>slurp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's shoulders almost reached the hippo's pursed lips. Her smile grew and she clumsily tried speaking with the cub in her mouth. \"Awy lawt words, cuh?\" was the best she could do. He pleaded with her. \"Please... no...\" but his lamenting fell on deaf ears. He felt her thick tongue curling around his lower body and with nothing but a brief scream he was pulled inside. Simba scrambled frantically, panicking to find a way out, any way out. Whatever he'd have to do, anything was better then this hell on earth. With her tongue encircling the cub Henriette got a good taste of him. Simba was absolutely delicious, but she knew the rules and more importantly the penalties for breaking them. No taste was worth being forced to throw him back up and having to throw a lengthy showmatch to him. The throwing up she could deal with, but letting this cub win in a showmatch? Her ego wouldn't allow it in a million years. Besides, he wasn't going anywhere. She could savour the cub's excellent taste for hours. And that's exactly what she will do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Everyone around the ring collectively held their breath as Simba was stuck inside the hippo's large maw. This 'king of the jungle' had been reduced to a whimpering heap, and soon he'd find out just how much strength resided in Henriette's mouth. The cub was given a moment to get used to his new surroundings. The slowly undulating tongue he rested on roiled with anticipation. The slick muscle felt strong. Brimming with power and almost eager to play with the little lion. All around him was the damp stench of hippo breath, making Simba feel a little queasy. He couldn't see much of anything in the pitch darkness, with only the odd flash of light passing the hippo's thick lips. Saliva was everywhere, soaking his fur and adding to the uneasy feeling that this hippo was really liking his taste.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette sat in the middle of the ring, all eyes turned to her. The audience eagerly awaited her next move and with the biggest smirk she clenched her jaws together. \"Whoops! I just couldn't help myself.\" She said jokingly. A gasp went around the audience. Had she really just done that? Before any outrage could even start she opened her maw wide and revealed the little cub to be fine. A little worse for wear and dazed by the bright light, but fine. It impressed on the audience just how truly vast her mouth was compared to the little runt sputtering on her tongue. In spite of his predicament, he still moved himself forward, somehow hoping that if he pulled himself free of her mouth she'd give up on him. Even someone as big as Henriette had to admire the little cub's tenacity. But she was nothing if not willing to see how far this fortitude could be pushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe huge hippo jaws closed again, trapping Simba once again in darkness. The tongue below him stirred into motion, licking his legs and curling over his back in a gentle fashion. With surprising dexterity and a soothing touch the tongue slithered all over the little lion, leaving a thick blanket of saliva on him. Henriette even briefly considered pushing the tongue in Simba's mouth, but that'd be a bit too much. He was only a cub after all. And since cubs like to play, she knew the perfect game. The little lion wasn't quite as much of a fan of tongue wrestling as Henriette thought. Her thick tongue brought it's immense strength to bear as it coiled around Simba's torso and dragged him around the inside of her maw. Occasionally he'd be flung to the side, only to be pressed forcefully into the side of the hippo's mouth, past the few teeth present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectators could actually witness these moments, as a distinctly lion-shaped bulge would appear in Henriette's cheek. Sometimes a paw pushed out between her lips, but she playfully slurped those right back in. The crowd could only guess what kind of saliva-drenched rollercoaster Simba was on. Had they known how roughly he was getting thrown around in there, they may've felt some pity. There wasn't a corner of her mouth the cub wasn't pushed into. After a solid ten minutes the crowd got a little bored of watching the hippo smack and slurp on the little lion in her mouth. Henriette didn't care though. This kind of taste was a once in a lifetime experience and she was going to take full advantage of her little playmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she opened her mouth again Simba didn't have the fight left in him to move at all. He was still there, bruised but awake. He was however covered from head to toe in a large volume of hippo drool. It clung to his fur and oozed down his sides. It was a good thing there was some space between the hippo and the crowd as the foul breath could knock out a zebra. She pushed him up with her tongue, mocking his inability to even stand up anymore. Slowly she pushed him forward a little as well, under the cub found purchase on the soft lower lip. He found his vigor renewed and pulled his slickened body towards the edge. Must escape the mouth. No matter what, I must escape the mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he reached the tipping point and was about to slide down on to her belly the hippo closed her mouth once again. Her smile curled up with a cruel twist. \"reawy fo' roun' two?\" She cooed as she effortlessly slurped Simba back inside her mouth. The cub yelled in surprise before being sealed inside again. The game Henriette played with him had changed. This appeared to be some kind of slimy parody of hide and seek. Simba tried his hardest to avoid the probing tongue, slowly moving around the hippo's mouth. If it touched him, she would coil her touch around the helpless cub and drag him back to the middle before squeezing him and slamming him face-first in the puddle of drool that amassed under the tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also loosened up her lips a little, making it much easier for Simba to poke his head through. Though whenever he did, she immediately counted it as having found the little cub. As a result Simba's messages were little more then one-word please before he'd be yanked back out of sight again. \"Help!\" \"Please!' was the most that could be mustered. None in the crowd were too eager to help, as Simba got punished for these interruptions to Henriette's joy. The punishment often entailed more roughhousing from her tongue. Coiling, squeezing and flinging Simba all over her maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been 30 minutes since the cub had been left at the mercy of Henriette's big tongue. She could see the audience's boredom reach a critical level. Enough is enough. Maybe if she plays her cards right with Timon and Pumbaa she can experience this again. But for now the show must go on. She gently pushes him forward, letting his head pop through her lips. His expression is broken, his gaze distant. She could feel his heartbeat and breathing, but he wasn't able to do much else. Simba had spent the last half hour being squeezed, shoved, coiled, dragged and flung around by her thick tongue. His coat of saliva seemed to have a coat of it's own, that's how thick it was slathered onto his weary body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette leaned backward, slowly pushing Simba out of her mouth through pursed lips to control his descent. The saliva-drenched cub barely moves as he lies on the hippo's belly. At this point the vulture flies in to see if the fight can be continued.</span></div></div>",

The vulture holds up a paw, but the cub's body is like jelly in his hands. The cub couldn't even stand and barely responded to the vulture checking him up at all. Henriette just sat on her rear, watching the slimy lion try to make sense of what he'd been through over the last half an hour. She knew this fight was pretty much over. With the cub in this condition, there was nothing more she could do to him. There were some things she w\u00e1nted to do to him, but those were either forbidden or just a repeat of the last half hour and the crowd would probably boo her out at that time. So she remained patient, confident in how this situation would unfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba is no longer able to fight! Your winner for this match is...

Henriette, what will you decide?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon and Pumbaa were in the sidelines, quietly devastated at the results. The champion they've been propping up around here had been utterly humiliated. Henriette never even broke a sweat as she flattened him and toyed with his body like Simba was nothing more then a plaything to her. And the way she just kept on suckling and slurping on his body was downright unsettling. The two of them wanted to go in and get the little lion out of there, to clean him up and mend his bruised body and spirit. But they knew Henriette. She wasn't one to leave her playthings behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you've probably all already guessed, I lay claim to this lion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs the lion and carries him off to her home. Simba just groans, his bruised body in no state to object to the verdict. The hippo is too occupied just relishing the thought at all the things they can do together. Outside the arena, there were no pesky rules. So many great games to play with her new lion, and only so much time left in the day. After a good hour's walk she arrived at her home, having carried Simba...</span></div></div>",

Along the way she'd occasionally play tricks on him with her tongue, but for the most part she was content to just let him sit on it. His little head stuck out between her lips as they gently held him in place. With the exception of the moments she suddenly dragged him back into her maw the ride was surprisingly relaxing. It was a welcome reprieve from the rough treatment he got earlier. Though he was still sore all over, he at least felt like things might not go quite as spectacularly bad as they had for the last hour. Henriette had been humming assorted tunes, enjoying the little cub in her mouth. His heavenly taste was a powerful as ever, and she was going to get everything she could out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last they arrived at Henriette's home. A shady little corner of the savannah with some pleasant features for the both of them. A grassy patch that had clearly been used to sleep in for some time now provided the hippo a place to gently spit out her passenger. Close by was a little pool of water. Large enough for her to bathe in, but too small to draw in lots of other animals. Lastly and most prominently were the mud pits. Each at least as big as the body of water and alltogether around a dozen of them. Simba was unsure on what to do. He knew Henriette had 'claimed' him, but he was unsure on the meaning of this. Timon and Pumbaa never told him about this part of the fighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo seemed to notice his confusion and laid down the rules in a commanding tone. \"Listen up cub, you're mine now. That means you stay by me at all times. If you run, I will hunt you, I will find you and I w\u00edll eat you! Are we clear?\" Simba nodded meekly, and her harsh glare immediately faded. \"Excellent, now that we've got that out of the way, where to you want to start? A bath? or maybe some rest? You've been through a lot.\" Her tone was friendly, almost suspiciously so.</span></div></div>",

Very well, a bath it is.\" Simba was relieved to hear her treat him with some semblance of kindness for the first time since they met.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mud bath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Simba stammered as the hippo grabbed him by the tail and lifted him into the air. Without a word, Henriette flung the cub towards the mud pits. He sailed through the air in a graceful arc before landing face first in the thick mud. It was surprisingly warm and comfortable, even if the earthy smell gave him flashbacks to being pinned underneath the hippo's gut. It took considerable effort to right himself and get his head out of the warm mass. Once he'd freed himself he noticed he barely had to swim at all to stay afloat in the thick muck. It appeared to be so dense he'd float no matter what. Suddenly his attention was drawn to the increasingly rapid heavy footsteps thundering towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette got a racing start before leaping into the same pool as Simba. Her body soared over the little lion, giving him even worse flashbacks about her gut. She flew straight past the cub and landed in the mud with a huge splash. The lion looked away to avoid getting a face full of sloppy muck. \"Aaaaaaah, this stuff's simply the best, whelp. You just lie back and relax, let the heat draw the pain of sore muscles and bruises right out of you.\" Skeptical at first, Simba tried her advice and relaxed his body. He sank up to his shoulders into the mud and tilted himself a little backward, shoving his front paws into the warm mud too. He closed his eyes and felt himself calm down entirely. Almost exactly as she said, the warmth of the muck around him began to coax the pain out of his little body. The crushing from her gut and squeezing from her tongue all felt like they'd happened years, not hours ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Years ago I discovered these pools. Heat from an underground thermal vent keeps everything nice and warm. And the mud works wonders for my skin too, as I'm sure you've felt.\" She grinned at the cub, who couldn't care less about her words. He was in his own little section of heaven, his wracked body finally getting the rest it so sorely needed. \"Of course you gotta add a little heat yourself too sometimes.\" She chuckled, before some extra bubbles appeared in the muck near her butt. The miasma of stench crawling towards the cub finally broke his relaxation, as he looked at Henriette with a small glare. She put on her most innocent smile. The both of them spent an hour soaking in the mud in almost complete silence, letting all their worries float away to the soothing music of the bubbles in the mud pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, Henriette decides to...</span></div></div>",

The dense mud made any movement ten times harder, but also gave the cub a lot of natural buoyancy. When all was said and done he could keep his head above the surface and slowly tread around. He tried to pull himself free, but it was to no avail. Only on the side of the pool would he have the grip to free himself. Or he would need a helping hand from Henriette. She was around, he saw the mud shift and churn, failing to hide her round body as it circled him. But now she had sank down even deeper, hidden from the cub but still present somewhere in this mud pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA clue to her position was given when Simba felt bubbles rush past him. She must be directly below him, trying to scare him. 'It'll take more then some hippo breath to scare this mighty lion' Simba thought to himself. The moment the first bubble surfaced and popped it was clear Henriette agreed with his suggestion. The air was quickly given the familiar stink of hippo farts that he had experienced earlier. As more bubbles popped around him the stench intensified, making his already tired body cough and strain to breathe the foul air. The little lion began to move as fast as he could away from this bubbling cauldron of hippo gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he felt precisely what Henriette had in store for him. A strong hand grabbed his submerged tail. The hippo pulled a little on the lion's tail, dragging his head perilously close to the surface of the mud. She'd ease off on him as long as he didn't try to swim away. She wanted him to stay put right at the epicenter of her flatulent eruptions. His eyes watered and his nostrils felt like they were on fire. The potent stink of hippo gas was enough to strip the bark from trees. There was no way around it, the cub was stuck right in the middle of it. 'She can't have much more in her then that' Simba thought to himself. But Henriette gradually released her horrifying gas attack, producing an almost unreal amount of farts. The torment lasted minutes, but to Simba it may as well have been days. The slightest hint of him trying to escape the bubbling mud was punished by the hippo dragging him down into the muck. Her grip on his tail was unwavering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe feels herself drain of her precious farts and holds on to the last reserves. Underneath the little lion Henriette concentrates and releases one last thundering volley. It felt pleasantly warm escaping her, and she was sure Simba would appreciate this gesture. He felt the sudden rush of bubbles rise up all around him. The mud pool's surface bubbled briefly but intensely, dramatically increasing the stench in the air. The struggling cub had to put all his effort in just staying conscious. Thoughts of futile escape were gone, replaced by thoughts of mere survival. Deep beneath him the hippo silently smiled, proud of this latest game she had conjured. She finally released her prey and resurfaced near him. The hippo quickly rose up and grabbed the almost submerged lion in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Henriette do next?</span></div></div>",

The cub got another good look at the massive jaws he'd spent the last hour in before Henriette bumbled over to her bed. It was getting late and the games would be just as fun tomorrow, possibly moreso with the little lion in a less worn out state. The flattened grass that was her bed was not the most comfortable thing, but it beat sleeping on the ground. She looked up to Simba and spoke with a stern voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whelp, get over here.\" Simba obeyed, recognizing that a tired hippo makes for a cranky hippo. \"Give me a good night kiss!\" The cub recoiled. He had to kiss... that? With great hesitation he pushed himself towards the hippo's pursed lips and pressed his nose against them. The hippo's powerful smooch pulled his head further between her lips. His muzzle was already held shut, and she didn't seem to relent. Only after sucking his entire head into her mouth and licking if from all angles was she pleased. Simba didn't care, he'd been given so many coats of saliva today another one barely even mattered. Her next order on the other had was a new one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put your tail under there.\" She commanded, pointing at her gut. Simba was shocked. Even after all of today's events, she hadn't squashed him enough? \"What? Why?\" he stammered. \"Because otherwise you'd run off the moment I fall asleep, and I cannot be bothered chasing you across half the damn Savannah! Now put your tail under there or I'm going to put all of you under there!\" Simba's back still hurt from the last time that happened, so he meekly obeyed, allowing the hippo to lie down on his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what if you roll over me during your sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't roll in my sleep, too fat for it. Don't worry, I won't steamroller you until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what?\" Simba gasped but there was no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

A good night's sleep helped him wear off all of the muscle ache and other assorted pains from yesterday's match. The first thing he noticed on waking up was Henriette's bulk no longer resting on his tail. He gave it a happy wag just o make sure it still worked. Remarkably it felt as good as the rest of him, in spite of having been flattened by a fat hippo gut all night long. Then a very familiar feeling washes over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba feels the hippo's big lips suckling the small of his back again. 'Oh no, not again, not right away!' he thought. Thankfully his reactions weren't dulled by a belly flop this time and he jumped out of harm's way. He thanked his lucky stars he had avoided another god knows how long mouthplay session, but the hippo wasn't so easily amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright whelp, listen closely. Today's game is Predator. You'll be the helpless fleeing prey and I'll be the hungry predator. If you can avoid me long enough for me to throw in the towel I'll keep you out of my mouth for the rest of the day. Hippo's honor!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if you win?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you're going in here.\" Henriette calmly stated, patting her big belly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insane, that'd kill me?!\" Simba shouted, shocked to hear the hippo's insane game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a myth. If you go into there in one piece you can last hours, maybe even days. Trust me, I kept track of it for a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will you keep me inside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends on how well you do at avoiding me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rules agreed upon and the stakes raised, the hippo began a countdown. Simba only had six seconds to get a head start before the ravenous hippo would give chase. He ran as fast as his little legs would take him. Soon he heard the familiar rumble of heavy footsteps. the sound got louder, she was gaining on him! Simba darted into the undergrowth, hoping the thick shrubs would block her wide girth. He hadn't counted on just how much she wanted to feel a tasty lion cub go down her throat. Henriette barreled right through the bushes, making Simba yelp in fear as he has to find another strategy to outmaneuver the hungry hippo. In spite of her reassurances, the cub ran like he was chased by death itself. He knew what kind of slimy hell was located in her mouth. He dreaded to think what her stomach would be like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion tried every trick in the book to avoid the hippo's maw, but every time he thought he was gaining some precious distance she would surprise him by simply bulldozing the obstacles he'd carefully sidestepped. After almost fifteen minutes of solid high-speed pursuit the hippo finally caught a lucky break. As Simba was trying to run around her and slip away she managed to intercept him. Her huge maw immediately grabbed hold of him and lifted him into the air. This game was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she'd never tell him, Henriette was impressed by the quick little cub's dexterity and tenacity. Now though, it was her time to determine what to do with the captured lion. </span></div></div>",

She was about to send him into her belly, where she normally puts her food. He couldn't believe he was reduced to this, a hippo's little victory snack. She interrupted his ceaseless worrying with a little shake and spoke to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did well, cub. Not many can keep out of my maw for fifteen minutes. As a reward, you'll only have to spend that time in my belly.\" She said with a smile. Henriette had enjoyed the chase immensely. Normally only predators would show this sort of hunting behaviour. She had stumbled upon it by accident one day, warding off her territory from a lone marauding hyena. At some point she'd scared him off far enough, but the urge to run after it never left. She wanted that hyena. that... morsel. She kept on chasing it, and eventually caught her target. She didn't really know what to do with a struggling hyena in her jaws, so she let the terrified scavenger out. Ever since that moment she kept her predatory instincts to herself. The thrill of the chase excited her, and she was sincerely grateful the cub did so well. But that wasn't going to save him from what was coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba quivered like a reed as Henriette brought him back close to her mouth. She planted a big kiss on his chest and gave him a large, playful lick. She opened wide, showing the shaking lion the black void down her gullet. Simba began to actively struggle against her. It did little to slow her, but she loved it all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, perfect! I love it when they struggle going down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helpless cub was deposited on her tongue once more and shrouded in darkness as she closed her maw. Henriette almost moaned in pleasure as she played around with the little lion in her mouth. She shoved him, grabbed him, squeezed him and released him over and over again. A few minutes of fun, who could object to that? Perhaps Simba, but his opinion wasn't really relevant to her right now. All that mattered was his taste, and on that front he delivered in spades. She simply couldn't keep herself waiting any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe large, strong tongue grabbed hold of Simba and began to drag him backwards, towards the gullet. He felt the edge of the muscles lining her throat and doubled his efforts. The large tongue held him down easily as it continued to push the cub towards the inevitable. Finally the hippo's gullet got hold of his hind legs, squeezing them together and pulling on the rest of his body. Henriette swallowed again and again, drawing more and more of the little lion down her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth his hind legs were now completely trapped, his fate was sealed as he felt them brush against the slick tunnel of her esophagus. The powerful muscles lining her throat squeezed and undulated, preparing for the next...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gulp</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's torso offered little resistance as it was sucked down the hippo's throat. Everything up to his shoulders was now slowly slipping further towards her stomach. He tried to grab hold of her tongue, but it kept itself unavailable, leaving the little lion to his own devices whilst being pullet down Henriette's gullet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>GULP</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last powerful squeeze sealed his fate. He slid down the smooth tunnel of her throat to meet his inevitable demise in the stomach. With loud gurgling and dripping he was introduced into this innermost part of Henriette. The cub landed in a sticky pool of goop, quickly determining this to be the dreaded stomach acids. He leapt aside, but the walls were too smooth for him to get a grip. He fell back in the pool, thrashing around and screaming bloody murder. It takes him almost a full minute before things begin to fall into place for him. First and foremost, this fearsome acid seemed to do almost nothing at all. No painful stinging or even much of a vague tickling sensation at all. With time and the inescapable nature of his prison that could've been a problem, but for fifteen minutes he hardly had to worry. Secondly the air was, though foul-smelling, quite breathable. Slowly he came to realize the hippo might have spoken the truth, strange as it may have sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette enjoyed the wild flailing inside her belly immensely. She pats its huge mass, inadvertently sounding like a heavy drum inside of there. The cub was fighting to survive, and as a result had been outright delightful squirming down her throat and into her belly. It was everything she had hoped for and more. Her stomach joyfully bounced the little cub around inside of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom Simba's perspective things were a bit less happy. The slick walls had come alive and were slamming him across the room. His fur became soaked with the stinking goop inside of Henriette. It was nearly impossible to maintain his balance. He fell over frequently and landed in the puddle of slime. The hot, foul air was irritating his nostrils. As the minutes crawled by his struggles diminished. He knew none of it was going to do anything. For now he'd be stuck in this sweltering, squishy chamber. Suddenly Henriette's voice rumbles all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your fifteen minutes are up. That's enough of you squirming in there. Time to come back up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all the warning he got as the walls closed in on him. He was pushed back up through the esophagus and into the mouth once again. Henriette wasn't quite ready to let this be the end of it. So before he could react her thick tongue wrapped itself around him. She licked the cub clean of her stomach juices, replacing them with a heavy coat of saliva. Simba was almost growing accustomed to it. After a few minutes of this tongue bath Henriette pursed her lips and pushed the little lion's head through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright sunlight stung Simba's eyes, but he quickly adjusted to it. His head was thoroughly slathered in drool and held firmly in place by her big lips. He was able to look around only by virtue of Henriette turning her head. She pointed him at the pool of clear water nearby and looked up a little. With careful aim she then spat the cub towards the pool. His drool-soaked body sailed through the air screaming before landing right in the middle of the pool with a big splash. Simba thrashed around a moment before righting himself and swimming back to the surface. The cold water was really pleasant to him, having spent the last half an hour inside the hippo's hot mouth and stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba swam around, washing the drool out of his fur. When he was done, he felt refreshed. He knew today had only just started though. What other games did Henriette have in store for him? </span></div></div>",

Simba feared future games were going to only get worse. After all, she'd only used her mouth so far. There were plenty of other parts she could use to play with. He remembered getting flattened under her belly and shuddered at what she might do to him with her butt. He had no intention on finding out. He knew she'd eat him if he ran off. But she'd proven she'd eat him if he didn't too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalmly he swam to the side of the pool. He got out as quietly as possible, keeping an eye on the hippo. She was still lost in her own world, relishing his taste. Seeing Henriette this happy about the way he tasted further cemented the idea he had to get away from her. Stealthily he snuck into the undergrowth, wandering around to see if the hippo wasn't tricking him somehow. When he finally felt safe enough, he made a break for it. Running towards the open plains of the Savannah he'd use his speed and cunning to build a big head start before making his trail disappear with some clever tricks. The plan sounded good, right up until he heard a terrifying sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy thunder of hippo footsteps got closer behind him, with Henriette's voice booming loudly. \"Another round of Predator? Oh, you spoil me, Simba!\" The cub's bravado broke, his cunning escape now another frantic sprint for survival. He couldn't tell from her voice if she caught on to him trying to escape or just wanted to play. She got closer and closer to him, but he'd learned from the last time. Simba didn't bother with ducking and weaving past shrubs. Nothing short of a tree or large boulder would knock this hippo off course. His strategy worked well, but Henriette was unrelenting. He could hear her panting loudly. She was just as out of breath as him, but neither wanted to be the first one to fold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually something just had to go wrong, and a missed low branch sent Simba tumbling into the undergrowth. The hippo was onto him, relishing her victory. The cub's leg hurt and he was frankly too tired to get away again. Henriette...</span></div></div>",

Though Henriette wouldn't tell the lion this in a thousand years, she was quietly proud of Simba. The plucky little cub proved to be a great prey to play around with. He was fast and agile, but still catchable. Not to mention that tenacity. She was out of breath and then some, but he was too. He'd run from her until his legs couldn't take him any further. Few of her past play-mates had ever achieved that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba for his part was simply done. He'd twisted his leg and running was entirely out of the picture for a while. By now he had a surprisingly large amount of experience with the inside of the hippo's mouth, and he hoped his performance would grant him some form of mercy. But as hot breath washed over him the inevitable didn't take place. He didn't feel her slimy tongue drag across his body nor her lips suckling him. Instead the warm flow of hippo breath receded as she closed her mouth. Simba looked over his shoulder to see what she was up to, only to find her staring at him. She was lost in thought for a moment before refocusing her attention to him, a large frown adorning her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you just try to escape from me?\" She asked calmly, her tone failing to contain a sinister combination of anger and malice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew. Henriette was aware of his escape attempt and she was none too pleased about it. Simba could only respond with shocked silence, all the hippo needed to confirm her suspicions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you what would happen, but I guess a little demonstration is in order. No more playing around, I have to teach my little cub a lesson.\" She spoke harshly, before opening her maw again, approaching Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wastes no time scooping half the lion off the floor and closing her jaws, lifting the rest of him up in the air before quickly slurping it in with the rest. Simba was familiar with the insides of her mouth, but this time around everything was decidedly less playful. Her tongue pressed him against the ceiling with remarkable strength. He felt the air being pushed out of his lungs and the slick surface of the tongue slowly flattening him. As sudden as he was squashed up against the roof of her mouth Simba was dropped back down, only for the tongue to slam into him again and pin him to the side of her jaws. He used to think she was playing rough, but this was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcern switched to outright panic however when he was shoved onto a row of molars. Henriette's little lesson in obedience wasn't going to half-ass anything and Simba quickly found himself pinned between her teeth. He squealed in terror and closed his eyes. Then he opened them again. He was held firmly between the two rows of flat teeth. They pressed down a bit from time to time, but this was nothing like what he'd expected. He knew how strong a hippo's bite was. There was no way he should have survived this, and at that point things began to sink in. Most notably her teeth, which started slowly grinding a little back and forth, roughly squeezing the cub between them. Simba groaned in pain and discomfort as Henriette gently pressed her jaws together a little harder. She took utmost care not to break him, but she'd be damned if that sneaky cub wasn't going to suffer. Simba could barely believe what he was feeling. The overwhelming strength of the jaws crushed and squeezed him, compressing his body until his bones creaked, but never any further. Even now the hippo was making sure not to kill him, to preserve her toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette walked back to her home, chewing on the cub along the way. Once they'd arrived she spat him out into her bed. Darkness had set in and she was getting ready to sleep. Simba was barely able to stand, coated in sticky saliva and utterly wracked with pain. He was miraculously without injury barring the leg, and that would probably be gone by tomorrow. The hippo quite literally chewing him out for trying to flee was another story. Said hippo didn't quite appear to be done with him just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay runt, this is what's gonna happen now...\"</span></div></div>",

He had experienced being under as well as being in her belly. His mind flashed back to the overwhelming mass of her gut resting on top of him during their match. The uniquely terrifying experience of sliding down a hippo's throat and spending some time in her stomach was still freshly seared into his memory as well.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henriette was quietly surprised at the cub's decision. After spending so much time in her mouth and even going for a brief trip into her belly, he wanted more? Her voracious side was overjoyed. She prepared to eat him once again when Simba raised a paw. She paused, curious what the little lion wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I can make one teensy request though... could you swallow me quickly? I'm too tired to put up much of a struggle in your mouth anymore, and I know how much you like that. I just don't want to disappoint you.\" The cub lied through his teeth, hoping to hit a soft spot with his captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should've thought of that before trying to escape. Nevertheless, I am quite tired too, so I'll keep it short.\" She replied, opening her maw expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way around this. The little lion gulped as he cautiously walked towards the large mouth. Strands of saliva hung from the ceiling, further reinforcing the powerful resistance Simba felt with every step. Every fiber of his body urged him not to do it, but he knew that much worse would await him if he chickened out right now. From what he'd gleaned the hippo's stomach was effectively harmless to him, and while she slept it would be a lot more protected then being squashed flat under her belly. Henriette expected the cub to have some difficulty following up on his words and showed some patience. However, the moment he set a paw in her mouth it snapped shut like a bear trap. With ease she slurped the remainder of his dangling body inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue was ready for action and quickly wrapped itself around Simba for a little squeeze. Henriette murred as even in his fatigued state she managed to squish some desperate struggles out of him. The meaty tongue threw the ragdoll of a lion around a few times, slamming him into the sides of the hippo's mouth after each throw. After just a few throws she tilted her head up and opened her maw, allowing the cub one last look outside as he slid downwards towards her hungry gullet. In a flash it gulped down half of his body and a second loud gulp sent him to his slimy sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach of the hippo was in the exact same state he left it in. The dry stench of digesting plant matter with the overwhelming aroma of her freshly applied coat of saliva did remarkably little for Simba. He feared he was already getting used to the horrid stench on her inside. Though that may be a blessing, considering he'd be stuck with this voracious hippo for the foreseeable future. The walls that pushed and churned him earlier today were a lot calmer in the evening. The cub felt the hippo lie down in her bed, as far as Simba could consider the patch of squashed reeds a bed. His chamber was spacious enough, had air and was soundproof on all sides with a thick layer of hippo fat. The little lion got ready for the night and settled himself on the edge of the stomach, keeping out of the pool of stomach juices in the middle as much as possible. Sleep proved hard, but the day's events had left him bruised and knackered. He fell asleep pretty much the moment he laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

She stood on her bed, patiently waiting for Simba to stumble over to her and take place under his 'blanket'. He had a rough day, and was almost looking forward to getting some sleep, even if it was underneath her heavy gut. When the little lion was in place underneath her, he lied down and simply waited for the inevitable. Henriette looked under her belly and sighed with pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unless you've learned how to live without air, I'd scoot a little to the side. I don't want you to suffocate, I'm not th\u00e1t horrible.\" She said with a comforting smile. Simba quickly shuffled a bit to the side. His head would be free, sticking out from underneath her. He'd smile at how funny it would look if he wasn't tired beyond compare. He flopped onto his belly and practically fell asleep on the spot. He did still notice the hippo plant a big good night kiss on him, her lips pressing against most of his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was time for Henriette to sleep. She stood over the little lion and basically just dropped all of herself down at once. Simba gasped at the sudden amount of mass enveloping almost his entire body. Her jiggly gut rested on his back, flattening his whole body a little. This time around he knew sort of what to expect, but he was still taken aback by the hippo's immense weight. At least his head stayed clear, allowing him to breathe. A pang of dread shot through him as he feared for a moment she could roll over, but he remembered the first night. She had been right, and never moved an inch all night. Simba didn't quite understand how she could perform such a feat, but with the help of her giant gut, he as sure he would match it tonight. He calmed himself down and settled in for the night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dawn had only just broken and Henriette was already waking up. Yesterday's game of chasing the little lion around had left her muscles sore. She groggily looked around, seeming to have forgotten she like right next to a field of mud pits. With a sleepy smile she sauntered over to their bubbly goodness. In her still partly-sleeping state she hadn't noticed yet, but Henriette was carrying a passenger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba had spent a full night stuck underneath the hippo's sizeable belly. Its weight was immense, but eventually he did fall asleep. During the night Henriette's belly moulded itself around him, slightly reducing the burden he had to bear and pressing the two of them together for hours to come. The result was almost comical. The little cub was stuck to her belly, still asleep. As her pudgy gut swayed gently from side to side so did Simba, still happily dreaming of a world where he was getting squashed by a hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween the two of them there was about enough active thought going on to power a sloth, but Henriette was mostly focused on soothing her aching frame. She carefully sat down next to the pools and reached a toe in. The mud was perfect, the network of steam geysers running through the earth keeping it at a constant pleasant warmth. She slowly slid herself into the pool when the hippo finally noticed her little passenger, still asleep. She smiled at the cub and thought about what it must've looked like for her to walk to the pool with him still glued to her gut. She giggled a little, causing her belly to shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween her having slept on top of him and the events of yesterday Henriette felt like the cub could use a mud bath too. And just like that she cooked up another little game for the situation. Seemingly unconcerned about the lion, she lowered herself further into the pool as planned. Her shaking gut had apparently stirred the cub out of his sleep, but he was still far from awake. The warm touch of mud against his body did considerably more to wake him. He barely grasped what was going on by the time he was already half submerged into the bubbling dirt. He looked around in a panic, feeling the mud engulf him more and more. He looked Henriette in the eye, but all she did was wave at him as he vanished into the mud. Simba had taken a deep breath and was beginning to clue in to what was happening. He had to pull himself free from her belly and struggle his way to the surface quickly before she pulled him down too deep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe squirming and fighting felt great to Henriette, who loved feeling the little lion fight her body. The bond her sweaty belly and the lion's body had formed proved difficult to loosen. Simba being buried in mud didn't help much either. She was content to watch a little longer and see what'd happen, but the cub had far less enthusiasm for this scenario. He fought mightily, slowly peeling himself off of the hippo's gut. How well does he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba fights to tear himself free from the hippo's belly, but the sticky bond formed overnight proves tough to break. The mud heaping on top of him also adds more and more mass for him to contend with. It's beginning to feel like the belly isn't sinking any deeper, but the cub's situation is dire. He took a deep breath before going under and concentrated all of his efforts. He was mostly free, but his lower back still clung to her sweaty gut. 'I must not panic, I've got precious little air left. It can't go to waste.' The little lion thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Henriette could feel the cub desperately try to fight himself free. It amused her to no end that they'd become stuck together overnight, and even that little bond was too hard for Simba to break. Her belly shuddered with laughter. After a while she did become concerned the cub's struggles were weakening. \"I'd best interfere, before he gets himself hurt again.\" She sighed, reaching an arm into the mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's lungs were on their last legs. Was he really going to drown in a mudbath, stuck to a fat, sweaty belly? He could feel it jiggle and shake, and he knew it was probably that evil hippo laughing at him. Suddenly he felt something else stir in the mud, and a strong hand grabbed his tail. He was yanked back up. The strong arm lifting him had no problem tearing him free from the belly and pulling him out of the mud. The moment he broke the surface he took a deep breath. Precious air flooded his systems, along with the grimy taste of the dirt around his mouth. He didn't care though. He was safe, for now. He rubbed the mud from his eyes and looked at his saviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo was about to burst, and the look of a mud-drenched cub looking up to her was the final straw. She erupted in laughter, thinking about how pathetic the cub had been. Underneath all the dirt, Simba was red with embarrassment. \"Hahahaha, you were stuck to my belly... and you couldn't even pull free... I almost drowned you, just taking a bath! Hahahaha.\" Slowly her laughter petered out as the cub simply waited for her to release him. After a few more minutes she hoisted him to her side and casually dropped him into the mud. He landed with a small splash, and quickly found himself having little difficulty staying afloat in the dense mud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, cub. These pools are great for sore muscles, and I'm guessing that after yesterday's events you've got plenty of those to spare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith him no longer in mortal peril, the aching muscles did come back to the forefront. She was right, yesterday was rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax and let the warm mud do its work. I know I'm needing it. It's not often my prey gives me that much of a workout.\" She said, and for the first time, Simba talked to her with something more then a desperate plea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easy to run when there's a hungry hippo right behind you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you didn't just panic. You were still thinking clear, using the terrain to slow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that it did much good.\" Simba sulked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, you avoided me well enough that I'm still feeling my muscles burn from it. Most toys don't leave that big an impression. For all the laughs I have at your expense, I do like having you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still have the chewing to remind me of that.\" Simba replied, afraid for a moment he'd gotten a little too sassy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was probably a bit excessive, sorry. But I needed to show you I don't take escape attempts lightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub was shocked. Did she just apologize? \"Well, message received loud and clear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette just smiled. The two of them lay in the pool for some time, letting the warmth relieve their sore bodies. Afterwards...</span></div></div>",

It'd do for Henriette, who knew exactly how she was going to administer her weight again. She cleared her throat and leaned forward. Simba looked up behind him, seeing the sitting hippo lean forward over him. It wasn't until her pudgy gut touch the floor that he realized her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Henriette slowly leaned forward to get on all fours she neglected to stand up on her hind legs. The result was her big gut practically rolling towards Simba, flattening against the ground and quickly gaining on him. He knew what it was like to be under there. The weight, the smell, the intimate contact with her thick skin. He never wanted to experience that again. Adrenaline surged through him and he launched himself forward, only to be halted almost as quickly and slam back onto the floor. His tail was already caught under her bulk and had kept him from escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette saw what happened and knew she had the little lion pinned. As a result she slowed her descent greatly, soaking in the situation. Simba was about to be buried into her belly again, albeit only for a moment. But he didn't know that, so he was panicking, fighting for his life. Her mighty gut rolled forward, slowly covering more of the lion's tail. Simba barely felt anything but the overwhelming sensation of being stuck and the overpowering fear of disappearing underneath the fat hippo again. After a brief pause the belly rolled on over his hind legs. The pressure was less then he expected, but he knew full well what was yet to come. His body was slowly engulfed by the vast mass of Henriette's pudgy belly. When only his head and some paws remained, she paused. Simba groaned and struggled to breathe with the weight pressing down on him. She simply smiled and got up on all fours. All things together Simba only vanished under her for a second or two, but it was no less torturous then before. Back with his body pressed firmly into the dirt he had to start over. This time however, Henriette was not so courteous as to wait for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calmly walked to the side and slowly reversed towards the lion. Simba looked to his right and saw he rotund butt approaching. He'd already endured two squishings, and it looked like number three would arrive shortly. With nothing but sheer willpower he got up again, but Henriette decisively stopped his escape. Her butt impacted the little lion with a heavy thud, instantly pinning him to the ground once again. She wouldn't let up until she'd wrung a good show out of him, no matter how many times she'd have to flatten the little lion. This time Simba was given the dubious honor of watching, as her butt had landed on his back, leaving his head and two little forepaws sticking out from underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, I think I sat in something. I do hope I didn't break it.\" She said to the crowd, who were loving every moment of it. Simba meanwhile was under more pressure then he'd ever felt. Under her gut a lot of the weight was spread around. The relatively small area of her butt meant he had to endure even more. He barely believed it was possible, but he was definitely convinced by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to make matters worse, Henriette...</span></div></div>",

His mouth drooped open to take in deep breaths of fresh air to replenish his energy. Simba knew he was in way over his head challenging this hippo, but unfortunately there was nothing he could do to get out of his predicament. His train of thought was broken by the sight of Henriette's ass entering his field of view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who you could have some fresh air?\" she asked rhetorically. She raised her ass up high into the air and let it drop like a boulder down on top of the cub. Unfortunately for little Simba, his mouth was left open when the mountainous ass buried him beneath it and left him very vulnerable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now you don't have my beautiful stink on you anymore! That's going to have to change right now.\" Henriette grunted before letting out a ground shaking <i> <b>FFRRRRUUUUMMPTT! </b> </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion's puffed up as his mouth was violated by the gas bomb and filled his lungs up with its noxious stench. He could taste every molecule of her gas that rolled around in his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, much better!\" said the confident hippo, wiggling her rump on top of her opponent. She could feel the runt's frail flails from beneath her spacious cheeks. This made her chuckle out loud. There was nothing Henriette loved more than burying her opponents beneath her. Her ass was a gift from the heavens and she was always ecstatic to use it whenever she could. She even gained a massive reputation because of it. Animals from all over the country would come to a match just to see that beautiful rump of hers in action. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> <i>BBRRRROOOPPTT!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was treated to a fresh dose of hippo farts directed straight into his mouth. The stink from her last fart still lingering and now more gas was added on to the stink. The cub's lungs felt heavy from the swampy nature of Henriette's sweaty leathery hindquarters and the raunchy fumes of her farts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it up little guy.

She began to shuffle in place, grinding her heavy ass down on the trapped lion. \"Let's rub my stink in good. I want the whole Savannah to know where you've been, little cub.\" She bore down on him with everything she had and the effect was chilling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt himself shifting and moving very slowly. More and more of his body was compacted by the smooth, leathery surface of her ass. Worse yet, he could feel himself slowly slipping between her cheeks, the only place with any amount of space left in this nightmare of a fight. The gassy torment never seized until he was met with the single worst feeling ever. He was wedged so deep between Henriette's flabby asscheeks that his nose was now touching the wrinkled skin of her asshole. The hippo quickly added a thundering fart to confirm his fears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><i>FFRRRRMMPFT!</i></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vile gas, piping hot straight from the source, blew up Simba's nose and into his flattened lungs. He could almost feel the potent fumes inflating them again, but he was too dazed and disgusted to act on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the matter, why are you not squirming that much any more?\" Henriette asked with a facetious smirk. \"Is it because you secretly like it down there? Well, I can't blame you. My beautiful ass has been the end of many fights in this ring. My opponents just can't seem to stop admiring it.\" The crowd all nodded, cheering loudly and egging the hippo on to up the torment. Henriette laughed loudly. She'd smothered and subjugated so many in the ring that she'd lost count. The little lion would be another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ground down on his squashed little body one last time to deliver the ultimate horror. Simba was unable to do anything as he was too tightly packed between the monstrous asscheeks. When she bore down on him his muzzle entered the foul hole. It clenched a little, wrapping around his snout and bathing it in silent, but atrocious farts. This only seemed to spur Henriette on further as she kept going. Slowly Simba's head started to get enveloped by the foul-smelling pucker until it was pulled inside completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I think he's ready.\" The hippo mused to the crowd. Simba didn't catch a word of it, his head stuck deep between her asscheeks. She stood up, revealing the extent of her actions to the audience. They showered her in applause upon seeing the cub's grimy fur poke out between her hefty asscheeks. She even clenched them together a little, the lion barely twitching in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get comfy just yet, little cub. I can't leave you there. Not when these people want to see the Hippo Cannon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe applause doubled in volume. Henriette was drinking it all in. This is why she got in the ring. The sheer wall of cheering and clapping, all because she was not afraid to humiliate some brat in a wrestling ring. With her victim thoroughly immobilized the hippo bent over and grit her teeth. Her gut rumbled as she prepared the foulest method imaginable for dislodging the trapped cub. This trick only worked with small opponents and there weren't many stupid enough to get in a ring with her. It made this all the more satisfying to do. With her ass pointed skywards she let out a warcry and unleashed a short but amazingly powerful fart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe explosive force hit Simba in the face with a wall of stench unlike anything he'd experienced, even in the lead up to this. It pushed him free of the painful hold of her asscheeks and sent him flying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust how potent was Henriette's Cannon?</span></div></div>",

Where he would land he had no clue, but it would certainly better than being rammed up that hippo's fat ass. His decent finally came to a halt as he landed on top of the makeshift ropes that made the ring. The cub slumped over the edge of the rope as his eyes rolled around in circles in his head due to his dizziness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uggghhhh..\" Simba groaned in pain as he felt every muscle in his body throb and ache. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience meanwhile cheered Henriette on for her grand display of her Hippo Cannon. Though it was a weaker shot than she had anticipated, it had served its purpose well enough. She now had her opponent on the ropes (literally) and needed to press on her attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub looked back and noticed the hippo slowly approaching him. 'Oh crap!' he thought. Simba began to panic. He knew he had to get out of this ring for his own safety. He fumbled his way through the ropes to make his way out, all he needed was take another step and - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just where do you think you're going little guy?\" a certain hippo asked. Simba was grabbed by his tail and dragged back into the ring. The cub was lifted into the air and brought to Henriette's face upside down. \"You weren't trying to escape now were you? The fun only just started!\" Simba whimpered in the presence of the imposing hippo.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette decided to implement another one of her crowd pleasing techniques. She lowered the cub down near the top rope and tethered his tail on the topmost rope to leave him dangling by his tail facing her. She then turned her side to the cub and reared up her hips. \"Get a load of my HIP-po check!\" Henriette announced, before swinging her hips down and smacking the dangling cub with her lower body. The sheer force of the blow caused the cub to spin around the rope by his tail at a rapid speed. Her opponent screamed in fear as he was swung round and around. Each time his momentum slowed, Henriette would ram her hip into him again to keep him spinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Simba could see was blurs of yellow, green blue and especially grey. Each time Henriette struck him with a face full of hippo hide, it would knock the air out of his lungs. He could still hear the audience roaring with laughter and cheering as he continued to be spun around like a windmill.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, I think that's enough of that.\" Henriette stated. As her little play thing came back around for another pass around the rope, she put out her hand and grabs him by the head. She could see the cubs eyes spinning around from dizziness which gave her a sensible chuckle to see, but now was not the time to dwell on such petty things, she had to keep the show going. The hippo pulled Simba straight down by his head, the rope creaking as it stretched. \"Time for another flight!\" Henriette announced, before letting the lion cub go. Simba was against shot up high in the air with tail coming untied in the process. He squealed in terror as he was slingshot up to heights he never thought possible to reach. At the apex of the slingshot, his body turned to face downwards. He plummeted at great speed towards a grey figure that was Henriette. Simba was shocked as he fell -</span></div></div>",

Her large tongue was twitching, like a fleshy pillow eager to catch him. Close by was her gullet. It looked just wide enough for him to plummet into. He'd be gone in a flash, swallowed up by the terrifying hippo. Anything but that. Simba thrashed wildly, flailing through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette was ready to catch the cub. She knew she had to be a little careful. Gobbling up an opponent completely mid-match was forbidden, and the punishment was steep. She'd be forced to cough him back up and she'd have to then fight another match and lose on purpose. But nothing in the rules stopped her from keeping the little lion in her maw. She swayed and stepped nervously, aiming to make sure her victim would land where she wanted. The hippo closed her eyes and waited for the shrieking cub to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wet splat Simba slammed down on the large hippo tongue. It wasn't nearly as soft as he'd expected, though after a fall from that high, it wasn't a surprise that it couldn't handle it very well. Thick, goopy saliva splattered everywhere. The horrid smell of Henriette's breath was disturbing, but the cub didn't have time to regain his bearings and flee the danger. The large tongue was like a hair trigger and in an instant the hippo snapped her jaws shut. The cub's escape attempt was brought to an instant halt. The only thing that got out was his head, now poking out from between Henriette's thick lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmMMMMmmmm\" She hummed, savouring his taste. Her tongue slithered and coiled around the lion's body like it had a mind of its own. It soaked Simba in thick, smelly drool. With an exaggerated slurping sound Henriette suckled on the cub's head before pulling it back behind her lips. With the cub trapped she tasted him all over. The hippo dragged him to every corner of her cavernous maw, giving the audience a show by showing them the little lion-shaped bulges in her cheeks. \"You're one tashty litwle cub, ain'tcha?\" She muttered with her mouth full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally having tormented him enough she spat out the slobber-coated lion into her hands. She held Simba up to her face and gave him a big smile. \"If it wasn't against the rules, I'd swallow you up right now, you tasty little morsel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba shuddered at the thought. Only some rule stood between him and the hippo swallowing him up whole. He was thankful she took these rules seriously. He wasn't keen on discovering her insides too after all the horrors she delivered with the outside. The hippo's smile grew as she brought him even closer. Henriette lowered her voice, whispering in the little lion's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you let me use you for a little fun and do a good job while you're there, I won't claim you after the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaim him? What the hell was she talking about? Did the rules really state that the winner could take the loser home with them as some sort of prize? Simba shuddered at the idea of being the hippo's prize. She'd surely eat him the moment they were out of the ring. But what did the hippo want from him?</span></div></div>",

There was nothing she loved more in the world than abusing little creatures in any way, shape or form. Knowing there's a being crushed beneath her butt when she sits, squashed under her belly when she lays down and struggling in her intestines and stomach was pure bliss for the hippo. As great as squashing and eating them was, there was nothing that could compare to having said creatures working that large greedy pussy of hers. Henriette gave little Simba the look of flirtation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know just where you're going lion boy~\" the hippo teased. Simba shooked his head in fear. \"No.. please don't put me back in your mouth, please anything but that!\" he pleaded. Henriette chuckled at his deplorable pleas. \"Oh you aren't going in my mouth little man.\" she assured. Henriette brought the cub down to her sopping pussy. \"You're going in THERE~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's jaw drop at the sight of the hippo's love tunnel. Her juices spilled to the floor of the ring like a salivating maw awaiting a delicious meal. The lips were great and puffy and blushing with a shade of cherry red. Her pussy could easily house an person of his size and now he was being threatened to be jammed right up inside there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make to wiggle around extra hard in there for mama~\" Henriette adjured the cub, before pressing his face against her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMPH!\" she moaned as the cub pressed against her sensitive lips. It had been a long while since she had someone inside there and her pussy was craving some 'food'. She pushed him further inside, pushing his snout and face into the crevice. The hippo bit down on her lower lip and shoved his entire head inside with sloppy <b> <i>SSHHHLLUUURRPP!</i> </b> \"OHH! HEAVENS!\" she cried out. Simba's furry little body tickled her vaginal lips and insides just the right way and it drove her wild, but she couldn't stop with him only halfway inside! Another push crammed Simba inside up to his waist.Henriette's legs began to buckle at feeling of the cub entering her cavernous pussy further and further. She took her hand away from the cub and let her pussy do the rest. She flexed and clenched her pussy over the lion's puny body, pulling and slurping him up like spaghetti. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery second the inner walls would scrunch up around Simba and drag him inside further. Her walls were coated with warm slime thicker than her saliva. The stench was like a mix of rotten fish and her inconceivable stench of musk. His arms were stuck to his sides as he was squeezed through his entire body. All the the furry little dildo could do was whimper, cry and struggle as was now fully inserted in the hippo cunt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette gave way and let her legs finally collapse. She screamed out in pleasure as Simba squirmed like a worm inside of her. She reached down and flicked her bean around to pleasure herself further. The poor hippo had forgotten how amazing this felt as she laid down in the middle of the ring a horny moaning mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba squirmed left and right, trying to get one of his hands free of the clutches of Henriette's inner muscles, then maybe he could crawl out! He grunted and yanked as hard as he could to lift his hand up annnd. <b> <i>*SSLLIIIPP*</i> </b> The lion's right arm rocketed upwards and poked through the hippo's back gate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette's screamed out her moan. Her legs tightened and tensed up as her gates opened and flooded out a great shower of pussy juice. Simba was flushed out with the tidal wave and plopped down on his face. His fur was absolutely soaked in the hippo's sludge.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh LORD kid!\" Henriette shouted. \"You sure know how to please a woman.\" She sat up panting and stared down at Simba. </span></div></div>",

A slight hint of red as his manhood was just about poking out of its sheath. The intensity of her actions paired with her overwhelming feminine scent had affected the little lion and the hippo was going to take full advantage of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at that, it seems I wasn't the only one having fun. But did I finish too fast for you? Let me fix that.\" She said, her voice still a bit haggard from the afterglow of her orgasm. As much as she wanted to, she couldn't repeat her actions again. Though she was a bit hazy whether fully inserting an opponent into your pussy counted as swallowing, the referee's glare was enough to suggest she shouldn't try to push her luck any further. Maybe something to think about after the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba tried to get on his feet, but the slimy rollercoaster from before left him exhausted. He ached all over from the rough treatment and he wasn't out of the woods yet. He felt Henriette's hand press down on his side, pushing him to the ground and rolling him onto his back. He wiped the worst of the goop from his eyes and saw the hippo towering over him. She had a creepy smirk on her face. He gasped when he felt her hand venture down to his groin, stroking his cock. The rubbery flesh of her fingers felt eerie, but the pungent stink all around him made him feel weird. This wasn't supposed to happen, but he could feel himself get more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, show me what you got.\" She mused, chuckling as the cub reached full mast. It wasn't much, but she could work with it. With all the subtlety of a bulldozer the hippo simply let herself drop down. Her pussy was looming straight over his groin, the drooling wet lips eager for another meal. It would take some discipline not to cram him in again, but she had a different idea in mind. Henriette laughed and moaned as she gyrated her hips back and forth, rubbing her pussy on Simba's lower body. The warm, slickened flesh pressed against his boner until it popped up and slipped between the hippo's inner walls. They squeezed, milked and massaged his little shaft with vigor. The cub's head was left free so the audience could hear him moan as Henriette expertly forced an orgasm out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo kept grinding, her taunts melting into moans of her own as she could feel a second, smaller climax rush through her. Another load of slimy release splattered all over the cub as his own orgasm was completely lost within the torrent. \"You've got a lot in you, short stuff.\" She complimented between catching her breath. She'd met full-sized hippo lovers who couldn't give her a second release and this little brat managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba finally felt the weight lift as his tormentor stood up. He knew this fight was a farce from the start, but he didn't expect to get fucked over in the ring this literally. It was nothing short of harrowing to feel her ravenous pussy milking his shaft, trying to pull his entire lower body into her love tunnel again. He just wanted it to be over. He could only hope the hippo would keep to her promise of not claiming him afterwards. If this didn't count as giving her pleasure, he shuddered to think what would.</span></div></div>",

The little lion was sputtering on the floor, barely moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's done. But damn he gave us one hell of a show!\" She shouted to the crowd. They responded with loud applause and copious amounts of whistling. The hippo could see the many jealous eyes wanting what she just gave the cub. She walked over to the lion and nodded, appreciating the audience's reaction. She should fight small opponents more often. Maybe that little meerkat that was with Simba before the match? It'd be one hell of a fight. The brave meerkat avenging his humiliated friend versus the evil hippo. She loomed over the cub and raised a large foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenriette gave her victim a sly smirk and planted the leather sole squarely on his chest. The large hippo foot covered most of Simba's torso and the weight was unbearable. At the same time he could see she was barely even leaning on him.

Simba's heart sank at hearing those words. The hippo made a promise, but apparently her words are just as cruel as the rest of her. He didn't have the energy to resist when she grabbed him by the scruff of his neck, lifting him off the floor and dusting him off a little. She held him close to her big face, making him fear he was going back into her disgusting maw. Instead she whispered softly in his ear. \"Sorry about that, but I need you for like an hour tops. Just go along with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard for the cub to trust her word, but he didn't have much of a choice. He wondered what the hell this crazy hippo had in mind with him. Was she about to swallow him up? Maybe she'd shove him back into that slimy pussy of her forever? Every option that haunted the little lion's mind was worse than the last. Henriette was leaving the arena, taking her prize to a quiet corner behind some large boulders. Once there she sat down and let out a deep sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I had to claim you there. But it was the only way to arrange for this. I have a proposition for you and I knew there'd be no other way for me to get you to listen to me. Once we're done here I'll tell the ref I set you free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was seven kinds of done with this hippo, but he figured hearing her out couldn't hurt. But if he started to piss her off now, she probably wouldn't hesitate to keep him as her property a bit longer. He sighed and replied. \"Alright, fine. Let's hear it then.\" She could tell he was tired of having to interact with her already, but she had an ace in the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, word down the grapevine is that your uncle Scar is up to no good. Him and his hyenas have been eyeing that empty seat up on Pride Rock for far too long and that's supposed to be your place. But you're just a little cub and he's got his pack of hyenas. So what if you could even those odds? Imagine if you had someone of my caliber on your side?\" Henriette's smile grew as she could see the cub's eyes light up. Simba imagined putting Scar through the same horrorshow he'd just endured. Perhaps the hippo could be of some value after all. But the cub knew this was a little too good to be true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the catch? You're not gonna risk your neck for nothing. What could I possibly give you?\" The little lion asked, making the hippo blush bright red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't know how to dress this up nicely, so I'll just spit it out. When you went into my pussy, that was the single most incredible thing I've ever felt. Your little squirms inside me were so good. So what I want is simply for us to do that again. Either right here and now, or maybe in a few days when you've recovered from the match. If you do that for me, I'll gladly help you put Scar in his place. And who knows, maybe you'll like it enough to let me do it more often in the future. In exchange for more favors of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub could see her daydreaming about the experience already. He really didn't feel keen on repeating that nightmare anytime soon, but her offer was damn tempting. A way to get back his rightful place on Pride Rock was something not many out here were willing to give him. Could he set aside his feelings and endure the hippo just a little more in exchange for that?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I agree to this, and you promise that you'll help me fight off my uncle until I've regained my rightful place in Pride Rock?\" Simba asked, still having a hard time believing the hippo's words. It sounded too good to be true, a cheap excuse to abuse him some more outside the ring. But why would she bother with these kinds of deals for that? Technically Henriette owned him now. She could cram him wherever she pleased. Maybe she wasn't all horrible. As long as you're not in the ring against her at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got my word, hippo honour!\" She said proudly before leering at the cub lustfully. If that little lion didn't come up with an answer soon she'd have to force something out of him. Hopefully it wouldn't come to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... fine!\" The cub said, exasperated by the situation. \"Just get it over with so we can-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't get to finish his sentence before a large hand grabbed him by his head, driving it between Henriette's legs with haste. The cub was put face to face with her drooling pussy once more. Against all odds she seemed to be even more aroused the second time around and she wasn't about to waste any more time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squirm for me!\" She cried out as she plunged the little lion's head inbetween her soft folds. The slimy flesh yielded and the potent musky stench filled Simba's nose once more. The cub was frightfully accustomed to the smell, but it remained every bit as disgusting as the first time. The hippo's need was insatiable and he could feel her strong hands grab hold of his body to guide it inside. The slick walls pulsed with excitement but the powerful squeezes from before were absent. She seemed to be holding back for some reason. There was little he could do outside of handling her request. Though he didn't want to encourage her more, the cub felt the need to secure Henriette's allegiance by doing as she asked. He wiggled and squirmed as best as her crushing grip and slippery inner walls allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Like that! More!\" The hippo was ecstatic, crying with tears of joy. Her moans echoed across the savannah as she pushed her little lion toy deep into herself. In mere moments her hungering pussy had swallowed its prey. Once more the cub had been sealed completely inside her sex and his futile squirms awoke a primal need. She bore down on him, waves of pleasure shooting through her whenever her inner walls arrested his movements with a potent squeeze. The lion always followed it up by more wiggling the moment he was able to move again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPredictably it didn't take long for Henriette to find herself teetering on the brink of an orgasm. She tried to hold herself back, to wring just a few more seconds of unmitigated pleasure from the cub. But his puny little wiggles inside her love tunnel finally drove her over the edge. A rush of fluids washed over the unfortunate lion, pushing him out far enough for the hippo to grab one of the feet now dangling from her pussy. She quickly pulled her toy out before he was in danger of drowning in her voluminous release. It gushed from her snatch like a river of slime, the aftermath of an orgasm more powerful than anything she'd ever experienced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know about you, little cub, but I'm one happy mama. I hope it was worth it for you too. Without meaning to get too far ahead on things, I really think we should try to find more reasons to do this.\" The hippo said with the biggest smile on her face. Simba only offered sputtering and coughing in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, that was wilder than you expected, wasn't it? Well, strenghten yourself with the thought that you've now got me to teach that mean old uncle of yours a lesson. And if any of his little hyena friends interfere... they'll regret it.\" She gave her ass a loud smack, the vast cheek jiggling on its own for nearly a minute. The cub had seen up close what those could do, and that was probably with Henriette holding back. He almost looked forward to seeing what they'd do to Scar.</span></div></div>",

So I've got a friend who I'm sure is up for some mischief. Go talk to your little friends and explain what's happening, I'll be back here in an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub shakily nodded, watching the hippo leave. He went over to a nearby creek to wash all the gunk from his fur. Timon and Pumbaa saw him go and followed him. The smell that came of Simba gave the two of them pause for thought, opting to follow from a fair distance. They'd witnessed the brutality in the ring and could only guess as to what that cruel beast had done afterwards. When the lion was midway through cleaning himself they finally broke the silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... uhm... you alright? That match didn't look too... pleasant.\" The meerkat muttered, blushing a little. He couldn't help but feel guilty for sending Simba in against an opponent like Henriette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba let out a long, frustrated groan. \"Urgh, sort of? I'm gonna have aches and bruises from that 'fight' for the next few weeks. And let's not talk about being degraded and used like a fucking sex toy in front of a crowd!\" Timon and Pumbaa both looked down in shame. But the cub wasn't done talking. \"But unbelievably, there's a bright side to this story. I had a talk with Henriette and after providing her a favor she agreed to take on Scar for me. Right now she's getting a friend to help her but she'll be back in an hour. I'm not sure if they'll object to you two tagging along, but something tells me they might not approve. And trust me when I say that outside of the ring they're even worse than in the ring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great, Simba! Hopefully she'll do to Scar what she did to you in the ring, only worse. Anyway, me 'n Pumbaa will keep our distance and let the hippo do the heavy lifting.\" He smiled awkwardly, feeling a little bad about himself. The meerkat had hoped that with the publicity of the fights they could rally some muscle to help remove Scar from Pride Rock, but now it had all been sorted already by that vile hippo. An hour ticks by and Simba waits for Henriette's return by himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There he is. Didn't I tell you he's just the cutest little thing?\" A familiar voice cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh, he's adorable. And he let you...\" A similar sounding voice followed, answered by Henriette. \"Oh yes, it was amazing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind a nearby boulder two hippos arrived. The one next to Henriette was nearly identical to her. Same height, same facial features, even the same big, jiggling belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cub, this is my sister Michelle. Michelle, this is Simba, the prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about you. Apparently you lions have had a little hostile takeover? Well, we're gonna set things straight for you. But first, come here, I want a hug.\" Michelle said cheerily, barreling towards the little lion. Simba was wrapped up in a tight embrace, wedged between the hippo's large breasts and powerful arms. Pressure aside it felt remarkably pleasant, the smooth thick skin rubbing against his fur. He was held up to her face as Michelle kept gushing about him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henriette was right, you're the most adorable little cat I've ever seen. And according to her you can do things few other creatures out here can. Maybe we can discuss that later...\" She said with a wink. The cub just rolled his eyes. Seemed like Henriette was eager to spread his status as a prime quality adult toy for large animals around. For now though, if they helped him reclaim his throne, he'll grudgingly live with it.</span></div></div>",

Shall we go have some fun in Pride Rock?\" Henriette asked cheerily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lead the way.\" Michelle replied. She made no moves to free the lion from her overbearing hug, carrying him with her. Simba had hoped he was at least permitted to walk alongside them, but it looked like they had other plans for him. He found his head patted heavily by Michelle before she took hold of it and guided it towards her pursed lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mwah! You're the cutest.\" She murmured, plastering his head in increasingly slobbery kisses. The cub just reluctantly let her do her thing. Not just because she still held him inescapably tight, but also because he really didn't want to interfere in whatever plan they had to conquer his throne for him. When the smooching got so intense he was on the verge of passing out Michelle finally relented. She draped the lion over her shoulder, letting him rest up and recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith weary eyes he could spot the odd glimpse of Timon and Pumbaa following in the distance. They kept themselves far out of the way, but never stopped shadowing him. Soon his attention was back on the hippos as they chatted with eachother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sis, have you got any kind of plan for this?\" Michelle asked with a curiously raised brow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go in to Scar's lair, sit on his lackeys, beat him up and put our little prince back on his throne.\" Henriette replied. Both hippos laughed at the simplicity of their plan. Soon they met with the first sentry, a scrawny looking hyena. It tried to halt them before noticing the cub slung on Michelle's shoulder. Simba thought fast and played dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, that damn pest is finally gone? Good riddance. You may show Scar, but don't prepare for him being grateful. He would've loved to kill Simba himself.\" It cackled madly, but the laughs vanished when Henriette got close and suddenly jumped towards him. With a heavy thump she slammed down, burying the sentry completely beneath her large blubbery butt. Simba heard a muffled crunch, but when the hippo stood back up it turned out the ground itself had cracked under her weight. The cub gulped, realizing just how much she had held back in the ring. The hyena had gone nearly two-dimensional, plastered to her butt. She let out a noisy fart before pulling it free and holding it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now scram. I don't want to see your face again.\" She grumbled, dropping her victim on the floor. The hyena didn't need to be told twice, racing off into the plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad sis, I half expected you to eat it.\" Michelle complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, that thing was all skin and bones.\" Henriette scrunched her face with disgust. \"I prefer something a little more substantial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Scar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you monster, eating the king of the lions.\" Michelle feigned shock, making her sister laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing but the best for me.\" Henriette joked back. \"Though if the rumors are true there's not a lot of meat on his bones either. Simba, you've met the guy, is he as skinny as they say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a spineless coward without an ounce of bravery in his body.\" The cub replied. Just thinking about his traitorous uncle made his blood boil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, he's even cuter when he's mad.\" The hippos cooed in unison. Henriette was quick to follow up on that statement. \"Sounds like a real tender meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he loathed Scar, the prospect of him being gobbled up by these two lunatics still made the cub queasy. It didn't help that the next sentry they met was flattened so thoroughly by Michelle it took the other hippo to pull him free from between her asscheeks. \"Phew, if he'd gone any deeper he would've ended up inside.\" She joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't be the first.\" Michelle said with a cruel smirk. The cub tried not to imagine what that would look like. He couldn't imagine a worse fate. Only the horror of being crammed inside Henriette's pussy got close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they arrived at their destination, having dispatched two more lookouts each. The ominous looking rocky cavern of Scar loomed before them. For the first time there was a pang of hesitation in the fat beasts, but they steeled themselves and marched in. Scar's ravenous hordes awaited them.</span></div></div>",

Apparently it had found enough of a spine to warn the others and ignore the hippos' threats. Henriette stared daggers at him, eager to show the cowardly mutt just how badly it had fucked up. With the cub still slung over her shoulder Michelle got ready for a fight alongside her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dispose of them!\" Scar yelled out from his throne. He'd barely bothered to glance at these interlopers, but when he did the black-maned lion nearly did a double take. Right there, on one of their shoulders was draped that infernal cub!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring me that cub but don't harm him, I want him alive.\" He commanded, the throng of hyenas cackling and closing in on Henriette and Michelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first to leap towards them was snatched out of the air by Henriette's quick reflexes. She reunited the brave hyena with his friends by throwing him at them as hard as she could, bowling over several of the snarling beasts. Several more tried to go for the throat, but all were tossed through the cavern, impacting the walls or being 'caught' by the others. They all kept their distance at first, but like a grey-furred tide the hyenas slowly moved in. Only when they were close enough to nip at their blubbery bellies did the two hippos demonstrate their true strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them jumped forward, landing ass-first amidst the thick crowd. The hyenas stumbled over eachother to get away. They stood no chance as Henriette and Michelle buried them beneath their huge backsides. They got up quickly afterwards, preparing for another round. The squashed hyenas were either unconscious or too hurt and exhausted to get up, choosing to stay on the ground instead of having to endure another flattening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar watched in disbelief as these two hippos worked through his minions with little difficulty. They endured bites and scratches, but their hides were so thick the hyenas failed to draw a single drop of blood. In return they wreaked havoc, squashing and throwing his beasts with ease. Every butt-squash took another half dozen out of the fight and soon the last few hyenas ran off, rightfully more terrified of the hippos than the lion. All the while that stupid little cub just held on, clinging to the hippo's shoulder as she destroyed his guards. His attention was so fixated on Simba that he didn't notice Henriette had climbed up to his platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mere you!\" She said, her voice filled with malice and glee. She grabbed the larger lion and wrapped him in a bearhug. Her large chest poked against his back as he flailed his claws, hitting nothing but air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release me at once you fat, stupid~ AAAAAAH\" His sentence was cut short and replaced with a scream as Henriette jumped off with the lion still in her arms. The ground came closer and it was clear she was about to make a beautiful belly flop with only Scar there to cushion the impact. The cave shook as she landed, the lion letting out a loud wheeze as all the air was squashed from his lungs. Henriette stood up, the flattened lion coming up with her. She held onto him again, giving her sister a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle nodded and grabbed the cub. She set him down beside her and rushed towards her sister. When they were about to collide both hippos threw their bellies forward, connecting with a heavy <i>bwomp</i>. Scar disappeared almost completely between them, only his head still visible as he was put through the wringer. When the two separated he fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right, Simba, he is a scrawny one.\" Henriette mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScar was left at their mercy, what do the hippos do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Henriette's belly rumbled. All that squashing was hard work and she was ravenous. Looking around the cavern it was clear there was little worth eating here. Some hyenas still lay scattered about, crushed unconscious during the brawl. She quickly scanned to see if that one spineless little twat was around that tried to ignore her threats. He'd make for a tasty morsel. But it seemed like he'd ran off again, hopefully for good this time. Suddenly, a different idea sprang to mind. None of the hyena's looked very appetizing, but she can't remember the last time she ate a lion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Simba...\" She cooed with the sweetest voice she could manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle saw what her sister had in mind and grabbed the cub off her shoulder. It was almost hilariously difficult as he had grabbed hold firmly during the brawl, desperate not to get thrown off and end up in the middle of those hyenas. Or worse yet, beneath one of the hippos as they dealt with the hyenas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, the fight's over, you can let go now.\" Michelle spoke soothingly, stroking the little lion's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Simba took a long breath, forcing his body into action and letting go of the hippo's shoulder. He was quickly wrapped up in a flabby hug by Michelle, who eagerly wanted to show him what her sister was up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub was treated to the wondrous sight of Henriette holding Scar in a choke-hold, his futile flailing slowly weakening as she wrenched her strong arms around his neck. With crushing force she knocked the older lion out cold, letting him flop onto the floor when the job was done. It didn't need a lot of effort after that devastating double belly slam earlier. But Simba's eyes widened with horror as he saw what the next step in her plan was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo licked her chops and grabbed Scar's head, opening her maw wide before placing it inside. She could fit his head and half his chest into that drooling cavern before closing her jaws around the defeated lion. Having been trapped inside that maw himself, Simba winced at the display. A low slurping sound echoed through the cave as Henriette suckled on her prey. She reared back her head, holding Scar's limp body up and letting gravity assist her. A deep gulp sent his head down her gullet and more quickly followed. She had to be fast so she wouldn't choke on her meal, but this wasn't the first big morsel going into her belly and it wouldn't be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba stared in disbelief as he watched his uncle sink down into the hippo's throat. He wished nothing more than for that murderous traitor to suffer, but this just felt wrong. There was little he could do about it now. It's not like Henriette was going to listen to him to begin with. And worse yet, she'd probably want a different lion to eat instead, and the cub was the only one around. He just hung there in Michelle's embrace as he watched the last of Scar's legs slide past those thick lips. He was such a substantial meal for her that the little lion was certain he saw the hippo's belly swell up. The final few gulps seemed the most stressful for Henriette, but at long last she had worked all of the lion down her neck and could breathe freely once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaah. That was a real treat. Your uncle might be evil, but he was no less tasty. Reminded me a bit of you, actually.\" She mused aloud, chuckling a little at the cub's disgusted look. He didn't need more reminders of the time he almost ended up in that belly himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the king's gone... Now what?\" Michelle asked, holding the cub up to eye-level and expecting an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I can claim my throne and rule this land as is my right.\" Simba responded proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other lions would follow a cub?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd help me out, but they'll recognize that I'm Mufasa's son and with that the rightful ruler of Pride Rock.\" The cub's tone got a little more haughty as he discussed these royal matters. Henriette just rolled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So as ruler, could you order things to help us?\" She asked inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" The cub was curious to hear what the hippo had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first dibs at the watering hole for saving the king sounds fair. Maybe force those hyenas to enter the ring against us for entertainment, I'm sure you can think of a few things.\" Michelle chimed in. But as the gears in her head turned, Henriette began to think on a far more ambitious scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say sister, I just thought of something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, sis?\" Michelle responded. Simba didn't like the tone of the hippo's voice. He had a gut feeling things were about to get a whole lot worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is it written that a lion should rule Pride Rock? Since we overthrew the last king, doesn't that make us the rightful owners of this place?\" Henriette pondered aloud, putting a broad smile on her sister's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think you might be right. We should get the word out to our family. They've been looking for a new place to crash and this one might actually be big enough for the lot of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! You can't do this!\" Simba cried out. \"You promised me you'd put me back on the throne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I promised to overthrow your uncle Scar. And judging by his current predicament I'd say that's a job well done.\" Henriette gave her jiggling gut a big pat. \"And I suppose you've been in charge of the place for a good few minutes, but I think Pride Rock needs someone a little... bigger to run it properly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't believe it. These fat beasts were talking as gleefully about removing him from his position of power as they were about putting him there to begin with. He'd never even sat on the throne before getting chucked right off it again. But what could he do? The last lion that stood against them was now in Henriette's belly and he wasn't about to start a fight with them. Michelle could feel him wriggle nervously and  tried to soothe the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Simba. We're not gonna kick you out. We're not monsters like that. You can stay with us. After all, without you we wouldn't even be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too right, sis. Besides, that little lion is gonna love it here. He'll make for a great...</span></div></div>",

Michelle pulled him closer into her chest, crushing any resistance whilst arguing with her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon sis, I only just met the little guy. How are you still hungry after that last lion anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you see him? He was all skin and bones. I want something a little more juicy than that. And that cub is exactly what my belly is longing for.\" She responds, licking her chops with glee. \"Besides, once the family is here he'll end up in someone's belly before the sun has set, you know this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle found it hard to argue that one. Their family's voracious tendencies were well known and one of the big reasons the other animals gave them a wide berth at the watering hole. Those that strayed close were oftentimes toyed with or swallowed outright. Henriette could see her sister thinking it over, but she didn't seem convinced yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what. After the family gets here I'll go out and get you a lion to toy with. An adult one that isn't quite as helpless. Or if you're after something small and cute, I'm sure Simba's dumb little friends are around here somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, fine. There's no arguing with you when you're like this. Just promise me you won't chew on him.\" Michelle huffed, handing the cub over to her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This little thing? If I can work his entire uncle down whole he shouldn't be a problem.\" Henriette gave an amused smirk before lifting the cub up over her head and opening her maw wide. The overpowering hug Michelle had given him had left Simba worn out, unable to put up much resistance. But when he saw the pink abyss below him he mustered every ounce of fight he had left in him. It mattered little to the hippo, her tongue twitching a little with excitement as she milked the moment. Her grip on the cub was unwavering and before long he'd tired himself out. Michelle gave him a shy little wave goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Henriette let go of her prey and sent the cub plummeting into her jaws. Before she could even close her maw around him Simba had already slipped halfway down her gullet. The hungry hippo savoured the taste as best she could before another swallow sent most of the cub down her neck. With a final muffled gulp Simba felt himself enter free fall, pushed down the bottomless cramped throat of the hippo. How Scar had managed to fit through here was a mystery. In the background he could hear her heavy heartbeat and muffled voices. It sounded like the two were discussing something again. What they were arguing about mattered little to Simba. The cub had resigned himself to the bitter fact that his last moments would be inside the hippo's stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unbelievable, you greedy guts, you barely even tasted him.\" Michelle joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tasted him plenty in the ring and you saw it, he practically slid down my throat before I could do anything. Little bastard almost seemed like he wanted to be in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two hippos sat back and laughed. They'd get the rest of the family over here soon enough. For now it was time to enjoy the spoils of their conquest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside of Henriette's belly, the cub wasn't having nearly such a good time. He just reached the end of the esophagus and splashed down in the large stomach. She pats her gut contently, letting it work on its prey.</span></div></div>",

But as the final stretch opened up before him the cub saw the one thing that would make his stay in the hippo's stomach even worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilling up most of the cramped space was Scar, curled up in the fetal position. His mane was matted down with stomach slime, the rest of his fur not faring much better. His eyes were half-closed and he seemed almost peaceful, having accepted his fate. A peace rudely shattered as he looked up to see the cub getting deposited in with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You...\" He muttered angrily, struggling to put his fury into words. \"You did this! You brought these horrors to my lair! Did you really think they'd obey you, you stupid little whelp?! Because of you I'm going to spend the last few hours of my life wasting away inside a hippo's stomach!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was unable to get in a response before Scar wrapped both hands around his neck. The confines of Henriette's belly were roomy enough to hold the both of them, but little more. There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide for the little lion as his uncle pulled him up to his face. The larger lion's toothy grin widened as he opened his maw wide. He would only have one last opportunity for vengeance and he was damn well gonna take it. He would deny that fat hippo the chance to digest the cub and do it himself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scar! NO!\" Was all the cub could cry out before his head was shoved into the yawning maw. Scar had to fight the urge to bite down on his nemesis. Sharp teeth brushed all along the cub's sides as he slipped in deeper. The hungering gullet opened wide and accepted the little lion's head, pulling it in further with a loud gulp. Simba's flailing limbs were restrained and held down against his body as the evil lion swallows more of him. If Henriette's throat was narrow, this one proved nearly impossible to get through. But Scar had never been more determined to beat the odds. He would put that stupid little pest in his place, even if it's the last thing he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral more strained gulps and the cub had been reduced to a pair of flailing feet slowly sinking down the ravenous gullet. Scar felt a little nauseous trying to swallow something that large whole. But as he felt Simba move inside him he knew it was worth it. For years he'd daydreamed about ridding himself of the cub. He'd thought about drowning him, beating him to death, even throwing him off the same cliff as his father. But given his predicament, swallowing the cub whole seemed like the most poetic piece of justice he could imagine. He wasn't gonna escape this belly and judging by the tingling goop in his fur those juices would do their thing soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs what little air was present began to run out the larger lion's eyelids grew heavy. He knew he wouldn't wake up from this, but with his thirst for vengeance sated he closed his eyes. His last thoughts were of the little cub now squirming in his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither lion was ever heard from again and Michelle and Henriette kept their word. As soon as their family arrived they took over Pride Rock. The few lions with enough backbone to stand up against these usurpers quickly had those bones flattened underneath a hippo butt. Those that resisted still were given the same treatment as Scar. With that grim message sent the hippos were now in charge of the Savannah. Though they demanded food, the other animals seemed relieved to have a change in leadership. That relief would fade as the corruption set in. With absolute power the hippos began to run the place as they saw fit. Animals were judged mostly by how hungry the hippos were for a snack and those that weren't eaten were sent into the wrestling ring to face however many hippos it would take to make the fight completely one-sided. No-one dared complain though as Henriette frequently regaled them with stories of the little cub that made it all happen, patting her belly as she told the conclusion.</span></div></div>",

He finally opened his eyes to the sight of complete darkness, the sensations of the stomach-churning around the lion cub as his legs slid into the humid cavern. He sloshed about within the stomach, his paws slightly pressing out against the stomach\u2019s walls in confusion as to why there was no burning sensation. The cub though that he was either dreaming or excruciating lucky. A sigh echoed within the confines of the hippo's stomach as Henriette swayed her hips, watching her bulging gut sway about, the meal within that was Simba being helplessly thrown around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predator hippo blushes as pleasure flowed through her veins from the movements her temporary prey made. The liquid within the stomach rose to Simba's neck and knees as he curled into a rough ball, the stomach walls constricting tight around his body. The apparent acids around the lion cub continued to bubble harmlessly, the sensations of it beginning to relax him alongside the warmth slowly. From the slow groans of the belly and the occasional gurgling sound, everything felt pleasant and relaxing, a stark contrast to the onslaught of fear and panic he was having earlier. The cub's eyes began to droop as he grew tired, the quiet and gentle swaying of the stomach further coaxing the lion to sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he had any desire to continue staying awake, the lion's body refused as the acids, belly sounds, and gentle movements relaxed his form until it was limp. Once he'd grown unable to move, his eyes shut, and sleep quickly overcame his senses. The world remains just as pitch black as it already was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight erupted into Simba's vision with disturbing haste, interrupting his slumber, and forcing the cub's paws to his eyes. \"You're finally awake, huh? Hope you had a good sleep~.\" The imposing, authoritative voice of the new Queen of the Pridelands boomed in Simba's awakening mind.  He surveyed his surroundings and saw he was no longer inside Henriette's stomach, but perched atop her heaving chest. Calm, deep breaths ruffled his fur, not even a trace of liquid upon it, as she smiles over his tired form. \"What, you didn't think I'd digest you, right?\" She chuckles at the puzzled look the lion cub was giving her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why shouldn't I've thought that?\" Simba scowls with a hiss, catching Henriette by surprise. \"You digested Scar; you digested him so fast there wasn't anything left of him by the time you decided to eat me. So...why didn't you?\" The hippo's eyes fluttered as she breathed out a more substantial, sad sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I deserve that. You must have gone through quite the scare earlier, huh? Well, there are two big reasons why you're still around to talk to me.\" She sets the Lion cub down onto the floor of the cavern in Pride Rock. How long had he been out? Had the hippos even left the place since they took over? \"One, your too tasty to be eaten just once, us Hippos love our food and your one the most lovably delicious snacks I've had in a long time, and I'm sure my family will agree. Second, well, is it so hard to believe that I like having you around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of, yeah?\" Simba frowned as he kept checking for bits of drool or acid his fur might have sustained from being inside of the hippo's stomach. \"All I am to you is a bit of food, or a seat, or a pet. You took me over to Pride Rock not to make me King, but so you could take over my home and my people! I can't-I...\" The would-be King suddenly couldn't deal with all the horrible emotions he was lumping on to his tired brain and fell to the hard, cold floor of the cavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Simba had a chance to cry, Henriette shook her head sadly and lifted him by the scruff of his neck. \"Simba, look at me.\" She said in a stern voice. With not much say in the matter, he obeyed. \"Simba, I know you think I'm a monster, but I'm not. I digested Scar killed Scar because he was. I didn't kill you because you're a kid, and if two hippos won't let a kid be king, do you think the rest of the Savannah will, eighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...\" The Lion cub sniffled, struggling to remember his Father's words. \"But my dad said that all the lands that the light touches belong to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba...he's gone.\" Henriette interrupted him. \"This is going to be hard to hear, but I don't put much stock in dead people's words. Us hippos have a saying: eat or be eaten. If he were worth hearing, he would still be around. I keep you around because I like it when you talk, along with all those cute little squeals you make when I tease 'ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...what happens next?\" Simba asks, his eyes a little puffy from the tears that were supposed to be flowing if not for Henriette's intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: \"Your mom was here, earlier, asking for 'ya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: \"I think it's time for you to get acquainted with my family~\" She grins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Simba's stomach growls. \"First thing is getting you some food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: You might not be king...but I'll let you decide.\"</span></div></div>",

Come, I'll introduce you.\" Henriette draped the cub on her shoulder and wandered back to the main cavern of Pride Rock. Simba wasn't sure what to expect, but soon he was met with a familiar smell. It was burned into the back of his mind after his 'fight' with the hippo. The distinct smell of hippo farts hung in the air, though mercifully faint. Whoever this family was, hygiene didn't seem a high priority to them. As they neared their destination the cub could hear voices. So many voices. How big was this family?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they entered the area and the cub's jaw nearly fell off. A veritable sea of fat, smelly beasts filled the room. All of them were busy talking among eachother. Many were smiling from ear to ear, clearly pleased with their new accommodation. Henriette grinned smugly, speaking to the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet the new royal family. More than you expected, ain't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the lions? What did you do to them?\" The little lion asked with a twinge of panic in his voice. His family wouldn't leave so easily and if Scar was any indication, many of those fat bellies could be stuffed with them now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy. We simply asked them to leave as we were the new rulers thus Pride Rock belonged to us. I'll admit some were more resistant to departing as this had been their home for so long. But most of them just grumbled and growled before heading of. I guess they knew what would happen to those that tried to fight. And as far as those that resisted went... They changed their minds after being sat on for a few hours. The only one that's gone forever is Scar, but I doubt any tears will be shed for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba breathed a sigh of relief. At least nobody else got killed during this hostile takeover. The hippo enters the crowd and begins to show off the cub to her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba, this is my uncle Elmer.\" She chirps, holding the cub out to a particularly fat hippo. He responds, his foul breath curling the lion's whiskers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet ya, former prince. Hope ya don't mind us lower creatures takin' over for a while.\" He laughs. Henriette hastily moves on to more acquaintances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That there is uncle Shawn, stay away from him. He's a bit of a pervert.\" Henriette said in a hushed tone, pointing out a shifty looking hippo. The cub rolled his eyes. After what she'd done to him, she was in no position to call anyone a pervert. \"He'll fuck just about anything with a heartbeat.\" She added, giving Simba the unpleasant mental image of what might happen should the hippo get his hands on him. Almost on cue the hippo shot the cub a lecherous look and grinned creepily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pa, Ma, meet Simba. He's the cub I told you about.\" She exclaimed happily, turning to a pair of hippos that opened their arms of a big group hug. The cub thought he'd be safe on his perch, but she grabs him by the scruff of his neck and dangles him in front of her. He barely gets out a little scream before three rotund bellies meet, squashing him in the middle. The blubbery masses envelop him completely, squeezing and rolling the lion between them. Greasy sweat matted his fur as the hippos seemed more eager to toy with him than to exchange hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly it sank in to the cub that this was his life now. A toy to be squashed and played with by this family of fat monsters. And from what he'd seen so far, more than a few of these hippos would be 'playing' with him in ways no lion should ever be subjected to. The pervasive stench of lingering farts and stale sweat would become the default and being smothered by bellies and butts was going to be his natural state of being. Assuming none of them wanted to show of their ability to swallow him whole and not digest him again. There was still one ray of hope. These hippos may have overthrown the lions, but would anyone accept them as the new rulers of the Savannah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the crushing bellies parted and Simba was left to flop onto the ground. The cub was breathing heavily from the overwhelming experience, just laying there and listening to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So? How'd the acceptance speech go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lots of cheering, I guess they were as happy not having to deal with those lions any more as we were. Even the request to provide an offering of food didn't seem to ruffle any feathers. I suppose when bringing food no longer involves offering up friends and family to be devoured it becomes a lot more palatable.\" All three hippos laughed, the little lion quietly whimpering in shame. So much for that idle hope. Did anyone in the Savannah like them or were they just afraid of them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I'm gonna check in on some things. Can you two keep an eye on him for me? If you see Michelle, just hand him off to her. She's been eager to play with him for a while.\" Henriette looked down and gave the hippo a malicious smirk, knowing exactly the kind of games her sister had in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\" Her parents replied. Henriette took her leave, abandoning the cub to their care. They barely paid him any attention, continuing to chat with other family members.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The many hippos of Henriette and Michelle's extended family freely conversed in Pride Rock's main cavern, talking mainly about all their plans they have for the Savannah now that they have stumbled upon all this power. At the same time, Simba, the lion who should have had all that power, went ignored. The cub pricked his ears up into the air, trying to make out what Pa and Ma were saying over the hiss of the background noise. However, just before he was able to decipher something along the lines of political intrigue, Simba was suddenly lifted from the floor of the cave into the air, face to face with a more familiar pachyderm, Michelle. \"Hey, there, kitty-kat~\" Henriette's sister cooed as her eyes drank in the cub's fidgeting form. \"So, how are you getting along with my folks? They're pretty cool, but watch your step around them, they worked up a mighty appetite coming over here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fat hippo playfully smacked her prodigious belly with one hand while holding Simba in the other, the massive organ inside letting out an ominous growl of hunger that sent the cub into another panicky fit. \"O-oh, yeah, Michelle, your family is...great.\" He fibbed with as much of a smile as he could muster. The truth was that he was afraid of the lot of them, with their raunchy behaviors polluting his home. Of course, he couldn't say that. That would guarantee whatever torment they all have planned for him would intensify. \"So, um...now that you're all in charge, what's going to happen to the Pride Lands?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you too young for politics, little kitten?\" Michelle teased with a smug smile, tucking Simba atop her right shoulder as she made her way outside of the main cavern out onto the precipice that looked over the kingdom. The lion cub was appreciative of the cold wind breezing through his now matted fur; it had gotten stuffy in there with all those hippos marking their new territory. The pachyderm sat strolled to the very tip of the overhanging rock and sat down over the edge, taking in the beauty of the land in the late morning. \"Well, if you want to know so much...look out, Simba. What do you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba obeyed and followed Michelle's gaze over the Pride Lands, the same Kingdom that Mufasa, his father, promised would be his. \"It's...the Savannah. Where everything the light touches belongs-I mean, used to belong to the Lion Pride.\" The lion cub put bluntly, trying to skirt over the fact that his whole world had changed in the span of a trip to Henriette's stomach. \"What do, er, you see, Michelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Food.\" The hippo offered just as bluntly, if not more so then Simba did. Her stomach let out another impatient growl as she absentmindedly rubbed it with a content smile on her lips, sounding like Hell's horn to the lion cub. \"I see miles and miles of my family's brand new kitchen. Zebras and elephants, antelopes and buffalo, all prime for the taking and looking delicious~.' Michelle licked her lips slowly as she fantasized about all the tasty meals she could have at her leisure, while Simba looked on at her aghast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but...I thought you promised you wouldn't ask to offer themselves up as food...\" Simba protested to Michelle quietly, the hippo craning her neck around to give the little lion a condescending smirk. \"I know that you all like to eat, but...can't you just eat fruit and grass, like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I got this big my just mowing down lawns, kitty? No, I need meat, and my family needs meat, and there's so much to eat!\" Michelle laughed right in Simba's face, spewing foul-smelling spittle on his fur before taking him down from his perch atop her shoulder. She sat him down atop her grey dome of a stomach instead, the organ inside eager for more nourishment. \"Of course, we'll honor the 'letter' of our promise, kind of like me and Henriette honored putting you back on the throne. We won't ask our new subjects to be our food. We won't make requests, not when it comes to the food we eat. Harvest looking a little skimpy? Not a problem, a herd of gazelle is easy to find, and at our size, there's not much a fight they can give us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba shook in terror atop Michelle's stomach as she laid out what exactly was going to happen to the Pride Lands, his old home, in vivid detail. He regretted asking the question in the first place. Lions ate prey, too, like a lot of other predatorial animals in the savannah, but these hippos, to them, this was a sport. \"Soon, Simba...you're going to have to get used to your new role in life as our pet.\" The hippo grinned as she forced the lion cub deep into the surface of her belly, delighting in his little struggles as he tried to push himself up from her grip on his back. \"Because if you think we're too much to handle now, I've got some bad news for you. We're only going to get bigger, hungrier, heavier, and needier. Maybe if you're a good kitty, we can talk about getting some of your friends and family to help lighten your workload. Unless you're okay with seeing them as hippo chub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion cub broke down, reaching his emotional limit, as he was forcibly snuggled into Michelle's soft stomach and tears began to well up in his eyes. His mind was filled with horrific images of his mother, Sarabi, going down precisely like Scar did, of Nala being thrown into the same wrestling ring that he found himself in only yesterday. \"Michelle...s-stop, please.\" Simba whimpered. \"I'll be a g-g-good kitty, just don't hurt them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey, enough with the waterworks...\" Michelle brought a hand down to reach Simba's face, wiping away a few fallen tears from his muzzle. \"Nothing's happened yet; there's no reason to cry over milk that hasn't even spilled, yeah? Sometimes, I...can get a little carried away with the teasing, it's not fun seeing you like this. All you have to do is be on your best behavior, can you do that for me?\" The hippo was still smiling, though her eyes were now contorted with worry.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion cub grit his teeth and forced himself not to let any more tears fall, nodding through the flexible stomach blubber to aver Michelle's question. Yes, he can be a cute little pet. He'll get stepped on, used as a seat, get eaten, and be a living toy for the rest of his life, but if it meant securing his family's safety, he'd do all of that and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...well, now that I've sated your curiosity about politics and whatnot, let's play a game.\" The hippo sets Simba off from her belly and down onto the floor of the rock, abruptly ending whatever sobs he still had in his system to get out. \"Hide and seek, plain and simple. You hide, and I'll seek. You'll have the advantage since this is all new territory for me. If you stay hidden...uhh, I guess I can take you to your mom, I think. She was asking about you earlier. I guess she was worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...serious?\" Simba asked. \"What happens if you find me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle doesn't answer. Instead, she gives Simba a win before she closes both her eyes. \"You've got until I get to a hundred. Ready?\" No, he wasn't, but the lion didn't have a choice as he began to make a mad dash away from the hippo as she began to count from one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Simba hide?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The cub felt a spark of optimism as he bolted away from the fat hippo. For once the deck was stacked in his favor. He mulled over his options. The main room offered a lot of hippos to hide among, but if Michelle's words about their voracious attitudes are anything to go by, his hiding place would end up being inside their bellies. And even if he managed to avoid getting swallowed, they'd give him up the moment Michelle asked them for him. Similarly most the upper floors would probably have hippos trawling around in them, stinking up the place. The watering hole was another alternative, but given the fearsome reputation and position of power Michelle now carried, the animals there would gladly give him up in exchange for not being on the menu themselves. He could keep his tiny frame hidden. It would be other creatures that were the biggest challenge. Though he loathed the idea, he knew he had to go somewhere without animals. The elephant graveyard sprang to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the cub snuck down into the lower caverns the distinct smell of hippo was replaced by the dusty stench of bone and decay. Scar's old lair was abandoned, the hyenas not keen on sharing Pride Rock with the fat beasts that usurped the place. Among the bones there were many hiding places and soon the cub had found a skull just big enough to hide in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his hiding place the little lion began to softly whimper. All of this was his fault. He'd led these hippos here, gave them a taste of power. And the moment they could, they seized it from him. He should've never tried to work with them. Now they were going to bring ruin to the Savannah to sate their hunger. And worst of all was that he, the prince and rightful heir to the throne, was now little more than a toy in their eyes. At least hide and seek was a pretty tame option as far as games go, especially considering Henriette's far lewder games after her victory in the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his self-pity was interrupted by the sound of something knocking over a stray bone. He was no longer alone in here. Had enough time passed yet for him to win? Or was the hippo close on his scent. Neither proved to be true as a distinct growl echoed from behind him. The cub turned around only to stare straight into the maddened yellow eyes of a hyena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well look who it is... The cub that cost us our home. Didn't think I'd find you here, all alone without your bodyguards no less. I'm sure the others would like a piece of you too, but I'm not in a sharing mood. So I think I'm just gonna rip you into tiny pieces until I feel better.\" The beast let out a howling cackle, saliva leaking from its slavering jaws. It looked almost familiar, like one of those sentries Michelle and Henriette chased off before charging in here. Simba shot away from the skull, surprising his opponent by being able to fit through the jaw and escape out the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fierce chase ensued. The cub's smaller size let him pick paths and shortcuts his pursuer couldn't follow, but the hyena's greater speed let it catch up again and again. Finally it backed Simba into a corner, high cliffs on either side of them and a towering pile of ribs blocking the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to enjoy this...\" The furious hyena growled as it slowly approached its prey. It was so occupied with the little shivering cub it didn't notice the large shadow appearing all around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an earthshaking thump the hyena vanished beneath the huge ass of Michelle. She had seen the chase and climbed up onto the cliffs for a devastating butt drop. Her aim was spot on, squashing the hyena flat and saving her little toy. But as happy as she was to have saved the cub, her desire to punish the beast that threatened him soon overtook. Simba watched in horror as she ground her ass from side to side, putting as much weight as possible on the flattened hyena. The cub didn't care much for his attacker, but it was a grim reminder of what these hippos would probably do to him if they felt a need to torment him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle hadn't said a word yet and as she got up she only gave a brief moan. The cub was surprised to hear her sounding aroused of all things. Soon it became clear why. Her heavy grinding had left the hyena's muzzle wedged deep between her asscheeks. So deep that when she got up it went up with her. Its whole head was lost to her jiggling assfat, the flattened body hanging limply save for the occasional twitch or struggle. The hippo reached back and to Simba's greater terror began to push it deeper. It seemed impossible for the hyena to go any further, but the muffled squelches soon proved otherwise. The little lion was nauseatingly sure what caused those sounds and he dreaded being forced to witness it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena steadily disappeared between those large asscheeks, the hippo's butt eagerly accepting its prey. It barely put up a fight as it entered Michelle's cramped back passage. The stench of hippo farts was a nightmare to deal with and with only a pair of legs still dangling from her pucker she blew a loud fart, knocking the hyena out completely. Only when she had finished 'swallowing' her victim did the hippo's attention turn to Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, cutie. You shouldn't run of that far. I'd never forgive myself if you got hurt. Well... hurt by someone other than me.\" She cooed, the cub flinching at her last sentence. This, in turn, soured the hippo's smile. Was he really that oblivious to all her teasing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I made sure that big, mean hyena can't hurt you anymore, let's get back to our game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Simba stay hidden long enough to win?</span></div></div>",

Simba blinked in surprise as the hippo cuddled him into her soft chest flab, remembering the promise that the predator made back at Pride Rock if he won. \"Well, a deals a deal. I guess I can let you spend some time with you mommy~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-really?!\" Simba allowed himself a rare smile as he looked up past the horizon of Michelle's smothering breast fat to see if the hippo was telling the truth. It had been so long since he had seen his mother, and right now, he needed her more than ever. After everything that had happened to him, a familiar, doting face was sounding like heaven. \"Thank you, Michelle! So, where is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Simba spotted Michelle's face grow devious as her smile twisted to show her teeth. \"She's closer than you think, kitten.\" She purred as she gave her stomach a tremendous big slap, prompting the organ deep inside to shift and gurgle with renewed vigor. Simba looked at the sphere of hippo flesh until a horrible truth dawned on him. \"Before I headed out to find where you scampered off to, I paid a special visit to your mom. She was mighty tasty. I bet it runs in the family~\" She lifted the cub suddenly, only to deposit the poor thing into her maw feet first. The cub struggled, but it was no use; the muscles constricting around him were just too powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore and more of his body was being dragged from the calm, cold outside world, back into the confusing, tight, sweltering haze that was the body of a hungry predator. The hippo was cooing with bliss all the while, finding cute little cubs like him to be yummier than anything else could ever hope to be, her tongue savoring every small part of him as he was pulled down and down, deeper into his abyss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt got to the point that his chin was resting on that playful tongue, which took a moment to lap his face, while the hippo delighted in treating him to one last view of the outside world, framed by the silhouette of her jaws. Strands of slobber surrounded him, though, eventually forcing him to clench his eyes shut as he was soaked to the point of concealment. All of this building up to the point she finally closed her jaws in front of him, sealing him in darkness as she leaned her head back, and gave her one last big, mighty swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't a single part of him that wasn't being squeezed and squished all over within the dark, warm confines of his predator's body. Reality seemed like a dream-like haze, where all he had was the countless sensations all around him. The hippo gave the biggest, most devious grin as she trailed along with the bulge he made in her throat, as he descended downwards and downwards, slowly squeezing more and more through that tightened sphincter until, finally, his form disappeared beneath her blubbery chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there you go~\" She smiled, sitting back and patting her belly with a blushy expression of sheer satisfaction on her face, delighted at having been treated to her most lovely meal in a while. The mother was more filling, but the lion cub just had this particular flavor that was so perfect in every way. Of course, the amount of room he took up in her stomach immediately forced all the other gasses out, resulting in a big, mighty belch forcing its way up from her throat! \"Unff! Kicked up a lot of air in there, huh? Hell, it's been way too long since I've had a meal like you, kitten~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to describe what it was like to be in Michelle's stomach except for the phrase' total sensory bombardment'. At least it was easy enough to describe what it looked like, complete darkness. Describing the feeling was somewhat harder. Those unbelievably soft, smooth walls squished down around him, the wrinkly rugae providing texture as his stomach massaged him all over, squishing him down into the veritable hot tub of chyme, gastric juices, and the mashed-up remains of half-digested food pooling around him. Up to his middle, he was continually soaking in the concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer intensity of the experience was making the lion cub shiver and shake all over! He could hear his heartbeat; he could listen to his lungs inflate and deflate; he could make out everything. The sheer amount of gurgles, churns, sloshes, and slurps ringing out from unknown organs all around him made it feel like the hippo's body was some grand machine, and he was stuck inside of the discord. And there she was, right next to him lying limp, Sarabi. The larger lion tiredly opened one eye, curious as to what new thing was pressing up against her side, when a look of surprise came across her face. \"Sim...Simba?\" She questioned, almost not believing what she saw before her. She pawed at the cub's back, testing to see if her mind was playing tricks on her. \"Is it you, after all this time? Oh, Simba!\" The lion cub found himself wrapped in an affectionate embrace from Sarabi, and he immediately returned it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, oblivious to all this, the hippo stood with the most triumphant grin, patting her belly and celebrating her' catch.' \"No escape now, I've gotten pretty good at keeping cute little kittens like you two down. Hehe~\" She grinned, taking big handfuls of her belly flab. \"Yup, there's no way out of there until I let you out\u2026 and if you think that'll be any time soon, you've got another thing comin'. So get used to it in there~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she played with her prey, wriggling her belly around and squishing it with her hands to make the whole experience even more intense for the two lions inside. The hippo grinned as she felt them wriggling against the confines of her gut, letting one last proud belch as she admired his stomach. \"Heh, wriggle all you want, but you can't even be seen through this big old stomach of mine. I can parade you around wherever I wanted, and nobody would even know you were in there,\" she smiled. \"In fact\u2026 I think I might as well show off to the fellas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Michelle walked right back to Pride Rock, with no evidence to ever prove that there were two lions desperately struggling deep beneath that thick layer of wobbling chub that made up her gut. Heading back up into the main cavern, the rest of her family remained utterly oblivious. This lets the hippo savor the look on their faces when she brags about what she's done, and they all poke and prod her belly for a chance to feel the faint movement of Simba and Sarabi deep beneath that flab.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry, mom... it's all my fault.\" Simba whimpered as he nuzzled his head against Sarabi's ruined fur. \"Everything is my fault. I led the hippos here to get rid of Scar. They told me I would get to be King. But then it all fell apart. The rest of them came and now-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh...\" Sarabi gently shushed her son, licking away some of the tears coming down his cheeks. \"It's okay, Simba, I'm just so happy I finally get to see you again. I don't care if you had invited a thousand of those beasts back here, I'll never stop loving you. Let me hold you, Simba.\" The lioness readjusts herself against the fleshy walls of Michelle's stomach so that her son could lean against her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Michelle plays more with the two lions inside her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: The hyena that Michelle 'swallowed' enters into her stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Michelle has a hankering for some more lions...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Uncle Elmer convinces Michelle to cough Simba up for some 'play time'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 5: Free Choice!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After showing off to the family Michelle bursts into a gleeful little victory dance. She swings her hips and sways her belly. Inside the little lion and his mother are thrown around the slimy confines of the stomach. half-digested gunk and chyme splashes against them, soaking Simba as thoroughly as his mom. Worse is whenever the hippo sways her big belly around to make the occupants slosh from side to side. Frequently the cub found himself up against the wall with his mother sliding into him. As much as she tried to control her movements, she couldn't help but squash him between her body and the constantly shifting stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Simba... Just hold on.\" She said, her voice reassuring as she crashed into him and smothered him into the muscular walls. The cub tried his best to avoid it, but in the erratic movement of his pitch black prison there was only so much he could do. Finally she managed to catch him and curl herself up around him to protect her son, but by then Michelle was getting bored with her little game. She gave the two a little pause, treating them to the sounds of another lion being bullied into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis defiant growls rang out loud enough to be heard, but so did Michelle's response. \"Bad boys like you will be taught a lesson. You're lucky my belly is already stuffed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed like a step up until they heard the distinct thump of hippo ass meeting stone and a piercing cry from the lion. It wasn't long as it felt like Michelle had just used that vast ass of hers to squash him, forcing the air from his lungs. Only subdued groaning still came from below as she ground her heavy asscheeks on his body. For a moment she pondered sending him down the same path as the hyena earlier, but she didn't really feel like it. But as she shuffled back and forth more vigorously a stray limb did brush against her pussy. It sent a surprise wave of pleasure through her and reminded the hippo of something she was still very eager to do. She stood up, leaving the flattened lion to recover and maybe learn some kind of lesson about obedience. The hippo walked away from the herd that was her family, finding a small secluded cave in Pride Rock to do her business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt the walls closing in and braced himself for the worst. The dark prison flexed and convulsed, separating him from his mother and sending him on a rollercoaster ride through Michelle's body. He couldn't tell up from down anymore until he suddenly flinched as light hit his eyes. He was hurried along and spat out, finding himself shivering in the hippo's arms. She lapped away the worst of her stomach juices before inspecting the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, wasn't that fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... You ate my mother!\" Simba cried, tears rolling down his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, don't fret. I'll keep her nice and safe in my belly. The others might not have been so careful.\" She replied, trying to sound reassuring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster.\" The cub kept blubbering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's for your own good... I'm sure you'll come to see it my way soon enough.\" Michelle's voice sounded duplicitous. Like she was trying to comfort him and threaten him at the same time. It made Simba's skin crawl, but not nearly as much as what she had in mind next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now to more important things. Little cubs like you need a mother to look after them. And with your own mother probably not able to last long without my protection I think it's best for me to adopt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You <i>what?!</i>\" Simba said incredulously, a second voice joining in from the hippo's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep it down, you.\" The hippo prodded her gut, annoyed with the lion's interference. \"I mean, right now you're just a meal waiting to be eaten or played with, but if they learn I'm your momma you'll be a lot safer. And don't worry, I'll still let you see your own mom too, she's not going anywhere.\" Michelle smirked as she felt some futile struggling in her gut, the adult lion clearly not happy with the prospect of being held there for an indeterminate length of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba mulled over his options before hitting a dreadful realization. With hesitation in his voice he asked. \"Do I even have a choice in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle maintained her unflinching demeanor as she brought home the bitter truth. \"Of course not, I just want to tell you how things are gonna be from now on. I'll expect you to call me mommy and you'll be punished if you misbehave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P... Punished?\" Simba stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. Hippo children get sat on to teach them a lesson...\" She mused aloud, Simba's jaw hitting the floor. He'd just heard her crush a fully grown lion into submission in seconds with that ass and his experiences in the ring with Henriette weren't any better. \"...but for you I think I'll just put you up my ass like I did with that hyena. So you better not be causing trouble.\" Michelle finished. The cub was dumbstruck. How was that any more fitting? He gulped, knowing the steep price for not obeying this crazy hippo who thinks herself his second mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then, let's make this official.\" She announced, grabbing hold of the cub. \"My sister might do this for fun, but when I'm done I'll be your mother. So you best behave, young man.\" She said, her motherly tone only slightly less intimidating than her usual predatory affect. The cub was rushed along between the hippo's thick legs, a distinct piercing stench hitting his nose. It was painfully clear that she was aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba gasped in horror as she rubbed him against her large pussy, replacing the few leftover streaks of stomach residue with large volumes of slippery goo. The potent feminine musk burned the little lion's nostrils, but his every struggle did nothing but arouse the fat beast more. She pressed him into the soft flesh, massaging herself to near orgasm before even partially inserting the lion. With a goal in mind Michelle bit her lip and pushed hard. The cub's world became darkness as he felt himself get squeezed into the slippery depths, his head first to be claimed by the hippo's snatch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe overpowered his every effort at escape and kept pushing him deeper until he was completely surrounded by her clammy warmth. The cub was at her mercy and Michelle couldn't be happier to feel her new son squirming inside of her. She didn't even bother pushing him all the way to her womb, her love tunnel already proving spacious enough to hold onto the cub. She bore down on him, her inner walls squeezing his little body from all sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub winced and squirmed, but the powerful flesh surrounding him was completely in control. It squeezed and undulated like a hungry animal chewing on its prey. He could hear the distant thump of a heartbeat, much faster this time around, and the myriad of sloppy squelches produced by the various corners of Michelle's body. The heat was sweltering and the smelly goop matting his fur stung his nose. But the worst part of this with a distance were the odd, muffled moans echoing through the fat beast. She was using him as a toy for her pleasure and there was nothing he could do about it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba didn't know how long he spent inside of Michelle's love tunnel, the cub's sense of time ceased to function as he endured the torment that the hippo was giving him. All that he could think about as his body was continuously squeezed and pulled was how his life had changed into utter hell. First, his father, Mufasa, died in a stampede, allowing his Uncle Scar to chase him out of the pride lands. When he thought he made some new friends in Timon and Pumba, Simba meets Henriette in the ring, and he's humiliated and beaten in front of a laughing crowd. He was reduced to a toy for sexual stimulation for a family of monsters that took over his home, while his only family left is held close by in just as bad of a situation, if not worse. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this pain, all this degradation was beginning to take a toll on Simba's mental welfare. As horrible as the hippos have treated him, his need to survive is stronger than his impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma. Much to his further shame, Simba moaned as he felt himself twinge with stimulation as a thick, goopy strand of feminine juice forced its way into his mouth while he tried to take in a breath. He was beginning to LIKE what was happening to him, although he tried as hard as he could to force those feelings back down. Now that he was faced with the future of calling his tormentor, his second mother, a positive emotional bond would have to be made to mitigate any potential punishment in the future. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion cub had been rendered a hapless, battered, powerless and submissive thing of what he once was. The only way he was going to survive in this world now was to obey the whims of his new hippo family. Inside of Michelle's body, the rest was impossible. Every movement she made, even when stationary, shifted her insides around, always too hot and too chaotic to find respite. Finally, after what seems like a full day, Simba felt himself being squeezed back out from where he had slipped in through the hippo's clit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light burned his eyes as he was taken out from the confines of her vagina, and quite suddenly, he was deposited into a pool of water. Going from inside of a hot furnace to chin deep in a cold pool was incredibly shocking, but not as surprising as what he saw next. Right above his tired, weak body as he flailed around in the water was Sarabi, smiling down on him dotingly. Her fur looked clean, if a bit matted, and without a word, she began to wash her son a way of remaining stomach juices and hippo cum. \"M-m-mom\u2026\" he tried to speak, but his mind was a confused, blurry haze from everything that had happened. \"Miche-I mean, um...my other Mommy let you out?\" Sarabi frowned at this, nodding as she licked away some of the gunk around his ears before spitting it out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove, Simba and Sarabi heard the familiar sound of a stomach digesting a new meal. The smaller of the two felines pried his gaze away from his mother and looked up behind him, coming face to face with Michelle's belly, more significant and fatter than he had ever seen. It was distended and bloated, moving of its own accord as the hippo gave her new son a happy, smug smile. \"Yeah, I had to after I spied this Zebra family nearby. They seemed so happy to see me; I guess they were happy to meet one of the hippos that took down Scar.\" She gave the vast sphere of the flesh a heaty slap, delighting in every squirm the three Zebras gave out. \"The look on the kid's face when I gulped down his parents was priceless, although he wasn't as filling. Oh, that reminds me! You two probably haven't had much to eat, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo lazily pointed out to the other side of the pool, which Simba could see was the watering hole, where a substantially sized pile of fruit was piled along its shore. The cub would have preferred meat, but Michelle was right, he was starving for just about anything he could get his hands on. \"T-thank ...thank you, mommy.\" Simba offered to the hippo, to which her smile grew wider. \"May I please have some food now?\" Sarabi scowled but continued to say anything. It pained her to see her son so submissive, a far cry from the noisy, troublesome little thing he was before all this tragedy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Simba! 'May I'? You don't have to be so formal around me, little kitten!' The hippo laughed as she reached down and hoisted Simba away from his birth mother up to the top of her writhing stomach. The usual hippo musk was still there, it was a hot day outside, after all, but it appeared that Michelle indulged in a bout of hygiene at the watering hole. The grime washed away, her now clear skin shone in the light as it glistened with sweat. \"But...since you're so nice and polite, I think an early dessert is in order~.\" She giggled again as she slowly guided the cub across her squirming belly towards her breasts, gesturing to her fat, pink nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-o-oh\u2026\" Simba realized what Michelle was implying. Now that the lion cub was her son, it only made sense in her mind that she did what mothers do and breastfeed. He hadn't had milk in a very long time, and he felt like he was too old for it now, a blush coming up to his cheeks. But he knew this crazy beast did not tolerate that misbehavior, and he was hungry. He gave his birth mother one last look, Sarabi looking horrified, before he plunged on that sensitive nub. Michelle let out a surprised squeak of pleasure as she felt the cub suck without her saying to begin, beads of creamy fluid dribbling down his chin. He was expecting the milk to taste stale and sour, but to his surprise, it was slightly sweet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle, seeing Simba twisting his mouth into a smile from the sweet taste, cooed as her heart melted from the adorable scene. She rubbed the little cat's back slowly, making him mew through his meal. But the view was ruined as her gaze shifted to Sarabi's downcast expression as she saw it all unfold. \"I know you hate me. I know you have no reason to even remotely like me, but I'm not lying when I say that I care for Simba.\" The hippo frowned. \"I'm going to need you to at least put up with me, at least for now. I'm going to need your help raising this little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi stifled a look of anger as the hippo had the nerve to not only steal her child away but ask for the lion to be okay with it. \"What...do you want me to do?\" She said at last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to go and get something to eat.\" Michelle pointed over to the pile of fruit once again. \"And maybe after that, if you're up to it, my feet could use a rub right about now. They're pretty sore from having to lug you around in my belly.\" She raised a fat foot playfully into the air, water dripping from its sole near Sarabi's muzzle. The older lion grumbled but nodded before going over to the other side of the watering hole. By then, Simba was starting to feel full from all the milk he had been drinking, and soon he unclamped his mouth from the hippo's breast with a stifled burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got enough, kitten?\" Michelle poked the lion cub in his now slightly distended belly, full of vitamin-rich hippo cream that his battered body desperately needed. Simba nodded, feeling much more energetic now that his stomach was satisfied, though his body was still sore from the hot furnace that was her love tunnel. \"Good. Now that you're officially apart of the family, that means you get special treatment. No one's going to mess with you...unless, of course, they have my say so.\" Michelle giggled as she realized Henriette would never forgive her if Simba becomes off-limits entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-and my mom? I mean...uh Sarabi.\" Simba scowled as he referred to his mother as not his mother. Using her real name felt weird on his tongue. \"Is she protected like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One, in hippo families, we've got nothing against having two moms, so you don't have to say Sarabi if it sounds weird.\" Michelle smiled a little less deviously then she usually does. \"And two, not a chance, kitten. Making you my son doesn't make her my sister in law or whatever, she's natural prey. I'll keep her safe, don't you worry, but that safe place is somewhere you're very familiar with, I'm sure.\" She pats the writhing stomach that you were perched upon, the zebras inside beginning to melt into a caloric slurry waiting to be absorbed into more hefty pachyderm blubber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Michelle puts her son to work with Sarabi cleaning her feat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Simba tries to make the best of his situation and get along with Michelle better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 3: Michelle lets Simba play in the water, leaving her alone with Sarabi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 4: Another hippo comes over to the watering hole.

The little lion didn't need to be told twice. After spending that much time up close with the hippo he could use a moment for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he bounded out of earshot the fat beast turned her attention to Sarabi. The older lion was still hungrily attacking the plate of food, chowing down as much as she could. When Michelle beckoned her over she growled a little before reluctantly returning to her. As she got close the hippo pulled her feet up out of the water and held them out to the lioness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start licking.\" She commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\" Sarabi growled defiantly. The hippo frowned, she didn't want to torment Simba's mom in front of him, but this couldn't go unpunished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I get that you think you're all that. You've been in charge of this place since forever. But you ain't the top of the food chain anymore. So unless you want to join those zebras on my hips you better quit the attitude and accept that this is the only way you'll be spending any time with our son. So start. Licking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi swallowed her pride and stuck out her tongue, a devious smile growing on Michelle's face. After letting her feet soak in the water they were already clean enough, but seeing the lion put herself in such a submissive position was worth it. The feeling of that raspy tongue dragging along her soles sent a shiver down her spine. Or it just tickled. Either way, the hippo was satisfied, seeing the older lion finally seeming to accept the reality of the situation. But after a few licks Sarabi gave her an unexpected question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now? You're in charge of everything, how do you plan on keeping everyone happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your reign of the Savannah has already established that keeping people happy is completely optional as long as they're too afraid to do anything about it. And you lions certainly had that down. But I think we'll be able to top that voracity and cruelty.\" Michelle mused, giving the lion a devious glare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't look so surprised. Did you really think we liked having rulers that demanded live prey every day? How many of those animals you proclaim to rule over do you think have had to say goodbye forever to a family member or friend because you wanted tribute? Did you imagine that little 'circle of life' bullshit did anything to temper that pain? You had the good sense never to ask us or this little revolution would've happened a lot sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's it? You're just gonna keep eating whatever isn't nailed down until someone deposes you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? It worked wonders for you.\" Michelle snapped back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then if we're all just food, why not eat me and be done with it?\" She growled. Grisly as it sounded, death seemed a better alternative to having to endure the hippo's 'protection' for the rest of her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be like that. It's not that awful having me to keep you safe. And if you must know, it's because I don't want Simba to grow up without his mother. Well, his lion mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you care so much about him? Every other lion has been degraded to toy or snack, what makes him any different?\" Sarabi asked, shocked by the previous answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle paused a moment. She knew the answer, but she wanted to put it into words properly. The older lion smirked, hoping to have finally caught the hippo tripping on her own logic. But with a calm expression the hippo provided a response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First off, I think you can agree he's really cute. But can't you see that he's special? He had the bravery to ask me and my sister to help overthrow Scar. I mean, what kind of madman does that? We don't respect much, but that right there shows promise. It also helps that he finally seems to have accepted his place. Obedience is a rare trait among you lions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi snarled a little at that final remark, but the hippo didn't care. Michelle knew she was right, wiggling her stubby toes to demand more licking. When the lioness reached in, tongue at the ready, the hippo suddenly leaned in, grabbing the lioness and pulling her closer. In an instant Sarabi found herself between two thick thighs, the blubbery mass encasing all but her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thankfully, with some effort, even you can be taught.\" Michelle whispered, malice dripping off her words. She squeezed her victim between her thighs. Having the air crushed from her lungs there was no more than a silent gasp as the lioness was shown her place. She wouldn't hold out against this onslaught for long, but thankfully the hippo decided her message had come across. She relented, letting the lion breathe but keeping her pinned between her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I don't want to hear another growl, grumble or snarl from you... or else...\" The hippo ramped up the pressure, crushing the trapped lion again to thoroughly instill her message. Sarabi grit her teeth, trying not to let the hippo see the pain she was in. But Michelle knew the power hidden in those fatty thighs of her. She'd crushed many things into submission or worse with them. She let the lioness' flop free from its sweaty prison, leaving Sarabi breathing heavy between her legs. Hopefully she'd be a bit more accepting of Michelle as Simba's other mother now. Speaking of the little cub, where did he go? She scanned the water, but didn't see him at first. Like mother, like son it seemed. Michelle already pictured the disobedient cub being taught the same lesson, her crushing thighs smothering him completely. But before she could daydream any further the little lion appeared from behind a bush, completely unaware of the torment his mother had been put through. She beckoned him over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think it's time we head home. By the feel of it, those zebras have left the building, so your room is ready.\" She gave Sarabi a sly look, the lion letting out a weary sigh and accepting what was about to happen. With no ceremony at all Michelle lifted her up and stuffed her down her throat. Simba looked away, but the wet slurping, squelching and gulping were unmistakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah, still tasty.\" Michelle smiled, patting her belly and picking the cub up by the scruff of his neck.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Wow\u2026\" Simba fluttered his eyes as he took in Michelle's form. \"D-did you get...bigger?\" Yes, she did. In addition to a Hippo's stomach being able to control what it does and doesn't digest, it was brutally efficient in breaking down whatever was unfortunate enough to end up inside. In the time that Simba had to himself playing around the watering hole, the Zebra family that his new mother ate had broken down into a goopy pulp, and by the time Sarabi entered, they weren't even that. There was no mistaking it, however slight the changes were, there was more Michelle now than there was before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach protruded farther out; her breasts sagged more heavily, her rear end had more fat to sway, she even looked to be a few inches taller. \"Maybe a little,\" Michelle smirked as she brought the little lion cub closer to her face. \"But that just means there's more of me for you to love.\" Before Simba realized what she was doing, the fat beast parted her maw with a smile and gave her son a lick-kiss. He squirmed a bit at first, asking her to cut it out, but there was no hiding the smile he mirrored or the giggles in between his requests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHippo tongues could be quite acrobatic when they wanted to, the fat muscle washing over his paws and premature whiskers, tickling him to no end. When she was done, Simba was still smiling as she deposited him atop her right shoulder. Michelle rose from her seat on the shore of the watering hole before walking back in the direction of Pride Rock. \"Um...M-mommy, can I ask you a question?\" Simba piped up after some time, earning a lazy eye roll from the hippo as she gave him her attention. To her surprise, the lion cub was blushing slightly now. \"Um...what do I taste like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, why would you ask a question like that, Kitten? Do you want to be more like me or something?\" Michelle probed with a smile, pleasantly unprepared for such a query. Simba squirmed underneath the hippo's gaze, fumbling his paws together as he tried to force the words out of his mouth. \"It's hard to describe; that's why I like eating prey. Their flavor is so much more complicated than regular fruit or dead meat. If you want to know, you taste like cherries drowned in cream, with a hint of salt.\" To this, Michelle gave the cub another lick; this time, the tongue stayed far longer to relish in his distinctive flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cherries and salt? Sounds gross.\" Simba shivered in disgust, but while Michelle kept on trekking to Pride Rock, the wheels in her head began to turn. Simba was adorable as a lion cub, but, in all honesty, also horribly frail. She and the rest of her family were planning on fatter and more substantial from the spoils of their new kingdom, but If the lion cub stayed the same, it would get more and more probable that one of their play sessions would leave him seriously hurt. She didn't plan on relenting Simba's torment, but she didn't want to kill him accidentally. He was part of the hippo family now, so it was time he started acting more like them. \"So, what are we going to do now?\" Simba piped up, catching Michelle in the middle of her train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I was just thinking about that.\" Michelle had a mischievous glint in her eyes as she spoke. \"I'm glad that you enjoyed your 'dessert' earlier, but I'm willing to bet that you have a craving for some real protein, huh?\" Simba gently prodded at his hippo milk-filled stomach, the slightly distended spear swaying ever so gently as Michelle trekked across the Savannah. He was full, but the prospect of a proper lion's meal made the fullness go away to a point. Sheepishly, he nodded to his 'mother,' prompting a hearty chuckle from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as luck would have it, Michelle noticed a gentle, resulting in the long grass to the left to her, most likely one of the many smaller animals that made their home in the Pride Lands. Usually, something that little would barely be considered a snack to the hippo...but Simba would have to start somewhere. The enormous fat beast stopped in her tracks towards Pride Rock, and with practiced grace despite her bulky size, jumped up into the air over where she saw the grass move, nearly throwing her new son off her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah!\" A high-pitched voice rang out from underneath the rapidly growing shadow of Michelle's descending form before an earth-shattering boom rang out as she landed ass-first into the ground. The owner of the voice was pinned to the underside of the hippo's thick thigh, a female meerkat who pounded her fists helplessly against the Earth, pleading for release. \"Please, g-get off of me, I can't breathe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, what are you doing?\" Simba asked with growing dread as he observed his second mother oblige the meerkat's request, wriggling her fingers around her as she raised the small mongoose higher and higher into the air. \"If you're going to eat her, can you-mph, MMMPH!?\" Before the lion cub could finish his sentence, the hippo cut him off by forcefully inserting the imprisoned meerkat into his open maw. The little lion flailed and squirmed against Michelle's advances, but there was no stopping her; she pushed more and more of the meerkat into his head, forcing him to start swallowing so that he wouldn't choke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle kept a steady, constant smile as Simba enveloped more and more of the meerkat's body, her torso slick with lion spittle as he tried to breathe and swallow at the same time. The only thing that mitigated against the intense confusion that he was in...was the unanticipated cornucopia of taste dancing on his tastebuds as he took in his first living prey. If lions tasted like cherries and salt, meerkats tasted like pork and paprika, and onions and mushrooms and apples! He tried not to, but the lion cub couldn't help but smile at the waves of pleasure his tongue was sending to his brain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meerkat was soon only a pair of legs kicking without an aim in the air, Michelle no longer having to support her body as Simba now was brining her down of his own accord. The lion cub's already bloated belly inflated further as the meerkat entered headfirst into a slurry of acid and milk. But no matter how hard she screamed, no matter how hard she kicked her feet, she was already past the point of no return. Finally, with a sloppy slurp, the last of the meerkat's paws disappeared from the world, never to be seen again, and Simba was left a panting mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, however, the horror of what he had just done dawned on him. \"Oh...oh m-my god...\" he moaned as he pawed his now strained gut, a wince of pain and pleasure from being so full ringing out from where he prodded. \"I can feel her move inside...it huuuurts...!\" The lion cub rolled onto his back atop Michelle's broad shoulder as best he could, trying to alleviate the pressure on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh wow, I guess I kind of forgot what it was like the time I had my first prey...\" Michelle cooed, gently lifting the cub down from her shoulder to a more comfortable spot atop her blubbery bosom. Simba had a proper potbelly, with the meerkat inside punching little bumps against his stretched, furred skin. \"Here, this is a trick my mom did with me when I had a tummyache~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba attempted to push the encroaching hippo snout away as it approached his distended stomach. Because of her, he was now in the process of digesting someone alive, what could she possibly do right now to make him feel better? But despite his mistrust, there was a lot that she could do to help him. First, she gave the distended stomach a small, short kiss. It didn't do much, but it tickled and put a smile on the cub's face through the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Michelle began to rock that stomach back and forth, the meerkat inside getting soaked in digestive juice, only stopping when she was rendered unconscious from the lack of fresh air. Finally, the hippo began massaging her lion son's stomach thoroughly, soothing the taut skin underneath his fur while he groaned in restrained pleasure from the treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go, Kitten. Feel better?\" Michelle stopped after a while, the little cat in between the valley of her breasts rapidly losing energy as he began working down on the most enormous meal he ever ate. He mewled like a lost alley cat in the rain, nodding wordlessly to Michelle's query. \"Good...how did she taste?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-amazing...but I wish you would have warned me, I almost choked.\" Blood rushed to Simba's cheeks as he relented how he felt about his meal. There was a great deal of shame in delighting in how good another living thing tasted, but there was no denying that he enjoyed what his second mother did to him. What would Timon think of him know? \"Am I...going to have to eat more meerkats?\" He asked with both anticipation and terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kitten, now that your apart of the family, you're going to be eating a lot more than just small-time like that,\" Michelle smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the hippo and cub got closer to Pride Rock Michelle opted to take a small detour. Simba followed along, but was curious to know why they weren't going home. It didn't take long for him to recognize the familiar tree they were moving towards. The wide trunk of the baobab that housed Rafiki was all too distinct. A shiver ran down the lion's spine. He could really do without more of his friends getting exposed to these voracious hippos. He was all the more surprised to see the monkey greet them with the same elated voice he always had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon, how are you two today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\" Simba was still lost for words. Had Rafiki not heard of what happened in Pride Rock? How could he be so casual with the hippo?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're fine, thanks.\" Michelle replied curtly. She looked over to the dumbstruck lion and rolled her eyes. \"Maybe a bit full on food, but otherwise fine.\" She added with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah hah ha. I see... And what carries you to my humble home?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like your help with my son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your son? And where is he?\" The mandrill asked, curious about the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right there.\" Michelle pointed at the cub, who finally stammered out an awkward greeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The lion?\" Rafiki's voice was filled with confusion. But before the hippo could elaborate on her adoption he shrugged and nodded. \"Very well, what about him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to make him big and strong like myself. Because well... look at him. He's adorable, but he's not that much to look at. And I know that in a couple of years he might be a bit bigger, but well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you want more? Ah hah ha ha, you hippos, always vying to be the biggest. Rule of the roundest belly, right? But when your little son is all big and grown up, will he still be the cute little thing you adopted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle smiled happily. It was strange for Simba to see. Normally there was always an air of glee or malice about her smile, but right now she seemed genuinely just cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he'll always be my cute little thing. Now can you help me or not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, you presume much of my abilities, but I can guide you on the path like a fly zooming across a pond.\" Rafiki said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Michelle's brow furrowed with annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him here.\" The monkey extended a hand to Simba, the hippo giving him a fierce nod prompting the cub to approach them. As the little lion raised his paw to give to Rafiki, the mandrill reached further and put his hand on Simba's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I see you're already trying to speed things up yourself.\" He mused to the hippo. Michelle huffed a little, her patience wearing thin. Rafiki turned his attention to Simba, looking him in the eyes. \"Yes, I can see big things in your future. But a future tomorrow is as distant as a future three years away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three years? I came here because I thought you could deliver me something better than waiting three years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, and you think I can not?\" The monkey joked, tapping the hippo on the head with his staff. Michelle let out an irritated growl, but he seemed unfazed by her anger. Instead he went into his home. The sounds of vigorous rummaging around could be heard and a minute later he came back with a small fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it?\" the hippo huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big things come in the smallest packages. Especially when they've got to fit in an overstuffed belly.\" He replied with a laugh. He gave Simba the fruit, the cub straining to eat it. He felt stuffed and even though the meerkat had stopped wriggling in his belly, it did little to diminish his bloated gut. It didn't help that the fruit tasted as dry and old as Rafiki himself. Michelle looked on with baited breath, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, now what?\" She huffed. Rafiki tapped her on the head again and a second piece of the same fruit was left balanced on her large snout. The hippo bristled for a moment, her patience reaching its last straw with the annoying monkey. Simba was the only reason she'd humoured him so far. She did what she does best with food and scarfed it down, practically inhaling the little piece of fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you wait a minute and you'll no longer have to look down to see your son.\" Rafiki mused, smiling broadly and taking a few steps back. He held onto his staff and watched with rapt attention. No matter how this would end, it would no doubt be amusing.</span></div></div>",

The lion cub's fruit received what the hippo's fruit gave, and as it melted away with the acid, milk, and assorted bits of Meerkat, his body absorbed it with unusual eagerness. The pachyderm's adopted son went wide-eyed as his body involuntarily spasmed, wave upon wave of pure, enchanted energy coursing through his veins. But he wasn't in pain, the widening smile on his face could attest to that. Whatever the fruit was doing to him, it felt good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh... what's ha-happening to me...\" Simba half moaned and giggled, a firm, warm sensation enveloping his whole being before the first changes became apparent to Rafiki and Michelle. With a series of soft popping sounds, the lion shifted away from being a quadruped to a biped, his two front paws becoming more dexterous while his hind legs became his legs. Tongue lolling out from his mouth as he lay stomach up, it was apparent to see that his already distended belly was further ballooning outwards. Soft, supple blubber piled layer upon layer of warmth for its new host, his lithe legs turning to trunks and prominent man-boobs growing on his chest. \"M-more...more!\" The thickening lion cried out in joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much more is he going to get?\" Michelle finally spoke up, hoping that Rafiki was able to cast light on Simba's transformation. She was glad that the monkey's shenanigans weren't a waste of her time, but as the lion grew up and out in weight and height, she was naturally curious as to what he'll look like once his little mutation was over. \"Don't get me wrong, I'm all for what's happening to him, but...what exactly is happening to him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said earlier, you will wait until you no longer have to look down to see your son, remember?\" The Mandrill chuckled at Michelle's questions. Meanwhile, just as much as Simba was gaining weight, he was losing fur. For every pound of fat and muscle put in place along with his lengthening skeleton, his fluffy hair received by an inch \u2014 patches of yellow and cream fuzz fall, revealing pinkish-grey skin shining brilliantly in the savannah sun. \"And that's how much more he'll get, until your face to face with the child you want to see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Michelle wasn't interested in looking at her son as a lowly lion; she wanted a Simba that had the same hunger, desires, and needs as someone like her does. Sarabi was in for a shock when she eventually left the hippo's stomach because her flesh and blood was rapidly looking more and more like Pride Rock's gluttonous invaders. The lion cub groaned and moaned in ecstasy as his feline tail shortened to a stub, his buttocks just underneath inflating like beach balls. His muzzle broadens, his ears reorient, and with his newly formed hands, he feels up and down his growing body. In time, the cub turning hippo begins to stand up, wobbling at first, unsure of how to balance his increasing heft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle yelps in surprise as Simba falls forward against her torso for support, his eyes full of ecstasy and amazement. \"Is this...is this what it's like for you, all the time?\" He queries the longer established hippo genuinely curious, slowly growing in height from his eyes at her waist to her naval. His cheeks looked like they had two full meerkats stuffed in each one, more and more coming off from his body, revealing the pachyderm he was becoming. \"Always so big and soft, and big and powerful and...and hungry?\" A soft growl escaped from his ballooning tummy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide smile appears on Michelle's face as she takes in the lion-hippo's questions. \"Yep, and it never stops kiddo. Remember what I said earlier today? We're only going to get bigger, hungrier, heavier, and needier. Do you know what it means to have power like that?\" She pets the slowly growing Simba on his head, tufts of fur coming apart at her touch. She was afraid that his cuteness would evaporate as the changes went, but in a way, he looked almost more adorable now. He still retained his youthful spark, his eyes wide with wonder and innocence. \"And now that you're like us, so will you.\" To that, Simba surprised his adopted mother by rapping his plump arms around her side as his head brushed her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mommy.\" Simba buried his head into the same orbs he drank milk from earlier. Michelle blinked at how he addressed her as his mother; it was the first time it didn't sound forced or unnatural. His new hippo tail wagged happily behind him while Michelle hugged her son back, Rafiki watching the scene unfold with amusement. \"I can't wait to be just like you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba did not have to wait very long. Soon, his transformation from a sweet and adorable lion cub into a fat, greedy hippopotamus was nearing completion. It was hard to think that he ever looked anything remotely related to a cat, his once thin and fluffy torso now the size of a barrel, his legs and arms as thick as tree trunks, his maw big enough to fit five of his old self in with ease. And true to the Mandrill's words, the growth only stopped when the two pachyderms were at eye level with each other. Michelle, who couldn't be happier with how her Simba's metamorphosis played out, gave her son a lick-kiss across his newly cherubic face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that the change has been completed, there is now the small matter of payment.\" Rafiki ruined the tender scene by clearing his voice and announcing to the two hippos that his service was not for free. \"That fruit that I gave you was far from cheap, but since this is a family affair, you can have...say, two years working as my assistant?\" Michelle blinked, confusion, and rage boiling up inside her as the Mandrill calmly stated that her Simba was now his. But before she could have a chance to enact her fury, the former lion cub turned around to face him instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'll have more than that.\" He licked his lips greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I dunno, even for you that might be- Woah what hey-!!\" With a quickness utterly uncharacteristic of someone his size, Simba had set his massive body into motion and lunged forward. Before Rafiki could react, the new hippo had snatched a lively treat in his hands. Michelle gasped in shock, Simba had the Mandrill firmly trapped in his clutches, holding him like a simple sandwich. He squirmed valiantly, but that only tightened his iron grip around his waist. \"Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's answer was a smug grin and a dramatized lick of his lips. With that, he opened his mouth wide and immediately Rafiki into his hungry maw. He was given no chance to plead. No time to react. No way to even realize what the former lion thought of him until it was far too late. He was allowed mere moments for his mind to catch up to what was happening to him while Simba took the opportunity to savor his taste. He tilted his head up and sealed the Mandrill's fate with a single swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Rafiki slid down Simba's neck, he traced a claw along with the bulging outline of his form, easing it down his gullet. Until finally, he slipped out of sight and was forever lost within her enormous belly. Michelle suddenly felt dizzy; it had all happened too fast. Her son had shown that his mind had evolved along with his body in the transformation. A childhood friend meant less to the new hippo than the whims of his appetite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle couldn't have been more proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned out to be a greedy little thing, huh, kitten?\" Michelle walked up behind Simba to give the new hippo an embrace, catching him by surprise. \"Only a real hippo could do what you just did. How do you feel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mphrf...hungry.\" Simba smiled, rubbing his stomach idly. Rafiki didn't even make a bulge from the outside. He gave out the hippopotamus equivalent of a purr as he felt Michelle's blubber crest into his back, rapidly forgetting the torment she and her family put in through or at least seeing them in a new light. And with that, Simba the hippo was born.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Michelle had felt the older lion's protests in her belly. Kicking and shoving against the unyielding walls. Even some muffled shouting, though the hippo had no idea what was actually being said, her insulating blubber nearly muting it alltogether. The lioness had probably caught as little of what was going on outside, but her conclusions were that her son was in peril. The hippo couldn't wait to show her that the opposite was true. And now that Simba had transformed, she wouldn't be able to interfere in their plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi's frantic struggles finally paid off. It seemed like the fat beast was too annoyed with her to keep her down any longer. The stomach walls around her closed in, squeezing her through the narrow tube. She was getting real tired of being taken in and out of Michelle's belly, but this was the only way she could watch over Simba. Soon the wet tunnel was replaced with dry air as she fell to the ground. The lioness shook her head, wiping the worst of the hippo's stomach juices from her face. In front of her was another hippo, but this one seemed... odd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" She spoke coldly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" The hippo replied, his baritone voice sounding familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S... Simba?\" She stammered, her eyes widening in horror as she tried to wrap her head around what happened. This mountain of lard had her son's voice. \"What's going on here?\" She added, sounding increasingly distressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, mom. I'm fine. Mommy Michelle helped me be as big and beautiful as her. Now I don't have to worry about being eaten anymore.\" He tried to reassure her, but Simba's words could only do so much for a mother whose son had suddenly gotten much bigger and stronger than herself. The former cub struggled to convey his message too. His instincts were pushing him to see the scared lioness at his feet as little more than food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... I love happy reunions!\" Michelle cheered insincerely. She was up to something, Sarabi could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you know what would be even greater? How about you show your mommy how big you really are? You can carry her around now, like I do.\" She mused aloud, seeing a sly grin creep up on Simba's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi was shocked by the hippo's bluntness, but far more surprised when she felt her son grab her by the scruff of her neck. The level of ease with which he lifted her up in the air was terrifying. This was supposed to be her happy little boy, not some fat monster about to eat her. The lioness was hoisted up high, held dangling over the cavernous chasm of the hippo's maw. Simba's belly rumbled almost on command. There was nothing more she could say or do to stop this. Without hesitation he pushed her headfirst down his gullet. The tight flesh grabbed hold of its prey. Sarabi fought off her natural urges to resist, not wanting to hurt her son. From one fleshy prison to another, the lioness was starting to feel awfully bored by sliding through hippo throats into big, hollow bellies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba shivered with joy as he felt the large morsel travelling through him. An entire lion, down in one go. And yet, his hunger remained. He turned to Michelle, who was eager to lay her hands on his belly. Inside she could feel the weak squirming of two animals the cub had called family not too long ago. His transformation into part of his new family was coming along nicely. But as she stood there daydreaming and rubbing her son's gut, Simba surprised her with a suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy? Can I go out to the plains to get some food. My belly is all big now, but also still empty.\" His stomach grumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empty? I just watched you eat that dumb monkey and your own mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mostly empty. Can I? Please?\" The former cub whined, his low voice making his childish mewling sound all the more pathetic. Michelle just shrugged in response. He was a hippo now, how much trouble could he get himself in? Anything he couldn't eat he was now strong enough to crush into submission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, just be back at Pride Rock before sunset. I want everyone to meet the newest addition to our family!\" She said cheerfully, watching as the cub walked into the plains to start his voracious rampage. A tear welled up in her eye. She'd not felt this proud before in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba walked around with a confident stride. Where most of the beasts in the Savannah would've given him trouble before, now they'd better mind their own business or there would be more passengers in his gut. When he was well out of earshot, the former cub began talking to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you two, stay calm. I've nearly got you out of here.\" He said, his voice still somewhat hushed just in case. The squirming in his belly subsided, but only a little. Another few minutes of walking passed and Simba was now certain the hippos wouldn't be able to see what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi and Rafiki got squeezed together as the large stomach around them contracted to expel the two. A short trip later they were spat out right next to a small pond. They looked up to the fat monster, betrayal in their eyes. But before they could throw accusations at him, Simba falls to his knees and apologises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry I put you in my belly. But it was the only thing I could think of doing to get you out of there. Mom, it's not safe for you around those hippos. I love you, but I'm with them now. I'll be sure to visit you lots, but your little cub has grown up... literally I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba struggled to string together his words, but suddenly he felt a reassuring paw on his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Simba. I don't know what happened or how...\" The cub turned hippo looked up to see Rafiki looking away and feigning innocence. \"...but you'll always be my little boy. Promise me you'll be good.\" She said, trying not to cry in front of her son. But the waterworks had already started in his eyes. He grabbed her and lifted her into an overwhelming hug. Sarabi sank halfway into the soft blubber of her son. It hadn't stopped being surreal yet to have him be a hippo now, but at least he still had the kindness in him from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Rafiki... What were you thinking asking Michelle of all people to pay you? You're lucky I intervened or she would've done much worse to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah hah ha ha, do not threaten me with a good time.\" The mandrill chattered, earning him a confused look from both lion and hippo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, you're safe now. I'm gonna get something to eat and head over to Pride Rock. You should try to find the other lions that were smart enough to run away. I don't know when or how, but I'm gonna try and make this right.\" Simba stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just be careful, son. Even as big as you are, don't believe there aren't any dangers anymore for you.\" Sarabi replied, sounding as motherly as she ever did. The cub turned hippo smiled at her, squeezing her into his fatty chest one last time before setting her back down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his friends safe the cub could get on with his original plan. He was a hippo now, and the deep-seated urge to feast was ever present. It was hard for him not to gobble his mom and Rafiki right up again after letting them out. They felt so great filling his belly. But the cub stayed ahead of his instincts. It did leave his belly empty and the hippo was ravenous for a meal. He wandered around, hoping to find a nice opportunity when he heard screams coming from the other side of some boulders. There it was, the meal he was looking for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the hippo rounded the corner he saw what was going on. Before him were a small family of gazelles being harassed by two hyenas. The lithe herbivores were shaking on their legs as the menacing brutes closed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who should we eat? I think the chubby one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chubby? They're all skins and bones. I wish there was a chubby one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looking for chubby?\" The cub turned hippo said, introducing himself to the scene with a hungry smile.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before Sarabi left with Rafiki from the Pride Lands, she asked Simba to promise her that he would be good. The older lion could see the hunger in the cub turned hippo's eyes, and she knew that even as he hugged her against his newly thickened chest, a good portion of his brain was telling him she was nothing more than food. But though there was nothing that the mother could do about her son becoming a pachyderm, she hoped she could stop him from acting like one. Perhaps a few words of motherly advice would help drown out the more carnal desires to eat everything and everyone indiscriminately. But as Simba looked down at the hyenas and gazelles, the only thing he could think about how much bigger he might get after he was done digesting them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hyena that complained about his prey not having enough meat on their bones was the first to turn around to face the intruder's voice, prepared to attack before realizing just who was speaking. The other hyena turned after that, dropped its jaw in horror, and began to back away in fear. Yet Simba was not in the mood for a chase. Testing his newfound power, he let out a smirk and leaped into the air onto the escaping brute before it could get too far. Crashing down belly first onto the Savannah floor, the hyena let out a howl of pain as the hippo's weight crushed the air out of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, little guy? I thought you wanted a meal with some fat on them?\" Simba chuckled as he observed the pinned hyena flail in the vein, unable to breathe with the cub turned hippo's stomach flesh obstructing his mouth. The colossal pachyderm moaned as he felt his soon to be food wriggle against his torso; it was like a massage only much more intense. Now he understood why Henriette and Michelle liked to squash him when he was still a lion cub; it felt amazing. \"Lucky for me, I'm much less picky~.\" With no further foreplay, Simba forced the struggling hyena out from his vice grip and plunged him quickly into his drooling maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hyena that Simba left unattended was entirely opposed to his friend becoming hippo food, so without time for thinking, he threw himself against the intruder's thigh in an angry rage, attempting to sink its teeth into his blubbery hide. Unfortunately for the hyena, this did nothing save for tickling the hippo as he shoved his friend down his esophagus, his skin was too thick to be pierced like that, it seems. As soon as he was done with the first snack, he plucked the biting hyena off from the side of his leg and lifted him into the air. The gazelles that Simba 'saved' watched in increasing horror as both of their harassers were swallowed whole by this gluttonous stranger. Tracing the last of the hyena down his throat, Simba turned his attention to the family of antelopes; a mother, a father, and two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe father of the gazelles, hopeful that the rather gluttonous stranger helped them out because of good intentions, nervously walked up to Simba with a gracious smile. \"T-thank you, good sir...I think if you didn't show up, it would be us that would be stewing away, not them.\" The lion cub turned hippo, his hunger somewhat sated, had enough self-control to not grab the approaching antelope up into his maw followed by the rest of his family, but he would be lying if he said he wasn't tempted. \"Is there anything we can do to repay you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's stomach let out a powerful growl as it impatiently reminded its host that it was no way near full. The hippo smiled and affectionately slapped the great ball of fat and muscle, making it bounce and quiver right in front of the father's face. \"Well, do you know where I can find some more food? Those two hyenas were alright, I guess, but I don't see anymore around, and I'm starving!\" Simba chuckled as he saw the male adult gazelle's smile grow more strained, obviously realizing he and his family wasn't out of danger just yet. \"Hey, I have a perfect idea! Why should I go to the food when you can just bring it to me? That sounds like a fair trade for saving your lives, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"U-uh...r-right! Well, what would you like us to get? There are some fruit bushes near where we usually graze, or...\" The father of the gazelles slowly stopped talking as he saw Simba's big hand come descending onto his form. He didn't even try to resist as he was lifted into the air up against his savior's broad muzzle, grinning greedily as the hippo eyed his form. \"...pl-please don't eat me.\" He whimpered, his wife shielding the kids away from the scene as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as much as Simba wanted to do just that...Sarabi's words echoed back into his mind, and he sighed with a slight air of disappointment. \"Ah, well...since you said the magic word.\" With that, the hippo dropped the father down onto his expansive stomach, the children who had wiggled away from their mother's shield laughing from the humorous sight of him drowning into all that pachyderm fat. \"Now, here's the plan; I'm sure those hyenas I ate weren't the only ones who have been harassing you all, right? I'm going to hide behind that boulder, and you're going to go out and make yourself look like easy prey to some desperate predators. Then you bring that back here, and everyone's happy!\" The father, more than a little flustered after almost meeting his end twice in under ten minutes, felt obliged to agree to Simba's plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I could stand to do with less of those brutes trying to eat me every day...\" The father of the antelope family tried to slide off hippo's soft belly, not able to feel the struggles of the two digesting hyenas deep inside. \"But what's stopping us from just taking off the moment we're out of sight?\" The moment he said that he regretted it. It was never a good idea to give someone that could eat you and your family with ease ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks, I can't believe I didn't think of that!\" Simba slapped the side of his new hippo head, eternally grateful that the gazelle pointed out the flaw in his plan. His eyes landed on the two children nearby the horrified looking mother, appearing less scared of the great big hippo that saved them and more fascinated if anything else. \"I know, you can just leave those two here with me while you're getting me a proper meal. Don't worry; I'll take excellent care of them...you know until you come back. Which you will, right?\" The two adults looked like they couldn't believe what he just suggested, but before they could oppose the notion, the two kids, blissfully unaware as to how much danger they were in, paced up to the big fat goliath with big smiles. They seemed rather excited to spend some time with this big guy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright...come on, dear, let's do it for them.\" The father antelope, having managed to get off from Simba's stomach, galloped away with his mate away from the boulder in search of attracting some opportunistic hyenas, leaving the hippo with their two kids. They seemed transfixed by him; they've probably never seen anyone so big before in their lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let's get to know each other. My name's Simba, what's yours?\" Simba smirked as he quickly, yet carefully, grabbed the two premature gazelles by surprise and hoisted them onto his expansive dome of a stomach with room to spare. The two were a bit scared at first, but their fears quickly dissipated as they giggled from how soft and warm their new seating was. \"You guys gonna talk or just ogle my tummy all day?\" He asked playfully, earning a blush from the more feminine looking gazelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Akinyi, and my brother's name is Okello.\" The brother, obviously less shy than his sister, dropped down to start hugging the tough yet yielding flesh of Simba's belly fat, earning a sudden yelp followed by a relaxed coo from the hippo in question. \"Wait...your name can't be Simba. That was the name of the old king's son, and then he left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Simba!\u201d The lion cub turned hippo pouted childishly. \u201cI came back to get rid of Scar with the help of the other hippos and...uh, than they turned me into one.\u201d SImba rubbed the back of his head as he oversimplified a very complicated and fantastical story about how he accidentally installed a new regime over the Pride Lands. Thankfully, the two kids had no reason to disbelieve such a claim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, you mean you used to be smaller? Smaller than me?!\u201d Okello\u2019s eyes brightened up with curiosity. \u201cThat\u2019s so cool! I wanna be a hippo! Please?\u201d The boyish antelope tried to make himself look cute by making his eyes wide and tilting his head, which, in all fairness, was rather adorable. But even if Simba had any intention of fulfilling such a request, he just sent the only person that knew how to do it away with his mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh...maybe later. For now, since I\u2019m part of the family that rules the pride lands...I\u2019m in charge.\u201d The hippo smiled a little more mischievously, the oblivious kids innocently failing to notice the change. \u201cAnd since I\u2019m in charge, one of my duties is to look after and get to know my subjects. And I know the best way to do just that~\u201d</span></div></div>",

Their legs were unsteady already on the flabby gut and the heavy hit made them buckle instantly. He pressed the two down into the soft mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By hugging them!\" The hippo announced with a cheery voice. The two gazelles cheered too now that the shock of the surprise had worn off. The squishy belly they were pushed into was endlessly soft, the smooth hide pleasant to the touch. They squirmed a little against the overbearing pressure but it was all fine for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba on the other hand felt things he'd not felt before. The sense of power he had was... intoxicating. Feeling those pathetic little things squirming against his strength. He could so easily crush... no, none of that. The hippo shook his head. He would ignore his instincts. But at the same time it gained him a new understanding to why Henriette and Michelle were so eager to throw their weight into him. He couldn't deny how much fun it was, and judging by the cheers from the little gazelles he wasn't the only one enjoying his new appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rubbed their little bodies against his belly, massaging his stomach as it worked through what was left of those hyenas. Hopefully the parents would bring more soon. He had leverage on them, yes, but if they cut their losses and ran the cub turned hippo would be left with a very paltry offering. The two kids didn't exactly have a lot of meat on their bones. Maybe one mouthful combined. After a while he released the little ones, letting them scramble back onto their hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whee! That was fun, mister Simba. You must like being a hippo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm warming up to it.\" The pachyderm replied. He was mostly telling the truth too. In spite of his added chunkiness the cub felt remarkably powerful. Before he'd have to fear the hyenas, now they were the ones terrified of him. It felt good to be on the other side of that equation. But the ceaseless hunger that came with it was less pleasant. Even now he couldn't help but stare at those little morsels and wonder what it would feel like to add them to his big belly. Those parents better return soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be our big friend?\" Okello asked with the gazelle equivalent of puppy eyes. How could the cub turned hippo possibly say no to something so cute?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" He wrapped the two in his arms, pressing them against his flabby chest in a tight hug. They squirmed and cheered in his embrace, the hippo smiling down on the two. It would be so easy now. One little bite and... Again Simba shuddered, pushing back against his instincts. His mind was soon brought back to the gazelles as they had another request. \"Play with us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo quickly hatched a plan. He dissolved the hug just enough to grab hold of them, his large hands enveloping most of their little torsos. He raised his arms and brought each gazelle to an armpit, a weird sweaty stench wafting out from them. Before either could complain he brought his flabby arms down, smothering them in fatty mass. Their squirms and struggles were expected and as fun as ever. He made sure not to squeeze them too harshly, even if the desires in the back of his head tried to coerce him into killing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlaytime is quickly interrupted though when the parents can be heard screaming for their lives. \"Help! Help! Somebody help!\" Their voices rang out. They were closing in fast and turned the corner before Simba could react. They saw the flabby beast perched against the boulder, their kids' hind legs twitching as they were being smothered by the fat beast's foul armpits. It took every ounce of restraint for the father not to launch into a futile attack. But they needn't worry. The moment they came into view the hippo released the kids from their damp prisons and got up. He'd lost all interest in them as he hoped there'd be a fleet of hyenas ready for him. Akinya and Okello were stumbling around, nearly falling unconscious from the overwhelming... whatever it was the hippo had put them through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was not disappointed when he pushed past the two gazelles to inspect their pursuers. No less than seven hyenas were on their tail, all of them screeching to a halt and crashing into the hippo's big belly. The cub turned hippo acted fast, heaving his belly up high and bringing it down on the scrambling heap of hyena. A loud thump echoed across the plains as five of the predators were caught under the endless volume of fat. Before the remaining ones could turn tail and run the cub turned hippo grabbed them by their hind legs, dragging them into a crushing bear hug. He squeezed them as hard as he could, unleashing all those pent up urges he'd felt while hugging the little gazelles. With their bodies squished and the air forcefully removed from their lungs they didn't offer any more resistance as the hippo opened his maw wide and shoved one of them down his gullet. The other followed soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle family waited behind the boulder, not wanting to watch what the cub might be doing to the hyenas. Each of those damn mutts deserved what was happening to them, but they couldn't shake the feeling that even seven of them wouldn't sate the hungry hippo. The speed with which they heard him gulp down his prey was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo started to fish the flattened hyenas out from under his dominant belly one by one. The ones that didn't struggle were sent down his throat. More feisty morsels were crushed into submission first. Either with more monstrous bear hugs or by wedging their heads in his smelly pits and letting them stew for a moment as he tried to squeeze their skulls under his arm. Each new meal made the rotund mass of his gut grow, but only after five of them had been down was there much of a noticeable difference. More miraculously, the cub began to feel a little full. There was still plenty of room for more, but at least it was heartening to know that big gut of him wasn't endless. With a squirming hyena in each hand he paused for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba let one of his victims fall to the ground before raising a large hippo foot over it. He stomped down with unrestrained glee, flattening the predator's torso and giggling as he felt the flailing limbs brush against his leg. The dry ground had cracked from the impact, a star pattern radiating out from his foot. The hippo felt so immensely strong. One step to reduce a fierce Savannah beast into a defenseless morsel, ready to eat. The cub turned hippo quickly acted, gobbling up the squished hyena and giving the last one a devious leer. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba, ignoring the desperate pleas for mercy and release from the last hyena in his grip, took the time to sit his fat ass down on the floor of the savannah and get himself comfortable for his meal's finishing. He gave his bloated stomach, filled with struggling and wriggling prey, a hearty slap, making the blubbery hide bounce like a bowl of gelatin. Despite the six mammals stewing away, his belly felt nowhere near full, sedated, but not content. \"Please! Oh, God, just let me go! We never did anything to you; what did we do to deserve this!?\" The last hyena sobbed, the adult gazelles covering their children's ears from the pitiful screams. The cub turned hippo, now in a playfully horny mood, decided to tease the prey just a bit more before sealing him away for good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba let the hyena fall to the ground, but before he had a chance to get to his feet and escape, the hippo sat the poor thing up and pushed his fat belly into his face and body, forcing him to try and shove it off him or suffocate from its crushing weight. \"P-p-p-please!\" That was the only word he could get out before Simba interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, what?! Speak up, mutt!\" All the air was drained out of the last hyena as he crushed him further with his colossal belly mass. Simba just kept relentless taunting the weak prey. \"What's the matter, too much for you? Yeah, your brothers are fucking heavy!\" Wordless gasps of breath came from the last hyena as the hippo watched with sadistic intent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I bet that hurts on a sore chest, huh? Can you even feel your brothers moving around in there? Probably not, they're as good as junk food now. They can wriggle all they want, but it isn't going to do anything. You can barely tell I ate them; I've got such a big fat gut that I bet someone your size wouldn't even make a dent in all this.\" Simba accented his last remark with jiggling his enormous belly. After that, the hippo finally got off of him, letting the hyena breathe in long, painful gulps of air. The predator took this time to grab his food's legs and pull them up onto the top of his stomach, his feet squishing daintily into his chubby moobs. He was getting too hungry to let this go on any further. \"Should have stayed home...but I guess it's too late now...ahhhhh~.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba lifted the hyena's foot-paws into his mouth and clamped his lips down on his ankles. He swallows up to his bony calves as the soon to be hippo-food weaky beats at his snout, making the hippo, in turn, pin his body to his soft chest. He swallowed past his thighs and crotch, and all the hyena could do was whine, watching as he sank further and further into Simba's maw. The gulps of the hippo's power throat dragged the hyena in and bulging into a vast, almost comical lump as his body passed down his gullet. Then his chest disappeared and began to panic as his head reached the hippo's maw, crying and whining but forming no words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then...no more hyena. Simba fell onto his back with a satisfied groan, his stomach swelling only subtly and letting out a shameless belch while he rubbed his full tummy in bliss. \"Mister Simba?\" The hippo that was once a lion lazily opened one of his eyes as the silence was broken, Okello with his sister Akinya standing by his side while his parents watched from afar in fear. \"You seem tired? Those mean hyenas didn't hurt you, did they?\" A wide smile spread across the hippo's face to Okello's question, while his stomach let out a low gurgle at the prospect of even more food. He rolled over onto his side and placed his arm around the two gazelles, playfully trapping them while they did not attempt to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I'm not tired, just relaxed. It takes a lot of food for this big ol' gut to stop shouting at me, and those hyenas hit the spot! But thanks for making sure I was okay.\" Simba, no longer feeling very predatorial after his need for food, was abated, leaned in, and gave each of the gazelle children a gentle nuzzle on the head, making them chirp and giggle. Though before long, the hippo noticed that they both had distinctive red blushed coming up from their cheek fur. \"Hey, do you both have something on your mind? You look like you're going to pass out with all that blood in your face.\" He playfully poked at Akinya's blush, only making it more pronounced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That thing you did with us before mom and dad came...it was bizarre\u2026\" The female antelope tried burying her face into Simba's semi-taut stomach to keep him from looking at her, but it did nothing to stop the hippo from noticing her mouth twist into an involuntary smile. Okello, equally as embarrassed but less timid, inched further along towards Simba's armpit, where the hippo had him trapped not too long ago. \"Mhmm...but kinda fun, too. You must think we're a couple of nutcases...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you better believe I think you two are nutcases. That wasn't supposed to be kinda fun; it was supposed to be loads of fun!\" As soon as Simba says this, he gives out a mischievous smirk as he swings Akinya over past the high dome of a stomach that she was nuzzling. At the same time, Okello was forcibly shoved further along his arm's fatty mass until he was smothered against the sweaty flesh. He squirmed and wiggled and whined, but Simba knew he wasn't trying to break free. \"Nawww, see? Your brother seems to be having fun. Do you want to join him?\" He teased, the parents in the background, getting more and more agitated at what was happening to their kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...but, uhm...there is s-something we were thinking of doing with you.\" Akinya shuffled her hooved atop Simba's grey stomach, her blush looking as red as a tomato. \"If you're okay with it...but I can't say it out loud, can I whisper it to you?\" Simba's curiosity was piqued, and there was something so endearing about how shy the little gazelle was around him, so he bent his head down to lend an ear and fulfill her request. Mustering up her courage, the girlish antelope whispered what she and Okello wanted Simba to do with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba blinked, unsure if he heard the little girl right, but he wasn't against it, not at all. With a big smile, the hippo petted Akinya's head before gripping her by her torso, followed shortly by Okello from his sweaty prison. He had a wicked, dopey smile on his face as he recovered from what the hippo put him through, and had to lean against his sister as he set the two gazelles on the ground. The hippo, a little excited for what was to come, gave the still lucid of the siblings a final nod before turning around and falling backward ass-first onto the two kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\" The father, not able to hide his anger any longer, came charging up to the hippo as his children disappeared from view, buried under hundreds of pounds of thick fat. \"Get off of our kids, now!\" Simba, amused, gave the two adults a lazy grin while letting out another shameless belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's with all the hostility? I'm just doing as they asked me to do with them, you should be happy for your kids speaking up for themselves.\" Simba cooed as he felt the two childish antelopes underneath him squirm and writhe, making sure that he bent most of his weight on his belly, so they weren't crushed. \"They're pretty comfy, too, I gotta say. Like two cute little cushions~.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is wrong with you, monster?!\" The mother finally spoke up, lunging past her husband to sink her teeth into Simba's belly flesh. She wasn't a carnivore; her teeth weren't built for eating meat, and even if they were, the hippo's flesh as too tough to pierce, but she felt like she had to try. Simba giggled at the tickling sensation the angry mother made on his stomach before the sudden movement from the outside prompted another gurgle. It looks like those hyenas weren't enough...but two gazelles might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no ceremony, no chance for them even to realize what was happening before it was too late, that's how much they meant to the hippo at the end of the day. The mother was the first to go, Simba hoisting her up from her mouth's hold on his belly before she was tossed into his maw like a piece of celery. Without having to bend down that much, he reached for the father of the two kids he was squishing with his titanic rear end, only having enough time to let out a second long scream before he joined his wife. They entered the rest of the hyenas in his stomach, finally leaving the cub turned pachyderm stuffed, dooming them to be just another layer of fat on his frame. Soon, all that would be left of them would be their children, Okello and Akinya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the two kids that Simba had just orphaned, around this time, they began to slow their movements, signaling to the hippo that they needed air fast. Quickly he lifted his fat ass from the ground of the grasslands, two little antelopes gasping with smiles on their faces in an indent in the field. \"You're so heavy, Mister Simba...!\" Okello groaned, stretching his back. \"But so sooooft!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...where did mom and dad go?\" Akinya blinked and noticed that their parents were no longer in sight. \"Mister Simba, did you see where they went?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Right here, kiddo.\" Simba patted his belly, explaining in an almost disturbingly casual tone to the two kids that their parents were gone forever. The huge hippo gut sagged and moved a little from all the squirming prey inside. It even gave the cub turned hippo a moment's pause as he realized how easily he talked about ending lives. More than ten animals had already met their demise just to sate his hunger and these little morsels in front of him looked tastier by the second. Maybe he could slowly crush them under his ass first, feel their squirms halt completely and~.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo's thoughts were cut short when Akinya replied with excitement. \"Wow, that's so cool! You just swallowed them whole!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf all the reactions, that was just about the last one Simba expected. He was ready for tears, anger, begging and crying. Okello too remarked with awe. \"That's them squirming in there, isn't it?\" Then he said something the hippo hadn't expected to hear in a thousand years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go in too? I bet you're super soft on the inside, I wanna see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them seemed completely oblivious to the permanent nature of things going down his gullet, but Simba didn't feel like leaving these two little scraps on the table. He motioned for them to get closer. With big, happy smiles the gazelles approached the fat beast. They let the hippo grab them, large hands wrapping around their little bodies. The cub turned hippo gave them a broad smile before asking the important question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who wants to go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me! Me! Me!\" They both shouted. The noise startled the blubbery beast for a moment, but seemingly at random he picked Okello, bringing the little gazelle close to his maw. The broad lips barely parted, giving the confused orphan a small kiss before slurping him inside like a noodle. Akinya giggled as she saw her brother get slurped up, the hippo gulping exaggeratedly to make it even more of a show. He let her watch as the bulge that was Okello sank down his neck and disappeared into his belly to join the squirming mass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe starry-eyed gazelle joined him in a record-breaking time. Simba opened wide and threw her down his gullet, swallowing Akinya whole and sending her rocketing into his stomach in seconds. He gave his big belly a satisfied rub before lying back against a large boulder. He'd promised Michelle not to be out for too long, but his eyes felt heavy and his belly heavier. Surely a little nap wouldn't hurt, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours had passed and the sun was starting to set. The cub turned hippo yawned loudly, opening his voracious maw wide. A dozen prey, all turned into jiggly mass on his body. Simba was surprised to see how much mass he'd gained. Everything looked a little weird before he realized he'd gotten almost a foot taller. Hippo metabolism was something else. Unfortunately it also meant the familiar rumbling in his belly was back. With a weary sigh the cub turned hippo weighed his options. He should probably go home before Michelle gets concerned. But out here he might find some more to eat. In the end the hippo decides to head for Pride Rock. Hopefully a little snack would be in his way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked Simba began to wonder how the other hippos dealt with this constant, nagging hunger. They seemed so well-adjusted to it. It also made him wonder how quickly they could strip the Savannah of all life if they let their bellies guide them. He alone had eaten so much already and mere hours later he felt like he could stomach even more. Next his thoughts wandered to his newly gained size. If he kept growing like this he could soon add larger animals to the menu. Was there even a limit on this? How much bigger until he could put the other hippos in his belly? The fat beast chuckled. It'd take a lot of work before he'd be able to fit that chunky family in his gut. He was so distracted with thoughts about food and girth that he didn't notice the twig snapping nearby. Something was stalking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaah!\" The cub turned hippo let out a surprised yelp as a lion suddenly jumped out in front of him. He didn't recognize him immediately, but Simba was certain he'd seen this guy before. The bushes around him rustled and from them sprang more lions. There were eight in total, surrounding the cub and growling menacingly. They must've left Pride Rock when the hippos took over, preferring life in the Savannah over enduring what the new owners had in mind for them. After seeing and hearing how Michelle manhandled the lions that resisted their rule he couldn't help but think they made the smart choice. But unfortunately, they weren't too fond of hippos as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well well, looks like we got ourselves a lonely little straggler. We all know what happens to those that fall behind, don't we? The predators get them.\" The lead lion growled. \"This is for Pride Rock, you monster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! It's me, Simba! The hippos forced Rafiki to turn me into one of them. I want to kick them out of Pride Rock too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lions all look at eachother. There was something familiar about that hippo's voice, but that story sounded unlikely at best. It certainly wasn't the response they expected out of their little ambush. Simba tried to steady himself. He didn't want to fight lions, especially eight of them. But at the same time they would prove a decent meal... No, these were his friends. His tasty-looking friends.</span></div></div>",

By the elephant's look Simba could guess that he wrestled for a while now, and that he was older than Simba was. He realized lately that Thunder was getting closer, ready to start wrestling, Simba backed away in fear as Thunder watched the young lion's pathetic reaction. \"Ha ha! I almost feel sorry for you kiddo\" Thunder said as he turned around to show Simba his incredibly big butt, even for an elephant. Among the panic and fear, Simba wasn't able to dodge in time, he was slammed by thunder's butt, stuck between his cheeks. The crow started to cheer for the easy victory Thunder accomplished, but, in fact, that was only the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was crushed under Thunder's rear, and the weight of the fat elephant didn't let him slip out to safety, that, combined with the smell of Thunder's rear were making the lion struggle harder and harder, but it was useless. \"Is that all you got? I'm not even using my full weight!\" and Thunder wasn't lying, and he proved that by sitting harder in Simba's face, making him squirm and cry for help as he felt his face sinking into Thunder's butt, but that wasn't what Thunder had in mind to the wrestling match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, should I start 'warming him up'? Thunder asked to the audience as they all cheered and yell at Thunder to finish him off, however, the elephant wanted to have some fun before winning the match. As Simba squirmed under the heavy beast butt, Thunder got ready to make this match, one that Simba would never forget. His stomach started grumbling, before Simba could even wonder what was happening a hot tiny, yet powerful fart came out right on Simba's face. The evil fumes coming out of Thunder's rear made Simba cry for help once again. \"Look kiddo, if you can't even bear one of my 'tiny farts' then you will be dead when we get to the real action\" Thunder mocked at the poor lion's situation as he rubbed his ass to make sure Simba could get the full experience.

This elephant was so much bigger and stronger than him it wasn't even funny. Well, the crowd was getting a good laugh in, seeing the cub get flattened underneath Thunder's massive rear. And their laughter didn't abate when he stood up again, revealing Simba to the world once more. The cub was wedged firmly between his buttcheeks, their flabby mass easily pinning him in place. With each movement the elephant made his round bottom jiggled a little, inadvertently crushing and smothering the cub with his rank stench. Somewhere much deeper lay his shuddering pucker, which he held firmly shut. The next fart would blow his opponent away in one foul blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder grit his teeth and clenched his buttocks together, pressing down on Simba in the process. But squashing the cub wasn't his main goal, as louder and louder gurgles emanated from his huge gut. The little lion knew precisely what he was in for, but he was powerless to do anything about it. For a good minute he kept thinking the elephant had reached his peak volume, but the gurgling just kept on building. Eventually Thunder bent forward a little, ready to destroy his opponent in one filthy blow. Simba could hear the gas travelling through the elephantine guts, racing towards him. At the last moment he closed his eyes and prayed for a miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound erupting from Thunder's rear was loud enough to start earthquakes and the amount of gas passed was enough to launch the little cub across the arena. Because of the slightly bent posture of the elephant Simba was propelled towards the ground, which he hit with a loud smack before sliding through the dirt towards one of the trees marking the edge of the ring. More horrifying then the noise or the force behind this butt blast was the smell. It had dissipated quickly into the air, but the little cub had received a shot at almost point blank range. Words couldn't describe the potency of the elephant's concentrated gas and the painful stinging Simba experienced in his nose. It made the crushing pressure of an elephant sitting on him feel like a walk in the park by comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder was very pleased with himself. He built up the suspense with the crowd beautifully and unleashed the best fart he'd ever had right in Simba's face. He couldn't be happier with himself right now, and to top it all of he would get to take the little cub home with him as a prize. Oh the things he'd do to that poor little thing. Only for a few days though, Thunder wasn't completely horrible. He was so busy thinking up things to do with the little lion he didn't notice him struggling to stand up again. Miraculously the cub wasn't out of the count just yet. Either his brains had been farted out or he was just amazingly stubborn, nobody knew. Thunder looked down at the defiant little cub, his brow nearly tearing itself off his face in sheer bewilderment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How in the hell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't say anything back, he just grinned. Thunder didn't know what to think. This little twerp had defied his mighty farts which was unheard of. On the other hand, this meant he could have another bit of fun with him. The elephant figured that was enough to look past the dopey grinning of the little lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed... bigger wrestlers have been floored by that sort of firepower.\" The elephant's upbeat smile then turned into a smile filled with spite and malice. \"How's about as a reward you get to play with my...\"</span></div></div>",

His trunk impatiently reached for the cub, sniffing the air loudly. Simba reeked of elephant gas and soon the large trunk hovered in front of him. Simba stood his ground, but was terrified. His fight so far had consisted of the elephant simply sitting down on him. What was he going to do to turn this around?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, with the speed of a striking cobra, the trunk shot forward, quickly coiling itself around the cub once and lifting him up. Subtlety wasn't Thunder's strong suit as he snorted loudly all over the little lion, relishing the scent. His trunk was adamant about not letting Simba go and he could feel it. The muscular mass around him squeezed tightly, making it difficult to breathe. He hacked and coughed but this only seemed to inspire even more fiercely possessive tendencies from the elephant. Another coil joined the first and he kept on crushing the cub with his trunk, seemingly oblivious to just how effectively he was wrestling with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Thunder finally took notice Simba was almost blue in the face. The trunk quickly loosened itself and dropped the lion on the ground. \"Ya holdin out there squirt? Ah couldn't help myself, you smell so nice now. One more little sample, alright?\" Simba didn't need to say anything. He just needed to put as much distance as possible between him and the elephant. He didn't care if all the Savannah branded him a coward. He was not staying in the ring with Thunder for another second. To even begin this fight was madness and he wouldn't suffer another second of torment by the elephant's hand. He ran as fast as his little legs would take him, fueled by adrenaline and sheer uncut terror. It took him a few moments before he realized he was running in place, with a familiar sensation curled around his tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant laughed, releasing Simba's tail and letting him suddenly sprint off only to stumble over his own legs and fall down. The muscular organ followed the cub to his little crash site and continued to smell him, sucking in air loudly. The loud snorting was violently interrupted when Simba felt a most singularly foul sensation. A creeping slimy feeling ran down his tail as he slowly looked backward to find it lodged right up Thunder's trunk. He expected the elephant to be just as surprised, but the grey monster just smiled at him. Suddenly he snorted, and the rest of Simba's tail was pulled up his nose. Not satisfied with just a tail the trunk kept snorting, sucking it's way towards Simba's butt before beginning to stretch. Simba knew elephant trunks to be quite flexible, but this was something he'd never conceived. It looked like Thunder wanted to suck the little cub right up his trunk. And given how small Simba was compared to the large elephant, he might just be able to pull it off too. Panic gripped the little lion. He couldn't think of a place he wanted to be less then an elephants snotty trunk. Already slime clung to his tail and Thunder showed no signs of slowing down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>SNNNRRRFFFTT</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't believe what he felt. Half his body had been pulled into the large trunk and with only his forepaws free he was hopelessly outmatched. Thunder simply lifted him a little bit off the ground and continued to suck the cub into his trunk. Inch by slimy inch the lion's body vanished into the strong elephant trunk. Soon Simba's forepaws too were rendered moot as only his head remained. With a final loud snort the little cub was pulled completely up Thunder's trunk, who was enjoying every second of the experience. He cooed with unfettered joy, both at the pleasing stench in his trunk and the meekly squirming lion trapped inside of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba was certain he was in a bind no other lion had ever experienced. Thick slime clung to his fur as the muscular surroundings of Thunder's trunk twisted and pulsed around him. They held him pinned inside with ease, producing a clearly visible squirming bulge for all to see. The elephant himself was pleased to see the cub struggle against him, knowing the crowd would appreciate it. They were for the most part utterly shocked at the spectacle before them. They'd seen Thunder fight smaller opponents before, but Simba was the puniest he'd faced in a very long time. The crowd burst into cheering seeing the elephant bring his power to bear in such a unique way. The trapped cub could hear the muffled cheers as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba groaned bitterly, knowing his fate was in the hands, or more accurately trunk, of Thunder. He was tempted to pull out his claws and tear into his captor, but he knew the rules. If he drew so much as a drop of blood the elephant would probably release him instantly, but he'd face punishment. Timon and Pumbaa were never entirely clear on what sort of punishment this was, but the cub can only imagine what an angry elephant could do to him. For now he would have to accept that he was stuck in this slimy prison. elephant snot matted down his fur and eased his movements in the strong trunk. It was at that point Simba began to realize he wasn't just kept in the trunk, he was moving along its length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder was in no rush to continue his plan, loving the cheering crowd and showing them the squirming bulge in his trunk up close. With every snort he got another deep whiff of the cub's scent. The little lion stunk of his farts and Thunder loved it. He also felt every snort pulling the cub a little bit further up the flexible trunk. Snot would keep everything running smoothly and he was sucking in lots of air with every snort. Thunder considered trying to pull Simba back down and stretch out his enjoyment, but a devious idea was conjured. So what if that pesky lion ends up outside my trunk? I'll just suck him in again and start all over. It was time to show that lion a bit of elephant anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt himself creep through the elephant's trunk at a snail's pace. He grew tired of trying to fight back, seeing as all of his struggles had accomplished a sum total of nothing. He weakly continued, fearing retaliation from the elephant if he fell still, but he wasn't sure how much longer he'd last before throwing in the towel. The further he went, the more disgusting slime he carried with him. It stuck to his fur like glue and bit by bit coated his entire fluffy coat. As he was sucked in deeper he felt more and more like an elephant booger. Simba began to wonder what would happen next. He'd seen elephants suck things up their trunk and shoot them out again. He'd be a snotty projectile for Thunder, who would probably point him somewhere humiliating. Suddenly he realized he could hear the elephant's delighted groaning quite close. He must be right at the end, the cramped tunnel finally widening. He was greeted with more darkness and slime and the cub braced himself for launch. What he faced instead would haunt him for some time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a drawn-out snort Simba was pulled through the elephant's sinuses and right down the back of its throat. A large tongue blocked the way, preventing the slimy lion from slipping down into Thunder's stomach. Consumption of foes was strictly forbidden and even a huge contestant like Thunder was not above reproach. The penalty was severe and he frankly didn't even want to end things that quickly. If a quick win was all he was after he'd have grabbed the little tyke with his trunk and just squeezed him until he'd lose consciousness. But where's the fun in that? The people wanted a show and he would give them one they would not soon forget. He already had them floored with this feat of bodily control, sucking a lion cub up his trunk and into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's trek through the elephant's body was halted the large tongue. It carried Simba away from the dark tunnel of Thunder's gullet and left him in the middle of a wide open mouth. The elephant happily showed off his prize, the snot-coated lion cub, to all around. The crowd went completely ballistic, not only at the utter humiliation put upon the cub, but also Thunder's great creativity. He'd turned the most one-sided match in history into something unique and spectacular. What does he do next with the little slime-covered lion in his mouth?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba barely got a moment to regain his bearings before Thunder closed his mouth. His snot-soaked body was too slippery for him to mount any sort of escape. He felt a light bit of panic set in as he realized there not only was room to spare in the cavernous maw, but he was perched atop a tongue easily the size of him. The only light in this darkness was that Thunder appeared to be aware of the rules. He actively stopped himself from trying to swallow the cub, so whatever might happen he would not end up in an elephant belly. The little lion wasn't given a lot of time to enjoy this relief as the tongue beneath him began to stir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder was well-versed in using his mouth to secure a win. Most of the time he'd just suckle on his opponent's head until they tapped out, but with Simba he could suckle on the whole damn thing. An opportunity like this didn't present itself often and he would take full advantage of it. Already the weakly squirming body in his mouth tasted like a heady mix of his farts and his snot. A tasty blend for the elephant, who quickly began to salivate at the thought of playing with the lion cub in his mouth. He coiled his agile tongue around the little lion, licking him and scrubbing off some of the snot. It was replaced with a thick coat of saliva only marginally less sticky. But what it lacked in power was made up for in volume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba held on as best he could with the large tongue slathering him in stinky elephant drool. Any attempt to run or hide was rendered moot by the slippery slime sticking to his body. With a tongue this size Thunder didn't need to try very hard to fully cover the cub, but he made sure to go over every part of him as much as he wanted to. The little lion almost grew familiar with the huge tongue coiling around him when the elephant introduced a new trick. Each time he wrapped his flexible tongue around the cub he squeezed it a little. Simba could barely believe what he felt. This tongue could constrict him too, just like the trunk? At least the pressure was only brief and manageable for the most part, or was Thunder simply holding back?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant switched up the torment again, laying out the little cub on his tongue and pressing upwards against the roof of his mouth. The surface was hard and unyielding, Simba yelped as pain surged through him. Thunder quickly grew bored of this little squashing and dropped Simba past his tongue to the small pool of saliva at the bottom of his mouth. The heavy tongue simply rested in its neutral position, laying its weight atop the cub. Simba was surprised. This tongue may be pure muscle the size of him, but it was surprisingly light. He bucked a little and pushed it away with ease. It quickly swept to the size and wrapped itself around the cub again, going for some more good old licking and squeezing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder was almost done with his routine, but he knew one more fiendish trick to force the cub to surrender to him. He carefully probed his tongue between the lion's hind legs and began to lick his crotch repeatedly. Simba could barely hold on as he felt the coarse saliva-coated tongue rub against him. He felt what the elephant was up to. One last humiliation. He groaned as he felt the devious plan take effect. Slowly his cock emerged from its sheath and Thunder wasted no time giving it all the attention his tongue could offer. Simba's struggles were meaningless to the elephant, who grew a wicked grin as he assaulted the lion's puny cock with his huge tongue. With a muffled scream the cub came on Thunder's tongue, who swiftly lapped up the pathetic amount of white goo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some deft maneuvering Thunder pushed Simba forward until his saliva-coated head emerged between the elephant's lips. He looked thoroughly worn out, one eye glued shut with a blend of dried up snot and saliva. The large elephant let the vulture fly in to inspect the lion, opening his maw to show the rest of the knackered lion's body. The crowd was cheering loudly, seeing the king of the jungle lying still on the elephant's tongue. The vulture could see Simba was alive and uninjured, just exhausted. He mills it over for a moment before flying back to the side of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing, ladies and gentlemen. The young prince still has some fight in him!\" He yelled. Simba wondered if the vulture was referring to a different prince. He could barely move, let alone fight. Least of all fight a huge elephant. Thunder simply smiled, closing his maw again around the lion and leaving his head peering out between two heavy lips. Next up, Thunder... </span></div></div>",

He opened wide and lifted Simba out, proudly showing him to the crowd. The cub just let the large elephant have his fun, hanging limp in the strong grip of the trunk. He was utterly drenched in saliva and snot, but thankful to still be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You still with me, squirt?\" Thunder mockingly asked. He gave the little lion a powerful squeeze, making him twitch and sputter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah good, for a moment I was afraid you'd passed out on me.\" He said, still parading around the ring and holding the slimy body up high. The crowd cheered the elephant on with undying applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" The little lion sputtered out. Thunder held him closer to one of his large ears. \"What was that, squirt?\" The elephant asks. Simba repeats himself: \"Please... mercy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder laughed loudly. \"He wants mercy! Tell you what people, I think he's got one more move in him. What will we use to finish the fight?\" Simba gulped. The elephant still wasn't done with him? What had he done to deserve this? He listened as Thunder began to rattle off all the different ways in which he could be finished off, an overpowering sense of dread growing with each evil suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe another powerful squeeze of the 'ol trunk, I know that's always a crowd-pleaser.\" Thunder said, giving Simba a small sample as a demonstration. The little lion twitched and wriggled as the powerful trunk wrung the breath out of him. \"Or maybe another ride up its length?\" The cub felt the tip of the trunk loudly snorting next to his tail. The crowd's applause was unceasing, not growing any more or less intense for any of the suggestions. Unfazed, Thunder continued. \"Maybe another quick dip into my hungry maw. A second taste of lion is always a nice treat. Or perhaps we go for some other part of my big 'ol body.\" Simba gulped. What more could he possibly have in store?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would y'all like to see me stomp him flat? Or squash him under my big belly?\" Simba's eyes widened. That would be a death sentence for sure. How was Thunder going to stop himself from killing his opponent? He hoped feverishly for any other option. Even a trip up the trunk sounded positively relaxing compared to the prospect of being trampled by Thunder. \"Or... Will this big butt see some action? It's been a while since I made someone disappear into it.\" The cub's mind was blown. How was this allowed? Did the rule about consuming opponents not count with butts? The crowd meanwhile knew what the elephant meant. They remembered the poor hyena that was pushed into Thunder's pucker. All the way up to its neck he was buried inside the elephant's colon, and after surrendering that's where he was kept as Thunder walked off victoriously. Nobody had seen that hyena since, leaving rumors aplenty about Thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright people, let me hear your favorite!\" The elephant shouted, prompting the crowd to yell their choices at him. Simba couldn't hear a single favourite choice and simply continued hoping he would survive the fight to begin with.</span></div></div>",

Simba braced himself as best he could, preparing for the muscular coils around him to crush him once again. Instead the elephant was ruminating on an idea. He'd thought about it before, but most of the time his opponents were too heavy to try this particular trick. With the little cub it could work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meaty trunk wrapped itself around the lion a little tighter, adding an extra coil to lock Simba in a powerful grip. Surprisingly the elephant seemed to hold back on the pressure. The cub knew well that he could squeeze a l\u00f3t harder with his trunk. He wasn't given time to question the grey monster's actions any further as Thunder set his plan into motion. He stretched the trunk out as far as he could, holding the little cub firmly. Slowly he moved the little confused lion through the air in a circle. Simba was utterly bewildered. What in the hell was the elephant doing? As he went full circle the elephant span him around again, a little faster this time. Slowly it began to dawn on the cub what was happening as each lap went by faster and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder was cautious in the execution of what he'd dubbed 'the helicopter' in his mind. He wasn't sure if he could pull it off or whether flinging the little cub around over his head would hurt his trunk too much. He started easy to get a feel for things but quickly picked up the pace as he felt more confident in his ability to perform. Simba had taken to screaming as he was flung around faster still. The crowd could barely keep their eyes on the cub as he soared through the air, still firmly in the grasp of Thunder's strong trunk. Simba's world was nothing but a blur now, and his stomach felt queasy from the speed. After only a few seconds of full speed Thunder slowed down and gently set the little lion back down on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba stumbled and wobbled on his feet, barely able to stay upright. He tried to focus on his enemy, but he couldn't tell which of the three blurry spinning elephants was the real one. He felt sick to his stomach from the speed and the iron grip of the trunk. He inevitably fell over, failing to even find his feet again and stand up. Thunder almost felt bad for the little guy, leaning his trunk in for an inquisitive poke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright there, squirt?\" He asked insincerely. The vulture smiled and flew into the ring to make things official.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba is no longer able to fight! Your winner is Thunnnnder!\" He yelled to raucous applause. The crowd cheered and clapped loudly, highly entertained by the merciless beatdown the elephant had laid upon the little cub. The vulture then turned his attention to Thunder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as is our tradition, you are allowed to claim your opponent as your own. What will you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we both know where this cub is going, don't we?\" The elephant answered playfully.</span></div></div>",

He opened his mouth wide and dropped Simba in. The cub was in no position to fight, still barely able to see straight from being flung around. His body lay on the tongue, responding to its movements only by flopping and rolling around in the elephant's mouth. Thunder maneuvered him to lie straight, his head poking between the large lips of the elephant. He smiled, showing off the cub one last time to the cheering crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the little lion in his mouth Thunder stepped out of the ring and went on his way. He shooed away any remaining groupies before walking home through the empty savanna. Simba's vision was finally focused again, but his strength was still recovering from the pummeling it had taken. Not that it would matter much against the elephant, who hummed a cheery tune to himself. Suddenly the elephant interrupted his humming and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was nice to meet you in the ring. But you only really get to know someone out here...\" Simba was confused as to what the pachyderm was on about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so much more intimate... no crowd... no ref... no rules...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The large elephant closed his eyes and concentrated on the screaming lion in his mouth. Then, with one big gulp, he swallowed him whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt the gulp course across his body, pulling him off the tongue and into a narrow, squeezing tunnel. The fast movement was disorienting and he could do little to resist the powerful elephant all around him. The journey was smooth and slippery, the cub feeling his body being pushed along the tight passage of Thunder's esophagus, slowing only briefly before landing in his stomach with a big splash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion looked around in the dark chamber, but couldn't see anything. He heard the stomach ooze slosh about and a distinct dripping from the stomach walls. The stench was overwhelming, reminiscent of the stench in Thunder's mouth but a thousand times worse. Every few seconds the stomach would churn, the walls bumping into Simba and the ooze clinging to his fur. The cub was in a state beyond panicking now. What was there left he could do? The tough stomach lining wouldn't budge to any of his attacks and he doubted he'd be able to convince Thunder to let him out. The elephant probably couldn't even hear him if he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant continued on his merry way, cheerily humming a tune. Inside Simba slowly drifted out of consciousness. The putrid air in the big stomach was almost impossible to breathe. After only a few more minutes the little lion blacked out completely.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strange spec is visible up ahead. Simba can't quite determine what this tiny bright spot could be until it clicks. It's daylight, the light at the end of the world's most nightmarish tunnel. With each step the elephant took the cub could see it come closer. It also provided some context as to how much the pulsating bowels were moving him along. Though he could see the finish line ahead, it was still far away and Thunder was more than keen to take his time. The wiggling in his colon felt heavenly and any attempt the cub made to crawl out faster was punished. First with a powerful clench, then with a volley of noxious farts. Even back there the elephant was in complete control, forcing the cub to play along and let himself be toyed with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, it's probably not too difficult for me to keep you in there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hulking pachyderm expected more panicked resistance to erupt in his colon, but the cub was remarkably subdued. Had he pushed him too far? It wasn't half as fun if the little lion wasn't going to try and struggle. Maybe the cub just needed some fresh air. The elephant mentally shrugged at the idea. Perhaps he could let him out for a little bit. It was not like any escape attempts would get far with the lion's dazed state. And if Simba started getting too rebellious or really just if the elephant felt like it he could always cram the cub right back in there. The powerful grasp of his rear had pulled in bigger prey than the cub. With a dark chuckle the elephant even contemplated giving the cub another full tour. Just wash him a little and give him a moment to drink some water and he'd be ready to struggle through his bowels again. The thought was very enticing, but his daydreaming was interrupted by a joyous feeling. The cub's head had reached his pucker and pushed through. Immediately he clenched it shut, squeezing it around the lion's neck and trapping him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, you made it. Be honest with me Simba, how was the journey?\" The little prince offered no more than disjointed coughing before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the single most horrible, foul and disgusting thing I have ever experienced. If the other lions find out how you've treated me they'll eat well on your corpse.\" The elephant seemed unfazed, farting to show his disapproval. The hot gas blew past the cub, but the tight pucker held him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't much like your tone. I'll have you remember that it takes me just an instant to swallow you again and send you through me all over. Or if you're a big fan of my butt I can show you just how long I can hold you inside.\" With those words the tunnel that housed Simba's body began to tighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub felt his movement get restrained and soon the elephant demonstrated his supreme control. The soft undulating of the bowels that had pushed the little lion along reversed. Were it not for the tight, twitching ring around his neck the cub would've been drawn back inside. With this terrifying demonstration carved into his mind, the prince offered no further resistance. With a sigh of relief Thunder relaxed himself, seizing his efforts to keep the cub in. But if the little guy was going to make an exit, he was going to need a little push. The elephant's rumbling belly effortlessly answered that question. It roiled and bubbled with built up gas and the cub would soon find himself in the line of fire. How does Thunder use his gas help Simba out of his huge elephantine ass?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The crowd cackled with sadistic glee. They'd seen Thunder carry off smaller opponents like this before. The elephant was eyeing the stumbling lion, aiming his enormous butt for a precise landing. His trunk couldn't reach all the way back there, so he'd have to sit down on the lion and hope to catch him right against his asshole. He spoke to his victim, trying hard to keep down his laughter. \"Alright now little guy, hold very still or this will get very painful.\" Simba looked up and saw the elephant butt descending. It was far too late for the sluggish cub to do anything other than accept his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder sat down gently, not wanting to squash the lion unconscious with his enormous grey butt. The cub needs to be squirming in his colon, and he can't do that if the elephant squeezes his lights out. For Simba it didn't matter how 'gentle' the pachyderm was with him. The vast rear completely surrounded him and rested immense weight on his back. He felt the huge cheeks slide past, their smooth surface pockmarked with little bits of dirt. The elephant's aim was true and the cub had slipped deep between his huge buttcheeks. Now he just had to feel that cute fuzzy little butt make contact with his pucker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some shifting, grinding and pushing his rear all over the helpless lion, but the elephant finally hit home. The audience was in silent suspense. They'd seen the cub vanish underneath the enormous elephantine butt. Some almost felt sorry for the little guy, watching an ass that weighs a hundred times more than his whole body squash him. Thunder felt a small lump of fuzz against his asshole and took a deep breath. The twitching pucker opened as wide as it could and pressed down. Simba's hind legs and lower body were effortlessly swallowed up by the stinking passage. The elephant relaxed his ass, his foul ring closing around Simba's waist and pinning him in place. The battered cub didn't even have the strength to contest the clamped down muscular ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoriously, Thunder stood back up to reveal his prize. The little lion was lifted up, dazed and confused. The audience cheering was just indistinct noise to him. But the sinister warmth he felt along with a strange slimy sensation shook him awake. He was stuck halfway into the elephant's butt. Vague squirming became fierce thrashing but the pachyderm couldn't give a damn. He felt his unusual grasp on his target and he smiled. There were many ways to humiliate an opponent and this one ranked very high. With a hefty amount of glee he spoke to his butt-prey. \"Say goodbye to the crowd, little guy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub didn't know what the elephant was talking about but he saw him exit the ring. Almost immediately his surroundings began to move. The seemingly dormant pucker awoke again and widened. Suddenly Thunder's insides contracted, grabbing hold of the cub and pulling him in a teensy bit. Before he could climb back out the ring closed down again. The elephant murred in barely contained joy, concentrating completely on the fuzzy lump stuck in his butt. Each time he opened up a little, another inch of the lion vanished into the enormous elephant ass. Soon enough only a head was left, screaming with empty lungs for anyone to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's whole body clung with slime. The thick, sticky substance made movement inside of Thunder insanely difficult. One last desperate plea was all the cub had left before the elephant groaned and sucked him inside completely. The lion's world was darkness now, entirely at the mercy of the elephant. The walls around him were rife with a stench worse then anything he'd ever experienced. Waves of crushing pressure washed over the confined space, pressing the slimy lining of the elephant's rectum into Simba's fur. If there was a hell, it could probably take some pointers from this torturous fleshy cell. Worst of all was not knowing what would happen next. When would Thunder let him out again? Would Thunder let him out at all? Surprisingly the elephant was pondering the same thing. He had the little lion in his butt, what should he do with it? </span></div></div>",

One particular phrase caught his large ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Squeeze him until he faints!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heavy elephant was no stranger to this type of KO.

I reckon we have a winner ladies and gentlemen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba could only breathe the slightest bit easier. At least the elephant's endgame is just to make him faint, rather then kill him completely. The latter may be against the rules, but the cub was beginning to doubt those more and more. He wouldn't be surprised if there was a rule forbidding little lions from being matched against elephants too. He wheezed a little as Thunder tightened the coils of his trunk around his body. The overwhelming strength left Simba with no options besides enduring this humiliation. Though that seemed to be the running theme from the start. He'd been sat on, snorted, suckled and spat out. This 'match' never got anywhere near a fight, just Thunder playing around with him for a few minutes. When this was over, Simba would have some choice words for Timon and Pumbaa. For now there wouldn't be any words, held in the elephant's crushing grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder fiddled around with the little lion in his trunk until he'd managed to wrap him up in three muscular coils. One for his lower body, one for his upper body and one just for his head. He untangled the last coil for a moment to get one last sniff of the cub. A potent mix of his farts, snot and saliva filled his nostrils. The smell of a job well done and a lion thoroughly put through the wringer. He held his victim high for all to see and began to build up the pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trunk's leathery skin tightened around Simba. He'd gotten in a few deep breaths but now all the air he could hold on to was slowly forced out. He wasn't sure why he even tried to hold out longer. The elephant would just keep squeezing until his lights went out. Already the crushing coils bore down on him tighter then ever before. The crowd fell silent, all eyes on the lion cub held high. They wanted to see him faint, to see the little body go limp. The only two not watching were Timon and Pumbaa, who looked away and quietly hoped Simba would walk out alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder had never felt so powerful. He felt the cub's body compress as he laid on the punishment. Every time Simba breathed out a little he'd tighten his iron grip on him. He loved the feeling of Simba's weak squirming rendered useless against his crushing strength. The faint groans of the cub heard by his large ears alone filled him with a sense of bliss. The only distraction was the nagging voice of reason in the back of his thick skull, warning him not to break the cub. He knew that with some effort he could probably do more than just make Simba faint, but that wouldn't be very sporting anymore. He'd never be allowed to fight again if he broke that rule and forever be branded a monster. He wanted the cub to live, if only so he could humiliate him again in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a good minute and Simba's hacking and wheezing grew more and more desperate. The strong trunk wrapped around him seemed to hold an endless amount of crushing force as it still steadily kept piling on the pressure. The cub's eyes felt like they were about to pop out of their sockets and he began to see spots. Thunder felt the body go floppy and soft moments before the little lion blacked out completely. The crowd erupted with cheering and the elephant released some of his coiling trunk to show off Simba's unconscious, limp body. It looked bruised and battered, fur matted by the saliva and snot. Thunder placed him on the floor with uncharacteristic gentleness and took a step back, letting the vulture inspect the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thunder has defeated Simba by knock-out! As the rules decree, he may now choose to take him as his property! Thunder! What do you decide?!\" All eyes were on the elephant, who decided to...</span></div></div>",

Not that Thunder cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd was roaring with both cheer and laughter at Simba disappearing into Thunder's trunk. The only evidence of the up-and-coming king left was the bulge traveling up the elephant's snorting trunk. The young lion was forcibly sniffed, completely abused for all of the gaseous fumes Thunder coated him in. In comparison to Simba's torture, Thunder was in bliss. All he could smell was the rank scent coming off of Simba's fur, and he thoroughly enjoyed feeling him struggle about within the confines of his sniffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, SImba may've been stirring around a bit too much. All of Simba's snot-matted fur rubbed up against the inner walls, and his flailing tail tickled about the insides. Thunder could feel a certain, humiliating, something coming on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He-...ah... AHHHHH-!\" Thunder started, jerking his head backwards with each noise. Simba could here the noise from inside Thunder's nose, and he had a feeling about what was about to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no...\" Simba said, sounding resigned as he braced himself for the incoming attack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH-CHOO!\" Thunder sneezed a mighty sneeze, his trunk aimed at the ground. Simba shot out the end, a trail of snot flailing behind him as he soared to the ground. His impact kicked up some of the dirt, leaving a crater of Elephant mucus, the young lion at the epicenter of it all. He tried to struggle to his feet, but the snot was so sticky, he could barely move. Thunder stomped on over to Simba, laughing at his predicament. </span></div></div>",

Thunder smiled broadly, preparing to blow away both his opponent and the crowd. He felt his bowels shake and rumble under the sheer volume of bubbling gas waiting to be released. He would teach this young little princeling who the king of bad breath was around here. He felt the exact moment the gas hit critical mass in his belly and came surging up. It burned a little, but the mere idea of Simba gagging and choking on his burps made it all worth it. The cub realizes only moments before his doom what the ominous gurgling from the back of the elephant's maw is. He tries to cover his nose, but he is too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder's belch is long and cacophonous, thundering all around the helpless cub as the elephant did his best to prolong the stream of horrifying gas. The stink was sour and warm, burning Simba's nostrils and robbing him of his breath. The cub began to trash and cough in the tight grip of the elephant's trunk, desperate for fresh air. His weakening struggles were amusing, but now was not the time to slack. Every last bit of horrendously foul belly gas was to be deposited in that little lion's face. Even the first few rows of the crowd began to wave their hands in front of their faces. They were used to things getting smelly, but this was something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's eyes teared up from the noxious belch, making his vision of the dark chasm before him hazy. The seemingly endless supply of rotten stench the elephant's gut held was impressive. If only the cub didn't have to experience it in such a terrible way. He felt his whole body ache, inside and out. The tight grip of the trunk squeezing around his waist whilst the foul gas set his lungs aflame. His breathing got more and more shallow and he began to fear he lose consciousness. He dreaded to think of the things Thunder might do to him should he pass out. He had to stay in there, he had to stay alert.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter nearly a minute of continuously belching on his opponent, Thunder lifts him to inspect the damage. Part of him wants to see if he managed to burp the lion unconscious. But that would also mean the end of playtime in the ring. Hopefully the crowd wouldn't mind a slightly shorter match than usual.

Thunder was pleased to see his little toy had this kind of endurance. It meant he could take things a step further. And with him, there were many steps not yet taken. So many things he wanted to do to the little lion. The tip of his trunk snorted loudly, sniffing the air around the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stink, little guy. Where've you been lately?\" The crowd laughed loudly as Simba looked at his tormentor incredulously. What was he talking about? He'd spent the last minute burping on him, had he forgotten? Didn't elephants never forget anything? Then the realization struck that this was just a bit to setup his next act of public humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fear not, your big friend Thunder is here, I'll clean you up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub couldn't express how much he didn't want the elephant to 'clean' him, but the crowd loved it. They watched and cheered as Thunder rolled out his massive elephant tongue and slammed the cub's head into it with a wet squish. The slobbery tongue licked every exposed part of the cub, smothering it with its warmth and leaving a thick coat of elephant saliva on the little lion. He had to work hard to keep the mammoth tongue from pushing itself into his mouth and violating him on the inside too. The elephant didn't mind the front door being closed. The tip of his tongue would have plenty of fun with the undefended back entrance. When the cub felt the slimy tip encroach on his butthole he clenched it shut so hard he could probably crush coal into diamonds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elephant was undeterred, spurred on by the audience. He pushed and pried until a wet <i>shlp</i> made the cub gasp in horror. Unsurprisingly, little more that the smallest bit of the tip of his tongue would fit in there, but it was enough to wake the cub right up again after the daze induced by his belching. Granted, all this tongue action also enveloped the lion in stinky elephant breath, but a bit of butt action seemed to be just the thing needed to keep the little lion playing his part. He already had a few ideas to continue his torment, but the look on the lion's face was troubling. The cub looked about ready to give up on this. He couldn't really threaten him with more torture. Suddenly a devious idea popped up. He moved the squirming cub close to his mouth and whispered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you stay the course and don't surrender, I won't claim you after the fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was confused more than anything else. What did the elephant mean by claiming him? He'd have to ask the ref about that when the air wasn't being crushed out of his lungs by Thunder's trunk tightly gripping his midsection. Meanwhile, he was being moved around, no doubt for another round of torment. What does Thunder have in mind for the cub?</span></div></div>",

Simba meanwhile tried his hardest not to immediately look at what the elephant was talking about. He stomped over to the little cub and stood over him ominously. With a distant squelch Thunder's cock began to emerge from its sheath, quickly growing and hardening. Simba looked up at the huge pachyderm belly hanging over him and tried to stumble away. He was dazed from the immense fart he'd received earlier and his opponent had no trouble keeping up, casually strolling along with the cub to keep his belly ready to flatten him. Thunder patiently waited for his guest of honor to reach full mast, at which point it too hovered threateningly over the little cub. It's sheer size alone was greater than Simba's whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took all of Thunder's restraint not to just lie down and squash the little lion underneath his cock and belly. The thought of rubbing his erect mass against the cub was delightful, but he would be patient. He'd only get one shot at this, and the elephant wanted to draw the maximum amount of humiliation out of this. Just burying the cub under his pudgy gut was almost too easy. What if he rolled the cub on his back first and then brought on the squashing. His huge cock would press up against Simba's pathetic effort. Or perhaps going all in was a bit too much to start with. What if he just laid his cock atop the lion without also bringing his belly into the picture. Its mass alone wouldn't be enough to pin the cub, but Thunder reckoned he would be intimidating enough to order Simba to stay put.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith so many options and his cock throbbing with anticipation the elephant was faced with a choice. How would he make the little lion get close to his massive dong?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The elephant made up his mind. He would make Simba feel exactly just how insignificant the little lion was beneath him. His trunk shot down under him and grabbed one of the little lion's legs. With a sudden pull he yanked the cub off his feet and rolled him onto his back. The cub's efforts to roll back or escape were quickly halted by Thunder, who quickly lowered himself. His erect rod landed right on top of the cub, pressing down on him and causing Simba to grab it by reflex. Without mercy the elephant put more of his weight on top of Simba, sandwiching his cock between his pudgy belly and the squirming lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it feel, tiny? The weight of a real man?\" Thunder taunted. He had the helpless cub right where he wanted him. He rubbed his musky pillar up and down slowly, grinding it against the little lion. The crowd was shocked. They'd seen Thunder humiliate an opponent before, but this was something new and unexpected. They came to see the elephant squash some humility into Simba, and maybe Timon and Pumbaa by proxy. But was this a bit too much? After some silent muttering a consensus was found and they erupted into cheering once more. Simba could feel the large elephant boner throb with glee as Thunder was now cheered on to crush him. Thunder wasted little time and interrupted the grinding periodically by lowering a bit more of him onto the whelp. The feeling of flattening the little lion under his manhood was intoxicating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Simba was feeling was pressure as the heavy elephant crushed him into the dirt floor of the ring. The stench of elephant musk grew more and more potent with every passing second. Paired with the lingering stench of his fart and the earthen smell of the floor he was being pressed into it made for a disgusting cocktail. He groaned with pain and revulsion drawn on his face, but outside of Timon and Pumbaa nobody seemed to care. Least of all Thunder, who had so much more in mind for the little lion. The sensitive shaft of his cock picked up something most curious. Between the little lion's legs. Simba felt it too, as his own little soldier had emerged from its sheath. The elephant burst out laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that it? Is that all you got to bring to the table?\" He taunted between laughs. \"Good effort boy, let me show you how it's done.\" He continued sarcastically. He began to grind down on the little cub faster and faster, stimulating his tiny manhood to full bore almost instantly. Feeling the whole body of the cub mashed against his sensitive cock pushed the elephant closer to his own climax too. But Thunder was adamant about this. He would make the weak little cub come first. He lifted his gut up a little, reducing the pressure and allowing him to grind his shaft against Simba even faster. Powerful musk surrounded the lion, hazing his mind. The smooth, throbbing cock dragging itself up and down his body was still painfully heavy, but somehow arousing. Unable to think straight Simba groaned in struggling relief as he blew his load. The elephant smiled and simply continued, rubbing Simba's load into his belly fur. Thunder's own manhood pulsed almost uncomfortably with excitement. What does he do next?</span></div></div>",

He'd planned this out as best he could and it took considerable effort not to just grind the little cub to dust. The elephant got up, allowing Simba another rare taste of freedom. The little lion was still barely able to move, his brain adrift in the sea of powerful elephant musk and his body bruised from the second crushing he'd received so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub, overcome with fear and disgust, didn't get much further than sitting there. His chances of escaping or defeating the elephant were zero and he could only hope the next attack from Thunder would seal the deal, KO him and get this fight over with. His fur was smelly and a little sticky, and he was practically ablaze with shame. He had expected the elephant to defeat him in a fight from the moment he stepped into the ring. Getting rubbed into the dirt by his cock was not how the cub had imagined this to go down. The feeling of the throbbing mass pressing down on him would haunt his thoughts for some time. But Thunder had more in mind. He would make the crushing weight seem like a pleasant dream compared to the next humiliation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba looked up with weary eyes and saw the monstrous elephant dong hover in front of him. Thunder's erection was twitching in anticipation, pointing directly at the little cub. The pachyderm grunted and groaned before unleashing his load. He'd kept his climax pent up for this exact moment and released volley after volley of thick, white cum all over the hapless little lion. The sheer volume of his release was almost enough to bowl his target over. Simba only just managed to close his gasping maw in time to avoid swallowing Thunder's seed. No part of him was spared as the elephant hosed down the cub. Pungent, slimy goop clung to his fur and restricted his movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little cub was no longer its characteristic yellow. instead he was dripping with creamy white ooze from head to tail, his eyes wide open and filled with with disbelief. Did this really just happen? Simba's mind couldn't quite fathom that the elephant just came all over him. Whilst he was stuck processing what was going on the elephant simply let out a big sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"aaaaah, I've saved that all up just for you. I hope you liked it as much as I did.\" He said, his voice filled with malicious glee. He took a few steps back to admire his handiwork. The soaked cub was sitting in a puddle of cum, stunned by the sheer level of disgust. Thunder waited a moment for the little lion to regain some semblance of bearings before...</span></div></div>",

He was soaked in elephant cum, desperately trying to rub the worst of it out off of his face and mouth. The disbelief in his eyes was replaced with annoyance. He saw the elephant looking down on him. He knew Thunder wasn't going to take this fight serious anymore from this point on. He'd probably just play around with him in the puddle of goop he was sitting in. A shiver crawled up his spine briefly thinking about what sick games could be played. The cub looked at the vulture and resolutely said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I surrender. I give up, I can't fight this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThunder frowned a little. He had so much more in mind for the little lion, and he was spoiling it. He hoped the crowd would echo his sentiment, but they were mostly silent. Had he gone a little too far by ejaculating all over Simba or were they just dumbstruck by the sheer awesomeness. The crowd seemed to mostly nod understandingly. Were they sympathizing with the cub? Thunder was confused. He didn't hurt the cub that badly. Why were they feeling pity? Was showering the little lion in his seed really that extreme? Maybe it was. Thunder couldn't recall the last time his manhood played such a prominent role in a match. He looked up and patiently waited for what he knew would happen next. The vulture flew into the arena, carefully picking a landing spot that was free of the elephant's eruption.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simba surrenders! Your winner and champion for this evening is Thuuuuunder! As per the rules of the ring, he may now choose to claim his opponent!\" Simba's jaw hit the floor. Timon and Pumbaa never told him about that. He was about to be that sick elephant's property?! Thunder had barely restrained himself in the ring, what unimaginable things would he do outside?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take one lion to go.\" Thunder replied, drawing a chuckle from the crowd. The cub considered running away while he still could, but the slippery slime he was sitting in would make that impossible. the elephant wrapped his trunk around the cub's midsection, completely unfazed by the slimy cum Simba was coated in, and nullified all hope of escape. He held on to the slippery lion's body tightly and walked out of the arena. He turned his head one last time and said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and apologies to whoever has to clean up the ring. I got a little carried away.\" Again the crowd laughed a little awkwardly. Lastly Thunder looked directly at Timon and Pumbaa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can have him back tomorrow at the latest, maybe a little earlier if he plays nice.\" The two looked at eachother and gulped. They didn't know what the pachyderm meant with playing nice, but if tonight's show was anything to go by it did not bode well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes of being carried in Thunder's tight grip later Simba and the elephant found themselves a quiet corner of the savannah. The cub's body was still dripping with white strands of cum. The elephant already had a plan to solve that and clean up the little lion...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"We oughta clean you up a little.\" Thunder announced. Simba was a touch seasick from being carried in the elephant's trunk but fairly certain he heard him right. The cub looked around for a body of water to wash off the slimy white gunk, but none were in sight. He began to wonder what Thunder had in store. Maybe the water was somewhere hidden behind the pachyderm's massive body. Wait, why was the elephant raising him towards his mouth? And why was he salivating so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Simba finally connected the dots he screamed, but the noise was cut short as he was deposited in the elephant's large mouth. The jaws closed, sealing the little lion gripped by fear inside. The large tongue burst into action, slathering the cub with saliva and pushing him around. The cum coating the lion's fur didn't seem to matter in the slightest. It made Thunder murr with delight, apparently a fan of his own flavor. The elephant's main focus seemed to be the cub's head, as the large tongue rubbed against it. When it felt sufficiently cleaned the pachyderm shifted the little lion around in his mouth, popping the saliva-covered head through his lips. He then steadily suckled on the rest of the cub's body, using his large tongue to replace the sticky cum with equally sticky saliva. Simba felt no cleaner after this, but Thunder deemed it an improvement. He retrieved the cub once more with his trunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go, much better. Now I've brought you here because you quit on me in the ring. That's okay though, you can make up for it.\" The elephant spoke in a commanding tone. Simba gulped. Whatever this grey monster had in mind, it would not be nice. And judging by the hint of elephant musk in the air, it would probably involve his cock again. more worryingly, it would not involve the rules of the ring. He was at the elephant's mercy. Thunder had taken him to a rocky area with boulders of all sizes dotting the grassy landscape. He placed the little lion on a small rock and stepped forward, looming over him in an ominous fashion. A small breeze paired with the slimy saliva clinging to his coat amplified the chill Simba felt running down his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will make this real simple for you. I need you to do only one thing for me. If you work with me, you're free to go. You could be back with your weird little friends in under an hour. If you don't, well... I'll have to be a little more persuasive. And I will take my time with that.\" Thunder spoke, doing little to put the cub at ease. \"Now, look before you.\" Simba obeyed and stopped looking up at the underside of the elephant's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the cub hung a familiar sight. Thunder's massive cock was already rock hard and throbbing with anticipation. The twitching cockhead pointed at the cub thanks to the elevated position Simba was put in. The stink of elephant musk grew more potent by the second. The cub reeled back in disgust when Thunder gave his command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" was all Simba could stammer in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss it. Right on the tip. Once is enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't think of anything he wanted to do less at this time, but he knew the elephant would not tolerate anything other then his total obedience. What does the little lion do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba had enough. He wouldn't play the elephant's sick games any more. He didn't believe for an instant Thunder would let him go, and if he'd show submission there would be no end to the torment. Out here nothing was going to stop the elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't feel any kissing... I'm not going to be patient with you, cub.\" Thunder grumbled overhead. He tried to contain his evil smile. While part of him really wanted to feel the soft touch of a gentle kiss on the tip of his dick, there was still more to be gained. If Simba would refuse, he would do the one thing he wouldn't be allowed to do in the ring. Seconds ticked by in slow motion as the grin on the elephant's face grew more and more sadistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time's up, now we do this MY way!\" He shouted, shooting his trunk down to the cub and wrapping it around Simba's neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gagged in the tight grip and choked for air. The trunk was unforgiving, pulling him inexorably towards the throbbing elephant cock. It pulsed and twitched with unbridled vigor, reflecting the gleeful state of mind Thunder was in. With one more quick tug he shoved the cub's head against his manhood. It was a cruel caricature of the kiss he wanted, but somehow just as satisfying to the pachyderm. He let up the constricting grip a little, allowing the lion a sample of precious oxygen contaminated with his potent musk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you decided to give me an excuse to do this. Little cubs who don't listen need to be taught. And this is a lesson you won't soon forget. Now breathe deeply, you'll need it!\" The elephant spoke loudly with excitement in his voice. The twitching cock rubbed its smooth tip against the struggling lion, who could do nothing in the elephant's mighty grip. Simba's face was dragged up and down, side to side, exploring every corner of the pachyderm's cock tip. Suddenly he was planted squarely in the middle, the trunk pressing him against the slit. It opened, unleashing another wave of undiluted musk into the air. More frighteningly Simba noticed that the slit was opened almost wide enough for his nose to fit in. As though the elephant had heard the cub's concern he began to push the cub towards the open slit. With a delicate <i>shlk</i> it parted the slit a little more and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion could scarcely believe it. His muzzle was being pushed into Thunder's cock and by the feeling of it that was just the tip of the iceberg. The trunk did not let up in its pressure, slowly pushing more of the cub forward into his dong. In spite of the elephant being rock hard the flesh surrounding Simba proved surprisingly yielding, stretching itself further to accommodate the cub's whole head. He was stunned with a mix of disgust and sheer disbelief. His whole head had been inserted into Thunder's twitching cock and the elephant showed no signs of slowing. He switched his trunk to the cub's midsection and began to push again, sliding Simba's neck and shoulders into his cock. The pulsing flesh parted wide, allowing the cub entry. He felt the strong, slimy walls around him encroach upon more and more of his body. The elephant was sucking him into his huge dick. Of all the things that could happen to him today, this was at the very bottom of the list. More frightening was the feeling that it was indeed the cock itself pulling Simba deeper, the trunk only there to suppress the heavier squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFighting back against this horrifying fate was made impossible. His front paws were already pinned to his sides by the voracious elephant cock and the trunk was holding his hind legs and tail together. With sickening ease he felt his midsection slide into the aroused elephant's manhood. The pachyderm groaned and moaned with unrestrained bliss. Squashing the little cub under his cock was one thing, but feeling him inside of him like this was on a whole new level. Thunder struggled not to just come again right then and there. He wanted Simba in, all the way. He was strong-willed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the elephantine schlong Simba was struggling for his life. He felt the slick inner walls of Thunder's urethra close around his hips. Soon he would be completely engulfed. He heard the blood rush through the long shaft of his prison and felt every twitch squeeze him just a little. With each pulse his legs slid in a little bit more until finally the whole of the cub's body was inside of Thunder's cock. The pachyderm trumpeted in victory. He'd experimented once or twice with pulling other critters in there, but never anywhere near as big as a lion cub. He wasn't even sure it was possible at all. The feeling was uncanny. He could feel the cub's whole body squirm as it slithered along the length of his manhood. His heaving balls were ready to receive their prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba had thankfully taken Thunder's advice about a deep breath to heart. His air would run out at some point, but he was determined to stay awake. Though with this disgusting situation it was rather easy to make it last as long as he could manage. The narrow, dark passage slowly continued making the cub lose all sense of direction. All he knew was that he was moving. Outside Thunder cursed his fat body blocking sight to this uncanny spectacle. The feeling was out of this world. The weak little cub slowly being sucked down his shaft. It was all he could've wished for and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the narrow tunnel ends for Simba. He finds himself in one of the elephant's big nuts, squirming weakly and trying his hardest not to gasp for air. The elephant could feel the panicked struggles rub against his most sensitive skin and moaned. Nothing in the ring could ever hope to compare to the unfettered bliss surging through him. Experiencing the little lion being sucked into his cock was out of this world. Now he had a tough call to make. What happens with Simba?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He could only moan and trumpet in unadulterated bliss as he celebrated this most unusual victory. He couldn't have dreamed of receiving this opportunity, and he had capitalized on it flawlessly. This was so much better then anything he could achieve in the ring. It might not provide the public humiliation, but squashing Simba underneath his cock would last him a while on that front. Feeling his ballsack wiggle with futile resistance on the other hand? That was satisfying on a far more personal level. With each passing second he felt himself build towards a devastating finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub meanwhile experienced a singularly unique vision of hell. The tight confines of Thunder's testicles were oppressive and sticky. The elephant's arousal adding not only a sticky coating to his fur but submerging most of him in a large pool of cum. There was plenty left after his unholy showering in the ring. Simba would be impressed if he wasn't so utterly revolted by this first-hand experience. His nose burned with the powerful stench of elephant musk and his whole body was coated in either cum or saliva. Most powerfully though, was the burden of defeat. He'd foolishly thought to take on all contenders, and Thunder proved just how insignificant he really was in the savannah. He was reduced to a toy, played with for a crowd's amusement. And now he had time to reflect on that, stuck inside of an elephant's swaying sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly everything around him began to pulse and squeeze. Simba felt himself pushed up into a narrow passage. All around him he felt the thick cum soak his body, pressing in on it. He was moving for sure, but he had no idea what was happening. Thunder roared loudly as he felt Simba surge back up along his shaft, propelled by a wave of semen. A bulge could be seen traveling along the length of the elephant cock. With a loud splatter he erupted, shooting Simba back out like a soggy firework. The cub landed on the ground, immediately hosed down by rope after rope of thick white cum. Thunder emptied his tanks onto the little lion, groaning loudly. He stood back and admired the scene he had created, a slime-soaked lion amidst a huge creamy pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooooooooooh, that was exactly what I wanted out of you. Run along now little cub. You're free but remember one thing. Timon and Pumbaa might think you their protector, but nobody can protect you from me. Don't ever forget it.\" The cub was too bruised, battered and out of breath to react. Thunder simply smiled and walked away, leaving Simba behind like a used tissue.</span></div></div>",

Vincent than did a complete 360 and sat right on top of the lion who had been in the middle of dodging the faux-charge.  \"Ha I got you know kid,\" Vincent said using his butt to grind Simba into the ground.  Simba tried with all his might to lift the Zebra ass off of him but he could not bulge it an inch.  \"Man you are weak kid, how old are you?\" Vincent said being to feel bad about beating up a kid younger than he was.  After Simba told him his age Vincent had to laugh, \"Wow I thought I was older than you but I am younger than you by three years.\" This statement caused the crowd to burst out laughing as Simba is being beaten by not only a prey to his kind but the kid was three years younger than the lion cub.  Vincent than decided to show his superiority by.</span></div></div>",

The wildebeest casually walks over to him, looking down at the little lion with pity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay, you can take a little break there. Gives me a moment to rest me weary bones too.\" Simba was too dazed to pick up on Lantka's intent and his eyes grew wide as she stepped over him. His vision filled with her underside, the coarse fur matted with sweat. It had been a long, hot day on the savannah and the wildebeest had been out in the sun all day. Her whole body reeked of sweat, Lantka's special odour. She nurtured it carefully by avoiding every form of bath like the plague, and Simba was about to receive a facefull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildebeest sighed deeply, letting herself drop down on top of the cub. Simba was instantly squashed flat underneath her large mass. Lantka was a large wildebeest and without any effort she concealed the little lion underneath her heavy belly. He was trapped completely, sealed off from the outside and sealed in with her sweaty gut. The clingy sweat stuck to him and added to his misery. It would take so many baths to get this stench out of his fur. The cub groaned in pain, the heavy wildebeest gradually crushing him underneath herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe torment experienced by Simba was an awful combination of pressure, stink and pain. Lantka's breathing caused her sweaty body to slowly rub against the cub's, pushing her sweat in deep. Its weight held him firmly pinned and the tiny pocket of air he had to breathe was contaminated by more of her sweaty stench. She seemed content to just stay put as the crowd cheered her on. She quietly had to admit she liked publicly humiliating the cub. She got up, revealing Simba to the world once more. His fur was grimy and glistening with sweat that wasn't his own. He laid still, but his eyes were open and he was looking around wearily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, go on. Get up boy, break time is over. Unless you want me to lie down again...\" The abject terror at enduring another second of that pushed Simba onto his feet. His legs were shaking and his whole body felt wracked and bruised by the heavy wildebeest. Lantka was not done with the cub though.

The little lion only stared silently as he watched his opponent seemingly lose her mind. But as suddenly as this act started, Lantka ended it. Her voice was calm again and she spoke chillingly. \"I'm real allergic to baths and anything that's been tainted by them...\" She turned to the lion again, walking confidently towards him. Her large nose sniffed the air loudly as she approached. Lantka's nose itched more and more as she got nearer until she was standing almost next to the cub. Simba was still bewildered by the wildebeest's act. But when she began to breathe weirdly it clicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly it clicked a moment too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ACHOO</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unreasonable amount of snot was expelled from Lantka's big nose and sent straight for the hapless cub. The volley of slime hit him with enough force to knock him off his feet. In an instant he was drenched in her snot. Thick wads of it clung to his fur, weighing him down a little. The bulk of the blast had hit him squarely in the flank, but the wildebeest wasn't done yet. With Simba on the floor she closed one eye to aim her next sneeze even better. Her breathing grew irregular and before Simba could so much as scream she sneezed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>ACHOO</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub couldn't tell how much snot was thrown his way, as it hit him directly in the face. The warm mucus coated his eyes, nose and mouth. He hacked, sneezed and coughed. His body did whatever was needed to rid itself of the wildebeest's stinking snot. His whole torso and head were slathered with this skincrawlingly disgusting slime. He almost wanted back underneath her. Being trapped and crushed under her large gut suddenly didn't sound too bad. Lantka simply let him squirm in revulsion, laughing along with the crowd. She was far from done showing the cub every last gross detail of her body. Whilst he worked to rid himself of the worst of her snot attack, the wildebeest calmly pondered her next move. Maybe she should force him to breathe her foul breath with some mouth-to-mouth. Or perhaps her agile tongue could probe him.</span></div></div>",

The cub only paid her a small amount of attention, more concerned with ridding himself of her last assault. He saw her mewl on about her tongue or something, demonstrating it's agility by curling it up and sticking it in her nose. The little lion shivered a little at the thought, but kept focusing himself on removing the snot from his fur. The wildebeest did not take kindly to being ignored and when she leaned in even closer the cub froze. He felt her hot breath wash over him and looked up again. Her head was mere inches away from his and in a flash her tongue shot out. It snaked around the small furry neck of Simba and pulled him closer. His neck was pressed against her pursed lips as the tongue set about strangling him. Simba couldn't believe how strong the wildebeest's tongue was. He was gasping for air, frantically flailing around. After only a few seconds of this unique chokehold Lantka let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub fell on the ground, only to be immediately assailed again by her tongue. It dragged itself along his belly, licking his sheath. The lion involuntarily shook with surprise. The tongue had found his puny little butt and dragged itself deep between his cheeks. As the tip passed over his little pucker, Simba felt something most ominous. The tongue had stopped dead in its tracks. Slowly it began to move backwards, the narrow tip pressing and massaging his pucker. Soon enough it yielded to the comforting pressure of Lantka's tongue. The cub pleaded her to show mercy, but she simply giggled. The wildebeest quickly pushed in, sliding her tongue up his rear as far as it would go. Simba shuddered as his yielding passage surprised the both of them. Lantka could slip most of her large tongue into the little cub's butt with little difficulty. Lantka was pleased things were going this smoothly. She pulled her tongue in and out, attempting to poke a little deeper each time. Large amounts of wildebeest saliva were smeared around by the strong muscle, further lubricating its journey. Simba felt it move deep inside of him. He'd never felt this sickened in his whole life. The disgusting tongue probing his rear had free reign over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Lantka released him from this slobbery impalement. Simba was going to walk funny for the remainder of today, but what else could she do to him? She noticed there were other parts in need of her tongue's intrusive attention.

His opponent sported broad hips, and she herself was 8 times Simba's size. Not only that, but she had a smug grin that seemed to out-smug Simba. The gazelle noticed Simba's courage waver for a moment, and giggled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already losing your nerves, tiny?\" Rachel said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!\" Simba responded, shaking his head. Rachel giggled more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright-y then...\" She turned and tauntingly shook her butt at him. \"...You can have the first move~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, the moment he showed resistance, Rachel spread her butt cheeks, only to clench them together, practically flattening Simba, who howled out in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can only think of one thing that'd be more fitting for you~\" the gazelle cooed out as a cruel idea entered her mind. She turned her backside towards one of the trees and backed up, eventually pressing her butt right against it, leaving the lion no chance to escape. She bent backwards, making sure to push as much of herself into Simba as possible. He wasn't sure what was coming, but he knew it couldn't be good. His fears would be confirmed when he began to smell a horrible smell, followed by a thunderous raspberry noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gagged and squirmed even more as he was swamped with her foul air, which Rachel laughed at. \"Ah~ Just the right punishment for you, tiny~\" she taunted as she rubbed against the tree, and him by extension.

TImon and Pumbaa, however, just gagged in disgust at their friend's predicament. \"Perhaps you need to learn your place a little more!\" She leaned back again, and farted once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next stream sounded like machine gun blasts, pelting her prey with several smelly blasts. Simba wasn't sure how much longer he could hold on. Rachel took herself off of the tree and walked forward, brandishing the weakly squirming lion stuck in her butt. </span></div></div>",

She paraded around the ring with Simba's tail tangling from her thick hips as the crowd roared its approval. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think I can make him tap out?\" the gazelle asked the audience. Their cheers only got louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If he doesn't pass out first!\" she laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba heard her taunts, though her voice was muffled through the layers of ass fat and flesh on both sides of his body. He tried to push back against his fleshy prison, but between the battering she started with and the gas she continued with, he just didn't have the strength. His paw just sank slightly into Rachel's soft flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle strode around the ring confidently, swinging her ass from side to side. With each swing, Simba was slammed from one cheek into the next and Rachel was slowly amping up the pressure as she flexed her glutes. Her soft flesh was getting more and more firm. Eventually it felt like she had his whole body locked in a vice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the lion's squirming slow and finally come to a stop. She paused in the middle of the ring and gave her ass one final, massive swing. When she reaches the apex, she relaxes her cheeks and lets Simba's unconscious body fly free out of her ass. The crowd gasps and cheers as they see the lion tumble to the floor in a heap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Winner!\" the vulture shouts, raising Rachel's arm in the air. \"Feel free to claim your prize Rachel,\" he says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle strides toward Simba, but keeps walking past him. She shouts in victory as she climbs the corner of the ring and celebrates her win with the crowd. She looks back over her shoulder at the lion and notices that he's just beginning to stir. His eyes are fluttering open. Rachel smiles and bends her knees slightly, taking aim. She waves her enormous ass in the air, drawing the beaten cub's attention. Knowing that he's too weak to move, she launches herself toward his body, her cheeks spread as wide as they can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer aim is true and she lands squarely on Simba's body, clamping her cheeks shut before standing. The impact actually looked worse than it was for the lion as he remained conscious, although he would soon wish he wasn't. As Rachel stood, the crowd roared even louder as there wasn't a trace of Simba remaining, not even his tail was visible within her thick ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a final victory pose, the gazelle exits the ring, clenching her ass over her new found prize. Timon and Pumba exchange worried glances. This did not go as planned. </span></div></div>",

They put the lion up to this and they couldn't have their protector live out his days as an anal toy for this shapely woman. Fortunately for them, Rachel was in no hurry so they caught up quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel! Miss Rachel!\" Pumba called out loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her name, the gazelle paused and saw the small animals who she recognized from the lion's corner during the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something I can help you boys with?\" she asked, caressing her shapely rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two friends swallowed hard.

We put him up to the fight. And what's more, he's really just a kid. We'd greatly appreciate it if you could let him come back home with us,\" Timon concluded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put him up to it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe friends nodded meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you knew the stipulations of the match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded again.

So I guess I have you to thank for that!\" she said, continuing to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, as a thank you gesture, how about you let him go?\" Pumba asked earnestly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle rubbed her chin in silence for a moment considering her options. If she played her cards right, she could end up with more than one little toy out of this match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok guys, I tell you what I'll do. I'll give you a chance to get him back,\" she said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you Miss Rachel!\" Pumba exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.

Simba took a deep breath finally able to get some fresh air. Every bit of his fur was ruffled and wet with sweat. He had a drunken look on his face from the tremendous beating he received from Rachel. The gazelle smirked, \"I'm sorry to part with you my little lion cushion, but I have two new playthings I need to go win.\" she teased him. \"I promise I won't be long.\" She brought him up to her face and gave him a drawn out kiss right on his lips. Simba wasn't in much of a state to fight back and was forced to endure the kiss. She turned to the audience and spotted a massive male wildebeest at the very edge of the crowd and walk over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildebeest looked up at the gorgeous gazelle, \"Hello there handsome.\" Rachel spoke in a seductive voice. \"I, uhh, err um hello.\" he stammered. Rachel leaned forward and brought a hand up to his face \"You sure look like a big, strong and capable wildebeest.\" she said while she dragged her hand tenderly across his cheek. The wildebeest chuckled nervously. \"And I was wondering if you could babysit my little lion toy for me, I would hate if he were to get lost.\" Feeling lovestruck in the face of the beautiful gazelle, the wildebeest nodded his head in agreement. He stood up and let Rachel lay the lion down in his seat face up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel waved at Simba before the wildebeest slammed his fat ass back down in his seat and letting out a sloppy fart on the poor cub. Knowing he was in good hands, she walked back to the ring and stepped inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies and gents, the match you've all been waiting so patiently for!\" the vulture announced. The referee flew over to Timon and Pumba, who were just climbing up into the ring. \"Say, what are your guys' names?\" the vulture asked. Pumba looked up at the ref, \"My name is Pumba and this here is Timon. We're going to win Simba back!\" Pumba announced. The referee rolled his eyes, \"Yeah whatever, i'll make sure it's written on your gravestones.\" \"Now wait just a minute!\" Timon protested before being interrupted by the vulture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Today we have newcomers, Timon and Pumba, who will be fighting none other than the undefeated champion, Rachel the gazelle!\" the vulture shouted. Rachel turned to pose so that the audience had a better view of her 'assets'. The audience cheered and applauded wildly, greatly feeding Rachel's ego. \"But this match is a special match at the request of our great champion!\" the vulture stated. \"In this match, any contestants that fall out of the ring are automatically disqualified!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon turned to his friend, \"All right Pumba, we've got to strategize to take her down so here's the plan.\" he whispered. \"When the match starts, i'll go in with the first strike and have her fight me.

Come on!\" Timon continued yelling, but he could tell she was completely disinterested in him. She was solely focused on his warthog friend whom she planned to jam in between those wobbly cheeks of hers. Timon had to think of something quick, something that would undoubtedly get her attention.

He saw Rachel clench her fists before turning to him. Timon saw the utter fury in her expression. Her bright blue eyes now small black pupils that focused solely on him. Her teeth were shaking from such intense gritting that it was astonishing they didn't shatter from the pressure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>What did you just say about me?</b>\" she growled.

He laid in a daze from the impact as a large familiar shadow loomed over him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon rolled over onto his back and looked up to see Rachel standing over him, all sanity seemingly absent from her face.  \"<b>HOW DARE YOU INSULT ME YOU LITTLE WEASEL!</b>\" the gazelle screamed as she lifted her foot directly above him. Timon closed his eyes before the foot fell upon him with a booming <i>-SQUELCH-.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's move was met with thunderous cheers from the audience, but she didn't much care for their amusement at the moment as she was blind with fury at this little weasel throwing such petty insults at her. He damaged her ego and she planned to pay it back tenfold. She lifted her foot up off the ground and slammed it back down before twisting to side to side, treating Timon as if he were a piece of dung she had stepped in and was trying to get off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the while applause and cheers roared from the crowd. Seeing the hotheaded meerkat get put in his place was a sight for all to look at, minus Pumba who looked on in shock at the abuse his friend was receiving. He felt the vibrations in the ground each time she slammed her foot down and flinched knowing that Timon was taking the brunt of each one. He promptly looked away, being unable to stand watching it any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stomped her foot on Timon one last time, panting strenuously after taking out all her fury on the pathetic little meerkat. She lifted her foot up to check her handiwork, but was met with only a prominent footprint in the ground. Rachel raised an eyebrow before looking at the bottom of her foot and saw a certain meerkat flattened and motionless against her sole. She took a hold of her opponent's head and peeled him off her foot and brought his flat body up to her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of laughter emerged from the spectators in the stands as they saw the flattened form of Timon looking as if he had been trampled by a stampede of hippos. Rachel couldn't help but to smile wickedly from ear to ear. \"That is what happens when you mess with me you little weasel!\" Rachel growled. The meerkat remained stupefied in her grasp as she took hold of his feet with her free hand and stretched his body like a rubber band before letting go of his feet and launching him to the corner opposite of Pumba and sending him slamming into the tree post. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba looked back to see a flattened Timon crash into the tree post. He hated to see his close friend get beaten so horribly, he wish he had stepped in to help, but he had to stick to the plan were they to get Simba back. Pumba thought of how brave and loyal Timon was to take such a thrashing from the towering gazelle just for Simba's sake and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience cheered for Rachel as Timon's body slowly slid down the tree post and back down onto the floor of the arena. Every fiber of his body throbbed in pain as it began to reform after the brutality Rachel delivered him. His ears rang like a herd of elephants trumpeting in sync and his vision was nothing more than a blur. He leaned up against the post to catch his bearings, but was given little time as his blurry vision made out Rachel who was standing only a few feet away from him. Timon's lips quivered in fear of the gazelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please Rachel, have mercy!\" the meerkat pleaded. Rachel was not one to show mercy to her opponents, especially ones so pitiful as this meerkat. She crouched down in front of Timon who in turn curled up into a fetal position. \"Oh, what happened to all that bravado just a minute ago weasel?\" Rachel badgered. She looked at the meerkat, who simply shook in his curled up position. Rachel rolled her eyes and looked towards the crowd of spectators cheering her on. \"I was planning on making this little guy my personal butt toy, but due to recent events, I think i'll just go and eat him whole!\" she hollered. The audience in turn began to chant her name and encouraged her to eat Timon. The chanting inflated Rachel's ego once again as she basked in her grandeur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon looked up in a timid manner to see the gazelle turned away and quickly glanced in Pumba's director. He was still standing in the starting corner. Timon waved his arms to get Pumba's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Pumba saw Timon waving towards him. <i>That must be the signal</i> Pumba thought to himself. He backed up slightly and fixed his eyes right on Rachel's bulbous backside. \"CHARGE!\" Pumba shouted, before charging towards Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Rachel take notice?</span></div></div>",

We have just one competitor left standing in the ring. Pumba is the winner!\" some of the crowd cheered the underdog, while many more booed his decision as they wanted to see Rachel's brutality rewarded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Per the rules of the match, Simba is to be freed into Pumba's custody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon started to get a little uncomfortable. Why all the focus on just Pumba? They worked together on this, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However,\" the ref continued, \"As two competitors were launched from the ring during the match, neither can be declared a winner or co-winner,\" he said, clearly focusing on Timon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are one lucky audience, as you will be treated to a <i>third</i> match with our champion Rachel! This time, she will take on Timon in a one on one contest under normal ownership rules,\" he stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered wildly. They were ecstatic about the opportunity to see Rachel a third time in one night, and especially in anticipation of the dominant show they expected to see her put on against the talkative and diminutive meerkat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel and Timon will return to the ring. As usual, no eating or full insertion. A loser will be declared when one competitor is declared unable to continue and that competitor will be awarded to the winner!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wildebeest who was tasked with...um....monitoring Simba begrudgingly pulled the cub from between his cheeks and tossed him at Pumba, who had been escorted out of the ring. As he returned to his seat, he happily stomped on Timon, who was attempting to escape through the crowd. Rachel smiled happily as she pulled her way through the ropes and watched the meerkat recover from his first match and from the light tap the wildebeest had delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So weasel,\" she teased as the ref rang the bell, \"I guess you're safe from being lunch for now. But what do you think about my <i>rhino ass</i> now?\" she teased, recalling the initial insult Timon had hurled her way while caressing her large, soft rump. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was angry about losing her royal toy and was intent on taking her anger out on the tiny meerkat. But she wanted his punishment and pain to last, so she knew she had to be patient and wait for him to recover before she started her assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she waited, she beckoned to the ref and whispered something in his ear. He nodded in agreement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At the request of the champion, in order to avoid an escape attempt from Timon the Terrible,\" he chuckled at the nickname, \"this will now be a Lumberjill match! Will any large, female animals willing to serve as a lumber jill and prevent our competitors from leaving the ring please proceed to ringside!\" the ref called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he was finished, the ring shook as a stampede of female rhinos, hippos, wildebeests, and even an elephant and giraffe or two surrounded the ring with hungry looks on their faces. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look Simba!\" Pumba observed happily, \"Timon already has so many fans!\" The battered cub just groaned in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon had finally fully recovered.

It was bad enough that he was stuck in the ring alone with Rachel, but now there was massive beasts that surrounded the ring who would pummel him if he tried to leave the ring. The lumberjills all looked down at Timon with various looks of hunger and lust on their faces, imagining the \"fun\" they would have with him should he take just one step out of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon's eyes shot around at the jills that were grouped around the ring. He first noticed a titanic giraffe woman standing behind his post who shot a wink at him as he made eye contact and squeezed her hefty breasts together. In fear he looked away from her only to see two giggling obese rhino girls on the left side of the ring that shook and smacked their massive rear ends in his direction. As threatening as all the lumberjills around the ring were, Timon was truly afraid of the gazelle that stood across from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel glared menacingly at the little meerkat in the opposite side of the ring. Her feelings towards him still soured over his disgraceful remarks about her beauty. <i>Rhino butt. Hyena dung.</i> Timon's words echoed in her head managing to infuriate her further. She was going was going to win this match and make that weasel her bitch for life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both contestants ready? Fight!\" the referee shouted, as the bell rang starting the match. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel immediately ran towards Timon and jumped up into the air and putting her feet together aiming straight for the meerkat. Timon screamed as he saw the soles of the gazelle plummet towards him. He dove out of the way at the last second, leaving Rachel to miss and hit the ground where he once stood. A devilish grin spread across her face as she lifted her right foot and stomped Timon five times in succession. After the fifth stomp, Rachel twisted her foot side to side before lifting it to see a flattened meerkat shaped like her foot drawing laughter and cheers from the lumberjills and spectators alike. Rachel looked around the ring at all of her fans, arms stretched outwards and a narcissistic smile that stretched from ear to ear basking in glory as she stood over Timon waiting for him to recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes had passed before Timon was finally back to his normal shape. His whole body was aching and throbbing worse than before. It practically begged Timon to forfeit the fight immediately and end the suffering, but Timon was a stubborn meerkat. He slowly lifted himself, albeit barely, onto his knees in defiance of the champ and managed to draw a few gasps from the lumberjills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel chuckled at the feeble display of defiance as she extended her right arm into a ninety degree angle and executing an elbow drop onto the puny meerkat. The lumberjills and audience applauded Rachel as she crushed Timon back into a two dimensional door mat. She lifted her arm off her opponent leaving a once again flattened Timon on the ground. Rachel picked up Timon by the scruff of his neck and brought him up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No more Rachel, p-please... I-I take back everything I said about you, h-honestly! F-forgive me!\" Timon stammered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle simply rolled her eyes, unmoved by his desperate pleas. \"You are so pitiful.\" Rachel scoffed. \"You insult me in front of my fans, cost me my royal lion toy and now you beg for forgiveness?

He screamed internally when he saw the elephants flaunting their enormous backsides at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey rodent!\" Rachel calls, focusing his attention on her and off of the lumber jills. His heart dropped even further when he remembered what he had to do. He knew he had the gift of gab, but there was no way he was talking his way out of this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel was a prideful, confident champion. It wasn't easy for a gazelle to be so dominant when she regularly faced off against lions (real ones, not little cubs like Simba) and hippos. She worked hard to train her body, to stay on top. So Timon's words stung sharply, especially coming from a runt like him who she could tell hadn't worked a day in his life. She was going to draw this out and really make him suffer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the girls outside are tempting, but you have a date with my ass!\" she shouted from across the ring. \"Be sure to tell me exactly what you think of it after you get a nice, close look!\" she taunted, caressing her backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon tried to keep his distance, but Rachel's strides were quick and long. She had him cornered in no time at all. He backed up to the edge of the ring and felt the hot breath of a rhino on his back and shuddered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanna feel a real rhino ass, just take a few more steps cutie,\" the rhino woman laughed as Timon scrambled away. Unfortunately for him, that meant moving closer to Rachel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle took advantage of his brief distraction, turned, and delivered an immediate hip drop. Planting her thick, fleshy ass on top of the meerkat. The crowd erupted into a wild cheer at the sight of the loud mouth getting what he deserved. Rachel could have ended the match and claimed her prize here, but she was far from finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe champ lifted her legs and spun around, facing the turnbuckle and smearing Timon beneath her backside. She gripped the vines and lifted herself off the floor only to drop on his body again. And again. And again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween drops, Rachel could make out the muffled squeaks from Timon begging for mercy. They were nearly drowned out by the loud cheers she received each time, but she savored the sound and focused. At times the came from the floor, other times from her own flesh where the meerkat had been stuck. But they were beautifully pitiful every time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle licked her lips and rubbed her ass on the ground, emphasizing her sheer dominance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no little rodent, I'm not finished with you yet. Not by a long shot,\" she said with a chuckle.</span></div></div>",

There laid the pesky weasel stuck in a daze with his arms and legs spread apart in a cartoonish manner. The meerkat's fur, as expected, was a complete mess that was clumped together and covered in dirt. His tongue hung out of his mouth as he took breaths of fresh air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Ughh, I think i'd like to go home now...\"</i> Timon slurred in his dazed state. Rachel loomed over the battered meerkat and chuckled. \"Oh, you must have misheard me, punk.\" she said as she reached down and grabbed hold of Timon in her right hand. \"I said i'm not finished with you.\"  The gazelle leaned back and crossed her legs before placing him in the small gap between her massive muscular thighs and positioning him so that he faced her. Her thighs practically swallowed up Timon's entire body up to his neck. Rachel grunted befor squeezing her thighs together, HARD. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon let out a loud shriek of pain as his body was wrapped in a vice. The audience applauded and chanted Rachel's name as she crushed her tiny opponent. \"That little lion friend of yours put up more of a fight than you.\" Rachel taunted, \"You could have just let me walk away with my new royal lion cushion, but no, you and that dumb pig had to stop me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba's eyes shot wide open, \"DUMB PIG?! WHY YOU!\" Pumba yelled while getting held back by Simba. \"No Pumba don't! You'll get Timon disqualified if you run in there!\" the cub reasoned as he desperately tried to pull Pumba back. Pumba snorted in retort. \"She got lucky...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you cost me my precious lion cushion, I think it's only fair if I make <u>you</u> my new cushion instead.\" Rachel stated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon screamed louder when he heard the champs words and began to wriggle with what strength he had left to get out of Rachel's grip to no avail. <i>\"She's so strong, she's going to kill me!\"</i> Timon thought to himself. Timon's screams turned to squeaks as Rachel squeezed harder and pushed the oxygen out of his lungs, all the while a horde of spectators cheered her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel grit her teeth and kept on squeezing harder and harder until he stopped screaming. His eyes began to flutter and his head drooped forward as he was on the verge of passing out. Rachel smiled proudly as she spread her legs apart and letting the meerkat collapse onto his back. She looked down at the barely conscious Timon, \"I don't quite think you've had enough, what does everybody else think!?\" Rachel said aloud. From all directions was a resounding roar of No's and laughter from the audience and lumberjills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle took hold of Timon by his hair and dragged him to the center of the ring. She turned him so that he faced a turnbuckle before walking towards said turnbuckle. Rachel climbed up on the vine ropes and stood on top of the turnbuckle, facing outwards of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it appears that Rachel is readying herself for her ultimate move: The Aerial Butt Bomb!\" the referee announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe audience all gasped in unison. Rachel's ultimate move was a major factor in her rise to fame. It was a rare sight to see and has never failed in finishing off her opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel stretched out her arms, basking in the cheers of her beloved fans for a brief moment before getting back to business. She put her arms straight forward and squatted down low and launched herself back into a majestic backwards somersault. At the peak of her jump, Rachel grabbed hold of her legs and lifted them towards her body and halting her somersault. She plummeted ass first directly where Timon was laying and let her ass crash down on top of him with her full weight with a echoing <b>BOOM.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hush fell over the crowd as Rachel made contact with the ground. They watched as Rachel slowly stood up and saw that there was no sign of the meerkat anywhere in the ring. The champ then turned and bent forward and put a hand on each of her ass cheeks before spreading them apart to reveal her opponent wedged in her ass crack. The audience went wild, jumping up and down, stomping their feet, screaming at the top of their lungs at the beautiful sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee flew over to inspect Timon's condition. He reached up and felt Timon's neck for a heartbeat. Timon was still alive, but was out cold. \"Careful back there ref, or you might just accidentally end up stuck back there with the weasel.\" Rachel said still holding her cheeks apart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture laughed nervously at Rachel's words before clearing his throat, \"Timon is no longer able fight which means he is now property of the reigning champion, Rachel!\" he announced. A round of applause erupted from the audience, while the lumberjills around the ring groaned as they were hoping to get a shot at Timon. Pumba and Simba looked on in shock as they had just lost their friend to a sadistic gazelle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel let go of her cheeks and took a bow. She had finally secured that pathetic meerkat and would make sure he'd regret the day he was born, but she still had a chip on her shoulder over losing her little lion cushion in her earlier match. Punishing this meerkat is more than enough to keep her occupied, but if she were to challenge that pig to another match and beat him, she would win back her lion and get to keep the pig as well. She would have have three comfy cushions to play with to her hearts content. Should she go through with it?</span></div></div>",

She thought about having those two additional toys in her possession. Maybe she could use the warthog as a nice cushion while using the lion and meerkat as living dildos for her gluttonous pussy and swampy anus respectively, or perhaps devouring and digesting one of the less obedient twerps into padding on her already massive hips to turn them into even more potent weapons to punish the others with. Those two thoughts was all it took, just two lewd thoughts threw Rachel into a lustful daze that caused her to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba turned to Pumba with a look of despair on his face. \"I'm sorry Pumba... this is all my fault.\" the cub stated. \"If I wasn't so weak, then you guys wouldn't have had to rescue me and Timon wouldn't be jammed up Rachel's butt...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba looked over to the cub, \"Aw don't worry Simba.\" he said to the lion. \"Maybe we can ask her nicely for Timon back.\" Simba sighed in disbelief, remembering how well that worked out when Pumba and Timon had asked Rachel nicely to give him back to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle knocked herself out of her lustful daze and concluded with herself that she would indeed challenge that meddling warthog and claim him and that lion cub of his, but first she had to make sure her newfound bitch was perfectly secure. She squeezed her ass cheeks together with intense force so that the little weasel trapped inside wouldn't accidentally fall out during the fight. The gazelle squeezed until she felt the meerkat's face press up against her anus. Feeling his face being compressed by her butt hole left Rachel confident that she had him locked away well enough and she proceeded walk on over to the referee to confer with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd began to disperse, but still felt jubilant after seeing their favorite wrestler and champ take part in three back-to-back matches. The spectating lumberjills felt disappointed they didn't get a shot at the bothersome meerkat. Some debating among each other over who had the more brutal method of punishing him, but were soon halted by a certain vulture's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't go anywhere yet folks!\" he announced. \"I have just been informed that the still undefeated champ, Rachel, has just challenged Pumba and his lion, Simba, to a lumberjill match!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll heads turned back towards the ring. A great stampede began as the lumberjills and the rest of the crowd scrambled back to the ring. It wasn't long before all seats were filled and the ring was once again surrounded by giant animals of varying species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba's face lit up. \"That's it!\" he shouted, now looking at his friend. \"If we can beat Rachel in a match, then we can win back Timon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba gulped as he turned his attention to Rachel, who simply glared back at him with a look of ferocity on her face. \"But Pumba... I'm not strong enough to fight her...\" the cub murmured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba rolled his eyes. \"Nonsense Simba!\" he exclaimed before throwing Simba up into the ring using his tusks and hopping in after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion yelled before face-planting inside the ring, which resulted in the crowd laughing at the pathetic display. He got up onto his feet only to visibly shake in fear at the sight of the gazelle standing firm on the far side of the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba spoke to the cub. \"Don't worry Simba. You're a lion, and lions prey on gazelles like her! Which means you should be able to beat her easily!\" he assured his pal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel couldn't help but burst out laughing at the warthogs statement. \"Well come on then, come get your prey little lion.\" she teased, while pointing her hips in his direction to show off her muscular curves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taunting was interrupted by the vulture, \"Let the fighting commence!\" he announced. The fight began as...</span></div></div>",

The stranger then hoisted theirself up onto the ring to reveal a well toned lioness with hips that rivaled her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it appears we have a surprise guest joining the champ this match!\" the referee called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel raised an eyebrow as the lioness approached her, <i>\"And who might you be?\"</i> Rachel challenged her. The lumberjill halted just a couple feet next to Rachel and placed a hand on her own chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"My sincerest apologies dear Rachel, I am known as Savannah.\"</i> the lioness answered. <i>\"I am the sole ruler of my marvelous pride and I just refuse to stand idly by when there's a puny little lion boy who's in dire need of being dominated by yours truly.\"</i> Savannah looked over towards Simba, who winced in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle's brows furrowed, was this lion bitch trying to stand her up?

It didn't help that she was also focused on the lion cub that Rachel rightfully deserved, but at the same time a partner would certainly help amp up the punishment that these two punks desperately need. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel crossed her arms. \"All right then 'Queen Savannah'.\" Rachel mocked, \"We'll see what you're made of, but after this fight that cub is <b>mine.</b> \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavannah rolled her eyes and scoffed, <i>\"Whatever you say Mrs. Rachel.\"</i> Champion or not whatever Savannah wanted, Savannah got, especially when what she wanted was the champ's lion cushion. What a prize that little Simba would be. Savannah knew of the pride that Simba hailed from. It was the dominant pride in all the land. Claiming him would mean to secure her and her pride as the new dominant power in the land, as well as supply her with an authentic king lion loveseat to rest her royal hindquarters on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"You heard it here folks.

It couldn't be as easy as it sounded...could it? With two of them pulling on the lion's legs, even as strong as Rachel was they should be able to wrench him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds....fair,\" Timon said cautiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" Rachel said happily, turning around and presenting her thick ass to the friends. \"Go ahead and get him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe meerkat and warthog stared up at the gazelle's firm backside and realized the significant challenge. At 8 feet tall, even her ass was far out of reach for either of them. They wouldn't be able to double team the challenge as they anticipated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Miss Rachel, would you mind getting a bit closer?\" Pumba asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh,\" Rachel sighed, \"I'm sorry boys. After that match, I'm just too stiff and sore to bend any more than this,\" she said in mock pain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Pumba, you're going to need to lift me up. I'll grab the kid's tail and then we'll both pull. Got it?\" he instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog nodded and grunted his understanding. He lowered his snout so his friend could climb up and reached as high as he could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill out of reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing, Pumba put his front feet on Rachel's thick legs and used them to prop himself up. He wasn't particularly stable on his hind legs without additional support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel moaned softly at the sensation of the warthog's feet on her flesh, distracting the duo for a moment, but they pressed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Timon was high enough that he could reach up and touch the gazelle's soft flesh. She moaned even deeper and shivered slightly as the meerkat's small hands searched between her tightly clenched cheeks. The movement made Pumba waver a bit, but he managed to keep his balance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog was struggling and his legs were shaking, but this was important, so he focused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Timon's searching paws felt Simba's tail. He wasn't eager to spend any more time than necessary with his hands up this dangerous woman's backside, so he called down to his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Pumba, I got him! Pull!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba shifted slightly so that Timon's tail was in his mouth. He clamped as hard as he could without injuring his friend and tugged. Timon pulled with all his strength. But leverage wasn't on their side from this angle and Rachel wasn't letting go of her prize without a fight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPumba dropped his front legs and continued to pull. Slowly, the cub's tail slipped free from between the gazelle's cheeks. But that was the easy part. The rest of Simba's body wouldn't slip out nearly as easily as his thin tail would. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warthog grunted and the meerkat shouted in pain as his body stretched, but progress was slow. Eventually, Timon felt his tail slipping from his friend's grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pumba! Hold on! Don't le-----ACK!\" Timon shouted. He was cut off as his body slipped from his friend's grasp despite Pumba's best efforts. As Rachel felt Pumba's pull dissipate, she lunged her hips forward and relaxed her cheeks just slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor Timon's thin body was shot like a slingshot straight between Rachel's thick cheeks, which immediately clamped up tight once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh, unexpected company,\" she said with a giggle, gripping and groping her flank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was shocked to see his already small space grow even more cramped with the added presence of Timon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...hey Timon,\" the tired cub said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey kid,\" the dejected meerkat responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon tried to squirm his way back out, but even as small and thin as he was, Rachel's thick rump was closed too tightly for him to wiggle free. His motions were only greeted by a happy moan from their host high above. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gazelle turned and looked at a tired and bewildered Pumba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like your friends will be hanging out with me from now on,\" she said with a giggle. \"Thank you again Pumba!\" Rachel laughed before strutting off confidently and leaving the warthog alone. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With the familiar pressure and swaying sensation of Rachel's stride, Simba quickly lapsed back into unconsciousness. That left the smaller meerkat alone to ponder how he got himself into this mess. He continued to squirm to try to find an opportunity for escape, but was just met with muffled giggles from his captress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm certainly enjoying that squirming Timon,\" the gazelle laughed, \"But don't use up all your energy too soon.

He had no idea what was happening or why he appeared to like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel sat up, her firm butt pinning most of Simba's body down. She smiled a little and stood up, revealing Simba's erection to the crowd. The cub had never felt so embarrassed in his life, lying there completely exposed. The gazelle relished seeing the little lion squirm with humiliation, but she had bigger plans in mind. She stood to his side, her hefty buttocks looming over the cub once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excited little boys like you must be...\" She said to the crowd. \"Punished!\" Rachel added as she dropped her butt back on top of Simba. His whole body except for his head was buried under her heavy ass. Worse, his erection was painfully slammed down against his belly. Simba yelped in shock and pain, feeling the merciless round surface of her buttcheek crush his boner. The cruel gazelle twisted her butt a little, the friction only adding to the pain. She smiled, having the little cub at her mercy like this felt powerful. She had him entirely under her control, grinding his erect manhood down. Then she felt something unexpected: a small wet patch on her buttcheek. Her eyes shot down to Simba's, filled with anger but soon melting into a far more disturbing lustful gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you dirty little cub.\" She cooed, barely loud enough for Simba to hear. He'd felt himself climax too, his cock mercifully waning and retreating back into its sheath. It made the overwhelming pressure of her butt somewhat more manageable, though he worried what the gazelle might do about it.</span></div></div>",

She leant forward, surrounding his head with her large thighs and planting her groin squarely on his face. Her weight nullified any resistance he could muster and soon it was clear these were no idle threats. Her smothering form wasn't going anywhere until he'd brought her the pleasure she felt she was owed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly his tongue began to explore her nethers, briefly tasting the slippery netherlips before pushing in deeper. Rachel moaned in delight, almost surprised to push the cub into submission so easily. Perhaps her oppressive little lesson is more impactful than she's giving it credit. Claiming the little cub as her own after the battle suddenly doesn't sound like such a bad idea. She could show him off to all her friends and force him to serve them as well. By the time she was done with him, he would have tasted every pussy in the Pridelands. And if he proved more disobient than she hoped, there was always a generous helping of her heavy butt to squash him back into line. Such happy thoughts, made all the better by the blissful sensation of her lion pillow offering some surprisingly good tongue action in her pussy. If she didn't know any better she would've guessed this wasn't the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere seems to be no end to the depths Simba can force his tongue to reach. Finally he hits the bullseye and with a howling moan she climaxes on his face. The audience, quiet in anticipation, exploded into roaring applause. Rachel had humiliated her opponent in ways not often seen in the ring. She stood up and walked around triumphantly as the ref flew in to check up on the floored cub. With a sigh of relief the vulture concluded the lion was alive, merely worn out from the beatdown he'd received. Rachel joined in, sitting on her knees over the cub. He was spared her weight, but that still dripping pussy hovered ominously over his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, little prince? You got another one of those in you?

She smiled before charging at him again and sending her ass crashing into his face a second time. This hip check sending him straight into the corner of the ring. The cub crashed into the tree that served as the makeshift ring post. He was dazed and found himself clinging to the tree, high off the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's smile grew broader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have attacked when you had the chance kid,\" she mocked, licking her lips before charging at him a third time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time though, instead of turning for a hip check, the gazelle gracefully leapt into a full body splash. Simba saw the scene unfold in slow motion. Rachel spread her arms wide and stuck out her full chest as she floated toward her prone opponent. Simba wanted to brace himself, but he couldn't tear his eyes away from the gazelle's approaching rack, which seemed to grow larger by the moment. His mind was torn, at one point aching for an escape and in the next breath pleading to dive into the rapidly approaching soft mounds of female flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's instinct for self preservation lost the battle, and he both moaned and groaned as Rachel made contact. The noises the cub made were met with moans of enjoyment from Rachel as well. When she landed, she wrapped her arms around the tree and held tightly, forcing the lion to be smothered harder and harder by her much larger body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh who knew a king could be so much fun!\" Rachel squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed as she finally released her hold and walked a few steps to the center of the ring, basking in the crowd's applause. They were loving every second of the domination and embarrassment she was putting the cocky challenger through. Simba, for his part, fell to the mat immediately as Rachel's presence was gone. He leaned back against the tree, struggling for oxygen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked up at his opponent and saw the gleam in her eye as she returned her attention to him, he realized that was a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel ran at him yet again. She seemingly never ran out of energy. At the last moment, she turned and spread her cheeks wide. The lion's mouth hung open preparing a scream, but no sound was heard. At least, not by the crowd. His voice was completely muffled by thick flesh on all sides of his small body. The gazelle moaned and leaned her upper body forward while pressing her hips back against the tree and the cub. She ground his body from side to side as he was defenseless to push her larger form off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she gripped the vines that served as the ring ropes and used them to pull herself forward and off of the prince, but the reprieve wouldn't last long. Simba hardly had the energy to gasp as he saw the now familiar gazelle ass throttling back towards him at rapid speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pounded her ass against Simba's body and the thick trunk of the tree as if she were trying to chop it down with her butt. Rachel pulled forward a final time and used her hands to part her cheeks wide before slamming her ass backwards yet again. Timon and Pumba looked away. They couldn't bear to watch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSLAM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she stepped away from the tree, there was no lion to be seen. Rachel looked around the ring in mock shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did my opponent go?\" she asked the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome in the audience laughed while others played along, yelling and pointing at her thick ass. The tufts of Simba's tail were all that could be seen from between her imposing cheeks. Rachel playfully caressed her ass with both hands, bouncing them from side to side, chewing up Simba's small body without even trying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems like the king likes my ass after all. Were you just playing hard to get?\" she said with a laugh. </span></div></div>",

There was no way in hell he could poop out a lion cub.......at least he didn't think so. Either way he had standards, he was gross but not that gross. \"Now be a good cub and let me enjoy this,\"He sighs as he sits down in his recliner and turns on the tv, \"I'll let you out in a few then I'll give you a bath and put you in one of your new outfits.\" \"Yes sir.\"Simba meeps out not wanting to find out if it was a bluff or not. \"Good boy.\"Gasser laughs as he rubs his belly and settles down to watch one of his shows.</span></div></div>",

She locked her bright orange eyes on the puny whelp, cowering in her awesome presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rang and Savannah lowered her front body, ready to pounce, but Simba was stumbling attempting to get off the stage.

Savannah said with a grin and pulled the cub back into the ring by his tail. Simba dug his claws into the ring to get a grip, but her strength was too much for the little lion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned him over onto his back and glared at him. \"The fight just started little guy.\" Savannah said to Simba. Her breath smelled like she had some bad meat before her match. Simba's nose scrunched up in disgust. \"Ugh, what did you eat?\" he regrettingly spoke. \"Well if you can't handle my breath, you won't last very long with what I have planned for you runt.\" Savannah said intimidatingly.

Simba lumbered in, no doubt exhausted from being this lioness' cushion. \"Y-Yes, m-mistress?\" he stuttered. Savannah pointed to a rock, makeshift to seat cushion. \"Lay down.\" Simba obeyed and laid down on the rock on his back. Savannah turned around and presented her glorious rear to him, eclipsing him from any light and dropping down on his small form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her butt so it covered his head and sat down with full weight, crushing the cub underneath her. Savannah stayed like this for a good twenty minutes, watching the wild life graze the lands below. Simba's whole body was practically molded to her buttocks at this point. A familiar noise is heard and a strong, wet fart expels from Savannah's tailhole. \"Sniff.\" she commands. Simba reluctantly obeyed and lifted his snout to her tailhole and began sniffing at the fumes. By now, he had gotten used to the smell of her farts. She rubbed her butt down and let out another gas bomb which Simba breathed in by Savannah's command. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSavannah continued this for over most of the afternoon and evening, making her new slave practically worship her rump. When it was night time, she sat up off her 'cushion' who was coughing from the long period under her. \"Bed.\" she commanded, and Simba got up and walked in the back of the cave to her bed made of dirt and grains. Simba laid down and Savannah stood over him and lowered herself onto him. Simba could only sigh as he felt his new mistress' weight fall down on top of him and compress him until she completely covered him with her body and fell asleep on top of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The little lion cub found an ounce of courage deep within in himself and glared back at Gene to show he wasn't afraid. The cheetah chuckled at the sight, knowing her opponent's move was only a facade and she knew how fearful he was of her. She squinted her eyes in a dominate matter to counter his scowl. Simba gulped, feeling she concluded his act, but he had to stand his ground. Just then, a low, deep growl came from the cheetah standing before him. The panicked cub was puzzled, until he saw her cheeks puff up...  In the makeshift bleachers, the crowd waited in anticipation for the cheetah's move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGene inched fairly closer to Simba and let out a rowdy belch right into his face. The force of the blast blew his hair back and the stench that followed matched the power behind it. Simba coughed and wiped his nose with one of his paws, trying his best to relieve himself of the stench. It smelled like rotten antelope meat mixed with wildebeest that had stood out for weeks before being devoured. Gene rose her head up and looked upon her opponent stumbling just from a single belch. \"What's wrong 'king of the jungle', can't handle a little burp?\" Gene teased. Laughter ensued from the audience as Gene teased the little guy. She walked to the side of the disoriented cub and turned her backside towards him. With a quick bump, Gene's rump knocked over Simba to his side, catching him by surprise. The lion noticed a large shadow cast over his body. He turned to see the yellow and block spotted muscled backside of Gene approaching him. Before he was able to make any noise, or movement, her buttocks made contact with Simba. Her left flank planted on Simba's head, keeping him pinned down while her right flank planted on the side of his body near his mid-section covering a good portion of the runt and finally resting on top of a new found yellow furred seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroans were emitted from Simba, partially muffled by the butt cheek pressing down on his face. \"Enjoying yourself?\" Gene asked. \"I don't just let any old bumpkin have the honor of being my royal seat. I only let a few, 'special' peons enjoy such a noble bum.\" Gene said, giving a few small bounces for emphasis to the situation she was putting her adversary in.

She'd often call in her pack to help out in her battles.

Simba leapt towards her, but Amy brought up a paw, slamming it against Simba's stomach and smacking him down to the ground. She brought her face down close to Simba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never tried lion before,\" she said, licking her lips. Simba's eyes went wide with her taunt. Amy opened wide and wrapped her jaws around Simba's head, completely enveloping him. The crowd, except for Timone and Pumbaa, cheered. SImba squirmed under her as he was instantly hit by her rancid breath. Amy started to suckle on him like a lollipop, her tongue running over his grimacing face as she tasted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the torture couldn't get any worse, Amy adjusted her paw to hold it around his head, keeping his snout close to her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"URRRRRRP!\" Amy belched. Suddenly, Simba was assaulted with what felt like a sea of grossness, flooding the inside of Amy's mouth. Simba squirmed even more as the sea of grossness began to drown him. With a pop, Simba's head plopped out of Amy's mouth. \"Mmm! That'll be good when the match is over.\" Simba looked around, slowly recovering from the horrid smell, and noticed other dog's in the arena. \"So nice of you all to finally arrive,\" Amy said, ginning.

He'd never seen a tapir before and Timon's description of a tiny-trunked, pudgy elephant-like creature wasn't helping. According to the meerkat, they lived in the rainforests south of the Pridelands. On rare occasion one would venture out into the plains. Leslie was a little different though, something Simba would be quick to realize when he laid eyes upon her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTimon would appear to be right on all accounts except for the size. Simba was expecting his opponent to be roughly the size of Pumbaa, but Leslie was considerably larger. Looking at the nearby spectators the cub put her on par with a rhino in size. The other thing that became clear was her stench. The tapir was on the other side of the ring, but the little lion could smell her easily. And her horrid odour was only the first of his concerns. In the ring with her was her previous adversary, an anthro lion. He was lying flat on his back with the tapir hovering over his face. His fur was shaggy and dirty from the wrestling, but he was spent. Whatever Leslie had done to him had worn him out completely. She seemed to celebrate her victory by plunging her long tongue down his throat in a cruel caricature of a kiss. His body twitched every time she went in, but he was too weak to stop her. After a minute or so of this torment the referee, a vulture, flies in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makka is no longer able to fight, do you want to claim him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naw, I got another fight after this, and I don't want to spoil myself with too many toys.\" She said with a cocky smile.

Leslie looked him in the eye menacingly, her head now mere inches away from him and... kept walking? The cub was mighty confused. Was this beast blind or something? He was right there, how could she have missed him. It was only when she stopped walking that things fell into place for the cub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he hadn't gotten up yet and by now the vast expanse of her belly was hovering above him. Realization dawned on him with a long \"Oooooooh... shi...\" His words were cut off when Leslie simply laid down. Her vast body completely enveloped the little cub in fatty mass. The short fur on her belly pressing against his nose and her stench filling the minuscule pocket of air he had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie smiled, feeling the trapped cub squirm weakly against her uncaring belly. This trick was by far her favorite. It wasn't as flashy as some others, but the simplicity and sheer brutality of just squashing her opponent underneath her was so satisfying.

She mentally shrugged and resorted herself to waiting until she could take her opponent with her. Feeling the pathetic squirming beneath her big belly left her confident she wouldn't have to wait long. As soon as Simba would wear himself out he'd pass out and she would be able to claim him. The massive tapir instead spent her time thinking of all the evil little ways in which she'd handle the little lion after this 'fight'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was completely pinned beneath the sluggish mass of the tapir's immense gut. A powerful odour of stale sweat hung around him and her short belly fur felt coarse and bristly against his nose. The monstrous weight was worst of all. Every tiny movement was hard-fought. Every breath a little shallower than the last as Leslie's giant form slowly crushed him flat. Dull pain radiated all over his body, but compared to the stench and utter helplessness of his situation it was barely noticable. To make matters worse, he could hear the muffled audience cheering. They wanted to see him humiliated like this. Thankfully the excitement was dying down. Though if they got bored, does that mean they're feeling pity or waiting for Leslie to do even more to him? Maybe the dimming sound had something to do with this lightheaded feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeslie clearly felt the very moment the struggles stopped entirely. She had done it. She had smothered the prince into submission. And now it was time to claim him. She got up quickly and the vulture flew in. The tapir was frightful for a moment when she saw the flattened cub. She wanted to knock him out, not kill him. Thankfully some errant twitching happened when the ref poked him. He quickly declared her the winner and popped the all-important question. \"Leslie, do you claim this lion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pact was sealed. Simba now belonged to Leslie and the tapir could barely contain her excitement. \"I can't wait to get started on you, little cub.\" Suddenly someone tapped her on the flank. It was the vulture again. \"Small problem. You KO'd him so quickly the next match isn't ready yet. Think you can fill some time with your new toy? No rules ofcourse, just don't go completely overboard.\" Leslie smirked a little. The idea of publicly playing with the cub without any rules to hold her back was perfect. \"Very well, I'll be your intermission act.\" The vulture let out a sigh of relief. \"You're a lifesaver, Leslie. I owe you one.\" He flew to the center of the ring and made his announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies aaaand gentlemen, a special treat for you right now. Whilst Marco and Atyeh get ready for their match, here is Leslie and her brand new toy, Simba!\" The cub slowly blinked back into the land of the waking. The tapir wasn't going to wait though.

Normally they wheel out some jobber to get slapped around for a minute, but this was something new. Leslie's agile tongue didn't often posses the strength to hoist an opponent into the air and the brutal display of thrashing around Simba earned her lots of raucous applause. The cheering was just noise to the cub, who was lying dazed on his back in the middle of the ring. The pink blur that was Leslie's tongue hung over him, dripping a few drops of saliva on his face. The large tapir withdrew the organ for a moment to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now... for the finisher!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stepped up to Simba, her head hovering over his groaning face. Her maw opened and her tongue lapped his cheek. He felt the slimy mass leave a trail across his mouth, which the cub kept firmly shut. Leslie quickly grew annoyed with these last scraps of resistance. She put a heavy foot on Simba's chest and whispered threateningly. \"Open up or else...\" The little lion still refuse to cooperate, drawing the tapir's ire. Her foot came down on his body like a building. The cub gasped in pained shock, strangely surprised that a rhino-sized tapir is that heavy. The open mouth was all she needed and with a hungry glint in her eyes she drives her tongue in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba felt his mouth fill up with slithering, soggy muscle. The tapir's saliva tasted awful on his tongue and the stench of her breath could probably strip paint. The vile mass coiled around his tongue, thoroughly contaminating it. But Leslie had only just gotten started. The prying tip soon found it's way to the back of Simba's throat. The buildup of saliva not his own triggered an involuntary swallow, and the tongue followed right on in. The cub gagged at this alien sensation. The long tapir tongue was pushing it's way down his neck. He felt the long muscle sway and turn, his body twitching and moving seemingly of it's own accord. The crowd recognized Leslie's move and cheered her on. This wasn't the first time she'd probed someone so deeply. Several former opponents in the audience held their bellies, remembering well what they suffered. They did not envy Simba's position, seeing the little body quake at the strange probing. Only when the tip of Leslie's tongue dipped into Simba's stomach did she pull out to let him breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still with us, he's a resilient one.\" the tapir announced. Simba needed time to recover, but Leslie was not going to give him a second. What does she do next? </span></div></div>",

She opened her maw wide, letting the cub observe every little detail. The strands of saliva dripping down, the long rows of dull herbivore teeth. In the back of it all was her gullet. It looked easily big enough to swallow him whole. The fleshy passage glistened with copious amounts of saliva. Only now did the little lion see just how much Leslie had been drooling at the very idea of making a meal out of him. His fight grew more ferocious, but the tongue was brutal in its response. It simply rolled the cub towards the waiting maw, wrapping a second slobbery coil around him. Another squeeze left the cub gasping for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no further resistance Leslie pulled her toy into her maw and hid him from the world. She fake-chewed on him, pushing him around with her tongue whilst pretending to the enraptured audience. They burst into applause when she opened her maw again to reveal Simba was just fine. As fine as a cub in his position could be at least. With her mouth closed and a struggling little lion inside the tapir looks at the ref. Both nod in agreement and a loud gulp echoes through the ring. The crowd is shocked silent. In a normal match Leslie would've been disqualified immediately, but for this halftime show she had special permission. She'd already beaten and claimed him, so for once she was allowed to do the eating of her opponent in the ring. The vulture ref considered in her reward for saving his ass with this last-minute halftime act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the tapir opened her big maw again half the cub was already engulfed by her hungering gullet. A small gulp pulled him in a little further, quickly intensifying his struggles. Against the powerful throat of Leslie the little lion had no chance. Another gulp pulled him in up to his neck. A last plea for help gets overruled by a loud gulp and Simba is gone. Only Leslie can detect him, a pleasurable feeling traveling to her belly. She didn't know what she had done to earn an opponent as delightful as him. But she'd do whatever it takes to get another one. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

All sound around them seemed to disappear as the realization hit Simba. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameroon, grinned, then quickly reeled his tongue back in.

Simba's eyes watered from the hot gas and his breath was shallow. This wouldn't do for Cameroon, who tightened his tongue. The fleshy coil holding the lion's body bore down on him with crushing force. The cub gasped at the sudden squeeze forcing his lungs empty. The toad then quickly loosened his grip. Simba reflexively took a deep breath, inhaling the pungent gas. He coughed and gagged at its foul potency. Again the coiling tongue squeezed the air out of him. Cameroon was controlling exactly when the cub was allowed to breathe. He kept this up for a few minutes until he felt certain the little lion had inhaled most of his horrid burp. A good thing, as his stomach was bubbling once again. This time no attempt was made to contain the foul burst of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCameroon's tongue felt Simba's struggles fade, but he wasn't quite done yet. He'd play some more before claiming him for his next meal. The tongue let go of Simba, letting him flop onto the base of the toad's maw. He pursed his lips a little and guided the cub out with his next belch. The little lion flew a few feet before landing in the dirt. He was slathered in toad saliva and weary from breathing the rancid air in Cameroon's maw. The toad himself leapt up high and landed in his corner. There he sat and waited for Simba to regain his wits. Shrugging off the horrifying experience of being pulled into his maw would take the little lion some time. But Cameroon could wait. He wanted to savour the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ref kept a close eye on the situation. The cub was a little careworn, but well able to keep fighting. After a few minutes of Simba trying to shake off the worst of the toad slobber Cameroon went for his next move. What does he do? He'd not shown him yet what it feels like to have a hippo-sized toad jump on top of him. Or maybe he should just waddle on over to the cub. Maybe belch in his face some more or gobble him up again without even using his tongue.</span></div></div>",

Which means no biting, clawing at the throat, gouging of the eyes, and definitely no tail-pulling,\u201d</span> the vulture loudly interrupted before Simba could respond. By now, they were both squaring off in the middle of the dusty field, and Yewande was so close he would feel her meaty breath on his face. Simba couldn\u2019t even bear to look her in the eye. <span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cWhen the competitors are ready\u2026 begin!\u201d</span> With a blow of a whistle, the leopard\u2019s composure immediately changed. As the two competitors circled each other, she arched her back like a veteran predator, her eyes staring daggers at the small lion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two fighters were now sizing each other up, both posed to strike at any second. They sized each other up, not knowing exactly what the other was capable of. Simba felt his fur bristling for the first time in years. The tension was palpable.</span></div></div>",

She was upon him before he could even blink, and all he could do is tense up in reflex, assuming the leopard would rip out his throat and it would be all over. But instead, the feline ducked down her head and headbutted the cub into the air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The cub flailed comedically as he flew across the coliseum, and though he landed on his feet, as all cats do, the laughter of the audience was mortifying. Yewande reared back again, that same smug smirk on her face. His side still aching, Simba was starting to realize just how strong the leopard was compared to him. She could apparently throw him around like a ragdoll with ease. How could he possibly compete with her? This wasn\u2019t a fair fight\u2026 but it didn\u2019t seem like he could back out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cCome on. Aren\u2019t you going to fight back?\u201d</span></b> Yewande taunted, beckoning him over to her side of the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Simba tried to think rationally, but his fear overcame him. The match must be rigged -- he was powerless against her! If he tried to fight back, she would destroy him for sure. There had to be another way out, some way to escape the coliseum. With that thought, Simba turned tail and ran. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou know I can outrun you,\u201d</span></b> Yewande laughed, watching with bemusement as the cub fled as far from her as possible, checking desperately along the walls of the coliseum for a way out. The audience\u2019s laughter was deafening, now, knowing that Simba had just sealed his fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It wasn\u2019t long until the lion found what he was looking for. A rope, draped over the side of the coliseum wall! He wanted to climb up the robe as fast as he could, and just keep running, fast as he could, deep into the jungle until he never had to lay eyes on this damned coliseum ever again. But just as he latched onto the rope, he felt teeth grab the scruff of his neck and drag him away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cNo!\u201d</span> he demanded, doing his best trying to sound intimidating as the leopard easily dragged him away from his only salvation. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cL-let me go!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe veteran hunter\u2019s strength seemed awe-inspiring compared to the fragile little cub\u2019s. Even when he struggled with all his strength, the leopard easily kept him in her grip. The feeling of powerlessness was inspiring some kind of primal fear within Simba. Eventually, she pinned him to the ground, leaving his forepaws free to bat at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cYou\u2019re stronger than you know, mtoto. After all, you have your father\u2019s blood,\u201d</span></b> Yewande insisted. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cCome on! Don\u2019t be a coward! Hit me with all you've got!\u201d</span></b> Yewande held her head there, obviously offering the cub a chance to strike back and show his strength. However, instead, Simba reached up and bit deeply into her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAUGH!\u201d</span></b> Her roar echoed throughout the coliseum, causing even the audience to cringe in shock. In her pain, she dropped the cub, and Simba darted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cdorange\">\u201cHey! Biting is forbidden!\u201d</span> The announcer jumped up in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Gamba. I\u2019ve got this,\u201d</span></b> Yewande yelled, before turning to nurse her wound. He had bit her right through the muscle, and the hole in her shoulder was now bleeding profusely. It ached every single time she moved her forearm. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cUgh\u2026 I try to be nice, and this is how you react? You are really starting to piss me off.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba began pulling himself up the rope again, desperate to climb out of the arena before the leopard could retaliate. It wasn\u2019t until he was halfway up the wall that he noticed her leaping at him-- and by then, it was already too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Before he knew it, the massive leopard was pinning him to the ground. He whimpered as she leered over him, pondering what she would do next...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Living in the pride, Simba never thought too much about the morality of the lions devouring their own subjects. \u2018The circle of life\u2019, is how they justified it, and Simba was satisfied with this. The little lion never questioned the circle of life while he was on top of the food chain\u2026 but now, staring down the leopard\u2019s dark, seemingly endless throat, Simba finally realized what it was like to be prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her anger, Yewande had wrapped her maw easily around the cub\u2019s head, pressing his snout against the back of her throat. He squeezed his eyes shut as his head was marinated in saliva, and his nostrils were assaulted by the stench of her meaty breath. The leopard pulled forward in predatory dedication, and the lion cub realized that there was no talking his way out of this one. The once-great prince had been reduced to prey in some backwoods colosseum, and there was nothing he could do about it. This was the end. He cringed, preparing for the leopard to bite into his neck and finish him off\u2026 but instead, she took one big gulp, and pulled his snout deeper into her throat. She was swallowing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leopardess\u2019 throat muscles clamped down on his snout, undulating rhythmically around him on both sides as they pulled him deeper and deeper inside of the righteous predator. Yewande closed her eyes, letting the lion\u2019s body rest on her tongue as she savored his flavor. Meanwhile, Simba was struggling harder than ever, terrified by the fate that was about to befall him. There had been a few lionesses in his pride that took great joy in swallowing smaller animals whole, a habit which always disturbed the lion cub. What was going to happen to him? Was he going to suffocate? Be masticated by her powerful muscles? Or worse\u2026 digested alive?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, Yewande had no intention of hurting the cub. But to have a prince be so weak and cowardly is disgraceful, so the little cub needed a harsh lesson indeed. Once the lion\u2019s body was almost completely within her mouth, she lifted her head up, displaying her helpless prey to the crowd, who roared in applause. Apathetic to the fate of the cub, they were just happy to see the arrogant little prince get put in his place. After satisfying the crowd, Yewande began gulping Simba down in earnest, trying to cram the immobile lion down her throat before she choked. Simba\u2019s strength drained, he could barely move a muscle as her powerful throat muscles clamped tightly around him, pulling him down into her belly with terrifying speed. As his entire upper body entered her throat, and the leopardess closed her lips around his hind paws, the only trace of his existence was an incredible bulge in the leopardess\u2019 neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd watched in rapt attention as the bulge slowly travelled down her neck, as the lion inside was sealed off from the outside world, damned to the dark, wet, smelly tomb of her stomach. Simba could hardly even think at this point; the lion simply focused on trying to breath, letting the leopardess have complete control over his fate. Yewande flashed the crowd a big, smug smile as the bulge in her throat disappears into her muscular body. Just as he thought he was about to run out of breath, Simba\u2019s head was painfully squeezed into a different, slightly roomier sac.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the cub was curled up inside the much larger leopardess\u2019 belly, which expanded around him, giving him a bit of room to wriggle around. It smelled awful in here, and he was made dizzy by the moisture and head, feeling like her belly was a tiny, cramped sauna. A strange liquid filled the bottom third of her stomach, nipping at his fur slightly. Idly, he thinks to himself that he should be freaking out right now, but at this point he was too exhausted and light-headed to even care. This was just his fate now. It was far too late to do anything about it. All he wanted to do was lay back and let the warmth of the leopardess\u2019 swinging belly swaddle him to sleep\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile, the leopardess was showing off her bulging belly to the cheering crowd while Pumba and Timon looked on in horror. The lion cub was so small, the leopardess just looked moderately pregnant; still, her belly swayed back and forth enough while she walked to satisfy the crowd. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cDelicious!\u201d</b></span> Yewande finally judged, giving the audience a perfect view of her stomach as it bulges and undulates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\"><b>\u201cI think we have our winner!\u201d</b></span> The announcer said, satisfied with the outcome. Yewande strutted confidently off the colosseum grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, backstage, as Yewande was wrapping at and getting ready to return home, Timon and Pumba appealed to the leopardess to release Simba unharmed. He is a prince, after all -- too valuable to be digested, they claim. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI shall not hurt him,\u201d</b></span> Yewande replied, stoically, not bothering to even look in their direction. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cBut I\u2019m not giving him back, either. Not until I\u2019m done with him.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen pressed for an explanation, she turned to them angrily. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHe\u2019s an heir to the throne, is he not? And yet, it\u2019s obvious you haven\u2019t been properly training him,\u201d</b></span> Yewande judged them harshly. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWeak, cowardly, selfish. You\u2019ve spoiled him. He must be taught what it takes to be a king.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing it was futile, the two of them gave up and fleed, lest they be devoured themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his surprise, Simba woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe never thought he\u2019d wake up again. Never on the outside world, at least. He looked at himself to make sure he was still there, and found no evidence of his stint in the leopardess\u2019 belly. His fur was pristine, he smelled freshly bathed, he felt well-rested; for a moment, Simba thinks the events at the colosseum had just been some terrible dream\u2026 until he realized that his surroundings were entirely unfamiliar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in some kind of overgrown cave, deep in the jungle. It looked like somebody\u2019s den. Simba searched all over, but Timon and Pumba were nowhere to be seen. He was alone here. What happened, he wondered?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe flinched when he heard a heavy paw colliding with the cave\u2019s floor. He reared back in horror as he saw Yewande, the massive leopardess, standing before him once again. She looked like she had been out to collect grub and berries, and ignored the cub as she put her findings away. Eventually, Simba worked up the courage to say something. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cW-why am I here?\u201d</span> he asked, in as brave a voice as he could muster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYewande was silent for a few moments, before responding. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAre you unfamiliar with the colosseum\u2019s rules?\u201d</b></span> she replied. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cI won, so now I get to do anything I want with you.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba continued, more confidently, <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cTrain you,\u201d</b></span> Yewande responded simply. Simba stared at her for a while, confused. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cAs the prince of the pride, you\u2019ve been pampered. You don\u2019t understand the plight of your own subjects. If you ever want to reign, you must learn what it\u2019s like to struggle to survive.\u201d</b></span> Yewande walked up to him, sitting down in front of him in the cave.  <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWith dedication, you will become stronger, faster, braver,\u201d</b></span> the leopardess explained, while  <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cEventually, you and I will have a rematch in the colosseum. If you win this time, you\u2019ll be free to go. If I win again, though...\u201d</b></span> Yewande chose not to finish that sentence, though Simba could assume she wouldn\u2019t have mercy on him next time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cI\u2019m a lion. I don\u2019t need any training,\u201d</span> Simba insisted, a little offended by the notion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh? Care to prove it, then?\u201d</b></span> Yewande asked, looming over him and licking her lips. Simba cowered away. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cThought so. We\u2019ll start training after breakfast.\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them sat and ate grubs for a while, in completely silence. Simba glanced at Yewande, trying to understand her intentions, but her expression was unreadable. She was just\u2026 stoic. As if this happens everyday. Simba didn\u2019t know whether to be outraged by all this, or terrified. Clearly, his status as a lion won\u2019t carry him very far here. He just had to bide his time until he could escape this crazy old hag\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Yewande would be training Simba\u2019s...</font></span></div></div>",

Simba\u2019s just been eating bugs and lounging around with Timon and Pumba for the past months, so he\u2019s gotten pretty out of shape. Thus, even Yewande\u2019s simple instruction -- climbing a small saugage tree -- proved almost impossible for the lion. Simba felt humiliated as he fell off again and again, unable to support his own weight. Within only a few minutes, the lion was too exhausted to continue, slumping to the ground. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cPathetic,\u201d</b></span> Yewande rolled her eyes, seeing the lion cub giving up so easily. Already angry, the insult made Simba\u2019s temperature reach the boiling point, and he quickly lost his temper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"corange\">\u201cYour\u2026 stupid regimen isn\u2019t working, lady!\u201d</span> Simba stood up and yelled, finally laying down the law (or so he thought).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</b></span> Yewande smirked, amused by Simba\u2019s frustration. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cLet\u2019s try something else, then.\u201d</b></span> Simba rolled her eyes, waiting to see what new, stupid \u2018exercise\u2019 routine Yewande came up with\u2026 only to be stunned when he looked back to see the leopardess\u2019 huge rear descending upon him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYewande didn\u2019t even sit down on Simba with her full weight, but it was still enough to press the lion painfully against the ground. Simba\u2019s face was pressed uncomfortably against the dirt as her large, plush rump pressed against his back.Eventually, Simba lifted her up enough to issue a complaint.  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cWhat the hell...\u201d</span> He managed to yell, his frustration and exhaustion evident in his voice. For the boastful prince, being used as a glorified chair was even more humiliating than being swallowed whole had been.  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cG\u2026 get off me!\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYewande giggled. The little lion was so small, only his tail and snout managed to avoid being covered by her rear end. He clearly wasn\u2019t in the position to be making demands. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cJust stand up and push me off,\u201d</b></span> Yewande instructed.<span class=\"ctan\"><b> \u201cI\u2019m only sixty pounds. You are a lion, aren\u2019t you? Aren\u2019t you supposed to be strong?\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he wasn\u2019t going to be able to talk his way out of this one, Simba relented, pressing his paws firmly against the ground and pushing upwards with all his strength. Even though the leopardess\u2019 rump was almost big enough to cover his entire body, his innate strength as a lion did allow him to raise her to raise up a little bit.  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cUrgh\u2026\u201d</span> he groaned, putting more effort into this than he had put into anything for the past couple years. Yewande raised a brow, a little big impressed by the tiny feline\u2019s power. Perhaps he really was stronger than she thought he was. Of course, Yewande was going just easy on him right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Simba was about to escape from under her rump, Yewande finally sat down with her full weight. Simba was smashed against the ground yet again, the leopardess\u2019 rear pressing down on him almost harder than he could stand. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cAgh!\u201d</span> he screamed, agonized, as the leopardess so easily overpowered him. Luckily, her rump was surprisingly plump and soft for such a muscular leopardess, which made the experience at least bearable, if no less humiliating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cWhoops!\u201d</b></span> Yewande giggled, shifting back and forth on her \u2018seat\u2019. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cSorry! Just getting comfortable\u2026\u201d</span></b> Simba futilely tried to push her upwards once again, just to get some room to breathe; unfortunately for him, this time, she wasn\u2019t going to allow it. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cIs that all you\u2019ve got?\u201d</b></span> Yewande laughed, entertained by the futile squirming of the lion under her rear. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cYou can\u2019t even budge me an inch. What a weak king you\u2019d be! If somebody wanted to steal your throne, all they\u2019d have to do is sit on you!\u201d</b></span> She cackled wildly at the thought. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cCareful down there. Don\u2019t break anything!\u201d</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, just as Simba was running low on air, Yewande decided to relent on this particular bit of \u201ctraining\u201d. She stood up, chuckling as the lion immediately started gasping down the fresh air. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cAww. Was that routine a little too advanced for you?\u201d</span></b> she said, as Simba rolled over onto his back, facing his captor. <b><span class=\"ctan\">\u201cWell, just admit that I know what I\u2019m talking about, and we can get back to our scheduled training.\u201d</span></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking over what had just happened to him, instead of becoming scared, Simba just got angrier. This leopard was toying with him. None of what she did made any sense. <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 crazy\u2026\u201d</span>  he said between breaths.  <span class=\"corange\">\u201cYou don\u2019t know\u2026 anything.\u201d</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYewande was a bit taken aback. She never expected him to be THIS stubborn. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cHm. I keep trying to extend an olive branch, little lion, but your pride overcomes your common sense,\u201d</b></span> she shrugged. <span class=\"ctan\"><b>\u201cOh well! Nothing a good humbling can\u2019t fix.\u201d</b></span> Simba looks on, horrified, as she brings her full weight down upon him again; this time vertically, so his body was partially submerged between her soft cheeks. Now he was wracked with not only pain, but also tortured by the smell, as his snout was lodged in the leopardess\u2019 crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis struggles before were nothing compared to his desperate struggles now. Yewande was normally pretty clean and refined, but with his nose just a hair\u2019s breadth away from her tail hole, the smell was about as foul as you\u2019d expect. Even living with Pumba, Simba had never experienced something that so disgusted him. However, this time, Yewande wasn\u2019t playing around; this was a punishment, not a test. Thus, Simba would be under there for quite a long time\u2026</font></span></div></div>",

If only mufasa had accepted his mistake, instead of acting as if our pet and I were the ones to blame... Anyway...\" He say as he pulls his nephew up towards his face. \"As I'm familiar with this place and it's rule, I know that as long as I do not kill or fatally injure you, like a broken arm and the like, I can do whatever I desire with you... Now What to do... Oh, i know. How about a proper hug to your dear uncle scar\"<br>\r\nWith that he start hoisting simba's  tiny arms around his own neck making it look like simba is returning the embrace. \"Good luck, simba\" and starts pouring on the pressure.<br>\r\nSimba clings onto scars neck as he starts screaming in pain, making it seem like a warm embrace between family instead of a death-grip.<br>\r\n\"Aw, i knew you loved me. Don't worry dear, I love you too\" Scar says teasingly. Deciding to give simba some pleasure to go with the pain the dark lion leans in, catching simba's mouth with his own in a searing kiss.<br>\r\nSimba, still screaming from the intense pain to his back, can't close his mouth, and end up receiving a mouthful of lion tounge. Feeling the alien appendage in his mouth, simba panics, trying everything he can to get free, but scars superior strength makes that impossible. The little cub has no choice but to let scar violate his mouth...<br>\r\nBetween scars kiss and the fierce hug, it doesn't take long for simba's air sully to run out.<br>\r\nToo weak to struggle and too scared to go on, simba falls limp in his uncle's arm, a sole tear running down his chin.<br>\r\n\"There, there. Did your big, bad uncle hug you too hard? Don't worry though, uncle scar will make all the nasty pain go away\" with that scar put simba on his knee. Using his right hand, he start groping and stroking the poor cup into full mast, kissing and sweet talking to Simba all the way. Being a cub means you don't have control over your body, so it doesn't take long before simba gums, squirting his weak load on scars big paws.<br>\r\n\"Good boy, such a good boy.\" Scar coos as he licks the seed off his hand sensually.<br>\r\n\"Well, I gave you some well-earned release, and now it's my turn\"<br>\r\nSimba knows what's coming, but is simply too tired too fight as scar pulls down his wrestling trunk, releasing the beast within. Before his uncle can even issue an command, the young cub wraps his arms around the large 10 inch cock and start rubbing, first slowly, then with more speed as time passes.<br>\r\n\"Hmm,  that's it, such a sweet boy. But you know, you would do an even better job if you used your mouth...\" Scar mutters, confident that the brash little boy he knew would protest at that, but simba, still too tired and scared to even talk straight simply opens his mouth and takes as much of the head as possible, greatly surprising the larger beast.<br>\r\n\"Oh dear, it seems my future king has a naughty side. Now, don't try to swallow the whole thing. Instead think of it as a lollipop, lick and duck the whole thing from base to tip\" scar instructs, moaning as his sweet little future pet/mate pleases him.<br>\r\nAfter a long time the great lion's breath becomes ragge and he starts thrusting into simba's mouth, making the smaller cat cough and choke. Of course simbaztries to pull away, but scar, not accepting that, hold his head in place until...<br>\r\nROAR<br>\r\nWith a mighty roar, scar climaxes into the young prince's mouth, filling it with streams of thick, white seeds.<br>\r\nThe amount is too much for the cub, and despite instinctively trying to swallow it in an attempt not to choke mire than he already is, ends up almost drowning in the salty cream-like substance.<br>\r\nAfter what seems like forever scar finally let the cub go as he falls back, using the corner rope to keep himself up.<br>\r\n\"*inhale*that was nothing short of amazing, my dear nephew. You will without a dud make a fine mate one day... Simba?... Oh.\" scar sees that simba has simply passed out, hid fur matte with his uncle's essence...<br>\r\nNow Scar is at a crossroad: simba has yet too submit, meaning he can't claim him as his mate/pet.<br>\r\nBut he has barely gotten started, so...<br>\r\nShould he make this a proper match, dominating the little one until simba submits properly to him, or<br>\r\nCall someone to join him on stage for a little 2 on 1?</span></div></div>",

The smaller lion was forced to feel jet after jet of Scar's creamy filling pump into his ass, and the bizarre sensation caused him to wince and lock up beneath the amorous feline.  Scar's toothy grin once again spread over his face as he felt his little mate's hole tighten around his thick cock.  The darker lion, leaned over his precious Simba and sloooowly ran his tongue up the cub's ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, so tight~\"  he teased.  \"Could it be that you don't want me leaving so soon?\"  Scar chucked his deep laugh right into Simba's ear, making his fur stand on end.  \"Well don't worry my precious mate.  We'll be spending a LOT of time together from now on.\"  All around the two of them the audience was laughing their heads off, but Simba was way more worried about what his Uncle Scar had in mind than he was humiliated.  When the big cat was finally sure that he had emptied the last of his nasty spooge in his beloved nephew's ass he finally pulled out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Simba was regaining his bearings, Scar decided it was about time he put on the last show for the audience.  \"You know Kitten...\"  He boomed so that all could hear.  \"...You're not the only one who likes things stuffed up their rump.  It must run in the family!\"  The naughty adult reached a paw over his lovely little pet and clamped over the scruff of his neck, before lifting him to his face so that their noses were touching.  \"But I like mine a little... squirmier~\"  Scar laughed as he snuck in a nose nuzzle on the little boy.  Suddenly, Simba found himself being swung back around to the old lion's smelly ass.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no!  Not again!\"  Poor little Simba tried his very best to escape his kinky uncle's grasp, but his struggles were cut short as a noxious gust of wind blew out from between the cheeks.  \"Oh, don't act like you don't enjoy snorting your uncle's love poots~\"  Scar laughed, before quickly forcing the kid's face right between his disgusting ass cheeks.  Simba screamed as the stink increased tenfold, but his voice was swallowed up by the sheer mass of his uncle's smelly butt!  It was so big and so deep that by the time the cub's nose was forced up against that raunchy hole only his tail and feet were outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll around the arena animals were laughing their lungs out at the embarrassment that the little prince had to endure from his own uncle.  Scar, however, had no time to bask in his victory.  He quickly turned to the ref and said, \"He won't be going anywhere anytime soon...\"  The lion spanked his ass, causing Simba to struggle harder.  \"...So I'll be taking him now.\"  The referee simply nodded to the veteran and washed him walk out of the ring with his mate/ass prisoner in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his way out, Scar forced out another filthy stinker right into his precious mate's nose.  \"Now wasn't that just the best?  If you thought that was fun, you're gonna love it...\"</span></div></div>",

Good thing I got to you first, because if anyone else had I would've torn them to bits. Only i get to claim you, my dear.<br>\r\nOps, i guess you're curious about what I mean by claiming; you see, when you win against someone in the arena you have the option of claiming them as servants or pets for a whole year, provided, of course, that you can afford to feed and care for them, but I have other plans for you. You see, I love you\".<br>\r\nWith that one sentence, the world stopped for the little lion. At first simba wants to call his large uncle's lie, but one look in scars eyes is enough to tell him the black beast speaks the truth, which makes him even more uncertain how to proceed.<br>\r\n\" I have watched you since the first day, when I thought you were nothing more than a nuisance keeping me from ruling your father's land, but ad you grew up, my feelings for you changed from disgust to love. When i found out you were gonna fight in the arena I finally saw my chance. Now according to arena rules, should you claim someone as your pet/servant or other things, you get 1 year to convince them to stay with you, otherwise they're free. 1 year to make you fall for me, let's see if I can make it happen tomorrow because today you belong to me\". With that scar plants a big kiss on simba, he's large tounge easily prying his mouth open.<br>\r\nAt first simba is disgusted by the kiss and fight like a madman to get out, but scar has a firm grip and the only thing simba accomplishes is tiring himself out, leaving the little cat at the mercy of scar's kiss, which, to his surprise, he's starting to enjoy.<br>\r\n\"You like that, dear? Then you will love this\".<br>\r\nScar turns simba around and begin exploring his body, large hands moving with inhuman grace, squeezing, stroking rubbing the cubs body, getting a reaction with each touch.<br>\r\nDeciding he has teased his nephew and future husband enough, scar takes the tired cub to bed were he starts kneading his ass like a piece of dough.<br>\r\n\"N-no, please. Not that\". Simba weakly begs, but he knows it's no point. Scar wants him, and what scar wants, he gets.<br>\r\n\"Now just relax, my love. This feel feel like heaven in no time\". Scar mutters gently into the twinks ear before gently, but firmly pushing himself into simba's tail hole. <br>\r\nSimba, still not being used to such large cock, starts screaming in pain at first, but as the larger cat begin breeding him his cries of pain becomes moans of pleasure and at a point, he even starts humping scars large member, making scar moan in satisfaction.<br>\r\n\"That's it, my sweet cub. Now you see, I may be a bit cruel in the ring, but outside I will always treat you like gold\".<br>\r\nIt doesn't ake to long for them both to hit climax, but the night is young and so they go nuts, trying almost every position possible, grinding their bodies together in a wild dance of passion and lust.<br>\r\nBut all things must come to an end, and after the ...th round simba promptly faints in scar's arms, exhausted, bur satisfied.<br>\r\nScar, while still up for more, brings the twink to bed pulling the cover over both himself and his mate as sleep claims them both.<br>\r\nTimeskip:<br>\r\nAs the year goes by, scar proves himself as a lover and mate time and time again, providing for him, spoiling simba with affection while teasing and training him, turning the scrawny naive brat into one hot lion stud, and of course, keeping their love-life interesting, with plenty of chances for scar to dominate/humiliate/make love with simba both in and out of the bedroom and arena, often inviting friends and fellow arena fighters for some added spice.<br>\r\nEven after the 1 year time limit passes simba decides to stay with scar, and short while after, the two truly do start dating...<br>\r\nTogether they returned to pride rock and simba was crowned king. Surprising everyone, the fresh king announced scar as his mate and the two of them actually got married during the coronation ceremony, much to the prides shock.<br>\r\nAs for timon and pumbaa...<br>\r\nDon't worry, simba still consider them great friends, but they had to face both simba and scar in the arena a punishment for putting simba in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe End... almost.</span></div></div>",

He thought he would face someone as small as he is, not a Greece God in a lions body.<br>\r\nThe more he thought about it, the more wrried he got, but before he started to panic he felt two strong arms on his shoulders and looked up straight into lion-o's gentle eye.<br>\r\n\"Hey, relax. Were just here to have fun. No need to panic, OK\"? The larger lion says.<br>\r\nHis warm voice seems to work as simba easily calms down.<br>\r\n\"That's it.;now, why don't you get the first move\"?<br>\r\nSimba reacted the moment liono gave him the chance, aiming a kick at the stomach, only to bounce back after hitting liono's strong abs.<br>\r\nFollowing that up with a few punches to the lion's midsection only to wear himself our and hurt his paws.<br>\r\nFinally the young prince wraps both his hands around the larger cats waist, trying to lift it, but liono is simply too heavy...<br>\r\nSpeaking of the king, seems that liono finally decided to make a move, easily catching simba in a standing head scissor squeezing the poor cub's skull to its limits.<br>\r\n\"Sorry buddy, but I did give you a chance. Now it's my turn\". Liono says as he reaches for simba's legs, pulling them towards himself to put pressure on the cubs's back.<br>\r\nScreams echoes through the arena as simba's back is stretched to its limit, small tears forming in the cubs eyes before liono releases him making him fall flat on the ground.<br>\r\n\"How's that for a good stretch? Felt pretty good, didn't it\"? The majestic beast asks the cub, receiving no answer.<br>\r\nAs simba tries to pull himself up from the arena floor he feels a familiar par of arms lifting him up by the neck, choking him I'm the process as he was carried towards one of the corners.<br>\r\nWith liono's firm grip the cub is unable to defend himself as he's pinned against the ringpost, the larger cat grinding his larger body against him.<br>\r\n\"You doing ok\"? The royal beast asks. \"I always try to make my smaller opponents enjoy themselves even when I'm dominating them so don't you worry about getting hurt too much... Having said that, I think it's time for a little fun. Ever rideen a merry go around\"?<br>\r\nBofore simba can reply a sudden pull throws him into the ground, his legs getting caught by liono before they even touch the ground.<br>\r\nWith a firm grip on both legs, the big lion starts spinning around, with simba as an unhappy attachment.<br>\r\n\"All around the world he goes, where he stops, nobody knows\" liono sings merrily before letting go, watching as the poor jobber flies over the stage onto the floor below.<br>\r\nWith no ring out rules, simba can't lose by lying down, not that that's a problem as the large cat follows him out of the ring, gracefully landing behind him.<br>\r\nFlipping the cub onto his back, liono kneels over him and begins flexing, drawing catcalls and whistling from the crowd.<br>\r\n\"You know, your actually pretty sturdy. Most people your size tries to run after the first few bruises, but you're actually sticking around. Not bad\".<br>\r\nWith those words, liono lifts up his little jobber again, this time in a one arm choke hold pressing the squirming cub against his chest.<br>\r\n\"Listen up everyone. How many of you think my little friend here is cute\"?<br>\r\nA wave of approval follows liono's question, scaring the little cat and amusing the larger one.<br>\r\n\"Now, how many of you would like to get a good feel of him\"?<br>\r\nThis time the crowd loses their collective minds, many fans almost jumping the fence to get to him.<br>\r\nLiono starts parading with the young lion, letting the fans get a good feel of both himself and his tiny adversary, much to he latter's embarrassment. <br>\r\nWith all four corners satisfied the two cats head back towards the ring.<br>\r\nSimba hasn't made a sound in a while, worrying the king, but as the larger beast looks down to check he is met with a fist to the head catching him off guard and letting simba free.<br>\r\nUsing the opportunity, the cub runs into liono as hard as he can bringing them both slamming down on the mat.<br>\r\nAnd he's not done yet: punches, claws anything he can use, he uses to hopefully take the arrogant cat down..<br>\r\nBut liono simply lies there smiling, enjoying the hits as they're nothing more than love taps for him.<br>\r\nAfter a while he figures enough is enough and grabbing hold of the cubs head, forces simba into his armpit.<br>\r\n\"Sh~, that's it... Take deep breaths\". He whispers to the little cub squirming in his pit.<br>\r\nShifting his body a bit, liono pins simba underneath his arm, letting him use his other arm to play with the cubs crotch,<br>\r\nSqueezing, fondling, playing with the balls and cock until the poor lion is at full mast.<br>\r\nSimba has stopped squirming, simply given up and letting liono play with him as much as he likes, which is what the large cat was hoping for. Now the fun can really begin.</span></div></div>",

Listen, I know you're tired, but I still want to play more so you'll have to endure a bit more, ok\"?<br>\r\nBefore simba can argue liono pushes himself up only to fall back down onto the cub, receiving a scream as the cub is flattened beneath him.<br>\r\nRepeating the process a few more times for good measure he reduced the cub to a groaning heap of bruised fur on the ring floor.<br>\r\nDeciding the body had gone through enough, the king of thundera sets his sight on the legs, putting them in an armlock. This of course made the poor jobber cub scream out as he was flailing around hanging by his legs...<br>\r\nUntil he was flipped around in a makeshift Boston crab hold, liono posing above him.<br>\r\n\"Ah~, nothing like a good flex and stretch with a cute kitten, and don't you worry, we're gonna get a good stretch before the fun's over... Now, let's see those arms\".<br>\r\nIgnoring simba's weak protests the majestic beast released the cub from his grip making him fall flat on his face. Getting a firm grip on his arm, liono put simba in a sitting position, and using his knee to keep the cub in place, started moving his arms as if he was rowing a boat, each pull straining simba's arms painfully and hurting his back.<br>\r\nLoud groans of pain escaped simba's mouth as his arms felt like they were bring pulled from their socket, the light humming coming from liono not helping.<br>\r\nAfter a while of almost tearing off simba's arms liono aimed towards his next target: simba's ass.<br>\r\nFlipping the cub onto one knee, he started kneading the buttcheeks getting them nice and sensitive for the incoming spanking.<br>\r\n\"Please, don't do it sir\". The smaller cat begs, fearing the painful beating he's about to get.<br>\r\nBut the plead falls on deaf ears as the muscular male raises his hand bringing it down with all the speed he can muster, the resulting slap echoing through the arena along with scream of the lion cub.<br>\r\n\"That's one only 49 left\". The king comments, his words sending shivers of terror down simba's back.<br>\r\nAnd so the smacking continues, each hit bringing out a scream, each hit marking the butt. <br>\r\nBy the time everything is over simba is reduced to a crying mess, his rear as red as liono's hair.<br>\r\n\"Sh, there there, it's almost over. Just a little more. Good boy\".<br>\r\nA large palm rubs over the bruised areas on the prince's ass, as if to comfort him, but simba knows better and before long a finger penetrates his asshole, causing him to wimper.<br>\r\nOne finger became two, then three, poking and prodding the cub's butthole preparing him for the royal scepter.<br>\r\n\"You know simba, I'm surprised you decided to try fighting here as small as you are, whit all the brutal heartless fighters here, nevertheless you entered and as the winner of this round I've decided to take you as my mate, or boyfriend if you prefer. Don't worry though, this is a once in a blue moon kinda thing, so don't think I'll treat you this bad every day\".<br>\r\nThe cub almost shout at that proclamation, but ended up moaning as the king removed his fingers from his ass, replacing them with a dildo. <br>\r\nThe great king puts liono in a sitting position. With his arms and legs too injured to move simba can only sit still as the larger feline stood up and began rubbing his crotch into the cub's face.<br>\r\nAs for the poor lion cub in question? He was forced to endure having his face smothered by a cock and balls almost the size of his face, but strangely enough he enjoys it, the strong musky smell, the feel of being completely controlled by only words and strength alone, knowing his opponent would keep him safe should he faint...<br>\r\n\"This feels pretty good. You doing ok dow...What the\"?<br>\r\nLiono's words got caught in his throat as something warm and wet wrapped itself around the fabric holding his cock. <br>\r\nLooking down he saw that simba had wrapped his mouth around the cock part of his trunks and was sucking it gently, like a baby sucking his thumb.<br>\r\nSmiling gently at his new charge, the regal lion gently pushed the cub away from his cock before shredding the restraining fabric to pieces, finally pushing simba's head back to work, whispering sweet nothings as he fucked the cub's mouth.<br>\r\nThrusting and pounding his future mate's mouth liono was bringing himself closet and closer to climax, but he wasn't satisfied. He wanted to claim the cub properly by breeding him on the mat for all to see.<br>\r\nLifting simba up and into a standing embrace, the large cat took hold of one of the cub's buttcheeks and, using it to adjust him, placed simba right above his throbing cock, the tip barely touching the hole drawing wimpers from the younger feline.<br>\r\n\"Sh~, it's OK, you're in good hands, don't cry\".<br>\r\nLiono comforts simba until he stops crying. Taking the end of simba's sobbing as a signal, the Lord of thundera <br>\r\nPenetrates the tight ass, loosened by the dildo and his own handwork.<br>\r\nAt first he goes slow, giving simba time to adjust as he whispers words of encouragement and comfort. Listening as groans of pain becomes moans of pleasure.<br>\r\nOnce they're both used to the pace liono sped up the humping to the point his hips became a blur and simba's moan got soo loud they echoed throughout the arena as the two beasts kept mating in the middle of the stage.<br>\r\nBodies covered with sweat, flesh pounding flesh, all ending in a climax as both lions roared out as they released their essence, liono into simba and simba onto the floor.<br>\r\nThe fun didn't stop there. Liono simply pinned simba down in a missionary position before ramming into him again, the cub clinging onto him for dear life as his large cock tore simba a new asshole.<br>\r\nAfter the 4th round liono finally pulled out of simba who had been out cold halfway through the last round.<br>\r\nThe cub was under his care now as he was the winner so liono picked up the little prince and headed for the shower, a smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce simba woke up he and liono started talking about what to do next.<br>\r\nLiono had learned about simba's situation while the cub was catching z's and to say he was angry with scar would be an understatement.<br>\r\nConvincing simba to face the ghosts of his past, the two cats went back to pride rock...<br>\r\nLets just say scar got himself a major spanking...<br>\r\nAs for our two heroes, liono stayed at pride rock teaching simba how to rule his pride... and also to try and win his heart. Did he succeed? That's for you to decide.</span></div></div>",

As much as she loves wrapping her legs around them and squeezing them into submission, there's one thing she loves more: painting them in whatever shade of lipstick she's wearing.

And yet, he couldn't help but feel the need to necessitate some level of decency now that he wore these things. Almost like he'd be exposed or something if they were down. So, he made a mental note to himself to keep these up. Not that he figured he'd struggle to. He went under the vines and into the main ring, stretching his arms, legs, and neck. He shook his arms a little, still stretching them, and looked ahead to who he'd be facing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there, he saw an immediately intimidating sight. In came a tall herbivore, an ibex with nice, tan fur. She stood over twice his height! She wore a pair of black wrestling shorts and a black sports bra. They clung tightly against her curvaceous form, her backside coming terribly close to swallowing those shorts of her! She sauntered forwards, a confident smirk on her lips. And Simba could swear those hungry eyes of her peered deep into him, as if searching for a weakness already. She easily stepped over the upper vine and into the ring, licking her lips as she towered over the young prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to witness a battle of the predators!\" the vulture announced to the crowd. \"In this corner, we have the king of the jungle, devourer of animals, Simba! And in this corner, we have the herbivore with a backside that'll chew its prey until there's nothing left, Derah!\" The crowd cheered at the vulture's announcement, while Simba seemed confused. What did he mean \"a backside that'll chew until there's nothing left\"? How could a rump chew? However, he had a feeling deep in his gut that warned him he didn't want to find out. The ibex, meanwhile, flexed her muscles to the crowd, turning around so she could face all the attendees. And that gave Simba a good look at her plump backside, a backside that was probably big enough to hide him away if Derah so wished. Simba shook his head and wondered why he even considered that a possibility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter flexing enough, Derah stopped, and stepped forwards, standing over the lion and forcing him to look up at her past the valley between her breasts. It only served to remind Simba how tiny he was compared to this lady. Something he'd have to get over ASAP! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya, shorty!\" she said cheerfully. \"I heard of being thrown into the lion's den, but I've never heard of a lion being thrown into my den.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what do you mean?\" Simba asked. Derah seemed to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ain't it obvious, shorty? This ass is gonna eat you alive~\" she cooed. Simba stumbled back, shocked by that statement. Surely this was some kind of joke! Still, it didn't stop him from getting red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well guess I'll have to remind you what happens when you're in the lion's den!\" Simba spat back. The ibex, meanwhile, chuckled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait to see,\" she said un a humorous tone. With that, she marched to a corner of the ring, as did Simba, feeling riled up. He glared at the ibex, who seemed to nonchalantly lean against the corner of the ring. And soon, the vulture gave his signal...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Simba was now filled with pure rage. Who did she think she was speaking to him in such a disrespectful tone? She should be in awe at his very presence and treat him like nobility, yet there she stood casually leaning against a post on the far side of the ring with that stupid smirk on her face. He was the apex predator here, he ruled all the land the light touched and it was clear he was going to have to make her pay for her insolence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub's brow furrowed as he grit his teeth and charged Derah at full speed. <i>\"I am the almighty king of this land and I will make you regret ever disrespecting me!\"</i> Simba roared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah rolled her eyes away from the puny cub rushing her in a fit of fury and turned to look at the audience members. Some of them were holding back laughter at the hollow threat made by Simba and others waiting in anticipation for her to retaliate against the lion. The ibex knew there was nothing this brat could possible do to harm her. She was several times his height and had a better toned body  She turned back in time to see Simba close the distance between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young king bent down and threw himself at his prey. Simba had learned from his father when he was learning to hunt that when hunting large prey he should go for the legs and quickly immobilize them. And the cub planned to do just that. Simba quickly extended his claws and aimed right at her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've got you!\"</i> he yelled out, believing victory was at hand! Unfortunately for the cub, fate had other plans. When he was mere inches from his opponents legs they quickly spread apart, leaving him to fly face first into the tree post. A roaring laughter erupted from the spectators stands as the boasting lion fell onto his back in a daze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah took a couple steps forward before turning and staring down at the runt that laid before her. <i>\"Aw, did the almighty king get a boo-boo?\"</i> she asked mockingly, drawing more laughter from the spectators. She bent down and picked up her foe by his tail and dangled him upside down in front of her. Derah was well aware that male lions were naturally prideful and she intended to break that pride in little Simba. <i>\"Well don't you worry one bit 'my king'. I know just how to make you feel better.\"</i> She gently laying the runt down on the topmost vine that acted as the ring rope, making sure he was perfectly balanced and faced her direction. Once content, she spun herself around and aimed her directly butt at him. Slowly she began to back up towards the cub. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah had made a mental note of Simba's reaction to her \"gun show\" before the fight which made it clear to her how terrified the cub was  of the size difference between the two. She halted when her thighs pinned his legs which left her rump only mere inches above him. The ibex looked back to see the priceless look on Simba's face. His eyes virtually bulged out of their sockets and his jaw dropped in awe. There wasn't any doubt in Derah's mind that the cub was unaware of what was about to happen. She was going to sit on him. The only thought going through the lion's head was, 'When was she going to sit on me?' and that's exactly how the ibex liked it. She wanted him to stay anticipating while taking in every inch of her lovely buttocks to truly fathom how truly massive she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Y-you... you wouldn't dare...!\"</i> Simba managed to spout, but his opponent merely chuckled before responding, <i>\"You wanna bet?\"</i> which was soon followed by the moment of truth. A literal ton of ass fell on top of Simba leaving only his head free from being crushed between the two moon sized cheeks. The king squealed out in pain as he felt every molecule in his body practically flatten beneath the weight of Derah. The audience cheered the ibex on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah quietly moaned as she felt the cub's body wiggle as it being crushed beneath her impressive weight. Nothing pleased Derah more than making foes suffer with her bulbous ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba couldn't believe the weight of this woman. <u>\"Augh! I-I am your king! I- ahh! I command you to ge- ahh! get off of me!\"</u> Simba cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Hush up, boy.\"</i> the herbivore spat and began bouncing on top of the lion. Not tiny bounces, hefty twerking that dropped the vine rope a few feet down each time she put her weight down with the lion in between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king cried out in pain with each drop knocking the air out of him and the pressure intensifying. He also couldn't stand the crowd laughing at his predicament. They were his underlings! They should be basking in his presence not belittling him! \"Damn them all\", he thought as the extreme weight from Derah's gargantuan ass pressed down on him once more. Only this time his head was smudged inside her canyon sized crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah got up off the vine rope as she felt her little victim trapped between her enormous booty cheeks and walked to the center of the ring. She raised her hand up and shimmied it into her ass crevice and retrieved the lion boy from his prison by the scruff of his neck. A wave of gasps emitted from the audience, followed by roaring cheers as the now scruffy haired Simba dangled from her hand. She grinned ear to ear before dropping the cub onto the floor of the ring and onto his back. As the ibex woman looked over her fallen opponent, she noticed a protrusion in the middle of his shorts. Derah greedily licked her lips.</span></div></div>",

He gulped as Derah's monster of an ass casted a shadow over him. <i>\"STO-!\"</i> Simba tried to command before his face was encompassed by ibex ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ibex turned her attention to the fed up lion's crotch. <i>\"Looks like somebody's excited.\"</i> she spoke seductively. She reached forward and gently slid down the cub's shorts to free his rock hard erection of its confinement and reveal for all to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub blushed bright red as he felt the air rush over over his royal rod, completely exposed for any passerby to see. He wiggled his entrapped body around and flailed his legs about in a crude attempt to escape. From the outside of the cave walls he could hear the audience cheering and laughing at him yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah scoffed at the fruitless flailing and gently caressed the tip of the young king's cock with a finger. She felt his whole body tense up from beneath her at the very touch. This prompted her to wrap her hand around his cock and grip it. Now she felt his body shiver with pleasure and proceeded to start stroking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's growled as his shaft was stroked. He couldn't believe that his prey was now jerking him off. \"Crude bitch.\" he thought. She should be the one beneath him defeated not the other way around, but there was little he could do as he was pinned to the floor of the arena by a massive ass. A very curvy and plump ass... supported by those wide hips... great child bearing hips fit for a king. \"What a worthy queen she would make.\" He cogitated, while his own hips instinctively began to buck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Enjoying that ass are you your highness?\"</i> Derah uttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cub shook himself out of his high, he couldn't possibly be liking this. <i>\"It's fine to enjoy yourself dear king, nobody can blame you for getting off to such a <b>BIG BEAUTIFUL ASS!</b> </i> Derah shouted, wiggling her ass on top of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young king couldn't believe that a regal lion such as him was getting his royal juices milked by a simple ibex. \"She doesn't deserve to handle his goods! he fought with himself between moans when fading back into the high. \"Those goods are only meant for a worthy lioness to handle!\" Simba was trying desperately not to get back into the high, convincing himself he hated this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah sped up her pace, jerking him off furiously and feeling his moans vibrate the inner walls of her cheeks. <i>\"Come on king, give your subjects a show they won't forget!\"</i> she teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe immense pleasure traveling up and down his body made Simba feel more uneasy as his ideologies and instincts clashed with one another. His uptight ideologies resenting his predicament and seeing his opponent as obscene and unworthy, while his instincts were unable to make out the distinction of compatibility and continued to unconsciously make his hips to buck. At this point he felt himself getting close to the edge as his cock yearned for release before losing his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horned wrestler continued stroking the lion shaft at a quick pace, knowing he was about to blow. Both knowing he just needed one last push. With a hand still working the shaft, the ibex lifted her ass off her foe. The lion laid moaning and bucking as he was reminded of the world outside of Derah's crevice. She let go of his member and bent her knees. Using her naturally muscular legs, she launched herself straight up several feet into the air and into a freefall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba looked on in awe, welcoming the massive ass as it once again fell on top of him with the weight of an obese elephant. This was the final push he needed. A surge flowed through his body from his balls to his feet to his head as his cock climaxed and a wave of euphoria washed over him. The lion spurted his noble fluids in long white streams into the air and landing on the floor of the ring and on his fur. He screamed out in pleasure from within his confined space with each orgasm he had. After his tenth and final string of fluid dropped, his body collapsed from exhaustion. Luckily his opponent lifted herself off of him and allowed the sunlight to shine down on him. An eruption of laughter blared from the audience at the shameful display the lion put up. His eyes met Derah's who looked back at him with a smug smile. </span></div></div>",

He was panting, lauding in the fresh air, trying to recover from the herbivore's humiliating assault. And after that, she had the nerve to glare down at him smugly, exerting the kind of power a king or queen might wield. And all the weakened cub could do was glare up at her. It was the sole bit of fight he could exert while he was recovering from her milking technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, can you even stand?\" she asked with a smug grin, gently nudging Simba's side with her foot. He merely lied down, still weak. He growled at her prodding while the crowd seemed to giggle at him lying down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider yourself lucky!\" he declared. \"If I got the chance to get my hands on you, you'd be begging for mercy!\" Derah's grin seemed to widen at that, as if she were told a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! Well in that case, I better not let you put your hands on me!\" she said. And then, she squatted down and grabbed his tail. She hoisted it up, holding the weak boy up in the air, his legs kicking about weakly. \"In fact, maybe I oughta gobble you up right now~\" At that, the crowd began to cheer. Simba's fear began to rise as he started to hear the crowd chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gobble! Gobble! Gobble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd seemed interested in seeing her swallow that boy. But wait, wasn't eating forbidden in the ring? Unfortunately, his questions would be left unanswered for now as the ibex brought Simba around back, behind her back and towards her buttocks. He was left gazing at them, staring at the big buttocks that'd dominated him just a few moments ago... A few snickers near him made him aware of the sudden erection he began to sport, leading him to try and cross his legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch out, boy! It's lunch time!\" Derah said, beginning to swing Simba's tail, swinging the rest of him like a pendulum. Forwards and back, he was being brought closer and closer to her abyss-like butt. He began to kick around, to wriggle as she swung him forwards and back, his nose getting uncomfortably close to her crack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonono!\" Simba cried out as he was brought closer and closer. Once he was brought close, he felt his cheeks bury in between her cheeks, the fabric of her pants squeezing around his muzzle. His vision was rendered black with darkness, and his nose was filled with a latent, noxious scent. However, in his flailing he managed to grab onto the edges of her pants. He wriggled about and tried to pry himself away from them, which Derah could notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I usually like playing with my food, buuuut if it's gonna fight back~\" Derah said. She giggled, and began to flex her cheeks. Simba's eyes widened as he felt her cheeks move around him. Somehow, the buttocks seemed to lean forwards, wrap around a bit of him, and then pull him deeper before repeating the process. It was like her ass was slurping him between her cheeks! It didn't take long until his kicking legs were all that were left, Derah blushing as he felt the boy shake and squeal about within her. She gently stroked a buttock, rubbing it around his small form. \"Mmm, your struggling is just delicious~ Oh I can't be rid of this flavor already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba shook about more and more, but seemed curious. What did she mean she couldn't get rid of this flavor? What was she planning now? Derah walked over to a corner of the ring, and sat back against it, her sitting causing her buttocks to squeeze tighter around the young king. She looked over her shoulder at a few of the patrons watching her luscious backside. \"Be careful~ You're in the blast zone~\" They each leapt up, and then ran away from the corner. Derah sighed and shut her eyes, as if concentrating. And then, she grunted, beginning to lift a leg while Simba was left to question what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, he heard a familiar grumble. He remembered his time with Pumbaa, it wouldn't take a genius to know what was coming. He shook about, jostling her cheeks while screaming, practically demanding she doesn't-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, any noise he could've made were quickly drowned out by the trumpetous blow, a maelstrom of methane rushing around Simba, encasing him in a thick, stinky fog.  He screamed out and shook harder, his eyes watering from the horrific stench. If she hadn't squished her butt against the corner of the ring, the force of the blow might've actually launched him out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah sighed, a large smile dressing her face after that blow. She got off of the corner, and walked towards the center of the ring, the struggling between her cheeks significantly slower than before. She grinned and patted her butt, giving a few slight vibrations around the young lion's body...</span></div></div>",

She released a nasty burbly sounding explosion of sulfur from her backside with enough force to fling the brash cub from his confinement and into her waiting hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba coughed as he was promptly grabbed by the scruff of the neck and brought to meet his foes face. He simply dangled before her with a droopy face as she took a whiff of him. Her face crinkled up in absolute disgust at how potent her gas was. <i>\"Damn, that reeks.\"</i> the ibex uttered out, drawing laughter from the bystanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile his face didn't show it, the lion was absolutely livid. Never in his wildest dreams did he ever think someone could be so dishonorable towards him, and by a lowly prairie dweller no less. He wanted nothing more than to give her a good roughing up to remind her who was truly in charge. Derah seemed to have read the cub's mind due to the fact he was dropped back onto the ground. Simba pushed himself up onto his feet and gave his opponent the look of death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Still you try to fight me?\"</i> the ibex questioned. <i>\"I can see you still can't grasp the position you're in little guy, so I guess i'll have to prove my point to you.\" </i> Derah put her hands behind her back before speaking again. <i>\"How about this. If you can manage to make me move just <u>one</u> inch in one minute, i'll throw the match.\" </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young king glared up at his opponent, considering her offer. <i>\"No cheap tricks?\"</i> he asked. Derah shook her head, <i>\"No tricks, I won't even fight back.\"</i> Simba extended his claws, ready to pounce on the woman who embarrassed him so greatly. Simba let out a roar as loud as he was able and charged Derah. <i>\"This time you'll pay!\"</i> he shouted. Seeing red, the cub dug his claws into the ibex's left leg. His claws were incapable of piercing her tough skin as he began to push on her muscular leg with all the strength he could muster. The ibex remained unmoved. He grunted and panted and dug his heels into the ground, but still the ibex refused to moved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Forty seconds.\"</i> she spoke. Simba's muscles tensed up to their limits from the strain. Veins popped out of his head and his legs began to tremble from exertion. <i>\"I am the rightful king you bitch!\"</i> Simba screamed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Thirty seconds.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n Simba refused to give up on his challenge, he couldn't make himself look weak in front of the crowd. Kings are meant to be unstoppable killing machines! Simba let go of her leg and began to backpedal to the endpost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Twenty seconds.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned forward and darted for the ibex with the speed of a cheetah and the ferocity of a wild boar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <i>\"Ten seconds.\"</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe king extended his arms forward and made impact with the leg and exerted even more force as he grunted, trying to propel forward. But the ibex held. Simba took his claws off the ibex's leg, he couldn't move her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Time's up.\"</i> Derah addressed. Simba looked up to his foe with dread. He couldn't believe it, he had failed. But he was the king and kings are supposed to prevail! It seems he wasn't the great king he thought he was... The cub's lower lip quivered as his titanic adversary leaned down and picked him up. He was just a runt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile spread across Derah's face. <i>\"Now there's the face I want to see. The face of broken pride.\"</i> she said referring to the quivering runt. <i>\"And now look at you little king, whimpering like a baby in front of all these people!\"</i> Derah raised him up the crowd to see as a wave of laughter erupted from the gathering directed at Simba. He remained silent. <i>\"Now that you've finally grasped what a pathetic king you are, let me show you your true place.</i>\" Derah taunted, as she...</span></div></div>",

She pursed her lips and thrust her head forward to press Simba's lips against her own and brought him into a kiss. A deep moan emanated from the ibex's throat as her lips locked with her opponent's. But she wanted more. Derah opened her mouth slightly and forced her tongue between the cub's lips and into his mouth. She kept her eyes open halfway to watch as the cub winced and squirm in utter disgust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue wrapped around the king's own tongue and sloshed around with little resistance. He wanted to bite her tongue to halt her lewd act, but he knew there would be dire consequences had he followed up on it. It had been made very clear that she was in total control of this fight and he was only there as a plaything to entertain the masses surrounding the ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba wished he had stayed back at pride rock living under his uncle's totalitarian rule. Who knows, maybe Scar would have taken pity on him and kept the cub alive as an underling like the hyenas were, or kept locked away in a makeshift cell where he wouldn't pose any threat to Scar's authority. Either fate would have been infinitely better than being humiliated further by Derah. Unfortunately for Simba, he would never really know what would happen for it was only mere speculation to distract him from the grotesque tongue kiss he was receiving from a certain ibex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah extracted her tongue from the lion's mouth and pulled her lips away from his with a string of saliva stretching from each others mouths that was connected to their tongues. <i>\"My, my.\"</i> the ibex spoke flirtatiously. <i>\"While you're an atrocious fighter, you sure are one fantastic kisser.\"</i> The ibex saw a certain something stirring in the shorts the cub wore. She glanced down and lo and behold, his shaft had awakened at full mast yet again. She shot the cub a seductive look. <i>\"Standing at attention again are we? You must be awfully pent up.\"</i> The cub was placed onto the ground on his back. <i>\"Let me take care of that for you right now~\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba began to panic. What exactly did she plan to do to him this time? He prayed it didn't involve the use of her ass, for he had seen enough of it for one lifetime, but when he saw Derah begin to squat, he shut his eyes and braced himself for impact. But the impact never came. He slowly opened his eyes and saw Derah sitting down in front of his feet. She reached forward and grabbed hold of his waist band yet again and this time yanked them off completely. Now Simba was completely exposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe threw his shorts outside the ring, <i>\"Hello again my lewd little friend~ Ready for round two?\" </i> Derah teased, referring to the lion's throbbing dick. A bout of hilarity from the crowd followed Derah's remark. The ibex brought her legs forward and poised them above the once proud king. While it seemed she was about to pin the boy under her legs, she had a different goal in mind. Her meaty thighs crossed over one another and clamped around the lion's member. The cub screamed out in pleasure. <i>\"Does that feel good little guy~?\"</i> Derah taunted. <i>\"I hope it does, because this as close as you'll ever get to getting pussy~\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba covered his bright red face in an to attempt to hide himself from the laughing onlookers. It was so deplorable being nothing more than an object for this sick woman's enjoyment. So far he had been bounced on, sat on, jerked off, stuffed in a butt, farted on, swung around like a rag-doll, and now he was getting his cock squeezed by a pair of monstrous thighs! Most of the assaults he had endured wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't been for Derah's constant belittling of him. Her insults, teasing and fueling of the amusement of a bunch of prairie dwellers shattered the king's royal pride and buried the remains deep in the earth. He held back his tears the best he could, not wanting the ibex to gain anymore satisfaction from his vulnerability. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in his crippled state, Simba couldn't deny the euphoric feeling he was receiving from his cock being compressed by Derah's titanic thighs. Her soft muscular thighs concealed every inch of his member and sent waves of pleasure throughout his body. His toes and fingers clenched each time she shifted her legs. Each squeeze forcing a moan of pleasure out of his mouth. \"Oh heavens!~\" he thought as his mind raced with perverted thoughts. The high he had lost himself in during his previous milking session had returned, but this time he didn't resist. Simba gave up his mental struggle and gave himself into his pleasure. <i>\"Ohh, yes~\"</i> Simba moaned, as he took his hands away from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked mile long smile spread across Derah's face knowing the cub's mind was now both physically and mentally at her mercy. The audience was shocked at how easily broken the lion was, but none were more shocked than Derah herself. She had many small opponents that she had broken, both male and female, but she had never broken any of them as badly as this lion cub. Derah could practically feel the sexual aura emanating off of Simba. She watched as every muscle in his body tensed with each squeeze and rub he got from her thighs. His eyes were rolling into the back of his head and his mouth spread as wide open as it could. His loud moans nearly drowned out the giggling from the spectators and he squirmed wildly. It was a truly wondrous sight that words could not do justice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt the cub's cock release a hint of pre and decided to give his cock another hard squeeze to force a moan out of him, which he obliged. <i>\"I can feel you getting close Simba~\"</i> Derah uttered in a seductive tone. <i>\"Do you want mama to make you release?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba didn't hesitate to answer. <i>\"Y-yes...\"</i> he spoke softly. Derah chuckled at his weak response, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm sorry, I didn't quite hear you little guy.\"</i> She wiggled her thighs over his crotch. <i>\"Ye-AHH! Yes!\"</i> the cub spoke loudly, between moans. <i>\"Yes what?\"</i> the ibex woman teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba bit his lower lip as another wave of pleasure rushed up his spine, <i>\"Yes p-p-please!\"</i> he managed to spout out. But Derah was still unconvinced. <i>\"I don't know, you don't sound very enthusiastic to me.\"</i> she teased further. This time she loosened her grip on the cub's cock. <i>\"I guess i'll just have to make you wait.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe situation was pure agony for Simba. His cock burned with the urgency to climax, but the ibex wouldn't let him have his epic release. It felt like he was going to explode from sexual frustration. If he wanted release, he had to convince Derah how much he wanted it. Simba grit his teeth before shouting. <i>\"Yes Derah please! I want you to make me cum! I <u>need</u> to cum! I want nothing more than to cum all over your meaty thighs! Pleaaase Derah please!</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thankfully, Derah gave him exactly what he wanted.She squeezed her thighs with all the strength she could muster and compressed the begging cub's cock with all her might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's eyes shot wide open as he felt the immense surge flow through him again, even stronger than previously. He dug his claws and feet into the ground and shouted in pleasure as his royal shaft fired out a flood of white seed. Even from the tight compact space between Derah's legs his seed managed to fire up into the air like a geyser and coated Derah's thighs in his kingly fluids. The build up from inside the imprisonment even began to fill up the cramped space with the cub's semen and flow over the sides. A resounding applause erupted from the audience for the display of the century.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ibex was stunned at how much cum the little cub produced. Just how pent up was this runt? she wondered. She separated her legs and let a sea of Simba's cum wash over his small body. Derah looked down to the cub. There was just something about seeing her opponent on the verge of unconsciousness due to his sexual urges brought on by her actions that left her overjoyed. This was her doings and hers alone. No help of any kind, just her strength and cunning brought this cub so such a broken state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture referee flew over to Simba to check him out, making sure to avoid the big puddle of lion seed. He looked over the battered cub. In his entire career, never had he seen a fighter so badly beaten. He almost felt sorry for the cub, but he did choose to fight knowing what he was up against. \"Simba is unable to fight! Derah is the winner!\" he announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA round of cheers rang from the onlookers as they were contempt with a show they won't soon forget. After all it wasn't every day they got to see a lion get put in his place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Derah continued looking at the cum covered cub, she began to ponder what would be his fate.</span></div></div>",

But he may as well do the crowd pleaser: the move everyone would beg to see her do. So, she began by pulling the back of her shorts open. And then, she lifted Simba over it, before gently placing him in. His legs and arms were slid into the pant legs, before she released her grip, letting the waistband snap into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young lion squirmed lightly as he was tugged deep into the abyss between her cheeks. He kicked a little and tugged his arms either way. However, the waistband held him tightly. He was strapped so tightly to the wrestler's ass, he may as well be called underwear! Derah shook her cheeks a little, rubbing her buttocks around him and his erection. Meanwhile, Simba could hear the chortles and cheers of the crowd as they watched her ass slowly swallow him whole. It had a tight grip on him, and it seemed like only she would let him go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Derah wouldn't show such mercy. She shook her butt side to side, making sure he was nuzzled deep into her abyss. And once he was nice and deep... she began the noxious assault. Simba squirmed and squealed a little as his entire form was encased in stink, no shorts to block it. And unfortunately, he could feel her cheeks vibrations and the intense warmth of her assault, a bizarrely... pleasant feeling to his erection. Despite how horrifically humiliating this was, he could feel himself throb against her assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBe it his natural smallness or his broken pride, Simba came to one conclusion: even if he had the will to resist, he would never escape this grip. Derah had him locked in an iron grip, and he was just there for her to toy with. He was her little milkee. Another fart rang out, causing his body to shake about a little more, and causing pre to drip down. It seemed like the ibex didn't want to bother messing with him now. His pride was broken, leaving so little to play with. All Derah had right now was the chance to make him cum to the most humiliating stimulation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFart after fart after fart pelted the weakened lion, him kicking about as her butt shook up and down and belched at him. He felt the lull of unconsciousness tug at his being, threatening to finish him off in a few minutes. But the burning sensation between his legs was just as strong, as though his body were begging for release. Soon, Derah's butt shaking sped up to a full on twerk, shaking the cub up and down on her crack while more nauseous winds belted forth, beating at his meat. And the crowd was eating his torment up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter enough farts, Derah leaned forwards, making sure to push her butt out and tug the little wrestler deeper into her abyss. Her stomach grumbled a foreboding grumble, signalling to Simba his finale. And then, it came, the most noxious, and the biggest fart came forth, trapping Simba in a veritable tornado of gas! His royal rod couldn't take it anymore! With a weak cry, his hips extended forwards, and he blew his load right into Derah's ass. And that was the last bit of strain his body could take. He went limp within his pants prison...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, I think our little challenger just let one loose! And all I had to do was gas the little boy!\" Derah laughed. The crowd cheered, lauding in the sheer humiliation. She shook her rump a little, taunting the lion. \"Man, are you so desperate for my ass that tha's all it'd take to steal away your juices?\" However, she was made aware of the lack of movement as she shook. Curious, she hoisted the young lion out and held him in front of her, now seeing him resting like he were catching some much need sleep. At that, she showed off the beaten lion to the crowd, who cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerah was once again the winner. Out in the wild she mey be the prey. But in here, she gobbled up all of her challengers!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And then, Derah hoisted Simba up by the tail, his limbs flailing about. \"Oh my, were you trying to run~?

He could only lie there and let the crowd cheer on his weak state. He felt his cheeks burn up as he felt them staring down on him... especially staring down on his little friend... Soon, his vision settled, and now he could see the ibex planting her feet on either side of him, his body looming over his own. At that, he planted down his feet and hands, and began to crawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you better not do anything you'll regret-!\" he commanded. However, a smug smirk told him she wouldn't regret this anytime soon. And then, with a quick dive downwards, she slammed butt-first upon him! But it wasn't a slam meant to squish. No, Simba could tell from the intense squeezing sensation he could feel. Specifically, the squeezing sensation around his bulge... The crowd could see Derah's shorts-clad ass wrapping around the bulge in his red shorts. She gave a few teasing wiggles, before her buttocks squeezed tight, stuffing Simba's bulge deep between her cheeks, the young lion writhing and shaking, kicking about underneath her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh~\" she ordered, gently stroking his cheek. \"None of that~ You're not going anywhere I don't want you to~\" Simba grit his teeth at her orders. He shook more and more, trying to buck his hips to try and pull his cock free. But those cheeks simply held tightly to his cock. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, you asked for this,\" she said. She turned around then, her body facing his legs while her backside pointed at Simba's face, his cock still between her cheeks. He wasn't sure what she had planned, but he knew it could be nothing good. And then, he heard a grunt from her. And then, one of the singularly most horrifying sensations he'd ever felt... Derah let one rip on top of him, her buttocks clenching tightly around his cock before she did. Simba could feel the fart batter his cock, not only pounding his nose with a noxious stench, but the fart coated his cock in a bizarre warmth, while her buttocks vibrated around his bulge. Simba's eyes went wide, his cock was forced to endure pleasure he'd never imagined, but his mind and nose were tortured by such a humiliating sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the ibex simply giggled at his horror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was gonna play nice,\" she said, now simply rubbing up and down his cock while her butt cheeks hotdogged him. \"I was going to simply stroke you with my cheeks 'til I was satisfied. But since you're being such a rambunctious guest, I'll spare you no mercy~\" Simba reached up, planting his hand against one of her cheeks, and tried to push it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you can't do this! I'm a king! I'll-!\" he began to demand. However, his pleas were quickly interrupted by another bout of gas, her cheeks again vibrating around his cock. The young king was forced to shut his eyes, hoping that could somehow hide him away from the crowd laughing at the method of stimulation. \"You be good now, boy~ Unless you <i>want</i> to be known as the guy that came to a farting ibex!\" She laughed herself, convinced she had him right where she wanted him. Instead of farting on him again, she simply rubbed up and down on his bulge, her buttocks jerking him. The poor king's toes clenched and his hands balled up into fists, a nervous frown dressing his face. He would've never imagined he would've ended up in a position like this. It was either cum or get farted on and cum. He'd refuse to accept her gaseous stimulation was doing anything, but he had a feeling he'd soon be unable to refuse...</span></div></div>",

Apparently those shorts were kinda tight and showed off a few more private curves. He pulled on the back of his shorts, trying to undo his wedgie, as he approached the opponent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhead of him was a hyena boy. He wore blue shorts and dirty gray fur. He seemed young, a little older than Simba, though still stood a head taller than him. He also seemed slightly more muscular. Not overly muscular, but enough to appear threatening. This was Felix. Whatever, his dad punished hyenas all the time. Surely he'd have no trouble here. So, he approached the wrestler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a bit strong for a little guy,\" Simba said. The hyena was facing him, looking awfully nonchalant. He grinned at Simba's statement, before flexing an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Got these muscles from pounding some brat butt,\" he said. \"Come to think of it... you look kind of like my workout buddy. Oh man, poor guy always passes out.\" Simba listened, and felt a shiver go up his spine. He wasn't sure why, but this tiny guy was somehow managing to intimidate him just by talking about his training. Surely he's bluffing though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I bet you get pounded an awful lot,\" Simba said, trying to sound tough. Felix smirked, before taking a hand... and reaching for Simba's waistband. \"H-Hey!\" the lion shouted, blushing heavily.

You don't look like the kind of guy that <i>does</i> the pounding,\" he teased. Then, he let go, letting that waistband snap into place. Simba blushed as the hyena snickered, stepping back to his corner. Simba glared and got back towards his corner, and glared at the hyena, waiting for the signal. He'd make it a goal to kick that boy's butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the vulture announced that it was time.</span></div></div>",

At the same time, he let loose a powerful gush of cum, staining his shorts while Felix increased his grip, making sure he was going nowhere. The crowd was downright manic now with raucous applause and laughter. The hyena released his grip, and let Simba flop onto the ground, exhausted. Felix then flexed victoriously, walking laps around the arena while the crowd kept cheering. Meanwhile, Simba was recovering. He was a little dizzy, but he felt like he can handle a little more...</span></div></div>",

She gleefully planted messy kisses all over his face. Her thick, rubbery lips suckled and smooched without pause, the smell of her stale breath accented by the artificial scent of the greasy lipstick being smeared all over him. She smothered his face, briefly trying to escalate to a full on French kiss, but the cub kept his lips locked. No matter, the real prize was elsewhere and Milla would take her sweet time in claiming it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion was confused when the zebra briefly opened wide and put her jaws around his neck. It was little more than a brief pinch before she moved on to painting his chest red with kisses. Milla smiled. Normally lions would be locking their jaws around a zebra's neck to kill and eat it. It felt poetic to return the favor for once, even if this cub probably didn't know the broader context yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was relentless in her attack and slowly the cub's struggles began to fade. \"You're not tired already, are you? I thought lions had more strength than that.\" She said mockingly, shaking Simba a little to refresh his resistance. It wouldn't help him in the slightest, but Milla enjoyed the feeling of overwhelming an unwilling opponent with her amorous ways. The little lion didn't get the message at first, but a slight squeeze of her large hand brought back the squirming she desired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... don't do this...\" He begged, his voice haggard from exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, you don't get to make me all excited without giving me the finish I deserve.\" Milla chided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSImba shuddered as he saw the results of the evil zebra's attack. His chest was practically painted red from all the kisses she placed, her bright crimson lipstick still looking as full as ever. His face was probably in a similar state and Milla showed no signs of slowing down. She planted big kisses on his belly, making the lion a little ticklish. The huge zebra didn't seem to mind the extra wriggling though, as she just kept going. THey both knew it wouldn't be long before she'd reach his crotch. Already her free hand was coming up to deal with his shorts.</span></div></div>",

And then, after positioning her hand just right, with a swift yank, she tore down one side of the pants. And at that, the rest of his shorts came down, flopping onto the floor below. At that, the young lion was hopelessly exposed, his cock at full attention at the zebra's lips. Simba groaned and wriggled in embarrassment, trying to shake himself free of her grip. \"Mmm~ You look delicious~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brought down a hand and cupped Simba's butt, a chill going up his spine as his eyes go wide.

Her little victim was already struggling more ferociously than he had ever done before. It brought a smile to her face. She wouldn't let his efforts go unrewarded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion fought back with newfound spirit, terrified of what the overbearing wrestler had in mind. It was all but inevitable now. She was humming with delight on that first contact. He expected her to play around a bit and kiss his groin before moving on to the main event. But it seemed like her patience had reached its limit. With a small slurp she planted her lips on his crotch and sucked his erection into her maw. It was surrounded in a damp warmth, her tongue quickly assailing his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone outside of the ring exploded into cheering. Milla had a knack for humiliating her opponents and the feeble little cub had played his part expertly. He went from struggling to a limp doll in her hands.

But this zebra wasn't one to give away such treats for free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilla's tongue swirled around the little shaft in her maw. It wouldn't take much to bring this eager cub to his peak, but she tried to milk it all the same. She paired the suckling with planting a few more smooches around the base of his shaft, ensuring the red streak she'd been painting would go from head to toe. Only his tail would be spared for now. Hopefully Simba would like his new flair, because her greasy lipstick was a nightmare to clean out of fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... don't...\" He weakly sputtered. The cub barely had the will or the strength left to object. That zebra bitch wasn't going to listen to him anyway. She had him exactly where she wanted. His overstimulated cock finally popped its cork and unleashed its payload. Inside her maw it was all but lost instantly, swirled up in gallons of saliva and swallowed down without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilla could feel her opponent deflating, his cock turning flaccid and the tension leaving his body. She didn't even notice his orgasm, but it was clear she'd wrung him dry with her oversized blowjob. \"Awww... did the itty bitty kitty already have enough fun? Then you'd best get ready, because now it's your turn to satisfy me.\" Her grin got twice as wide and three times as cruel. \"And unlike you I'm not nearly as easy to please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little lion gulped, terrified of what the zebra had in mind. With her imposing stature she could do whatever she wanted to get her fun out of him. Simba tried to struggle, to put up some semblance of a fight. But against Milla's endless strength it was useless. The jeering crowd didn't help one bit, shouting all manner of hurtful things at him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make him suck you off!\" <br>\r\n\"Just eat him already, he's useless!\"<br>\r\n\"Have him suffer! put him up your butt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Milla's voice demanded their silence. \"Quiet down, will you? You all act like it's my first time in here. I appreciate the suggestions, but I think this situation calls for something special.\" She patted the brightly colored shorts she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba rolled his eyes.

Her overbearing feminine arousal was clear as day. She was getting off on humiliating him, and she was about to take her nasty little game to a whole new level. He thrashed around, but the zebra either didn't notice or didn't care. She just teased the audience, slowly lowering the cub before pulling him away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun down there.\" She finally announced, releasing her grip and letting the cub fall. There was barely enough space for him in the opening, his body sliding in up to his chest. The zebra released the waistband, letting it snap back and pin the little lion in place. She chuckled at her victim's misfortune before deciding she could add even more to it. Milla put her large hand atop the cub's head and pushed him down until it was the only thing still visible outside of her shorts. His struggles were reduced to barely visible moving bulges on the outside of her shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside her shorts the cub could feel the overwhelming heat radiating off the zebra's groin. She was eager for satisfaction. Far worse was the slimy wetness Simba felt pressed against his back. The lower half of his body was directly in front of Milla's large pussy and it twitched eagerly with the lion's every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooooh. If I had known you felt this good I'd have skipped the kissing and put you where you belong straight away. But I think that wouldn't be very fair to the people. They want a show and now I think you're finally ready to give it to them.\" The towering zebra spoke, her ominous words making little sense to the cub. How was he going to be able to do anything here? His question was answered soon enough as Milla walked over to one of the turnbuckles in the corner of the ring. She leaned forward and began to grind herself against the sturdy wooden post. The crowd went wild at the sight of this sensual performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba wasn't having anywhere near the same experience. He was getting crushed between the turnbuckle and the zebra's crotch, her pussy rubbing against his back as Milla ground him into the unyielding surface. His tight prison barely allowed for movement, much less for any ability to defend himself against this painful display. Every time she pressed him into the turnbuckle Simba felt his body get a little flatter. He'd stopped bothering with pleas for mercy. That foul bitch had a plan for him and no amount of talk was going to sway her. Milla was in charge and she would keep going until she was done with him. He could only pray this would happen before she'd crush him unconscious or worse.</span></div></div>",

She wanted more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba watched in horror as her hand ventured down to him and began to slowly rub his body. The cramped confines of her shorts left nothing to the imagination as she made the bulge formed by his lower body disappear. The cub gasped as he felt the slimy warmth expand to surround his tail and hind legs. Milla gasped too, shocked by how good this felt. It wasn't often she was matched against an opponent this small and she would make full use of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave the crowd a show they wouldn't soon forget. All of them watched with perverted glee as she rubbed her groin, seeing the lion's panicked face. Slowly Simba's head began to slip behind the waistband of Milla's shorts. He was going in and there wasn't a thing he could do about it. Of all the humiliations he could think of, this was just about the last place he imagined going to. The zebra waved him goodbye as his head was pulled down into her shorts, laughing loudly. Her pussy had a strong grip on the cub, but now she had to be careful. There was no doubt in her mind that she could make the little lion disappear completely, but that would get her disqualified. She couldn't let that ruin her fun. This pesky brat wasn't going anywhere until she'd wrung herself an orgasm from him, one way or another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuffled cries for help only stimulated the zebra further, flexing her loins to encourage her soaking wet snatch to swallow up its prey. When the crowd began to simmer down, Milla ran her hands along the waist of her shorts and in dramatic fashion she pulled them away. Cheers and laughter thundered across the ring as everyone saw the sorry state Simba was in. Most of his body had been drawn into the towering zebra's womanhood. Only his front legs and head still poked out. He could feel the inner muscles of his tormentor steadily pulse and squeeze. It was the strangest massage he'd ever received.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, folks? Can the brave cub do the impossible or will he be lost forever?!\" Milla boasted loudly. She knew she couldn't make good on her threat, but it whipped the crowd into a frenzy. It also made her little toy lion squirm like never before, desperate to avoid such a disgusting fate. She almost pitied him, struggling for his life, unaware of the rules protecting him. Even with their size difference it was still a surprisingly snug fit. She squeezed and clenched, her inner walls bearing down on him with uncanny strength. She was so close now.</span></div></div>",

It dragged on his body as the slimy walls soaked him utterly in her arousal. The powerful stench of her feminine musk torched his poor, abused nostrils and to cap it all off the crowd was cheering her on in this nightmare. They loved every second of it, even if it meant the cub's unceremonious death. The only ones not smiling were Timon and Pumbaa, horrified at the lewd display. The ref too kept a keen eye, exchanging a harsh glance with the zebra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMmm... I'm surprised I've not heard more about you before, little prince. Cute toys like you are usually more popular in the ring with big girls like me. Or are you new around here? Well, I bet you weren't expecting this kind of introduction.\" Milla taunted as she felt her pussy work down her prey's resistance. She tried to keep up the trashtalk to hide just how horny she was feeling, but there was no disguising how eagerly her pussy wanted to swallow its prey. It took a concerted effort to squeeze and torment the cub, but his futile wriggles were providing waves of pleasure unlike anything the zebra had experienced in a long time. It was hard for her to stay coherent for much longer, an overwhelming orgasm building up deep inside of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls around the cub were slickened with ever more pungent slime. What little resistance the cub could manage to stop himself from being pulled in slowly eroded. All the while he was treated to the disgusting backing track of wet squelches paired with the zebra's taunts slowly devolving into lewd moaning. She was getting off on this and he was little more than a toy to her. Her barely restrained lust for him reached a peak as he felt her body squeeze him tightly before opening as wide as it could, drawing him in completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a booming moan Milla closed her eyes and let her hungering snatch finish the job. In one fell swoop it pulled the remainder of the cub in and closed up around Simba's head, hiding it from view. The crowd gasped at the brutality and lewdness of the show. Scattered cheers faded into shocked silence as the zebra kept moaning loudly. The ref quickly flew in to re-establish order but before he could speak she cried out at the top of her lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhh\" The towering zebra bellowed as it felt like her whole body had reached critical mass. Heat radiated throughout and at the core of it all was the cub weakly squirming inside of her. She could feel the wave of pleasurable release rushing towards its inevitable conclusion, squatting down a little to accommodate for the sheer intensity of the climax wracking her body. Sweat beaded all over her and feminine juices dripped from her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba's world was one of constant movement. The walls around him grew ever more animated, squishing and moving the cub within their powerful embrace. He couldn't tell if he was still sinking in deeper, but by now Milla's moans had gotten so loud that even trapped inside her love tunnel he could hear them. The little lion dreaded to think what his future in here was going to be like, not seeing any way to fight against the overbearing zebra. He felt things accelerating until finally he was hit by a warm torrent of slime. The sheer volume of it all pushing him around in the snug confines of Milla's pussy. Before he knew it there was light again, his head pushed out of the nightmarish prison with a noisy, wet squelch. More of his body followed at the zebra's climax forced him back out<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mere seconds the cub fell from his prison, landing in a big pool of smelly goop. Milla was too shellshocked to even move, more juices dribbling down on her toy lion. Simba felt drained and exhausted, too weak to even stand up after being so thoroughly beaten. He didn't expect a fair fight from the moment the enormous zebra entered the ring, but to be humiliated and used as a sex toy was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly Milla came down from her high. The afterglow still burned brightly and the experience is one she would never forget in a thousand years. But as her senses slowly returned she also realized what she had done. She had swallowed the cub whole, albeit in a very unusual way. The zebra saw the ref staring daggers at her and she became very nervous. How long had she kept Simba in there? Seconds? Minutes? Her climax was so overwhelming she couldn't tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulture inspected the aftermath of the 'fight' thoroughly and frowned. Milla had technically broken the rule, but she'd held the cub inside her for only a handful of seconds before popping him back out. Was that really severe enough to demand disqualification? The crowd loved every moment of it, even now providing the towering zebra with an ongoing standing ovation. Whatever his call, it was clear that this was the end of the match. Simba was in no shape to keep fighting, or really to be doing anything other than laying on the ground and catching his breath. The little lion struggled to even maintain eye contact with the ref as he assessed the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thunderous applause petered out everyone's eyes turned to the ref, who flew up to his perch. What is his decision?</span></div></div>",

He felt like he was in the grip of a predatory, left to be swallowed alive by this zebra, despite the rules. The zebra hoisted Simba high up into the air, before spinning him around, facing him away from her body. He kept on struggling in her grip, unsure what she was doing. And then... she lowered him, shoving his groin against her bust. Simba gasped out upon feeling her breasts wrap around him, and the crowd went wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-ha! HA!\" Simba panted in shock. Milla, meanwhile, wore a cruel smile that bore into his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fit just right, dear~\" Milla cooed. She then lifted him, before lowering him, just enough to lift his length up, and lower it down, into the chasm between her boobs. Over and over, she pumped him in, Simba continuing to gasp while his cheeks were burning. Meanwhile, Milla was looking all over his tiny form. She remarked to herself how small his dick was... but before her was quite the sight. He may've lacked between the legs, but he more than made up for it with that caboose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~ You're making me hungry, boy~\" she purred as she looked over his rear. Simba would've questioned her, but her continued technique kept on pumping him and kept on making him pant. Additionally, it shook his backside for her. She felt such a desire, and even she couldn't fight off the burning of her cheeks...</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, judging by the sudden, somewhat predatory look on her face, he wouldn't have long to question. Sarabi got into a low stance, her tail swishing about as she eyed up the young lion. She placed a claw on the ground as she got into her stance, still eyeing the prince, at which point Simba could swear he could hear her purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a thick pause, either fighter still looking at each other, Simba looking with fear and Sarabi looking with hunger. The lion cub began to realize that, as long as he stood there, he wouldn't be getting anywhere. One of them would have to win, so... Simba began to approach, keeping up a defensive stance as he came in closer and closer. Unfortunately, when he got too close, he saw a malicious grin appear on the lioness' face. And then, she suddenly leapt up into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba was too surprised, and left to watch as she jumped up, observing the arc of her pounce as she came in. And as he did, he noticed that midair, she spun around such that her... shapely rump was coming down first?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaster than he could realize what was happening, her butt fell upon his back, suddenly knocking him down and laying him onto the ground! The cub was swiftly pinned underneath her, her giant rump covering up everything between his thighs and his shoulders. He was stunned at first, but upon realizing what'd happened, he went red in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey! Get off of me!\" Simba shouted, squirming around underneath her. Unfortunately, his struggling didn't make a dent in the larger feline's mass. She very easily sat on him, her body pointing towards his head while she giggled. As she did, her tail slunk back, poking and prodding Simba's lower half, from his tail, to his hips, to his thighs. Simba squirmed harder and harder and kept trying to worm himself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, you think you can get out of your punishment?\" she cooed. \"That's cute~\" As she spoke, she leaned back, putting more weight on the boy's back. \"Unfortunately for you, I'm a bit of a crowd pleaser. Then again, you probably didn't come in here without considering that~\" Simba rose a brow curiously at her threat, when he suddenly felt her buttocks clench... Then, with a trumpetous blast, to Simba's horror, he felt warm winds pound against his back before traveling up and smothering his head with foul gas! Simba's eyes widened, and he thrusted his hands over his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BLEH! That's disgusting!\" Simba shouted in disgust. Sarabi, meanwhile, laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a warm up!\" Sarabi countered. \"You'll be eaten alive if you can't handle that~\" As she chuckled, she considered what else to do to the little lion.</span></div></div>",
