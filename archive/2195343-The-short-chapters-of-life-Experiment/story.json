In fact, I want it to be extremely focused on these, so it doesn't take too long for any reader to reach the next choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, this will mean that the stories of each chapter have to be extremely simple, but why not try it out as an experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTherefore, <b>the rules are as follows</b>:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Be as brief as possible (no more than 500 words per chapter)<br>\r\n2) Always create four choices at the end (three, if you are a free member or visitor)<br>\r\n3) Keep the writing in the 3rd person past tense<br>\r\n4) Keep the writing <b>for the choices</b> in the 3rd person present tense<br>\r\n5) The main character's name is \"Tom\" (don't change that)<br>\r\n6) Respect other people's stories and build upon them reasonably<br>\r\n7) Have fun and enjoy!</td>",
