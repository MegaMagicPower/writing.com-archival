On the screen of the game words appeared.\"You have been chosen\" they said. \"Chosen? What for?\" almost immediatley the words chaged to: \"For this!\". You were shocked to say the least. Your game boy started to glow and became very hot. \"Crap!\" you shout as you drop the game. It lands on the floor screen up and the light begins to fill the room soon it became too bright and you covered your eyes with your hands. After a few seconds the light died out. Your vision saw still a little blurry but you were pretty sure there was an egg of some sort on the floor next to your gameboy. As you rubbed your eyes to restore your vision you decided that your eyes weren't playing tricks onn you. There was a large egg on your floor. \"Wow, thats new.\" You cautiously picked up the egg and realized that it was the same pattern as the eggs from the pokemon games, white with green speckles. As you held it in your hands you felt it shake a little and a crack appeared on its surface. \"Woah!\" you gasped as it jerked out of you hands. You tried to catch it but you were too slow. It shattered on impact with the floor. revealing a small red and white bird like creature. Being a pokemon fanatic you instantly recognized it as a Latias. \"Incredible, a real Latias, in my room!\". The latias slowly opened her bright amber eyes aand looked into yours. Less than a second later she rushed forwards and gave you a gigantic hug knocking you over onto your bed and nuzzling your chest.(Hello, I'm Latias! What's your name?) \"Wha? Who said that?\"(Me silly!)\"You? You said that?.\" (Yes I used telepathy to project my words to you!) \"Oh, thats really cool.\" (Well?) \"What?\" (Whats your name?) \"Oh right I'm </span></div></div>",

But it was bigger than most eggs. So what creature could it belong to?<br>\r\nUpon looking around, you saw that it seemed to belong to nothing specific.

You were simply quick to jump to conclusions. Although you did think most things through, this time wasn't the case.<br>\r\nYou grabbed your backpack and moved some things into other pockets, which made room for what you planned on taking. You picked up the egg and placed it in your backpack, it being safe in there from your rearranging.<br>\r\nOnly after putting your backpack on, did you start walking back to town.<br>\r\nThe walk home was quiet. Then again, most nights in the area are usually quiet. You unlocked the door to your place once you got back, and walked in right away.<br>\r\nSince you lived alone, there was nobody to worry about keeping this egg secret from. You took it out of your backpack and put it in your chair for now, placing a blanket around it to keep it warm.<br>\r\nYou were about to walk away when it shook a little. It was probably best to stay on the couch down here, just in case anything happened.

You sat up and looked to the chair, seeing only the blanket and egg shell remains. You suddenly remembered the egg you brought home last night, which almost made you panic seeing shell remains.<br>\r\nThe reason you didn't panic was because you felt something about the size of a smaller than average house cat trying to get up on your lap.<br>\r\nYou looked down to see... some kind of mammalian creature. It was all white and furry, exception on its face and tail. Well, claws too. But that's expected. And it had a small sickle-like shaped horn on the right side of its head. Finally was its odd shaped tail. Just something about it being almost flat and certainly. in some kind of shape was abnormal.<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you?\" You didn't mean that to be rude towards the creature. But mammals are born live. So why'd this hatch from an egg? Not to mention that it was unlike anything discovered before. While unlike anything else, the closest you could guess is just simply some type of mammal.<br>\r\nIt rubbed up against you affectionately. You pet it on the head once, and it rubbed against you again.<br>\r\nStill, you didn't know what it was. If anything like it was discovered. Heck, you didn't even know if it was male or female.

The top of the egg shell still resting on its adorable little head. \"Eevee?\" It said aloud. \"Ee.\" It whimpered on your desk, not knowing where it was and being in pitch black darkness didn't help it one bit either. Once it's eyes adjusted to the darkness in the surrounding area, it looked around and eventually spotted another life form breathing on an elevated platform. \"Eevee!\" It squealed as it jumped straight from the desk to your bed. It tried nudging your head to wake you up, but once that failed it simply curled up close to you and fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you slept, you had dreams of what could be in that egg. In your dream you wake up to see the egg hatching. As if it were waiting for you to wake and sit up. But, without warning, a large bird broke in through the window and started attacking you with its talons. Once more in another instance of that dream the egg hatched and no large predatory bird attacked you this time. Out of the egg came a larger than normal bird chick. It was covered in small yellow feathers and had a small orange pointed beak. The chick jumped onto the floor and onto your bed. It then proceeded to snuggle against your side until it suddenly moved away and started squawking like an annoying alarm clock. You wake up to find Eevee...</span></div></div>",

lost,because I can remember this certain part of the forest,especially the large water fall,with a pond at the bottom of it.I was about 5'1\",pale skin,and I was wearing a blue shirt,with a Marill on it,and blue khakis.I had red eyes,gray ruffed up hair,held into a blue cap with a skull on it,turned backwards.Yeah,I dyed my hair gray,sue me!<br>\r\n\"-Alright,now I just have to go around this,and the trail should be ahead.-\"I thought,as I walked around the edge of a clear blue pond.I gotta say,the view never gets old.After walked around the pond,I pushed some bushes out of the way,and there was a brown dirt trail,pointing eastward.<br>\r\n\"-Yes!Now to just--\"As soon as I jumped over the bushes,my foot connected with something,and that made me trip in mid-air,and making me fall on my chest,and the rest of my body following soon.<br>\r\n\"Ow!Ughh...\"I growled in anger,turning my body over to see what my foot had hit.At first I thought it was just an oddly colored branch,but looking closer at it,I see that it was a rather big blue rock.<br>\r\n\"-Uh...okay...\"I then picked up the rock,and to my surprise...it didn't feel like a rock at ALL!Instead it felt like a newborn egg,and it was about the size of my palm,just a bit bigger.It also had a weird pattern on it.<br>\r\n\"-Hm...nice egg...but it didn't come from a chicken...or a cow.\"I then inspected the egg.It then started to do weak rattles in my hands,which I set the egg back down.<br>\r\n\"-By the feels of it,it seems it's ready to hatch.-\"I then took at least three steps back,before sitting down with my legs crossed.The egg started to do more shakes,and soon it blinked twice,right before it shined a dim white light.It was bright to me,so I covered most of the light with my hands in front of my face.As soon as the light faded away,I saw...it had formed into an Azurill!?A Pokemon!?Wait,that's not real.Is it?It slowly opened it's eyes,and then I almost fell over from the shock!It was real,and it was breathing.It still seemed sleepy,however,but then it did a light shake to it's...head,then it seemed wide awake,and it's eyes looked straight at me,and then it did a wide,open mouth smile.<br>\r\n\"Azurill!Azu-Azurill!\"It squeaked,as it stood up,and ran into my lap,and started rubbing it's head against my stomach,where the Marill was.<br>\r\n\"-Oh great,it only thinks I am it's mother,because of the Marill on my shirt.-\"I thought as I picked it up,and it looked at me,straight into the eyes,which it started flailing it's legs,out of joy.<br>\r\n\"I can see that your really easy to please.\"I said to it.<br>\r\n\"Azurill.\"It said,as it nodded it's head.My first thought was to send it back into the wild,but then I started to think of the possible chances that a Marill would be in the wild,not to mention,if anyone else found...it...people would go nuts and scientists would capture it and do painful experiments.My thoughts ran rampant of thoughts about keeping it,or letting it free...and to my conclusion,I want to keep it...but only for it's safety.<br>\r\n\"Alright,if you want to come with me,let's go.\"I said,placing it down on the ground,which it started running down the path.Luckily,and unfortunately,I was able to grab onto it's tail,but I was also dragged along the road,getting my clothes dirty.<br>\r\n\"-Oh jeez,how am I suppose to explain this to anybody?-\"I mentally asked myself.<br>\r\n*************************************<br>\r\n\"Alright,first we have to find what you like to eat.\"I said,as I placed my knapsack on the couch,which the Azurill started to rattle around in my backpack,before it showed it's head.It smiled,and then jumped out,quickly following me to the kitchen.I first tried the basics of foods,starting with the bread,which I took a piece out,and put it in front of it.It seemed to really like the bread,for it ate the whole slice in under ten seconds.<br>\r\n\"-Hm...fast eater.-\"I noted,as it just swallowed the last piece.Then something occurred to me.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Azurill.Are you a boy,or a girl?\"I asked.<br>\r\n\"Azurill.\"It replied,which I made my mouth a straight across my face.<br>\r\n\"Okay...uh...\"I started,which I took out a picture from the counter.It was basically the picture of my family,a basic one at that.<br>\r\n\"You see.Girl...\"I pointed to my sister in the picture,who was taller than me.The Azurill leaned it's head to the right.<br>\r\n\"Boy...\"I pointed to me in the picture,which it leaned it's head to the left.<br>\r\n\"Do you know which one,you are?\"I asked again.<br>\r\n\"Azu.\"It replied as it leaned it's head to the right.Okay,that meant it was a girl.<br>\r\n\"Alright,that's that.\"I said,as I tossed the picture over my shoulder,which I it landed back on the counter.<br>\r\n\"Well,since you just been fed...how's about we go to my room,for some sleep?\"I did quite a climb back in the forest,only to find this guy,what luck.<br>\r\n\"Azu...rill.\"It yawned.I did a short chuckle,before I headed upstairs towards my room,with Azurill in my arms.Luckily,my home was a two story building,well...three story,if you count the basement.I looked at the clock that was planted above my bedroom door.10:10.I then opened my bedroom door,and immediately went towards my bed,placing her on my pillow.She was smaller then the pillow,but her tail said otherwise.She instantly feel asleep too,which I carefully placed myself into my bed,and pulled the covers over my shoulders,before going to dreamland.<br>\r\n****************************<br>\r\nI suddenly woke up with a shock,which I had a bad feeling in my heart,something was wrong,so I turned to the pillow Azurill was on to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Azurill was cowering on her pillow,trying her best to get all of her body inside the pillow by any chance.I wondered what made her so upset,but then I soon got my answer,when I saw the room light up in a quick fashion,and then soon the boom of thunder,not to mention I could hear it raining outside.Beside the weather,I was more worried about Azurill.<br>\r\n\"Azurill...are you scared?\"I asked,which Azurill looked at,all scared,and her eyes watery.I also heard little whimpers coming from her.<br>\r\n\"Hey...don't worry.\"I said,as I picked up Azurill and placed her right next to me.<br>\r\n\"As long as your by my side,nothing will hurt you.\"I assured,which made Azurill's frown turn into a light smile.<br>\r\n\"Azurill.\"She lightly said,right before the room lit up again,which made her bury her head in my chest,and her tail almost hit me too.<br>\r\n\"Heh...good night Azurill.\"I then pulled the covers over Azurill and me,and went back to sleep.<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\nThe next morning me and Azurill were sitting at the kitchen table,having breakfast.Luckily,I was old enough(21) to live in a separate home than my family.My house was basically on top of large hill top,which is what I like.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Azurill.Are you done yet?\"I asked,swallowing the last pieces of my toast.<br>\r\n\"Azu.\"She muffled,still chewing her piece.<br>\r\n\"I'm taking that a yes,right?\"I asked.She nodded her head.<br>\r\n\"Alright,let me just get my things.\"I got up from the table,which Azurill followed shortly on her tail.After I packed things for today's trip,I strapped it on my back,and Azurill jumped into my knapsack.I quickly flung open the door,grabbed my hat,closing it behind me,then slid downhill,right onto this orange dirt road.My mom worried I may get lost,and never return to the city,so she build the orange road just in case,which it really helped me finding trails.I whistled as I walked down the trail,with Azurill constantly saying her name as I did.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Azurill...\"I started,which made her stop.<br>\r\n\"I was wondering...would you like a nickname?\"She jumped,happily as I said that.<br>\r\n\"Azurill!Azurill!\"She squealed,nodding her head.<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright...let's see...\"I put a finger to my mouth,like a cartoon does when it is thinking.<br>\r\n\"Um...Azu...ma...ri...Willy!How does Willy sound?\"I asked,which she nodded,which her eyes closed,mouth open smile.<br>\r\n\"Well,Willy.Seems like this is going to be a good relationship...\"I said,bravely,as I started looking at the entire city on another large mountaintop,with the wind blowing on my body.Azurill eyes lit up with joy.<br>\r\n\"I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n**********************<br>\r\n\"Okay,Willy.So far so good.\"I said,as I turned to corner.<br>\r\n\"Azurill.\"She quietly said,being as still as possible.I told her that she needed to act like a doll,if we wanted to get to a place where I wanted to go first.Many people looked at me funny,but some others thought I was a Pokemon fan.Finally,after turning a few more corners,I stood in front of this place,where it said Poke R' Us.Yes,it said that.I walked up to the door and opened them,hearing that occasional *ding-dong* noise as I did,quickly seeing a counter and the person behind it.It was my best friend Sally.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Sally,what's up?\"I greeted,as I rested a shoulder on the counter.She looked up to me with her blue eyes.<br>\r\nSally was about a an inch taller than me,tanned skin,long blond hair that reaches the bottom part of her back,flat chest,and a normal body line for a girl.She wore the occasional black and white stripped sweater,with a blue and red stripped shirt under it,and yellow pants with green striped.I swear,if you look at her shirt,you will get dizzy.<br>\r\n\"Hey,Blaze,nothing much.Business is slow today.\"She said,placing a Marill plush on the shelf,with other water related type Pokemon.Yeah,my name is Blaze.I named myself,but she also calls me Blare.<br>\r\n\"Really?I wouldn't expect something like that during the summer.\"I said,messing with one of the plush dolls.<br>\r\n\"I know,right?Anyways,what are you hear for?\"Even though she run's an entire Pokemon related business by herself,she's kind to the bones.<br>\r\n\"Well,I want to show you something,but you better keep a secret.\"I sounded a little too serious.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.You have my word,now what do you want to show me?\"I placed my bag on the ground,and unzipped it,which Azurill's head showed out more,but she was still acting like a doll.<br>\r\n\"Is that the Azurill doll you misplaced last week?\"I blushed when she said that.<br>\r\n\"No,it's a real Azumarill.Willy you can stop acting like a doll now.\"Willy took a deep breath,and then started panting.Willy did a double take,right before she fell backwards,with her mouth gaped open.<br>\r\n\"B-B-Blaze?W-what is that t-thing?\"She shivered.<br>\r\n\"Oh?I thought you knew every Pokemon in the Pokedex up to da--\"<br>\r\n\"I do know every Pokemon in existence and don't you forget it!!\"She yelled,right in my face,which actually blew my cap off.She was very serious when it came to Pokemon,and she was very quick on her feet,too.Willy then stepped out of my knapsack,and then started to look around,constantly tilting her head in confusion.<br>\r\n\"Alright,alright,jeez...\"I growled,as I picked up my cap,and put it back on my head.<br>\r\n\"It's a real living Azurill.I came to you since you knew about Pokemon,better than anyone in the city.I want to learn info about it,like it's habits,abilities stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay...an Azurill can use it's tail as a lasso and hurl itself up to a record of 33 feet,as stated in the Pokedex.\"I could see that Willy was spinning her tail,like a lasso.<br>\r\n\"Cool.\"<br>\r\n\"But,battle-wise,they are

I sat on the recliner and layed back. My parents brought in cinnamon rolls and MooMoo milk. And they finished it off with a Lavaridge cookie which I liked just a little bit. They brought in a box that was about twice the size of my head and another that was rectangle shaped and three forths the size of the first.<br>\r\n\"Open the small one first,\" my Dad whispered.<br>\r\nI reached for it and began to tear off the paper. It was a shoe box. I opened that and found a ton of bubble wrap. I began to unwrap that and there, in the center of the bubbles, was a brand new, shiny pokedex! And layed around it were five little pokeballs.<br>\r\n\"How did you get this?!\" I asked. I was so excited, I could hardly speak.<br>\r\n\"Pokemart has lots more when you bribe,\" my mom giggled.<br>\r\n\"Open this one, now!\" My dad said.<br>\r\nI opened it, then the box, then some blankets, and then I saw a weird looking thing.<br>\r\nIt was oval shaped and smelled pretty funky. It was a light purple with darker purple splotches on it. I picked it up and put my ear against it. It didn't make any sounds. I looked at my parents.<br>\r\n\"Where's my pokemon? Cause I'm not takin that Skitty. No way,\" I stated.<br>\r\n\"You're holding it,\" my Mom said.<br>\r\n\"Wha-?!\" I stammered. I looked at the thing again and studiedd it. How is this a pokemon? Then it hit me: this is an egg. Its GOING to be a pokemon.<br>\r\n\"Well?\" My Dad asked.<br>\r\n\"What pokemon is it?\" I asked as I kept studying the egg.<br>\r\n\"I thought the smell had given it away! But, its a Gastly egg!\" My mom exclaimed.<br>\r\nThe egg shook violently. It fell from my hands onto the ground.<br>\r\n\"Be careful with that egg!\" My Dad shouted.<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" I sighed.<br>\r\n\"Why don't you go walk around. Once that egg hatches, you're an official trainer!\" My mom suggested.<br>\r\nI agreed and walked outside with Eggy (I named the egg! Be happy its not Eggbert. XP) and wandered around a bit. <br>\r\n'Why is Pallet Town so boring?' I thought to myself as I kicked a pebble. It hit something so I looked to see what it was.</span></div></div>",

My parents were gone for a few days with my sister's game, so I would be home alone. My name is Eric. I am about 5' 9\" tall, and about 200lbs. I look chubby, but I'm in pretty good shape. I have black hair that I like to keep under a hat, and blue eyes. I enjoyed walking through the woods, it calmed me. I was about to run home, when I tripped over something. I looked back and saw a round stone. It was gray with yellow markings on the sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What on Earth is that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked over and grabbed the stone. The stone was radiating heat, like it was alive. I grabbed it, and carried it to my house. When I got inside, I put some chicken in the microwave, and carried the stone off to my room. I placed it on my dresser, and tried to search it on the computer. Nothing showed up though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This thing isn't a rock. It feels warm, and its markings look familiar. Maybe its a egg...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe egg wobbled a little bit, but stopped. I focused on it now, hoping for it to hatch. The egg wobbled some more, and then it began to glow. I backed up slowly, and the egg rolled off my desk. The light became blinding, but then it stopped. I looked down, and nearly fainted. On the floor, was a Giratina. Only, this one was very small for a Giratina, and it was in its Origin Forme. It looked around curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A G-G-Giratina!? But wait, isn't that a Pokemon? And they are not supposed to be real!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Giratina suddenly turned to me, and focused on me. It slowly slithered to me. Thank god it didn't know how to fly. However, it was backing me into a corner. I slowly backed up, until I met with the wall. I sat down, and it looked at me. Its face met my face. I could see its red eyes, gleaming at me. Then, it rubbed its head into my chest affectionatly. It then looked at me and smiled.</span></div></div>",

I heard its stomach growl, and it looked up at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He's probably hungary from all that energy being used to hatch. I wonder what I should feed him. I have chicken ready know, but I don't want it becoming a meat eater.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little Giratina began to look sad. I petted his head, and stood up, \"Stay here. I will be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Giratina nodded and curled up. I walked to the kitchen, grabbed the chicken, and walked back. The little Giratina instantly slithered up and curled around my leg. I made a small laugh, and sat down. I grabbed a piece of chicken, and held it in front of it's face. Giratina sniffed it, and then bit a piece off. It smiled and ate some more. I gave it the entire plate, but it ate only half. Giratina edged the plate to me, and rubbed its head into my side. I laughed, picked it up, and held Giratina up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to stay with me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiratina moved its tentacle like wings and began to fly.

How does the name Platinum sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiratina flew again, but he crashed into my legs. He stayed longer in the air, but not by much. He made a small sound that sounded like a cheer. He liked the name, I guess. I looked at the clock, and it was around 9:00pm. I climbed into my bed, and Platinum followed. He quickly fell asleep, and I rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can't believe that I have a baby Giratina with me now. I think my life got more interesting...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly drifted to sleep.

I patted his head and we went to the kitchen to eat breakfast. Platinum enjoyed eating fruit as much as meat, so the carnivore thing wasn't going to happen. After we ate, I looked on the computer for what moves Platinum could use as a hatchling. I figured we could start out small and work our way up to the more challenging ones. I at least wanted him to learn Shadow Force. I tried three simple moves; Will-O-Wisp, Dragon Rage, and a simple Headbutt attack. The Headbutt was the easiest by far. Next, I was hoping for Will-O-Wisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Platinum\" I said. \"Try focusing your energy and direct it to your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatinum closed his eyes and I saw him tense up. When he opened his mouth, a small light blue flame formed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" I exclaimed. \"Now try shooting it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatinum opened his eyes and aimed at one of the targets I set up. He fired the Will-O-Wisp at the target and it hit it dead on. The attack left a large burn mark from where it hit. I walked up beside Platinum and patted his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great first attempt\" I said. \"We can work on perfecting that later. Now let's try Dragon Rage. It is similar to Will-O-Wisp, but it requires a deep dragon power that rests in your body. Can you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatinum closed his eyes and tensed up again. His body glowed purple slightly. He opened his mouth again and a purple orb formed. He opened his eyes and aimed at the same target. The attack shot out of his mouth and hit the target. It exploded on contact sending out a bright purple light. Sone dust and debris flew out as well. When everything cleared, there only was a small crater. Platinum looked surprised, but I cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did it!\" I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked back at himbut he wasn't there. I turned my head and saw him flying. He licked my cheek, circled my head, and wrapped around my arm. I laughed as I made my way inside. Training took longer than expected, because it was 1:00! Before I could get us something to eat, the doorbell rang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Platinum, stay here\" I commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlatinum stayed on the table and ate some fruit.

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This is my fourth story, and I'm feeling confident. Anyway, this is a story where you find a Pokemon egg. You can find it where ever or however, but there are some rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Must stay appropiate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. The Pokemon can behave in anyway<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No anthros. I might be a fan of those, but not in this story<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Because this is an egg, the Pokemon cannot be a evolved form (Ex. Charizard)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The type categorys will be classified by which type the Pokemon is first. (Ex. Frillish is a Water/Ghost type Pokemon. Water is first, so it is a Water-type Pokemon.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. When adding to a chapter, please add a \"Are you a female or male\" choice before you start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. This story is now open to the public!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. This happens in the REAL world. Not the Pokemon world. It would be a bigger deal in the human world rather than the Pokemon world.</td>",
