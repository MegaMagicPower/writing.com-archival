You would think that having listened to it for the past four years you would be able to tune it out; but alas, the clock is still capable of doing its job well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping out of bed, you walk to the bathroom to take a shower. You smile at the reflection in the mirror. Your shoulder-length blonde hair is messed up from a night of tossing and turning while you try to get comfortable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend about an hour primping and preening as you ready yourself to go to the mall. Sarah agreed to meet you at ten, and you are both excited about finding the perfect dress. Sarah has been complaining that you're always late, so today you are hoping to prove her wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you are ready to leave you only have a half hour before you are late. Sarah lives on the opposite side of town, so it made no sense for the two of you to carpool. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing your purse, you rush outside and get into your car. The drive is slow due to Saturday morning traffic. Now you remember why you like to sleep in. Fortunately, you still make it to the mall on time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is waiting for you by the main fountain. She gives you a big hug when you approach. Her disbelief in your punctuality is worth having woken up early. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a new place down at the far end of the mall,\" Sarah states pointing towards one branch of the mall. \"Or we could just check out the large outlet store right here.\"</span></div></div>",

You think its an odd name for a store, but shrug it off as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are cases full of jewelry near the register. All kinds of t-shirts are hung on the wall, and formal dresses galore sit on racks spread around the store. In the back of the store are several shelves with underwear and lingerie. Again, you find the store name odd considering the merchandise that is being sold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything I can help you with?\" A young woman behind the counter asks as you and Sarah enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're looking for dresses for Prom.\" You reply glancing towards several of the racks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have quite the selection here,\" The saleswoman answers. \"We have all kinds of styles from the 1920s to the ultra-modern. Don't forget to check out our jewelry section too. And if you're looking to surprise your boyfriend after the dance, we have all kinds of lovely intimates in the back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah giggles at the saleswoman's words and immediately heads to the back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of the dresses immediately catch your eye so you decided to look at something else.</span></div></div>",

It sparkles in the light and you are entranced by it. The emerald was a simple stone laid in silver, with a thin silver chain. The price tag stated that it was sixty dollars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saleslady allows you to try the necklace on. She holds up a mirror while you examine yourself. The necklace is absolutely stunning. Your heart is aching to buy it; however, if you buy it then you won't have enough money to buy a dress.</span></div></div>",

It struck you as odd, but it must have just been your imagine. Looking around the store, you don't see Sarah anywhere, so you decide to wait outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon exiting the store you are greeted by a handsome, yet somewhat geeky young man about your age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find you were looking for, sweetie?\" He asks, as he bent down and gave you a quick kiss on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" You reply blushing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me, Sarah, your boyfriend,\" The boy replies, taking your hand in his. \"Are you ready to get lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Sarah is a girl,\" You stammer, as you are led through the mall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been over this a lot,\" Sarah grumbled. \"My parents have a weird sense of humor.

Finally, you decide to tell Sarah to pick something out for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah agrees and he wanders off to one of the vendors. Knowing that you've got at least five minutes to yourself, you begin to process everything that has happened. That's when it hits you; the glowing necklace must have granted your wish. For the mere price of sixty dollars, you are now the owner of a wishing necklace!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, you smirk wickedly, thinking about all of the fun that you could be having. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish Sarah was more muscular,\" You say aloud, causing your necklace to glow slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around for Sarah, but don't see him anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish that I had already bought the perfect dress,\" You muse, resulting in the necklace glowing again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot of fun,\" you think to yourself as you look down at a bag that has appeared by your seat. Inside is an emerald green gown with embroidered beadwork. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding up the necklace up to the light, you give it a small kiss to show your appreciation. On the back of the necklace, for the first time, you notice the inscription, \"Four wish maximum\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats!\" You think to yourself, having already used three of your wishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better make my last wish you count,\" You muse out loud. \"Do I want to have the most magical Prom ever, or do I want to have a life filled with happiness and comfort?\"</span></div></div>",

Sarah agrees to pick you up at six on Saturday at your house before going out to dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch, you head to your car to leave.

Sarah arrives in a black tuxedo with a green vest and bowtie matching your own green dress.

You all leave the gymnasium and return to your homes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah drops you off at your house. He looks you in the eyes before giving you a long kiss goodnight. Finding the magic necklace was the best thing that ever happened to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile as you watch Sarah drive away from your house. In a few weeks you will be graduating. Then, you will have all summer to spend with your boyfriend before you move away to college. The lingering feeling that this was the most magical Prom ever will be with you forever.</span></div></div>",

Within minutes, the photo is developed and framed and handed to you. Strangely enough, as you stare at the photo you the image of you and Sarah begins to move around. The people in the picture are as alive as you are, albeit they can't speak to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whenever you want to re-live this night, just gaze deeply into the photograph,\" The photographer explains to you as he gives you a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stick the photo into your purse and you and Sarah head inside. The decorations are amazing. The theme for your senior Prom is \"Wizards and Witches: A Night of Magic\". The entire gymnasium is decorated like a wizards castle. Electric candles are suspended from the ceiling by strings. A fog machine covers the dance floor in a light mist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah have a grand time. Every time a slow song comes on, Sarah grabs you with his big strong hands and holds you tightly throughout the song. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the clock strikes midnight, the lights slowly begin to return to the gymnasium. You gasp as you look around. The entire gym is deserted, except for you and Sarah. Your shock is dispelled as Sarah leans in and kisses with you. His lips are warm, and his embrace is tender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gymnasium begins to transform again, this time to a bedroom. The room is small, with several tiny windows that look out over a lake. The moon is full and is shining into your room. Rose petals cover the bed and floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looks deeply into your eyes before he gets down on one knee. Reaching into his pocket he pulls out a small box. Inside the box is a diamond ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you marry me?\" Sarah asks as he puts the ring onto your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" You gasp as tears begin filling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remainder of the night is unforgettable. The feel of Sarah's hands on your body is mesmerizing. You fall asleep in his arms with the smell of roses surrounding you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awake in the morning, you are back in your own room. You grumble as you think it is all a dream. However, your disappointment is short-lived as you look at your hand and see a diamond ring on your ring finger. The picture you had taken is sitting on a shelf in your bedroom. Inside of the picture, you and Sarah are smiling back. You are able to relive that magical night whenever you so desire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation comes and goes, and with it summer vacation. Your parents are happy that you and Sarah are getting married; after all, he was the nicest boy that you had ever dated. Their only concern was your schooling. They asked that you wait until you graduate from college before officially getting married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no desire to wait that long, but since your parents were paying for the wedding you happily obliged.</span></div></div>",

Having used all four of your wishes, the necklace appears to have lost some of its luster. You decide that it still looks pretty, and you would hate for someone else to get their hands on your magical necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Sarah returns with two trays of food. You are impressed at how muscular Sarah looks. She turned from a geeky looking nerd to a star football player. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I told you how wonderful I think you are,\" Sarah says, looking deeply into your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swoon at Sarah's words. She has a chiseled jaw, massive pecs, wavy hair that floats in a breeze, and deep blue eyes. The fact that he is all yours makes it even better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you're pretty wonderful too,\" You sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just want you to know,\" Sarah began, \"That I am going to make this the best Prom ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you spend the rest of the afternoon together. You wrap your arm around Sarah's powerful arms as he guides you along the mall. Finally, you must part for the day, but not before Sarah gives you a firm, yet soft kiss on your lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriving home, you cannot wait for Saturday. The days drag one, with the only positive part of each day is seeing Sarah at school. At one point, you overheard him talking to his football buddies about how wonderful you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night of Prom was magical. Your emerald green dress was the envy of all of the other girls. Sarah treated you to everything your heart could of desired. After the dance, Sarah drove you to a secluded park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah walk along the path, and you can tell that Sarah is increasingly nervous. Finally, you come to a small clearing an Sarah pauses. He looks you in the eye and leans in to kiss you. He wraps his powerful arms around you and you feel your knees going weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the most amazing girl that I have ever met,\" Sarah begins. \"I want you to know, that if it was not for your love and support then I would not have gotten a full ride to college. They want me to be their starting quarterback next season. The coach says that I have good chance of playing professionally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice,\" You reply, slightly uninterested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I can't do it alone,\" Sarah adds, getting down on one knee. \"Will you marry me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah reaches into a pocket of his tuxedo and pulls out a box containing a diamond ring. You squeal with delight as you wrap your arms around Sarah and kiss him furiously. Tears are streaming down your face as he helps you put the ring on your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you tell your parents, they are incredibly happy for you. Your mother immediately begins phoning relatives to tell them the good news despite how late it is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see Sarah for most of the summer as he had to leave for college in order to train with the team. Every Saturday, you are in the stands cheering for Sarah. When winter break rolls around, you and Sarah finally get married in your home town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree years later, Sarah is drafted into professional football. On the night that it is announced, you have an announcement of your own. Taking Sarah aside, you tell him that you are pregnant with your first child. Sarah is so ecstatic that he can't help but cry on stage as he holds up his jersey for his new team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile at your husband. Your life is comfortable and you never imagined that you could be so happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Several seconds after the glowing stopped, Sarah begins to freak out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\" Sarah screams, looking down at her now male form. \"I was a girl this morning and now I'm not!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawned on you that you had just made another wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Sarah, and let me explain everything!\" You say, trying to calm Sarah down. \"For whatever reason, and I have no idea how this happened, I accidentally turned you into my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's preposterous!\" Sarah whined. \"Change me back now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't,\" You lie. \"I already tried several times and you're still my boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do now?\" Sarah demanded an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could wish Sarah back immediately, but who knows when your wishes are going to run out.

The bead work on the dress is exquisite and included in the bag is a silver tiara. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah approached you holding her own bag.

You spent the day doing each other's hair and makeup. By the time it was ready to leave for the dance, your parents were ready to kick you out of the house in order to get some peace and quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, your car did not prove to be as reliable as you had hoped. You and Sarah were stranded along the highway on your way to dinner. To make matters worse, both of you had forgotten your cell phones. The night was quickly shaping up to be a disaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this!\" Sarah shouted, pounding the dashboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just wish we could have a decent Prom,\" You sighed leaning your head back against the headrest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of red and blue flashing lights caught your attention. A police officer had pulled up behind you and was approaching the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you two ladies all right?\" The officer asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car died, and we can't get to Prom.\" You explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, I can call a tow truck and have them take your car to the mechanic. In the meantime, I'll call your parents and let them know what happened.\" The officer added. \"If you want, I can give you a ride to Prom and have one of my fellow officers give you a ride home afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked at the offer and could hardly decline. It looked as if your Prom was not going to be ruined after all. You and Sarah leaped from the car and walked over to the patrol car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue to his word, the officer dropped you off at Prom. By the time the end of the night arrived, you must have danced with half of the football team and almost all of the chess club. You were shocked at how well mannered the boys in the chess club were. They were incredibly polite and well groomed. You even ended up giving your number to Jeff, the captain of the chess club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProm came to a close, and you and Sarah got a ride back to your house by another police officer. Graduation came and went, and with it summer vacation. It was not until you were walking around your college campus that you ran into Jeff. Coincidentally, he had enrolled at your college and you were taking several classes together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJeff was a little shy, but still managed to ask you out. At least, you think he asked you out. He was mumbling a lot and sweating. You told them that you would love to go out and he should pick you up at six.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first date with Jeff was magical. He was sweet, and caring, and made you laugh pretty much the entire night. By the time your date was over, you were beginning to fall in love. You continued dating Jeff throughout college, and over Christmas of your senior year he proposed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProm was but a distant memory, but had it not been for that fateful night then you may never have given Jeff a chance in college. As your wedding day approached, you found yourself looking through your old jewelry box. You came across the old necklace that you had worn for Prom. You thought it would be nice to wear it to the rehearsal dinner and share how it was the same necklace you had worn at Prom. It was then that you saw the inscription on the back, \"Four wish maximum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't I still have one wish left?\" You mused allowed.</span></div></div>",

As far as you can tell, you still have three wishes left. Unfortunately, Prom has become the focal point of your attention and you have completely forgotten about the necklace. As you are getting ready to leave for Sarah's you pause momentarily, a necklace would go great with your outfit. You smile as you rummage through your jewelry box to retrieve the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you are at Sarah's house, the two of you begin getting ready. You spend hours fixing each other's hair and make up. By the time that you are finally ready to leave for Prom, Sarah's mother is at her wits end and ready to boot you both out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two are so close you're just like sisters!\" Sarah's mother jokingly scolds you two as you head to Sarah's car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're better than sisters,\" Sarah shouts back. \"We're best friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish there were a level higher than best friends, because that's what we'd be!\" You giggle as you wave goodbye to Sarah's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fail to notice the necklace glowing as it grants your wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, your wish has been granted. At dinner, Sarah seems overly affectionate towards you and even pays for your meal. Once you arrive to the dance, Sarah insists on holding your hand as you walk inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing seems too out of the ordinary though, until the first slow dance. Sarah grabs your arm and pulls you close to her. She wraps her arms around you and the two of you begin to dance across the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah, what are you doing?\" You ask, confused as Sarah leads you along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Sarah replies. \"A girl can't dance with her girlfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we were just best friends,\" You answer, confused at Sarah's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're a level higher than best friends, we're girlfriends!\" Sarah exclaimed, looking a little hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt dawns on you that you wished for this, even without being fully aware of it. You are still confused, but Sarah is treating you so lovely that it makes the evening bearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the evening, you had completely forgot about wanting to dance with the boys. Sarah was the greatest thing to ever happen in your life. As she drove you back to her house you leaned across the car and rested your head on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy right now,\" You sighed. \"I don't want this evening to end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything in life has to come to an end at some point,\" Sarah answers, reaching over and placing her hand on your knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm scared about what's going to happen to us after graduation,\" You mumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll cross those bridges when we come to them. The important thing is that we are living each day to the fullest.\" Sarah replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I wish we could be happy together forever,\" You add, closing your eyes and ignoring the glow of your necklace as it granted your wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after Prom, you and Sarah graduated. Both of your parents threw a big graduation party, and it was during the graduation party that Sarah surprised everyone by proposing to you. You were shocked and dismayed, but you knew in your mind that there was no one else you would rather spend your life with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of your parents were incredibly supportive of your decision. Sarah asked that you postpone the wedding until the following summer in order to get a proper reception hall. It was the longest year of your life, but you loved watching Sarah plan all of the details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, you returned home from work to find Sarah rummaging through your jewelry box. She pulled out the necklace that you had worn to Prom. Smiling, she looked over at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe that you still have this thing,\" Sarah declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was too important to get rid of,\" You laugh, gazing at the trinket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could have a lot of fun with this,\" Sarah snickers as a wicked grin crosses her face.</span></div></div>",

A grin has spread across your face and you are radiating happiness. Who would have thought that your best is now your boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProm comes and goes, along with graduation. You spend most of the summer with Sarah. After Prom Sarah had given up trying to find a way to change himself back. You never bothered to tell him about the wishing necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your senior year of college approaches, Sarah musters up the courage to ask you to marry him. You knew that you had been close, but it was still an honest surprise to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitating, you reply, \"yes\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe years go by, and you are blessed with several children. As your twentieth anniversary Sarah rediscovers your wishing necklace in your jewelry box as he was trying to come up with ideas for an anniversary present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou come into your bedroom and freeze as you see Sarah with the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sarah looks at you and says, \"I'm happy with the way our life turned out, but sometimes I wish I could know what life would have been like if I had never turned into a man.\"</span></div></div>",

Why did Sarah have to be so mean? She was always doing things like that, just because her parents were rich and gave her a credit card. Waiting outside, you feel a tingle in your chest. Looking down, you see that your navy blue tank top was now a blue and white baseball jersey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething wasn't right about this situation, but you weren't entirely sure what to do.</span></div></div>",

Once inside the bathroom you run straight for the mirror and look yourself over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are no longer an average looking girl with shoulder-length blonde hair. In your place stands a mildly athletic young man with a buzz cut. Staring dumbfounded at yourself you fail to recognize that you are now in the wrong restroom until one of the other girls corrects you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApologizing profusely you race from the bathroom and crash right into Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing in the ladies' room?\" Sarah demanded to know, placing her hands on her hips and giving you the stink eye. \"Why can't you be like a normal boyfriend? Why do you have to act all perverted?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, Sarah walked into the bathroom after thrusting her bags into your hands. Not wanting to cause any further problems, you wait patiently outside for Sarah to emerge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry that I was so mean to you, but I worry that you're going to run off with another girl,\" Sarah says as she comes back out of the restroom. \"I love you, I really do, and I wish that we could be together forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah's necklace begins to glow. After several seconds, you look around. Something was off, but you couldn't tell what it was. Then you remembered, it was Saturday and you wanted to be at home playing videogames. Nevertheless, you had decided to be the good boyfriend and go dress shopping with your girlfriend Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too,\" You say as you smile down at Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really was beautiful. You never knew why a dynamite girl like that would ever go out with you, but you weren't going to complain. You had worked extra hard to make sure Prom was special. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the big day arrived, you showed up to Sarah's house in a freshly pressed tux while riding in a limo. Sarah's parents oohed and aahed as they took dozens of photos. You finally escaped into the privacy of the limo. Once inside, you and Sarah begin to make out. Your love for her is as deep as the ocean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dance, you take Sarah to a secluded area of the local park where you have laid out a blanket, several pillows, dozens of rose petals, and several candles. You wrap your arms around Sarah and kiss her neck and shoulders. She moans in ecstasy as your hands caress every inch of her body. Taking a condom from your pocket, you slowly undress each other. Several minutes later, you are lying in a heap on the blanket with your arms wrapped around Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation comes and goes, as does summer vacation. You and Sarah attend the same college and your love for each other grows stronger. One spring evening, three years exactly after that magical Prom evening, you get down on one knee and ask Sarah to marry you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah is sobbing wildly, but you can still make out a \"yes\". </span></div></div>",

Your pants had also become looser, which caused you be at a loss for an explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this wasn't right. You look at your arms, and they look the same. All those reps that you had done in the weight room were really paying off. What was it that was bugging you so much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging your shoulders you decide that it wasn't that important. You just wish that your girlfriend, Sarah, would hurry up and finish her shopping. It was bad enough that she was expecting you to pay for the limo, your tux, dinner, and photos for Prom, but now she was dragging you to the mall when you could be at home playing videogames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She does have a great set of tits, though.\" You think to yourself as you smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah walks out of the store and looks around confused. She was really cute when she did that. Deciding it would be a good idea, you sneak up behind her wrap your arms around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, cutie, where do you think you're going?\" You laugh as your kiss the back of her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah screams at a decibel louder than you've ever heard before she takes her purse and starts beating you furiously with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the big idea, creep?\" Sarah shouts loudly as she continues to pummel you with her purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd is gathering around, watching what appears to be a petite girl beat an athletic boy to death with a purse.

She helped you to your feet and began to kiss you, apologizing all the time. Wrapping her arm around your waist she led you to the food court. Many of the people that had witnessed you being assaulted just snickered or rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pride was wounded, and you figured that it would be best to break the bad news to Sarah now. Maybe after your beating she would be more understanding of your financial situation. You hadn't actually reserved a limo for Prom because you couldn't afford it. If you told her the truth now, then maybe you could get off without having to find an emergency limo service.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having a girlfriend with rich parents certainly had its perks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me know,\" You say, looking at Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was absolutely stunning. Looking at her always made you smile. You felt incredibly lucky that she would choose to go out with a guy like you. Your football career was pretty much over after blowing out your knee in the first game the season.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a little confused,\" Sarah began looking around. \"I came here this morning with my best friend, and I can't find her anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried calling her?\" You answer helpfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good idea,\" Sarah replies as she pulls out her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah punches the number into her phone and within seconds your phone starts to vibrate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is going on?\" Sarah mutters, before it dawns on her. \"Oh my gosh, I am so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what?\" You ask, puzzled by Sarah's odd behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you remember?\" Sarah inquires, looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't remember.

Before you leave, she wraps herself in your arms and gives you a big kiss. It's always so cute when she does that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday finally arrives, and with it Prom. As per Sarah's instructions, you arrive at her house at six o'clock. After getting photos taken by her parents a stretch limo arrives in the driveway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe limo takes you around town before it drops you off at one of the fanciest restaurants that you've ever seen. Sarah pays for everything with the help of her parent's credit card. After dinner you are dropped off at the dance where you spend the entire evening dancing with Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to Sarah's house and she grabs a backpack and a blanket. The two of you sneak off to a local park to star gaze. Sarah snuggles up close to you and begins kissing you. You return her kisses and before you know it you are making out. Sarah reaches into her purse and pulls out a condom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, you still think back fondly to your senior Prom. It was the night that Sarah gave herself to you for the first time. At your wedding, you spoke fondly of that night as it was the night you fell in love with Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what you did in life, you always succeeded. Your house was a mansion and your job paid seven figures. Every time you would bring it up, Sarah would always you remind you about the time you helped her find a dress at the mall.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Guess who's coming over later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have no idea how to respond, but judging by your mother's lack of surprise at seeing you, your only bet is to play along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, who?\" You ask inquisitively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your babysitter, Sarah!\" Your mother shouts, as she reaches down and tickles you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to giggle furiously at your mother's assault. After several minutes, she pauses, and looks you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you have an accident last night?\" She asks you, already knowing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the years that you have spent living with your mother have taught you not to lie. She has the weird power of seeing through you. You answer truthfully, and to your surprise she is not angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you take a bath, your mother takes you back to your room where she has laid out an outfit on your bed. There is a pair of pink princess panties, a pair of overalls with a flower on the chest, and a blue and white stripe long sleeve shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of your day is spent wandering around your house. Judging by the drawings on the refrigerator, you are enrolled at the local kindergarten. It feels so strange to be so young again, but you are doing a remarkable job of keeping calm and staying in character. Your last glimmer of hope is that Sarah will be able to help you when she comes over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you don't know the best way to explain things to Sarah. Will she even remember that you two were best friends? Maybe everything will work itself out and today is just some weird cosmic anomaly. </span></div></div>",

It seems strange to you that they are going out on a Sunday. You try to ask your mother about this, but just explains that its a work related thing for your father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grumble to yourself as you continue to wander around the house. Even though your room is full of dolls and stuffed animals, you have no desire to resort to acting juvenile. To your parents, it looks as if you are just getting cranky and on the verge of throwing a tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah arrives at five o'clock. Your parents welcome her inside and give her instructions for the evening. Before rushing out the door, your mother and father both give you a big hug and kiss goodbye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now left alone with Sarah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So munchkin, what do you want to do tonight?\" Sarah asks you, kneeling down and looking you in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to go to Prom!\" You exclaim as you put your hands on your hips and attempt your most intimidating pout ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, munchkin, but only big girls get to go to Prom,\" Sarah replies, ruffling your hair. \"You'll get to go someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou angrily stomp off to your room. Not even your best friend recognizes you anymore. Maybe you will just have to grow back up. But that isn't fair! You start to kick and scream as you work yourself in a hysterical tantrum. Within minutes, you are on your bed sobbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah runs into the room and sees you crying. Thinking that she was the cause of it, she tries her best to comfort you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we play dress up?\" Sarah offers. \"That way you can dress up like a princess and we can have our own Prom here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sniffle as you look at Sarah through your bloodshot eyes. It wasn't much, but at least it was better than spending your entire night crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah helps you off the bed and she walks you over to your costume chest. Inside of the chest are all kinds of costumes, not to your dismay they are mostly for princess and ballerinas. One particular item catches your attention though, a pair of white cotton panties with the words, \"daddy's little girl\", written on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are for you,\" You say mischievously as you hand them to Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are so cute!\" Sarah replies, as she pulls them up over her jeans attempting to make you laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou giggle to yourself as you watch Sarah. Hopefully, the cursed panties will find someone else to victimize and you can return to your old life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah gets a strange look on her face, as if she was in pain. She stops what she is doing and immediately runs to the bathroom. Judging from the sounds that she is making, she is vomiting heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes pass and Sarah finally emerges from the bathroom. Much to her chagrin, she is now as tall and as old as you. She is no longer wearing jeans and a sweater; her outfit changed to a pair of black tights, with a blue ruffled skirt, and a long sleeve black turtleneck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" Sarah screamed as she raced towards you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly explain to Sarah how to bought the panties at the mall the day before. As if a light went on in her head, she suddenly began to remember everything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what do we do now?\" Sarah asked, shrugging her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters, you two are going to brush your teeth before changing into your pajamas,\" Your mother said turning the corner. \"I think you've played enough for tonight. Sarah, I talked to your mother and she said that it was okay for you to spend the night tonight. She'll pick you up after kindergarten tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah give each other worried glances. After you have finished your nightly routine and and dressed for bed, you and Sarah finally have some alone time to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This could be the greatest thing that has ever happened to us!\" Sarah exclaims, having gotten used to being a child again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right!\" You giggle. \"We are going to be the smartest people in our class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We won't make the same mistakes that we made the first time through school,\" Sarah replies looking up at the ceiling from her sleeping bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for doing this with me, Sarah,\" You gratefully tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, thank you for wanting me to join you,\" Sarah replies. \"I just wish that I didn't have to wear Goodnites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" You respond, poking your diaper through your nightgown. \"We just need to relearn how to not have nighttime accidents. And if that's the worst thing we have to deal with, then I'm okay with that.\"</span></div></div>",

It was strange seeing your best friend like this. You kind of liked the attention that Sarah was showering upon you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night goes better than expected. According to Sarah, she was letting you stay up late, despite it only being after eight o'clock. Your eyelids were beginning to droop and you were yawning heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, squirt, it's time to get ready for bed,\" Sarah replies taking your hand and leading you to your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaid out on your bed is your nightgown and a Goodnite. The accident you had the previous night appears to be a recurring problem and no matter how hard you plead and beg, Sarah is unrelenting and you are forced to wear the diaper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter brushing your teeth, you get into bed so Sarah can tuck you in. She reads you a story and kisses you on the forehead before turning off the lights and leaving. A nightlight in the corner of your room is glowing and you find yourself drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of a car door slamming wakes you up. You look around, you are still a six year-old and fortunately, still dry. You crawl over to the window and look outside. Sarah is talking with your parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, she was good all night,\" Sarah explained. \"She did pout a little at bedtime though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's understandable,\" Your mother answers. \"Did she act like she remembered anything though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As far as I can tell, she think she's a normal six year-old girl,\" Sarah replied. \"She has no memory of going to the mall or being excited about Prom or graduation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Your mother replies, handing Sarah a large wad of cash. \"I'm just not ready to let my little girl grow up yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in horror as Sarah is driven home by your father. Your mother and your best friend had set you up. You were now going to have to grow up again. Tears welled up in your eyes as you threw yourself back onto your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, you had cried yourself to sleep. When you woke up the following morning, you resolved to make the most of this gift and live a more full life because of it. The first thing you had to though, was change out of your wet Goodnite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You have been wonderfully pampered and your hair looks fantastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day is spent getting ready at Sarah's house. When Tommy and Jason come to pick you up, you are giddy with excitement. Instead of heading straight to the dance, you stop by a local fast food restaurants just because you want to. You get quite a few stares from people which makes you feel fantastic; but the moment that really made your night was when a little girl, possibly around the age of six, asked her mother to take a photo of the \"princess\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the dance was a blur. You don't remember any of the songs that were played, but you enjoyed yourself immensely. As Tommy dropped you off at Sarah's house, you lean in and give him a long, slow, deliberate kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell that it was Tommy's first kiss. You can also tell that he enjoyed it, judging by the way he was grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation eventually came and went, as did summer vacation.

One day, in early May, you received a call from Sarah. She was crying hysterically into the phone, but from what you could make out, she had just been proposed to.

This was going to be one of the most exciting nights of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could think about during the dance was what you wanted to do to Tommy afterwards.

There were no lights for miles and the stars were shining brightly. He pulled several blankets and pillows out from the backseat of his truck and tossed them into the bed. Within minutes he helped you into the bed of his truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of snuggled up close together and began to make out. Jason was very rough with his hands and you were starting to feel conflicted. You chalked it up to it being your first time and was just your nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes later, you were collapsed in a sweating heap in the back of his truck. You had never felt as loved as did at that moment. Jason wrapped his arms around you and kissed your forehead. A smile crossed your lips as you slowly drifted in and out of sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo months later, Jason had broken up with you and moved on to his next girl. You were devastated, especially after he posted online all of the photos you had sent him. The worst, however, was yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was now June, and you only had a few more weeks before you were to leave for college. You figured that the stress from graduation had caused you to miss your period, but that did not explain why you missed it in June as well. Fearing the worst, you drove yourself to the pharmacy and picked up a home pregnancy test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that afternoon, you called up Sarah. Sobbing into the phone you explained about Jason and Prom and positive pregnancy test.</span></div></div>",

When Saturday arrives, you take your dress over to Sarah's and prepare for your date with Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Sarah get your hair and nails done at the local salon by Sarah's house Thankfully, Sarah's mom offered to pay for both of your packages. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Tommy and Jason arrive, you and Sarah are looking absolutely fantastic. You have completely made up and are the best of friends again. Nobody would have guessed that you two had been arguing about Prom for the past week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evening was magical and you enjoyed yourself immensely; at least, until the end of the evening when things went sour. Jason and Tommy decided to part ways. Jason was going to drive you home, while Tommy was going to drive Sarah back to her house. It seemed odd to you since you were spending the night at Sarah's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't entirely sure, but you thought that you smelled alcohol on Jason's breath. His driving was starting to be erratic and you were glad that you had buckled your seatbelt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJason reached over and started rubbing your shoulder. Lights were flashing in your head, but you quickly dismissed them in the hopes that it would keep Jason focused on driving. After several minutes of rubbing your shoulder, his hand moved down to your chest and he began to forcefully grope your breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush Jason's hand off of your chest before reaching over and slapping him across his face. He turns and glares at you, with a drunken rage in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis momentary lapse of concentration caused his truck to veer off the road. You both screamed in terror as the truck rolled into a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral days later, you awoke in a hospital. Your parents surrounded you and Sarah was seated in the chair opposite of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" You quietly squeak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents explain about the accident and how you were lucky to be alive. They tell you that Jason wasn't as lucky as you and was announced dead at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone kept hugging you and thanking God that you were all right. Many tears were shed by all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took another month, and you ended up missing your own graduation, but you were eventually released from the hospital. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you arrived home, you saw that there had been some major construction on your house. A ramp had been built to allow you to wheel right in the front door. The doctors told you that you may never walk again, but it was a small price to pay to be alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still able to go to college, and you still remained friends with Sarah. It was no surprise to you when she called you on the phone day crying hysterically. At first you thought that Tommy had broken up with her, but it turned out that the opposite was true. He had proposed and she wanted you to be her Maid of Honor.</span></div></div>",

You could tell that the idea of actually having a date with a woman was something new and exciting to him. It was really cute how he kept trying to nudge Jason and signal that he was interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the hint, Jason smiled wickedly at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we'd love to take you ladies to the Prom,\" Jason began, looking you over before moving his lustful eyes onto Sarah. \"However, this is going to be a double-date. I'm going to take Sarah to the dance, and you and Tommy can go as a couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes bulged out of your head. Of all the people that wanted to go to the Prom with, Tommy didn't even rank in your top twenty; however, you did owe it to Sarah after being especially rude to her.

If anything, it would help Sarah feel better and that was what mattered to you at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter making plans with the boys, you and Sarah continue shopping.

As you fall asleep, you feel that same tingle from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTossing and turning, you have one of the most restless nights that you can remember. If you guessed correctly, you got maybe twenty minutes of sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally decide to get out of bed, every single joint in your body aches. Muscles that had never been sore are tender and painful. Your bedroom also seems different; in fact, it looks more like your parents' bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you turn on the light to the bathroom, the sight that greets you in the mirror is horrific. Staring back at you in the mirror, is your mother. You reach up to touch your face, and the reflection in the mirror mimics your movements. You think that maybe you are dreaming, but several pinches later and you are still your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything all right?\" Your father asks from the bedroom. \"It's only six, we can sleep in for at least another hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic races through your mind.

Although, I guess I technically am mom at this point!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour father, or now your husband, slowly begins to run his hands all over your body. You quiver at his touch as your now mature body responds in kind. He is kissing you all over and your mind is ready to explode at the intensity of the pleasure you are experiencing. Are your parents always this frisky on Sunday mornings?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes again. The sun is now shining and the clock says that it is after nine. You are covered in sweat and your hair is a mess. You cover yourself as you walk to the shower. Confused feelings are running through your head. Physically, you are in your mother's body; but mentally, you are still your same old teenage self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hot shower does wonders for you and you are beginning to feel much better. After you dry off, you search through your mother's dresser for something to wear. It never occurred to you that your mother had such scandalous tastes in undergarments. All kinds of panties fill the drawers. There thongs, boy shorts, crothless panties, and even briefs. They come in a rainbow of colors and a variety of fabrics. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you move on to select a bra, you are relieved to find that the selection is much more limited. Instead of two drawers, all of your mother's bras are confined to one drawer. There is easily several hundred dollars worth of underwear spread between the two drawers. The next time you ask your parents for money, you'll have to bring this little tasty factoid up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaining a hold on your senses, you pick the plainest, most ordinary pair that you can find. Then, you go to the closet and find a pair of jeans and a sweater. As you exit the closet, your father pinches your butt and gives you a quick peck on the cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts now time to find your old body, but upon further inspection, you find that you are nowhere to be found. Maybe you should call your old phone, or maybe you should call Sarah to see if she knows anything about what happened.</span></div></div>",

Turns out, I found this amazing necklace at a shop called Morganville at the mall. It has the ability to grant wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, can I have my old life back,\" You cry into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Your mother responds. \"You see, this necklace only grants four wishes. After I devised my plan to switch bodies I found a way to make it so that you will never even remember this conversation. Once I took over your body, I wished that you and Andrew, your father, would become incredibly kinky nymphomaniacs and every time you had sex you would forget a little bit more of your old life and remember a little bit more of mine. The way I calculated it out, by the time your graduation rolls around you'll be thinking that you've always been me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, your father walked in on you. He wrapped his arms firmly around your waist and began to kiss your neck. Your body responded by heating up and becoming aroused. It felt better now than it had earlier. Within minutes, your father had you tied up to the bedpost in your new bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral weeks later, you were standing and cheering your daughter as she walked down the aisle to receive her diploma. You had never been as proud of her as you had at that moment. You remembered all of the important times in her life. Sadly though, you wished that your daughter had a better relationship with. It would be fantastic if you could just spend some time with her, or even switch places with her so she knew how difficult it was to be a working mom.

There is nothing that you can do now but wait and hope that your mother and Maggie keep their promise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week is one of the longest weeks of your life.

An anger was burning in side of you, but you were at least thankful that you would get your body back before the end of the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said goodbye to your mother as she left to go to Sarah's house. Unfortunately, this meant more alone time with your father. As much as you tried to keep up the act that nothing was wrong, it still felt weird when your father tried to be intimate with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt two in the morning, there came a knock at the door. Outside stood a policeman. He apologized for waking you before he told you the bad news. Your mother, and Maggie, were in a car accident involving a drunk driver. Bother your mother and Maggie were killed. Little did the officer know that your mother was in your body and Maggie was in Sarah's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now had no one to trade bodies with and were stuck as your mother.

By the time that Prom rolls around, you are more than a little agitated. Deciding that it would be best to keep your mother from embarrassing you at your senior Prom, you tell her that she cannot go in your stead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSurprisingly, your mother agrees immediately. You can't help but feel that she set you up for this. As strange as it may be, you think that your relationship is actually getting better with your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sunday morning arrives, you wake up in your old bed. Your mind is boggled as to how you arrived back in your own body; however, it means that you no longer have to pretend to be your mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following week at school, all of your friends are telling you about how awesome Prom was. It's a shame that you missed it, because it sounds like it was the most amazing time ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation eventually rolls around and with it comes summer vacation. You spend your summer working at a local ice cream store before heading to college in August. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe weeks turn to months, and the months turn to years. As your college graduation approaches, Prom is nothing more than a distant memory. Your boyfriend is now your fiance and you are planning on getting married a week after graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother pulls you aside at graduation for a mother-to-daughter chat. She is acting nervous and keeps looking around to make sure nobody is eavesdropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, I have a confession to make,\" Your mother begins. \"Do you remember the little accident we had back at your Prom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do,\" You reply. \"What about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I planned the whole thing,\" Your mother blurts out. \"I bought a magic medallion at the mall and used it to swap our bodies. I was worried that you were going to get pregnant after Prom so I switched places with you to keep you from going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely and utterly shocked by your mother's admission. You aren't sure what you're more upset with, the fact that she ruined your senior Prom, or the fact that she has kept hidden a magic medallion from you for all these years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that it won't make up for what I've done, but I want you to have the medallion now,\" Your mother continues, handing the medallion to you. \"If nothing else, you and your fiance can use it after you're married for some wild nights.\"</span></div></div>",

I want you to be my date for the dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will!\" Sarah answers gleefully, giving you a hug. Her anger vanishing completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week flies by and soon it is the morning of the dance. You drive over to Sarah's house and the two of you spend the morning getting your hair and nails done at the local salon. Thankfully, Sarah's mother agreed to pay for everything. It was one of the benefits to having friends with rich parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dance itself was wonderful. You and Sarah went to a fancy restaurant beforehand and had a grand time. At the dance you had your photos taken together, where Sarah swept you off your feet. The two of you danced all night together, you even allowed several of the boys to cut-in every now and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you returned to Sarah's house you were both exhausted. Your parents had agreed to let you spend the night at Sarah's. As Sarah was looking herself over in the mirror, preparing to undress, you walk up behind her and wrap your arms tightly around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked beautiful tonight,\" You whisper, before kissing her on her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You looked pretty sexy, yourself,\" Sarah replies, making eye contact with you in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let slowly unzip Sarah's dress and help her step out of it. She walks behind you, wraps her arms tightly around your waist and kisses you on the neck before giggling. It's now her turn to unzip your dress and help you out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you are standing in Sarah's room dressed only in your underwear. Your nervous hands begin to caress each other, and slowly you kiss for the first time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGraduation quickly came and went, as did summer vacation. You found yourself spending more and more time time with Sarah as you prepared to move off to college. You had planned to go to the same college before you started dating, and you were glad that you had even though you weren't roommates the first semester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that your senior year approached, you and Sarah were madly in love with each other. Most of your time was spent with each other and you could not imagine anyone else making you as happy as she did.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, your plan has backfired. While Sarah does accept your apology, she informs you that she won't be able to go with you to Prom.

You sulkily make your way back to your room and flop down onto your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nForty-five minutes later, you stop crying and head to the bathroom.
