Thornton, wanting to help, plugged in using a scavenged helmet and left the safety of the orphanage to go into the world of S.O.A. A kind, almost childish teen, Thornton prefers the company of his pet fox, Uno, who he jacked into S.O.A. as well, making a great companion due to the fact that the helmet allows conversation between players, allowing for communication between himself and Uno.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to be forsaking others with his weird personality, Thornton goes solo, often rushing head on with a loose plan to keep him on track. At level 45, he is often escorting those in the lower levels, making sure all are alive and well. This scavenging allows for him to be a part-time treasure hunter, often searching the area around dead players for red pawned gear. He uses some hacking knowledge to constantly boost his gear's stats by merging the items. No friends, no enemies, Thornton loves everyone.</span></div></div>",

Roland and his pets had attacked me out of the blue, I guess he wanted to plunder my equipment. I reframed from grinning as I felt my ability, Living Shadow, kicking in. Whenever I get to half health, my speed and stealth stats skyrocket for a short time, approximately 2 minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at Roland, who had his back turned to me as he spoke to the other player, a boy carrying a fox. I knew him, we fought together once, for a short time. He had a knack for creating amazing prices of weapons and armor. 'Note to self, ask him to make me a new sword when we're done here' I thought as I stood up silently and pulled my blade from the ground. I pulled up my hood which hid my face in a veil of shadow. I grinned as I saw Roland had his back turned, though his monsters were still paying attention. I sheathed my sword and took up a low stance, charging up my sword. I smirked as they growled at me. I ran foreword and was upon them in a blink of an eye. I released my attack and appeared behind them. I stood and sheathed my blade. When it went in with a click, the monsters erupted with slice wounds all over their bodies before dissolving completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled and turned to the other player \"never judge a book by the cover bud.\" I said as an enraged Roland spun on me.</span></div></div>",

One of the members was a boy with a two handed mace that had short brown hair and brown eyes.  He wore a fur helmet based off of a wolf's head and wore blue chain mail armor.  He had a unique skill, \"Thunder Smash\" where if he smacked his mace or hammer on the ground it could stun enemies around him in a 8 foot radius for a few seconds allowing him to either run or take a heal crystal.  He wasn't the strongest player of the 8 person guild, but the fact that they would only allow an 8 person cap suggested that the eight combined made up a powerful guild.  He was named Wolfgang the Thunder Speaker.</span></div></div>",

She had a small coati beast that was her pet named Coat.  She has blonde hair in a fishtail braid on the right side.  Her bosom was adequately developed for a 17 year old girl.  She wore a little red dress with a flared up collar.  She also wore a pair of bracers and leg armor plates of black armor.  Her eyes were blue and her left eye covered by a wide bang.  She carried a sling and had the unique ability with speed shot, allowing one shot per 15 to go at super speed to be unavoidable.  </span></div></div>",
