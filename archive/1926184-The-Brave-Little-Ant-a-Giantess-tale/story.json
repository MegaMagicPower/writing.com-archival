Hundred of concerned ants scurry and gather in front of a giant wanted poster that reads, \"GIANTESS, AT LARGE\". Talking amongst each other in panic they cry out \"The giant is coming!\" \"What will we do?!\" \"She crushes our houses!\" \"She eats all our food sources!\" \"How can we stop her?!\" Zooming out the ants are all actually gathered in front of a photograph that they brought underground to serve as a makeshift wanted poster.

She stood only 5'5 in human measurements but even to the ants the photo made her look huge! She wore strap sandals and short blue jean shorts and a white tank top that was a little tight and showed off a  not so modest cleavage. Her shorts seemed to struggle to fit her bulging thighs and her hips, she didn't have a muffin top but still it was a tight fit! She wore glasses and smiled with red lipstick in the photograph. Her smile giving her an innocent look... but the ants knew better. This \"innocent\" looking girl was the source of much of their woes amongst their hidden world. Many of the townsfolk family members had been crushed into pulp by this unaware terror as she stomped through her backyard and patio. Others were drowned by the massive water falls she made when she summoned powerful founts of water from her giant garden hose, and even worse... there were rumors of a party of ants who had gone out for an afternoon and drawn to a colossal patio table with enormous amounts of food. They were never heard from again, assumed to have either been crushed flat by the giantess or worse... unknowingly eaten alive! Miles away (ant miles that is) a group of ants were perched up on a windowsill at the neighbors house listening in on a conversation a man was having on the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH DUDE IM TELLING YOU PICKING UP ON WOMEN IS EASY! I'VE SLAIN PLENTY OF WOMEN IN MY TIME TAKE IT FROM ME!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe ants continued their conversation... wow... did you hear that? He just said he's slain plenty of women... you don't think he means it do you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSudden the the man unknowingly to him got close to the ants on the windowsill and yelled out while talking to his friend on the phone \"IM SERIOUS! THIS ONE TIME, I SLAYED SEVEN IN ONE BLOW!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nin unison and in shock the group of ants yelled out to each other \"SEVEN IN ONE BLOW?! <br>\r\n\"well that settles it... the king and our scientist who is in charge of the ANT-ITIZER have gotta hear about this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",
