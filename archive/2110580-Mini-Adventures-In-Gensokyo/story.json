You remembered that you were heading home from school when suddenly, you come across a odd portal in the bushes. The portal was purple with creepy eyes inside and red ribbons on each side.

You don't know where you are exactly since this place feels so unfamiliar. You navigate yourself across the grass to find out where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you saw something huge above you. Unfortunately you can barely see what it is due to the grass blades blocking your view but you could see that it's some sort of red structure. While you tried to find a suitable spot to view this thing, you soon found yourself in a stone path. Not only you got out of the grass, but you could also see what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't believe this...\" you said in disbelief. Right above you was an humongus torii standing at several feet (at least to you) from the ground. From what you learn about Japan, a torii is a type of structure that serves as a gateway to the Shinto shrine; acting like a transition between the mortal and spirit world in Shinto religion. You were surprised to see something like this in front of your eyes which cause you to think that you were in a gigantic version of Japan. You look ahead to see what looks like a Shinto shrine so maybe you could go and find help. Unfortunately, you have no idea if they could understand you since you are in Japan. Of course, that won't mean you could stay here any longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

You wonder who could live in place like this especially in the middle of nowhere. You make your way up to the house in hopes of trying to get help. \"I know by this size, they probably wouldn't see me but I have to risk it.\" You said as you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if life heard your plea, the door of the house opens and comes out someone. That's good, you wouldn't have to go inside and find someone there. You try to get a good look at who was the owner of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner appears to be a young lady who resembles a witch of some sort. She has long blond hair that was covered by a stereotypical witch hat, a black and white buttoned-up dress with puffy sleeves, and black mary-jane shoes. Looking at her, you now know why there's a house in a forest. You know that witches tend to live far away from society and often in wooded areas like this so it made sense. What you don't know however is that if she's friendly or not. Witches can be either good or bad so you hope that she'll be nice enough to use her magic to turn you back to normal-size unless she has that kind of power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the witch carries a broomstick on her hand and say \"Alright, it's time for me to go.\" You realized that she's going somewhere else and is going to leave you behind. You could try to go and hitch a ride on her broom to get her attention along the way, but that's too dangerous. You may try to go and wait inside her house til she comes back, but you don't know how long will it take.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

Somewhat lucky, the witch starts to run herself to catch some speed in order to use the broom. This could be dangerous because you could get stepped on by her shoe, but you went on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finally made it, you make a running leap of faith while having your eyes shut at the moment you made your jump. You have your arms opened wide to catch and grab on to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid you made it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour arms have made contact on something smooth, but at the same time you felt yourself hovering in the air.

You still don't know who even lives there but you hope that they're friendly enough to help you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou got to the house after a long walk that almost made your legs sore. You stood below the door which towered over you, making you nervous of how small you really are compared to whoever lives here.

However, what really got your attention was a nearby table that towered over you, making you feel like an insect around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wander forward in hopes you find some help around here or maybe some shelter around here. You don't know much about this place. All you could know was a clue in form of a painting which features a young girl with blue hair and scarlet eyes which was a little bit unsettling to you. Unfortunately, you couldn't see what's outside due to your size but you can tell that it was slowly getting dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you found a large door that must've lead to a room of some sort.

No seriously if you were the same size as anyone around here, it'll still be as gigantic as you can expect.

Despite the size of the library, you decided to go there and seek someone for help or somewhere to hide. You slip underneath the door and into the enormous library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to this library is like entering a large city. All the shelves towered over you like skyscrapers and floor was the streets that spread among the buildings. You walk forwards through the center space of the two shelves and can't help but feel impressed by how many books are around here. You bet that many librarians everywhere would be pretty jealous if they got wrap here and see tons of books, the structure and design, and the size of this library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou went onward until you found youself in a clearing. Right in the center, you saw a large table full of books. That's not all you see there, you also saw someone sitting there and reading one of the books; finally you saw someone in this giant mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe appears to be a young lady with long purple hair that was tied in red and blue ribbons and matching eyes. She wears a long lavender night dress and a small bonnet with a crescent moon on top. Right now, she's reading something but you aren't interested on that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to approach her when suddenly from far behind, you saw another giant girl, but this one was far more unusual than the other one. How can you tell? Well, she was in fact flying by flapping her large bat-like wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has long red hair and on her head, you can make out a pair of mini-wings much like her main ones. She wears a black dress with white sleeves and a red bowtie. She has a pair of gray tights and black shoes. Just by looking at here, you can tell that she isn't human. In her arms, she's carrying books and putting them in the shelves.

Only one way to find out!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Try to put more effort when writing a chapter and make sure it's a paragraph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Use decent grammar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Any fetish is allowed, but make sure they don't distant themselves from the main story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. The character is tiny enough to be unnoticed; however awareness is also allowed but try to get out details on how he/she get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. The character can have any sort of personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6.  You can end the story but don't try to do it so very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Death is allowed but put some effort on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. All the Touhou character's personalities are the same like they are (or at least how the majority the fandom often portrayed them) in the games. Don't go out of character unless there's a reason behind the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9.The character is not some random fan, gamer, or anything like that. So he/she has no single knowledge about the Touhou series.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Have fun!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n06/21/2019 UPDATE:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of this time, the story's rating has now jumped from 13+ to 18+ giving everyone the freedom to write whatever fits their style whatever they want. Any chapters with violent, sexual or other contents that are common in older rated stories are accepted without consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there's still a few limits that you must follow. Just because you can write whatever you want does not mean there's no rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew Rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. No extreme sexual content with underage characters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's so damn obvious why stuff like this should never be in the story. I don't want to see a story involving NSFW material with young characters because it's seriously messed up. So please don't go too far with this sort of stuff with the chapter involve around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No rebirthing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can still tolerate Insertion stuff....even if that's not my cup of tea. However, I can't really make sense with rebirthing stuff (I mean how can't you be turn into a newborn just by going inside reproductive organs) so I'm afraid this sort of stuff aren't allowed. My apologizes to all you fans out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Toilet stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile I'm fine with some bodily functions like sweat, boogers, and so on. However, I'm not okay with pooping, peeing and other stuff that is commonly seen on the toilet. Seriously, I'm terribly grossed out by this sort of stuff. Of course, that doesn't mean everyone can't do their business as long it happens off-screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo there you have it guys, go extra nuts and write what's ever in your mind ;)</td>",
