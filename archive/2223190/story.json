But you remembered, she could fly..you didn't want to say much if she was going to ask questions. \"I know you...you're Android 21.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n21 cocked an eyebrow up as she licked her pink Majin lips. \"Mmm, I see so another fan of mine I assume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another?\" You asked wondering what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes...a student from Orange Star High School heard of my wonderful work.\" 21 said. \"They studied under my teaching until well...\" 21's stomach erupted with loud growl as she smacked it a little. \"Let's just say they satisfied my hunger for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you backed up a bit. \"Screw this, I'm out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you manage to run away from the hungry Majin? </span></div></div>",
