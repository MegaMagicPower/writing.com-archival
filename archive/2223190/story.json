At last she spoke \u201cyes...yes it should work...though she might be suspicious of why a fruit would be in he-oh no, she\u2019s coming! All right, don\u2019t worry this will work...I hope\u201d 21 muttered that under her breathe, though before you could comment on that, the Android brought up her finger and then a bright pink light emitted from it, than she shot it at you, and suddenly you lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up, groogily, before noticing the floor was much closer than before. Than it hit you, \u201cduh, she turned me into an apple, though where-BOOM! An impact made the ground shake, it made your heart skip a beat before a boot came into your field of vision, and then you were lifted up...up...and up. Jesus how small of an apple were you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then came face to face with the good Android, her blue eyes studying you, in concern it seemed, which you were thankful for. \u201cI hope your alright little one, I\u2019m not sure if you can hear me or not, but better being this than in your normal form, at least around...she\u2019s here! Let me put you on the table.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Android quickly deposited your puny form on the metallic table and with little time to in between the metal doors opened in the entrance, revealing a pink skinned demon looking girl. Her red eyes scanned the area before metting a pair of blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl than spoke \u201cThat damn machine you created didn\u2019t work, I couldn\u2019t find my test anywhere!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndroid 21, the good one, rolled her eyes \u201cMaybe if you had more patience, the machine could have teleported your treats here instead of a random location... like I explained to you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink skinned Android than got into her other half\u2019s face, eyes filled with insanity and lust for hunger, \u201cDon\u2019t talk back to me, you pathetic waist of machinery, the only reason I\u2019m keeping you is because you have a better handle on your hunger...which is pathetic by the way, why on earth you don\u2019t just start eating these gnats, I\u2019ll never know. But if I don\u2019t get my meals, maybe I\u2019ll just eat you\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evil Android gave a sadistic grin, and started circling around her counterpart, \u201cyes... the power you have, while not as strong as me is still strong, you would fill me up, oh the way you would go down my throat and be in my belly, struggling so hard only to end up as fat on my beautiful body, oh maybe I should just eat ya right up!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Android than stared right into her counterparts eyes, but no fear was found in them, only defiance. Hmm, maybe her other half was not as pathetic as she thought! Still, she did need her, just have to put up with her a little longer, than she will have all the food she wants, and then eat her other half...oh she was so smart!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Majin Android than stepped aside, giving her blue eyed half one last look before turning around, \u201cwell, that wasted trip had made me tired, I\u2019ll be sleeping if you need me, don\u2019t wake me up unless that machine is working properly or another treat ends up here\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe majin than walked out the room, completely unaware that her meal was right under her nose, disguised as an apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe good Android than walked to the table, her face grin with the threat her other half made to her. It scared her, to be trapped inside her evil half would be a worse outcome than death, she would not go anywhere else, just trapped in her counterpart for the forseable future. Just the thought made her anxiety crank up a hundreds notches. \u201cJust breathe, just breathe\u201d she repeated over and over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down a bit, she turned her attention to the apple, wondering what to do now?</span></div></div>",
